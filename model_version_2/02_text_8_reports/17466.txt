AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 20 Knowing that we are among the leaders  message from the chairman of the board of directors while developing customer relations  we focus on solutions  that will make us more effective in new markets.  of our industry and the Turkish economy,  Dear Shareholders,  As the world goes through fundamental  changes following the global economic  crisis, developed economies are losing  their power while developing economies  are becoming prominent. According to  the World Economic Outlook published  by the IMF on January 2012, the growth  rate in developed countries is 1.6% but  in developing countries it has reached  6.2%. It has been predicted that the  recovery process will take several years  and in this respect, although economic  growth has slowed down around the  world, the major development that  marked 2011 was the deepening of the  crisis of public debt in Europe.  Despite this unpleasant picture of the  global economy, the Turkish economy  exhibited growth that was once again  over the expectations for the past year.  With 8.5% economic growth in 2011, the  most serious problem in our economy  has been the current account deficit  of US$ 70 billion, the highest rate of  all time. The IMF stipulates that in  2012, the global economic growth will  decrease to the level of 3.3% and that  the Turkish economy could even recede  up to 0.4%. In this respect, fragile  points such as the chronic problem of  the current account deficit and high rate  of unemployment as well as efficient  use of resources should be rapidly  addressed.  Although it is not surprising that  economic growth slowed down  globally, the major development  that marked 2011 was the  deepening of the crisis of public  debt in Europe.  AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 21  AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 22 The largest and most efficient  message from the chairman of the board of directors  Uncertainties in the commodity market  and concerns regarding the course of  the global economy keep companies on  guard in Turkey and elsewhere around  the world. The government announced  a new action plan in the framework of  an export product strategy. We expect  that these governmental policies aimed  at increasing the competitiveness of our  industry in the global markets will be  efficiently realized.  Like last year, the global demand for  acrylic fiber in 2011 was approximately  two million tons. By the end of the year,  the demand for acrylic fiber in Turkey  was 257.000 tons. Despite the industry  recession, Aksa managed to increase  its global market share from 13.2% to  14% and its local market share from  67% to 72% during 2011. Preserving its  leadership in the industry, Aksa reached  a capacity utilization rate of 93% by the  end of the year.  Overall, 2011 was a meaningful year  for Aksa. We now have 40 years of  experience behind us since we first  started production. Within these  40 years, we played a vital role in  establishing Turkey as the second  largest market in the acrylic fiber  industry after China. As the largest  and most efficient acrylic fiber factory  in the world, we excel in creating such  an industry in Turkey. We will continue  to increase our capacity, our greatest  competitive advantage, as well as our  efficiency to further create value for the  Turkish economy and the Akkk Group.  We took a number of big steps to  achieve our targets throughout 2011.  In reexamining our organizational  approach, we combined our Marketing  and New Business Development  departments and appointed new  executive managers. Among our  investments, which we direct by closely  tracking the opportunities that will take  us much further, the power plant and  the second carbon fiber production line  were of major importance during the  year. In line with its long term goals  for growth, Aksa has chosen carbon  fiber as its new business line. Together  with the investment on a second line  that will launch in 2012, Aksa will  increase its capacity to 3,500 tons/ year. Partial provisional acceptance for  our power plant, that once completed,  will generate 100 MW electricity and  350 tons/hour steam, was received  on December 30, 2011. We are also  prioritizing the launch of projects for  maintenance, conduct and upkeep to  support our strategy toward operational  perfectionism while increasing efficiency  and quality.  With our carry values, we are taking  steps to take our country into the future  and transform our innovative power  into new opportunities.

Despite these fluctuations,  Aksa maintained its leadership in  the industry thanks to its use of  the new technologies and business  lines, capacity, before and after-sales  services, product range and flexibility.  Playing a vital role in establishing  Turkey as the second largest market in  the acrylic fiber industry after China,  Aksa increased its global market share  from 13.2% to 14% in 2011. Despite  price fluctuations and the decrease  in demand throughout the year, Aksa  reached to a capacity utilization rate of  93% (86% in 2010) and also increased  its internal market share from 67% to  72%.  Together with the new marketing  strategies and pricing policies as  a result of the changing market  conditions as well as its strategy  of operational perfectionism, the  Company kept growing and its revenue  reached US$ 978 million in 2011 from  US$ 851 million in 2010.  international events in relation to  acrylic fiber in 2011: 	 SpinExpo Trade Fair/China 	 SpinExpo Trade Fair/USA 	 Techtextil International Trade Fair for  Technical Textiles and Nonwovens/ Germany  	 ITMA International Exhibition of  Textile Machinery/Spain  	 Heimtextile International Trade Fair  for Home and Contract Textiles/ Germany  	 Domotex International Trade Fair for  Carpet and Floor Covering/Germany  	 Pitti Filati Textile Fair/Italy  Thanks to its ability to utilize  new technology and business  lines along with its product range  and flexibility, Aksa maintained  its leadership in the industry  during 2011.  Aksa aims to strengthen its  competitive position with high  capacity of production, flexible  machine park and quality of its  products in the following years.  global market share for acrylic fiber production   AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 27 cARBON FiBeR Carbon fiber, developed by Aksas  R&D activities and commercially  manufactured as of the second half  of 2009, was one of the most active  fields in 2011 both in terms of process  and product development. Obtained  through oxidation and carbonization  of special acrylic fibers, this specific  type of fiber is a breakthrough in  industrial use because of its light  weight and higher durability compared  to conventional metals. Carbon fiber is  acknowledged as a strategic material  in the space and aviation industry,  land and maritime transport, industrial  materials, reinforcement of buildings  and infrastructure, blades of wind  power plants and sports equipment.  Carbon fiber is also widely used in  other areas, including airplane and  satellite systems, personal protective  equipment, pressurized vessels and  shell structure for Formula 1 racing cars. Aksa reached full capacity in its carbon  fiber production line with the capacity  of 1,500 tons/year and achieved its  sales targets in 2011. The capacity of  this line increased by 300 tons/year to  reach 1,800 tons/year. When growth in  this market is taken into consideration,  the demand is estimated to increase  to 150,000 tons by the year 2020.  To meet increasing demand and  achieve anticipated targets for carbon  fiber, Aksa plans to launch a second  production line with a capacity of 1,700  tons in July 2012. Thus, Aksa will reach  a production capacity of 3,500 tons/ year through Aksa Karbon Elyaf Sanayi  A.., its wholly owned subsidiary.  Global carbon fiber market reached  46,000 tons/year in 2011, doubling  in the past decade. The Company  anticipates achieving the same success  it achieved in the acrylic fiber and  targets a 10% market share in carbon  fiber in 2020.  The most important factors  determining competitive pull in the  carbon fiber sector are infrastructure  and production capabilities for this  sectors raw material, acrylic fiber. Aksa  offers a significant cost advantage  with infrastructure provided by a  production capacity of 308,000 tons/ year of acrylic fiber, at the same time  maintaining flexibility in the context of  rapid growth. The annual total carbon fiber  consumption in Turkish market is  estimated to be 140 tons in 2011. Aksa  began to manufacture carbon fiber  in Turkey and within two years, five  companies producing carbon fabric and  two companies producing pultrusion  were launched. The market is expected  to expand in the near future with CNG  production and also with companies  that will manufacture products like  blades for wind turbines.  With its success with regard to carbon  fiber production, Aksa is also rapidly  attracting attention in international  arena. An initial agreement has been  signed between Aksa and the world  giant Dow Chemical Company to  produce a partnership in carbon fiber  production. Combining their powers,  the two companies are intending  to establish a new company that  will become the worlds largest  manufacturer of carbon fiber and  carbon fiber derivatives. With a 50:50  share, this new company is planned  to start in 2012. With US$ 55 billion  in sales volume, US$ 2.3 billion for  the R&D budget and its worldwide  sales network, the contribution Dow  Chemicals will make in terms of Aksas  growth strategies is evident.

In 2010, Aksa also received zero  recommendation in addition to zero  non-compliance and in 2011, the  inspection by the Turkish Standards  Institution also included expert opinion  with regard to positive achievements  in addition to zero non-compliance and  zero recommendation. Here are some  of the positive opinions stated:  	 With regard to decreasing waste  management costs and meeting  the targets for waste volume,  Aksa sets an example with its  online management system for the  hazardous waste produced at the  plant and the hazardous waste site.  Waste from each unit is recorded  into the online waste management  system, enabling easy tracking and  controlled management of waste. 	 Within waste preventing and  decreasing work, Aksa managed  to decrease waste volume by 40%  in sludge dewatering with the new  decanter centrifuge system at its  treatment facility. With this system,  not only the volume of treated  sludge was decreased but also Aksa  made significant savings with regard  to disposal costs.  	 Landscape work around the waste  treatment facility was achieved  utilizing employee suggestions  at the facility got credit during  the external inspections and from  visitors to the facility.  	 The environmental monitoring- measurement plan, which was  facilitated for legal and voluntary  practices in line with Aksas  responsible care management, is  followed actively through the QDMS  action module; Aksas environmental  condition is consistently and  controllably monitored.  	 Aksa established an effective  database to follow-up Environmental  Legislation and communicate  internally with the related parties.  Environmental Legislation, which is  now followed up on a timely basis  from the Official Gazette through  the database, is a useful tool in  fulfilling legal obligations.   AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 40 Environment oriented solutions  that add value to life TS 18001 Occupational Health  and Safety Management Systems  certificate  Aksa received the TS 18001  Occupational Health and Safety  Management Systems Certificate in  1997 and maintained a record of zero  non-compliance during the annual  surveillance inspections conducted by  the Turkish Standards Institution ever  since.  Aksa declared 2010 its Occupational  Health and Safety Year. Aksa is  planning to conduct a Safety Culture  Analysis and an evaluation of Safety  Management Systems involving all  operations at the Yalova plant. Aksa  also aims to create a roadmap to  achieve its vision in terms of safety. To  this end, Aksa signed an agreement  of Sustainable Solutions with DuPont.  As part of this collaboration, the  context and reasons, the aims of  the project, the scope of the project,  responsibilities, timing, details of  the implementation of the project  and details of the investment were  determined. The first of this three- phase project was initiated by Aksa in  2010.  Phase 1: This stage includes evaluating  the current state, defining the future  state and strategy and crafting a  solution. An Occupational Safety  Perception Survey prepared in Turkish  and made up of 12 articles and 24  questions was conducted with all Aksa  employees as well as the employees  of subcontractors and contractors who  work in this field.  Phase 2: This stage includes planning  and implementing changes.  Phase 3: This stage includes work  and directions toward continuous  improvement. In addition to these, to Monitor and  Direct Progress on the journey toward  Excellence in Safety, the DuPont  method relies on three essential  success factors:  1. involvement of Leaders: For  the project to be effective through  organization of direct and indirect  reporting, cooperation by the leaders of  the company is required at all stages of  the project.  2. Hands-on Training: Most of what  is acquired through training is lost  after a couple of days. Education of  adults depends on immediate hands- on application following in-class  learning. Applying what has been  taught is a fundamental component of  learning. The DuPont method enables  transferring the knowhow with hands- on applications to the customer within  the customers own environment and  conditions.  3. Realizing the change equation: This  includes understanding the current  state, constituting a vision for a better  state and developing a method to reach  that vision.  Within the framework of the  Occupational Safety Project conducted  with DuPont, four experts from DuPont  visited Aksa between November 2  and 12, 2010.

In February 2011, two separate teams  comprised of 11 executives from Aksa  were invited by DuPont for three days  to visit the facilities of DuPont in the  Netherlands (Dordrecht) and DuPont  Luxembourg and observed the best  practices for occupational health and  security on site.  As part of establishing TS 18001  Occupational Health and Safety  Management System for determining  occupational health and safety risk,  two methods employed in 2005 are  being effectively implemented. The  first of these methods is the Failure  Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA),  which is used to identify the effects  of system and equipment failures  in the electronic platform and to  implement necessary measures to  minimize risk. The second method  is Hazard and Operability Analysis  (HAZOP), which is used to determine  and eliminate potential hazards in the  most dangerous zones according to the  plants risk map. cARBON FOOTPRiNTiNG Beginning work on Carbon Footprint  last year, Aksa calculated its first  Greenhouse Gas Inventory for the  2009-2010 period and was inspected  by the British Standards Institution –  Germany and Turkey. It thus became  the first industrial company in Turkey  to receive the ISO 14064-1 Greenhouse  Management Systems Certificate with  a high credibility level.  Although Turkey has no liabilities as  of yet, since Aksa also aims to be a  leader in this field, Aksa calculated the  Greenhouse Gas Inventory for the 2010- 2011 period for all its operations. To this  end, the inspections conducted jointly  by the Germany and Turkish offices of  the British Standards Institution at the  Istanbul headquarters and the plant  in Yalova on December 20-23, 2012  with regard to ISO 14064-1 Greenhouse  Management Systems certification was  passed with zero non-compliance.  In order to make these efforts  sustainable, Aksa will continue  focusing reducing greenhouse  emissions that result from its  operations and as a leader in the  industry.  FOReSTATiON  Aksa has been engaged in expanding  forest areas, which are important  terrestrial stores for carbon, in order to  balance greenhouse gas emissions into  the atmosphere.  In an effort to improve damaged  forest areas and to fight erosion  and to contribute to the National  Forestation Mobilization Action Plan  2008-2010 organized by the Ministry  of Environment and Forestry, Aksa  continued to distribute free-of-charge  seedlings grown in Aksas greenhouses  nationwide this year as well. To this  end, 6,243 seedlings were handed over  to environmentalists during 2011.

AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 42 eFFicieNcY Preventing and reducing waste has  been among Aksas priorities within  its environmental policy dating  back to 1995. Reducing waste on  site, reusing, recycling or disposing  properly and preferring to use recycled,  environmentally friendly materials  are appropriated as fundamental  principles. Various projects have been  realized in terms of reducing waste  on site, reusing and conversion to raw  material. Through these investments,  fewer natural resources are used  and waste is recycled, which in turn  contributes to the environment and  economy.  Thanks to the investments made and  awareness raised within the Company,  waste that had been disposed  completely up until two years ago is  now 65% recycled and reused. Parallel  to Aksas goal of increasing recycling  rates, waste reduction and reclaim  projects have an important place in  their five-year strategic plans.  A project for the pretreatment of dye  wastewater is being conducted by Aksa  in collaboration with Yalova University.  This wastewater results from dyeing  acrylic fiber before it reaches the  wastewater treatment facility, allows  dye to be recycled and used as an input  material in different industries. This  project will allow for the reduction in  the volume of waste at the wastewater  treatment facility and reuse of the  material.  Another investment is planned toward  both reducing the volume of the  hazardous waste that remains in the  recycling solvent and is disposed of  and reclaiming the disposed solvent.  Aiming to reduce the volume of the  disposed waste, the project is expected  to significantly increase recycling rates  of solvent that is disposed with waste.  A project for reducing color value in the  treated wastewater at the wastewater  treatment facility has also been  initiated. Although the color parameter,  which is among the parameters to  be checked in the current discharges  of treated wastewater, is below the  legal limits, Aksa is conducting work  toward color removal onsite. The work  is handled in two stages: the goal is  to reduce color value by using organic  based flocculant instead of ferrous  sulfate for color removal during the  chemical wastewater treatment and  A project for reducing color value  in the treated wastewater at the  wastewater treatment facility has  also been initiated.  Various projects have been  carried out in terms of reducing  waste onsite, reusing and  conversion to raw material.  High rate of recycling  activities on sustainability  AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 43 to pretreat dye wastewater resulting  from production by separating it from  the rest of wastewater and carrying it  via a separate line to the wastewater  treatment facility. Within waste management efforts, a  research project on dewatering treated  sludge or reusing it in producing  compost or fertilizer has also been  carried out. The goal of this project is to  decrease the volume of treated sludge  at the wastewater treatment facility  and to preserve global resources. Using  treated sludge as compost or fertilizer  in agricultural activities and/or for  improvement of damages areas is also  being considered.  By starting to use pressurized air  instead of nitrogen when cleaning filter  press cloths, Aksa reduced nitrogen  use by 20% and thus limited the use of  global resources.  By switching to use variable-speed  compressor in generating pressurized  air during the 2010-2011 period, power  use was also reduced. WASTe MANAGeMeNT In order to control waste more  efficiently, all processes of waste  management were transferred into an  electronic platform which facilitated its  management. Waste is categorized as  hazardous waste, reclaimable waste,  domestic and industrial solid waste,  excavation-construction and demolition  waste and waste sludge within this  system. Once there is waste, the unit  requests its removal from the site and  enters the details of waste. After the  removal is approved, the waste removal  team goes to the site and removes it.  AKSA AKRiLiK eNViRONMeNTALLY  FRieNdLY PROdUcTS  As a result of its leadership in the  industry, Aksa closely follows and  integrates new technology. The  Company also reflected its strategy  for investing on innovation and  products with added value in its vision  statement after the revisions in 2007.  Aksas vision is to invest in technology  to achieve operational excellence and  create new, sustainable and profitable  fields of use for acrylic fiber. In line with this vision, Aksa started to  manufacture environmentally friendly  fibers in addition to textile fibers and  aims at producing at least two types of  new fiber every year. Aksa began pilot manufacturing for  carbon fiber, a fiber that has a variety  of uses due to its superior qualities,  in 2008 and following the positive  outcome of these pilot studies,  production was started for carbon fiber  in 2009, once again a first in Turkey. NeW FiBeRS BY AKSA ANd THeiR  USe iN eNViRONMeNTALLY FRieNdLY  FieLdS:  Homopolymer Acrylic Fiber:  Homopolymer acrylic fiber, which  has a high chemical resistance and  thermal resistance in the filtration of  emissions and waste in coal operated  power plants and cement plants,  provides environmentally friendly  fields of utilization with its superior  qualities. In 2010, like other Aksa  textile fibers, homopolymer acrylic fiber  was also included in the KO-TEX 100  Confidence in Textiles certification.  AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 44 Products that respect  human health and environment  carbon Fiber: Carbon fiber, which is  a very strong, light material, is used  in the reinforcement of propellers for  wind power plants, automobile bodies  and airplane fuselages instead of  steel, increasing their resistance and  providing fuel efficiency. This in turn  reduces greenhouse gas emission, the  reinforcement of buildings, bridges and  infrastructure to increase earthquake  resistance.   Outdoor Fiber: Outdoor fiber, which  has high resistance to abrasion and  excellent light and weather fastness,  is used in outdoor applications like  shades and tarpaulins under direct  sunlight, upholstering of garden  furniture, boat covers, in producing  canvases and tarpaulins, headliners  for convertible cars, etc. They limit the  amount of sunlight and enable the  consumption of less power indoors,  thus contributing to the reduction of  greenhouse gas emissions.  KO-TeX 100 cONFideNce iN  TeXTiLeS ceRTiFicATe  KO-TEX 100 is an internationally  acknowledged standard to determine  human ecological safety of textiles.  Every year sample products are  submitted to the independent Testex  laboratory in Switzerland and tested  for Class 1-Products for babies (the  category with the strictest limits and  the most tests) for compliance and  certificates are renewed.  Samples have been submitted and  the certificate renewed every year  since 1995. In 2011, in addition to  sample testing, a company visit was  made by an independent inspector  for KO-TEX 100 certification. All  stages of production and laboratory  work including supply and storage of  chemical-colorant materials as well  as finished products were tested as  part of the inspection. The visit was  concluded with zero non-compliance,  thus proving human ecological safety  of Aksa products once again through  inspection and certification.  activities on sustainability  AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 45  AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 46 Sensitive and responsible approach to social responsibility  ReFLecTiONS ON STAKeHOLdeRS  ReLATiONS  AKSA ReceiVed TWO AWARdS FROM  cORPORATe SOciAL ReSPONSiBiLiTY  MARKeTPLAce As a result of its Responsible Care  practices, Aksa was invited to the  Corporate Social Responsibility  Solutions Marketplace organized by  the Corporate Social Responsibility  Association of Turkey; it earned two  awards.

According to the  Communiqu, entities shall prepare their financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  (IAS/IFRS) endorsed by the European Union.

Accordingly, Turkish Accounting Standards/Turkish Financial  Reporting Standards (TAS/TFRS) accepted by the TASB which are in line with the aforementioned standards shall be  considered.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Amendments in International Financial Reporting Standards a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective from 1 January 2011 and applied by Group: - IAS 24 (revised),Related party disclosures, issued in November 2009.

The interpretation clarifies  the accounting by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity issuing equity  instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability (debt for equity swap). It requires a gain  or loss to be recognised in profit or loss, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial  liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued. - IAS 32 (Amendment), Financial instruments: Presentation The amendment applies to annual periods beginning on or after  1 February 2010. The amendment addresses the accounting forrights issues that are denominated in a currency other than the  functional currency of the issuer. - IFRS 1, First time adoption of IFRS effective 01 July 2010.  Provides the same relief to first-time adopters as was given to  current users of IFRSs upon adoption of the amendments to IFRS 7. Also clarifies the transition provisions of the amendments  to IFRS 7. - IFRIC 14, Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement  effective 01 January 2011. The amendments correct an  unintended consequence of IFRIC 14, IAS 19 - The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their  interaction. Without the amendments, entities are not permitted to recognise as an asset some voluntary prepayments for  minimum funding contributions. - Annual improvements 2010 are effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2011.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. c) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards those are not yet effective in 2011: - IFRS 7 (Amendment), Financial Instruments: Disclosures effective from 1 July 2011. Emphasises the interaction between  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about the nature and extent of risks associated with financial instruments.  - IFRS 1 (Amendment), First time adoption is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Amendment  provides guidance on how an entity should resume presenting financial statements in accordance with IFRSs after a period  when the entity was unable to comply with IFRSs because its functional currency was subject to severe hyperinflation. - IAS 12 (Amendment), Income taxes is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012. This amendment  introduces an exception to the existing principle for the measurement of deferred tax assets or liabilities arising on investment  property measured at fair value. - IAS 19 (Amendment), Employee benefits is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. These  amendments eliminate the corridor approach and calculate finance costs on a net funding basis. - IAS 1 (Amendment), Financial statement presentation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012.

This standard is the  first step in the process to replace IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 introduces new  requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets. - IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. This standard  builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be  included within the consolidated financial statements. The standard provides additional guidance to assist in determining  control where this is difficult to assess. - IFRS 11, Joint arrangements is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. This standard provides for  a more realistic reflection of joint arrangements by focusing on the rights and obligations of the arrangement, rather than its  legal form. There are two types of joint arrangement: joint operations and joint ventures. Proportional consolidation of joint  ventures is no longer allowed. - IFRS 12, Disclosures of interests in other entities is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  This standard includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements,  associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles - IFRS 13, Fair value measurement is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. This standard aims  to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value  measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRS.  - IAS 27, Separate financial statements is effective for annual periods beginning on or after  1 January 2013. This standard includes the provisions on separate financial statements that are left after the control provisions  of IAS 27 have been included in the new IFRS 10. - IAS 28, Associates and joint ventures is effective for annual periods beginning on or after  1 January 2013.

The table below sets out all Subsidiaries and demonstrates their shareholding structure as of 31 December 2011 and 2010: Direct and indirect ownership interest by the  Company and its subsidiaries (%) Subsidiary 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Ak-Tops (1) 60,00 60,00 Fitco(1), (3) 100,00 100,00 Aksa Egypt (1), (3) 99,14 99,14 Akgiriim (2) 58,00 58,00 Subsidiaries Ak-Pa (2), (4) 13,47 13,47 (1) The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis.

(3) These subsidiaries have been included in the scope of full consolidation as at the balance sheet date.  (4) As of 1 January 2011 these subsidiaries have been included in the scope of full consolidation as at the balance sheet date.  Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the  date that the control ceases. Where necessary, accounting policies for Subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency  with the policies adopted by the Group. Carrying values of the Subsidiaries shares held by the Company are eliminated against the related equity of Subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and balances between Aksa and its Subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation. Dividends arising  from shares held by the Company in its Subsidiaries are eliminated from income for the period and equity, respectively.

Financial Assets  Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and  receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. When financial assets are  recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss,  directly attributable transaction costs. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re- evaluates this designation at each financial year end. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on  the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases  or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in  the marketplace. As of 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 the Group does not have any financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Loans and Receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active  market. After initial measurement loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less  any allowance for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivables are derecognised  or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Available-for-sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for-sale or that are not  classified in any of the three categories (a) loans and receivables, (b) held-to-maturity investments and (c) assets at fair value  through profit or loss. A gain or loss on an available for- sale financial asset after initial recognition shall be recognized directly  in equity, through the statement of changes in equity, except for impairment losses, dividend and interest gains, until the  financial asset is derecognized, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity shall be recognized  in profit or loss. If a fair value loss on an available-for-sale asset has been recognized directly in equity, and there is objective  evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that has been recognized directly in equity should be recycled into  profit or loss even though the financial asset has not been sold.  Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Available-for-sale financial assets that are quoted  in active markets are measured based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active the fair value is  determined by using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing model (Note 5). For investments as subsidiaries that are excluded from the scope of consolidation on the grounds of materiality where there  is no quoted market price and where a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be determined since other methods are  inappropriate and unworkable, they are carried at cost less any impairment in value (Note 5).  Trade receivables Trade receivables have a maturity range of 30-120 days and are recognized at original invoice amount and carried at amortized  cost less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful debt is made when collection of the full amount  is no longer probable. A credit risk provision for trade receivables is established if there is objective evidence that the Group will  not be able to collect all amounts due. The allowance is an estimated amount which is difference between existing receivable  and collectible amount. Collectible amount is the discounted value of trade receivables, all cash flows including collections from  guarantees by using original effective interest rate. Bad debts are written off when identified (Note 7). The Group has accrued discount premiums in line with the fibers customers purchase targets to be paid at the end of the year.  In the current period, the Group has classified the discount premiums under other discount account in sales. Trade payables Trade payables have average maturities changing between 30-180 days and consist of the amounts invoiced or not invoiced  related with the realized material or service purchases, and are carried at amortized cost (Note 7).

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value less costs to sell. Cost of inventories comprises the purchase  cost and the cost of bringing inventories into their present location and condition. Cost is determined by the monthly moving  weighted average method. The cost of borrowings is not included in the costs of inventories. Net realisable value less costs to  sell is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale  (Note 9). Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. When  assets are sold or retired, their costs and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss  resulting from their disposal is included in the income statement. The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and any directly  attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis (Note 10). Useful life and the depreciation  method are constantly reviewed, and accordingly, parallels are sought between the depreciation method and the period and  the useful life to be derived from the related asset. As of 31 December 2011, the depreciation periods for property, plant and  equipment, which approximate the economic useful lives of such assets, are as follows: Period (Years) Land 2 - 50 Buildings 5 - 50 Machinery and equipment 3 - 40 Motor vehicles 4 - 8 Furniture and fixtures 2 - 20  The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of  financial assets is impaired. In the event of circumstances indicating that an impairment has occurred in the tangible assets,  an inspection is performed for the purpose of determining a possible impairment, and if the registered value of the tangible  asset is higher than its recoverable value, the registered value is reduced to its recoverable value by reserving a provision. The  recoverable value is considered either the net cash flow to be caused by the current use of the respective tangible assets or the  nest sales price, whichever is higher.  Gains or losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing proceeds with their restated  carrying amounts and are included in the related income and expense accounts, as appropriate.  Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statements during the financial period in which they are incurred. The cost  of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess  of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset. Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are capitalized at cost. Intangible assets, created within the business  are not capitalized and expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which it is incurred. They are initially recognised  at acquisition cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The depreciation period for the  intangibles capitalized in relation with the new models will be started after the production of these models is started. The  carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the  carrying value may not be recoverable (Note 11). Useful lives of intangible assets are determined as 3-15 years.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Research and development costs Expenditures for research and development are charged against income in the period incurred except for project development  costs which comply with the following criteria: - The product or process is clearly defined and costs are separately identified and measured reliably, - The technical feasibility of the product is demonstrated, - The product or process will be sold or used in-house, - A potential market exists for the product or its usefulness in case of internal use is demonstrated, and - Adequate technical, financial and other resources required for completion of the project are available. The costs related to the development projects are capitalized when the criteria above are met and amortized by straight-line  basis over the useful lives of related projects (Note 11). Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can  be reliably measured. Revenues are stated net of discounts, value added and sales taxes. Revenue is recognized when the  significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured  reliably. Net sales are invoiced amounts of delivered goods excluding sales returns and sales discounts.   Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate until maturity and considering the effective interest rate. When the arrangement effectively constitutes a financing transaction, the fair value of the consideration is determined  by discounting all future receipts using an imputed rate of interest. The difference between the fair value and the nominal  amount of the consideration is recognized on an accrual basis as credit sale financial income (Note 21). Dividend income is recognized when the Group has the right to receive the dividend payment.  Rent income is recognized in the  financial statements when the Groups right to receive the monthly rent income is established.  Commission income is recognized when the intermediary goods invoice has been booked by the seller. Bank borrowings All bank borrowings are initially recognized at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue cost  associated with the borrowing. After initial recognition, bank borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using  the effective yield method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue cost and any discount or premium on  settlement (Note 6). Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, one that takes  a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset in the  period in which the asset is prepared for its intended use or sale. Without this context, the borrowing costs are expensed as  incurred. Fair value of financial instruments Fair (market) value is the amount for which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing  parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation, and is best evidenced by a quoted market price, if one exists.  The fair values of the financial instruments are determined in accordance with the following methods and assumptions as  follows:  AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 84 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TL) unless otherwise indicated.) AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Financial assets Monetary assets for which fair value approximates carrying value are carried at cost in the financial statements and consists  of cash and cash equivalents, their interest accruals, and other financial assets; and considered to approximate their respective  carrying values due to their short-term nature and negligible credit losses. The carrying value of accounts receivable along with  the related allowance for unearned income and uncollectibility are estimated to be their fair values.   Financial liabilities Monetary liabilities for which fair value approximates carrying value including accounts payable, short-term bank borrowings  and other monetary liabilities are considered approximate their respective carrying values due to their short-term nature. The  bank borrowings are stated at their amortized costs and transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of bank  borrowings. The fair value of bank borrowings are considered to state their respective carrying values since the interest rate  applied to bank borrowings are updated periodically by the lender to reflect active market price quotations. The carrying value  of accounts payable along with the related allowance for unrealized cost is estimated to be their fair values.  Employee termination benefits Under the Turkish Labour Law, the Company is required to pay termination benefits to each employee who has completed one  year of service and whose employment is terminated without due cause, or who is called up for military service, dies or retires  after completing 25 years of service (20 years for women) and achieves the retirement age (58 for women and 60 for men). As  of 23 May 2002 since the related legislation was changed, some transition pre-retirement articles has been removed. Under the Turkish Labour Law, the provision has been calculated by estimating the present value of the future probable  obligation of the Company arising from the retirement of the employees (Note 14).  The Group has an employee benefit plan called Seniority Incentive Bonus (Bonus) which is paid to employees with a certain  level of seniority. The Group accounts for this Bonus according to IAS 19, Employee Benefits. Seniority incentive bonus  provision which is disclosed within the employee termination benefit represents the present value of the estimated total  reserve of the probable future obligations. Current and deferred income tax  Tax expense or income is the aggregate of current income tax and deferred taxes which are based on the gains and losses for  the period. Deferred income tax is determined, using the liability method and tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted by the balance  sheet date. Deferred income tax is provided in full, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and  liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.  Deferred income tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences are recognized to the extent that it is probable  that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. The carrying  amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable  that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Deferred taxes arising  from income and expenses accounted under equity are recorded under equity, accordingly.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is  realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed by the Group at each balance sheet date and reduced to the  extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax  asset to be utilized (Note 23).

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Earnings per share Earnings per share disclosed in the income statement are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number  of shares that have been outstanding during the related period concerned (Note 24). In Turkey, companies can increase their share capital by making a pro-rata distribution of shares (bonus shares) to existing  shareholders from retained earnings. For the purpose of earnings per share computations, the weighted average number of  shares outstanding during the year has been adjusted in respect of bonus shares issued without a corresponding change in  resources by giving them retroactive effect for the year in which they were issued and for each earlier period. Events after the balance sheet date The Group adjusts the amounts recognised in its financial statements to reflect the adjusting events after the balance sheet  date. If non-adjusting events after the balance sheet date have material influence on the economic decisions of users of the  financial statements, they are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable  that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.  Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate (Note 13). Contingent assets and liabilities Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the financial statements, but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow  of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. A contingent asset is not recognized in the financial statements, but  disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Offsetting If the essence of the transaction and events requires offsetting, presentation of these transactions and events at their net  values or following up of the assets at their amounts after the deduction of impairment, is not evaluated as a breach of the  non-deductibility rule. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies are recognised in the statements of income.  Goodwill The cost of a business combination is allocated by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets at the date of acquisition. Any  excess of the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, over the business combination cost is  accounted for as goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually at the same time for impairment and the impairment provision, if any,  is immediately recognised in the consolidated income statements. The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is  determined based on the value in use or fair value less cost to sell calculations. As a result of the impairment tests performed  under above assumptions, no impairment was detected in the goodwill amount as of 31 December 2011. Since the sales  cost-based fair value of the said cash generating unit is higher than the book value, the Group management did not make a  recoverable value calculation according to the use value (Note 12).

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The  chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.  For an operating segment to be identified as a reportable segment, its reported revenue, including both sales to external  customers and intersegment sales or transfers, is 10 per cent or more of the combined revenue, internal and external, of all  operating segments; the absolute amount of its reported profit or loss is 10 per cent or more of the combined profit or loss or  its assets are 10 per cent or more of the combined assets of all operating segments. Operating segments that do not meet  any of the quantitative thresholds may be considered reportable, and separately disclosed, if the management believes that  information about the segment would be useful to users of the financial statements.  For at the Group the reportable segments are industrial segments. Reportable segment, its reported revenue, including both  sales to external customers and intersegment sales or transfers, is 10 per cent or more of the combined revenue, internal and  external, of all operating segments; the absolute amount of its reported profit or loss is 10 per cent or more of the combined  profit or loss or its assets are 10 per cent or more of the combined assets of all operating segments (Note 3). The Group assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax,  Depreciation and Amortisation, EBITDA.  The Groups reportable business segments are fibers, energy and the remained operations are reported as other. Among  the subsidiaries Aksa Egypt is included under fibers, Fitco and Ak-tops are reported under other segment (Note 3). The supportive functions of industrial segments namely Financial Affairs, Human Resources and Management of Systems,  Purchasing, Business Development, Research and Development, Head Office Expenses and other general administrative and  operating expenses are classified under unallocated corporate expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses are followed at the  Group level by management as the expenses are made to ensure the integrity of the Group by the management.   Derivative financial instruments The derivative instruments of the Group mainly consist of foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swap instruments.  These derivative transactions, even though providing effective economic hedges under the Group risk management position, do  not generally qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules and are therefore treated as derivatives held for trading (IAS  39). The Group shows its profits and losses relating to the hedging transaction under equities as hedging fund. All derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative (Note 16).

Related parties Parties are considered related to the Group if; a) directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, the party: i) controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Company (this includes parents, subsidiaries and fellow  subsidiaries); ii) has an interest in the Group that gives it significant influence over the Group; or iii) has joint control over the Group; b) the party is an associate of the Group; c) the party is a joint venture in which the Group is a venture; d) the party is member of the key management personnel of the Group or its parent; e) the party is a close member of the family of any individual referred to in (a) or (d); f) the party is an entity that is controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by, or for which significant voting power in such  entity resides with, directly or indirectly, any individual referred to In (d) or (e);  or g) the party has a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of the Group, or of an entity that is a related party of the  Group. Related party transactions are transfer of resources or obligations between related parties, regardless of whether a price is charged. A number of transactions are entered into with related parties in the normal course of business (Note 25).    Reporting of cash flow Cash flows during the period are classified and reported by operating, investing and financing activities in the cash flow statements. Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash flows of the Group generated from retailing activities.  Cash flows related to investing activities represent the cash flows that are used in or provided from the investing activities of the Group  (fixed investments and financial investments). Cash flows arising from financing activities represent the cash proceeds from the financing activities of the Group and the repayments  of these funds. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and bank deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily  convertible to known amounts of cash with maturities equal or less than three months and which are subject to an insignificant risk of  changes in value (Note 4). Government grants Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received  and the group will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to costs are recognised in the income statement by  deducting from research and development expenses. Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in non- current liabilities as deferred government grants and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected  lives of the related assets.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. 2.4 Critical Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements necessitates the use of estimates and assumptions that affect asset and liability  amounts reported as of the balance sheet date, explanations of contingent liabilities and assets; and income and expense  amounts reported for the accounting period. Although these estimates and assumptions are based on all management  information related to the events and transactions, actual results may differ from them.  The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets  and liabilities for the next reporting period are outlined below: a) Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable  assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.   The Group tests annually goodwill for impairment and carries goodwill at cost less accumulated impairment loss. The  recoverable amount of cash-generating unit has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These value-in-use  calculations include the discounted after tax cash flow projections, and these projections are based on USD financial budgets  approved by management covering a five-year period. The USD fair value is converted into TL by using the related foreign  exchange rate on the date of the balance sheet. Therefore, the value in use calculations is affected by the fluctuations in the  foreign exchange market. The discount rate used in the value in use calculations is 10,59% and the risk premium is 3%. The discount rates used are after  tax and reflect specific risks relating to the company. As of 31 December 2011, the Group did not determine any impairment in  the amount of the goodwill as a result of the impairment test performed by using the aforementioned assumptions. If discount rate used in goodwill impairment calculation has been 2% higher/lower with all other variables held constant, there  would not been any impairment define on goodwill amount. b) Net realizable value Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value as discussed in Note:2.3. Net realizable value is the estimated  selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the  sale (Note 9). c) Tangible and intangible assets useful lives Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss as discussed  in Note 2.3. They are initially recognised at acquisition cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful  lives. Useful lives of property, plant and equipment, rely on best estimates of management, these estimates are reviewed  balance sheet dates and if necessary adjustments are made necessary. Useful lives change of plant, property and equipment In 2011, Group has reviewed useful lives of some property,  plant and equipments in fiber segment according to IAS 16   Property, plant and equipment , as a result of the study, estimated useful lives of these tangible fixed assets have been  changed effective from 1 January 2011. As a result of this change, current period amortisation expense decreased by TL 8.299  compared to amount calculated with prior useful life estimation as of 31 December 2011.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Useful lives changes as follows; New  Useful lives Previous  Useful lives Machinery and equipment 17-30 years 10 years Land improvemens 30 years 15 years d) Doubtful provision In the event there is a situation which makes impossible for the Group to collect the amounts due payable, a provision for  loss is created for the trade receivables. The amount of the provision is determined with the assessment of the payment  performance of the customer and trade receivable aging. Provision for doubtful receivables is the accounting estimation that is  based on the past payment performance and financial situations of the customers (Note 7).   e) Provisions As discussed in Note 2.3, provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result  of past events, when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligation and when reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation (Note 13). 2.5 Convenience Translation into English of Consolidated Financial Statements As of 31 December 2011, the financial reporting standards described in Note 2.1  (defined as  CMB Financial Reporting Standards) to the consolidated financial statements differ from IFRS issued by the  International Accounting Standards Board with respect to the application of inflation accounting for the periods betrween 1  January and 31 December 2005.Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements are not intended to present the financial  position and the results of operations in accordance with IFRS USD amounts shown in these consolidated financial statements have been included solely for the convenience of the reader  and are translated from TL, as a matter of arithmetic computation only, at the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey official  TL exchange rate. Thus, USD amounts do not form a part of the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with  generally accepted accounting standards issued by the CMB as at 31 December 2011.

Under the Turkish Labour Law, the Company is required to pay termination benefits to each employee who has completed one  year of service and who reaches the retirement age (58 for women and 60 for men), whose employment is terminated without  due cause, is called up for military service or passed away. The liability is not funded as there is no funding requirement.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. The provision has been calculated by estimating the present value of the future probable obligation of the Company arising  from the retirement of employees. IAS 19 Employee Benefits require actuarial valuation methods to be developed to estimate the enterprises obligation under  defined benefit plans. Accordingly the following actuarial assumptions have been used in the calculation of the total liability: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Discount rate (%) 2,91 4,66 Probability of retirement (%) 98,94 98,92 The principal assumption is that the maximum liability for each year of service will increase in line with inflation. Thus, the  discount rate applied represents the expected real rate after adjusting for the anticipated effects of future inflation. . As the  maximum liability is revised once every six months, the maximum amount of TL 2.805,04 effective from 1 January 2012 (1  January 2010: TL 2.623,23) has been taken into consideration in calculating the reserve for employment termination benefit of  the Group.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and subsequently are re- measured at their fair value. The derivative instruments of the Group mainly consist of foreign exchange forward contracts and  interest rate swap instruments. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Group designates certain derivatives as  either a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge), or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or a  firm commitment (cash flow hedge). These derivative transactions provide effective economic hedges under the Group risk management position and qualify for  hedge accounting under the specific rules and are therefore treated as derivatives held for hedging. Changes in the fair value  of derivatives that are designated as being and qualify as cash flow hedges and are highly effective, are recognised in equity as  hedging reserve. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, or when a  committed or forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is  immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, or when a  committed or forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is  immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement.

Dividend Distribution Based on CMB Decree No. 02/51, dated 27 January 2010, there is no mandatory minimum profit distribution requirement for  the quoted entities at the stock exchange for profits arising from operations in 2009. Regarding the dividend distribution for  the current and following years, the entities are to distribute their profits for the current and following years under the scope  of CMB Communiqu No. IV-27, their articles of association and their previously publicly declared profit distribution policies.  In regards to the profit distribution, in accordance with the decision of the General Assembly, the distribution can be made as  cash or as bonus shares or as a combination of a certain percentage of cash and bonus shares. It is also permitted to retain  this amount in the Company reserves if the first dividend amount is below 5% of the paid in/issued capital; however if the  Company has increased its paid-in capital without dividend distribution in the previous year when the outstanding shares have  been identified as old and new, it is mandatory for companies that will make profit distribution from the net distributable  profit of the previous year to make this first dividend distribution in cash. There is no other mandatory minimum profit distribution decision taken according to CMB.

The main  purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations. The Group has various other financial  instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations. The main risks arising from the  Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. The Group management reviews and agrees  policies for managing each of the risks as summarized below.    Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party  to incur a financial loss. The Group attempts to control credit risk by monitoring credit exposures, limiting transactions with  specific counterparties, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of the counterparties. It is the Group policy that all  customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit screening procedures and the Group also obtains collaterals  from customers when appropriate. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that  the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant. Trade receivables are evaluated by management based on their past   AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 113 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TL) unless otherwise indicated.)

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return  capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as  net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including financial liabilities, trade payables and  due to related parties, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as  equity, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet, plus net debt. The ratio of net debt to equity is as follows: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Total liabilities 745.994 522.288 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (Note 4) (85.106) (64.499) Net debt 660.888 457.789 Total shareholders equity 850.947 775.765 Total capital 1.511.835 1.233.554 Debt/equity ratio %44 %37  AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 121 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TL) unless otherwise indicated.) AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. NOTE 27 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value estimation Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,  other than in a forced sale or liquidation, and is best evidenced by a quoted market price, if one exists. The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by the Group, using available market information and  appropriate valuation methodologies. However, judgment is necessarily required to interpret market data to estimate the fair  value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Group could realise in a  current market exchange. The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments: Financial assets Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the  balance sheet dates. These balances are anticipated to close their book value. The carrying values of significant portion of cash and cash equivalents are assumed to approximate to their fair value due to  their short-term nature.  The carrying values of trade receivables are assumed to approximate to their fair value. Financial liabilities The fair values of short term borrowings and trade payables are assumed to approximate to their carrying values due to their  short-term nature. The estimated fair value of demand deposits expresses the amount to be paid at the moment of withdrawal. The fair value  of the overnight deposits indicates the book value. The estimated fair value of the fixed interest deposits is determined by  calculating the discounted cash flows, using the market interest rates applied to similar loan and other debts. In case where the  maturities are short, the carrying values are assumed to reflect the fair values (Note 6).

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Fair Value Estimation: Effective 1 January 2010, the group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the  balance sheet at fair value, this requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement  hierarchy: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that  is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); Level 3 :Inputs for the asset or liability that is not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).  31 December 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Hedging derivative financial instruments - 4.175 - Total Liabilities - 4.175 - 31 December 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Hedging derivative financial instruments - 5.000 - Total Liabilities - 5.000 - The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.  These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible  on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instruments are observable, the instrument is  included in level 2.

This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control  relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or  error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. Auditors responsibility 3.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

CMB regulated the principles  and procedures of preparation, presentation and announcement of financial statements prepared by the entities with  the Communiqu No: XI-29, Principles of Financial Reporting in Capital Markets (the Communiqu). According to the  Communiqu, entities shall prepare their financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  (IAS/IFRS) endorsed by the European Union. Until the differences of the IAS/IFRS as endorsed by the European Union from  the ones issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) are announced by Turkish Accounting Standards  Board (TASB), IAS/IFRS issued by the IASB shall be applied. Accordingly, Turkish Accounting Standards/Turkish Financial  Reporting Standards (TAS/TFRS) accepted by the TASB which are in line with the aforementioned standards shall be  considered. With the decision taken on 17 March 2005, the CMB announced that, effective from 1 January 2005, for companies operating  in Turkey and preparing their financial statements in accordance with CMB Financial Reporting Standards, the application of  inflation accounting is no longer required Accordingly, IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, issued by  the IASB, has not been applied in the financial statements for the accounting periods starting 1 January 2005. As the differences of the IAS/IFRS endorsed by the European Union from the ones issued by the IASB have not been  announced by TASB as of the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the consolidated financial  statements have been prepared within the framework of Communiqu XI, No: 29 and related promulgations to this  Communiqu as issued by the CMB, in accordance with the CMB Financial Reporting Standards which are based on IAS/IFRS.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Amendments in International Financial Reporting Standards a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective from 1 January 2011 and applied by Group: - IAS 24 (revised),Related party disclosures, issued in November 2009.

This set of amendments includes  changes to six standards and one IFRIC, namely: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements IAS 27 (Revised), Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting b) Amendments and interpretations effective from 1 January 2011 but not has material impact on Groups financial  statements: - IFRIC 19, Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments, effective 01 July 2010. The interpretation clarifies  the accounting by an entity when the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and result in the entity issuing equity  instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability (debt for equity swap). It requires a gain  or loss to be recognised in profit or loss, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial  liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued. - IAS 32 (Amendment), Financial instruments: Presentation The amendment applies to annual periods beginning on or after  1 February 2010. The amendment addresses the accounting forrights issues that are denominated in a currency other than the  functional currency of the issuer. - IFRS 1, First time adoption of IFRS effective 01 July 2010.  Provides the same relief to first-time adopters as was given to  current users of IFRSs upon adoption of the amendments to IFRS 7. Also clarifies the transition provisions of the amendments  to IFRS 7. - IFRIC 14, Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement  effective 01 January 2011. The amendments correct an  unintended consequence of IFRIC 14, IAS 19 - The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their  interaction. Without the amendments, entities are not permitted to recognise as an asset some voluntary prepayments for  minimum funding contributions. - Annual improvements 2010 are effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2011.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. c) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards those are not yet effective in 2011: - IFRS 7 (Amendment), Financial Instruments: Disclosures effective from 1 July 2011. Emphasises the interaction between  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about the nature and extent of risks associated with financial instruments.  - IFRS 1 (Amendment), First time adoption is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011. Amendment  provides guidance on how an entity should resume presenting financial statements in accordance with IFRSs after a period  when the entity was unable to comply with IFRSs because its functional currency was subject to severe hyperinflation. - IAS 12 (Amendment), Income taxes is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012. This amendment  introduces an exception to the existing principle for the measurement of deferred tax assets or liabilities arising on investment  property measured at fair value. - IAS 19 (Amendment), Employee benefits is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. These  amendments eliminate the corridor approach and calculate finance costs on a net funding basis. - IAS 1 (Amendment), Financial statement presentation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012. The  main change resulting from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items presented in Other comprehensive  income (OCI )on the basis of whether they are potentially recycled to profit or loss (reclassification adjustments). - IFRS 9, Financial Instruments is not applicable until 1 January 2013 but is available for early adoption. This standard is the  first step in the process to replace IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 introduces new  requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets. - IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

The standard provides additional guidance to assist in determining  control where this is difficult to assess. - IFRS 11, Joint arrangements is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. This standard provides for  a more realistic reflection of joint arrangements by focusing on the rights and obligations of the arrangement, rather than its  legal form. There are two types of joint arrangement: joint operations and joint ventures. Proportional consolidation of joint  ventures is no longer allowed. - IFRS 12, Disclosures of interests in other entities is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. 2.1.2 Functional and Presentation Currency  Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary  economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are  presented in TL. The Group prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the going concern assumption. 2.1.3 Basis of Consolidation a) The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company, Aksa, and its Subsidiaries on the basis  set out in sections (b) below. The financial statements of the companies included in the scope of consolidation have been  prepared as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and have been prepared in accordance with CMB Financial  Reporting Standards by applying uniform accounting policies and presentation. The results of operations of Subsidiaries are  included or excluded from their effective dates of acquisition or disposal respectively. b) Subsidiaries are companies in which Aksa has the power to control the financial and operating policies for the benefit of  itself, either (1) through the power to exercise more than 50% of voting rights related to shares in the companies as a result of  shares owned directly and/or indirectly by itself or (2) although not having the power to exercise more than 50% of the voting  rights, through the exercise of actual dominant influence over the financial and operating policies. The table below sets out all Subsidiaries and demonstrates their shareholding structure as of 31 December 2011 and 2010: Direct and indirect ownership interest by the  Company and its subsidiaries (%) Subsidiary 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Ak-Tops (1) 60,00 60,00 Fitco(1), (3) 100,00 100,00 Aksa Egypt (1), (3) 99,14 99,14 Akgiriim (2) 58,00 58,00 Subsidiaries Ak-Pa (2), (4) 13,47 13,47 (1) The financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis.  (2) Although the Company has the power to exercise more than 50% of the voting rights, on the grounds of materiality these  Subsidiaries have been classified and accounted for as financial assets in the consolidated financial statements with a carrying  value of their initial acquisition costs less impairment, if any. (3) These subsidiaries have been included in the scope of full consolidation as at the balance sheet date.  (4) As of 1 January 2011 these subsidiaries have been included in the scope of full consolidation as at the balance sheet date.  Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the control is transferred to the Group and are deconsolidated from the  date that the control ceases. Where necessary, accounting policies for Subsidiaries have been changed to ensure consistency  with the policies adopted by the Group. Carrying values of the Subsidiaries shares held by the Company are eliminated against the related equity of Subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and balances between Aksa and its Subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation. Dividends arising  from shares held by the Company in its Subsidiaries are eliminated from income for the period and equity, respectively.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. The minority shareholders share in the net assets and results of Subsidiaries for the period are separately classified as non- controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income. The financial statements of the subsidiaries that are located in foreign countries, are prepared according to related countries  regulations, the required adjustments and reclassifications reflected for the purpose of fair presentation in accordance with  the CMB Financial Reporting Standards . Foreign subsidiaries asset and liabilities have been translated to Turkish Liras at  the balance sheet date currency. Income statement has been translated to TL with the average currency. Closing and average  currency translation differences have shown under currency translation differences. Changes in the scope of consolidation: The Company ceased to have the power to govern the operational and financial policies of Ak-Pa Tekstil hracat Pazarlama A..  The assets and consolidated value of liabilities of Ak-pa are excluded from the scope of consolidation as of 1 January 2011 and as  of that date, the carrying value of Ak-Pas equity attributable to the participation rate of the Company is designated as the cost  of the investment which approximate the fair value and included in the consolidated financial statements.  As of 1 January 2011, Aksa Egypt and Fitco, subsidiaries of the Group, have been included to full consolidation scope per their  increasing importance on the grounds of materiality. 2.2 Changes in Accounting Policies, Accounting Estimates and Errors Significant changes in accounting policies or significant errors are corrected, retrospectively; by restating the prior period  consolidated financial statements. The effect of changes in accounting estimates affecting the current period is recognised  in the current period; the effect of changes in accounting estimates affecting current and future periods is recognised in the  current and future periods. 2.3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and at banks and short-term highly liquid investments whose risk of value  change is not material including time deposits generally having original maturities of three months or less (Note 4).   Financial Assets  Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and  receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate. When financial assets are  recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss,  directly attributable transaction costs. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re- evaluates this designation at each financial year end. All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on  the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases  or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulation or convention in  the marketplace. As of 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 the Group does not have any financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.   AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 81 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TL) unless otherwise indicated.) AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Loans and Receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active  market. After initial measurement loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less  any allowance for impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivables are derecognised  or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Available-for-sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for-sale or that are not  classified in any of the three categories (a) loans and receivables, (b) held-to-maturity investments and (c) assets at fair value  through profit or loss. A gain or loss on an available for- sale financial asset after initial recognition shall be recognized directly  in equity, through the statement of changes in equity, except for impairment losses, dividend and interest gains, until the  financial asset is derecognized, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity shall be recognized  in profit or loss. If a fair value loss on an available-for-sale asset has been recognized directly in equity, and there is objective  evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that has been recognized directly in equity should be recycled into  profit or loss even though the financial asset has not been sold.  Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Available-for-sale financial assets that are quoted  in active markets are measured based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active the fair value is  determined by using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing model (Note 5). For investments as subsidiaries that are excluded from the scope of consolidation on the grounds of materiality where there  is no quoted market price and where a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be determined since other methods are  inappropriate and unworkable, they are carried at cost less any impairment in value (Note 5).  Trade receivables Trade receivables have a maturity range of 30-120 days and are recognized at original invoice amount and carried at amortized  cost less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An estimate for doubtful debt is made when collection of the full amount  is no longer probable. A credit risk provision for trade receivables is established if there is objective evidence that the Group will  not be able to collect all amounts due. The allowance is an estimated amount which is difference between existing receivable  and collectible amount. Collectible amount is the discounted value of trade receivables, all cash flows including collections from  guarantees by using original effective interest rate. Bad debts are written off when identified (Note 7). The Group has accrued discount premiums in line with the fibers customers purchase targets to be paid at the end of the year.  In the current period, the Group has classified the discount premiums under other discount account in sales. Trade payables Trade payables have average maturities changing between 30-180 days and consist of the amounts invoiced or not invoiced  related with the realized material or service purchases, and are carried at amortized cost (Note 7).  AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 82 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TL) unless otherwise indicated.) AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value less costs to sell. Cost of inventories comprises the purchase  cost and the cost of bringing inventories into their present location and condition. Cost is determined by the monthly moving  weighted average method. The cost of borrowings is not included in the costs of inventories. Net realisable value less costs to  sell is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale  (Note 9). Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss. When  assets are sold or retired, their costs and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss  resulting from their disposal is included in the income statement. The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and any directly  attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use. Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis (Note 10). Useful life and the depreciation  method are constantly reviewed, and accordingly, parallels are sought between the depreciation method and the period and  the useful life to be derived from the related asset. As of 31 December 2011, the depreciation periods for property, plant and  equipment, which approximate the economic useful lives of such assets, are as follows: Period (Years) Land 2 - 50 Buildings 5 - 50 Machinery and equipment 3 - 40 Motor vehicles 4 - 8 Furniture and fixtures 2 - 20  The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of  financial assets is impaired. In the event of circumstances indicating that an impairment has occurred in the tangible assets,  an inspection is performed for the purpose of determining a possible impairment, and if the registered value of the tangible  asset is higher than its recoverable value, the registered value is reduced to its recoverable value by reserving a provision. The  recoverable value is considered either the net cash flow to be caused by the current use of the respective tangible assets or the  nest sales price, whichever is higher.  Gains or losses on disposals of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing proceeds with their restated  carrying amounts and are included in the related income and expense accounts, as appropriate.  Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statements during the financial period in which they are incurred. The cost  of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess  of the originally assessed standard of performance of the existing asset. Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are capitalized at cost. Intangible assets, created within the business  are not capitalized and expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which it is incurred. They are initially recognised  at acquisition cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The depreciation period for the  intangibles capitalized in relation with the new models will be started after the production of these models is started. The  carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the  carrying value may not be recoverable (Note 11). Useful lives of intangible assets are determined as 3-15 years.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Research and development costs Expenditures for research and development are charged against income in the period incurred except for project development  costs which comply with the following criteria: - The product or process is clearly defined and costs are separately identified and measured reliably, - The technical feasibility of the product is demonstrated, - The product or process will be sold or used in-house, - A potential market exists for the product or its usefulness in case of internal use is demonstrated, and - Adequate technical, financial and other resources required for completion of the project are available. The costs related to the development projects are capitalized when the criteria above are met and amortized by straight-line  basis over the useful lives of related projects (Note 11). Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can  be reliably measured. Revenues are stated net of discounts, value added and sales taxes. Revenue is recognized when the  significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured  reliably. Net sales are invoiced amounts of delivered goods excluding sales returns and sales discounts.   Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate until maturity and considering the effective interest rate. When the arrangement effectively constitutes a financing transaction, the fair value of the consideration is determined  by discounting all future receipts using an imputed rate of interest. The difference between the fair value and the nominal  amount of the consideration is recognized on an accrual basis as credit sale financial income (Note 21). Dividend income is recognized when the Group has the right to receive the dividend payment.  Rent income is recognized in the  financial statements when the Groups right to receive the monthly rent income is established.  Commission income is recognized when the intermediary goods invoice has been booked by the seller. Bank borrowings All bank borrowings are initially recognized at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue cost  associated with the borrowing. After initial recognition, bank borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using  the effective yield method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue cost and any discount or premium on  settlement (Note 6). Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, one that takes  a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset in the  period in which the asset is prepared for its intended use or sale. Without this context, the borrowing costs are expensed as  incurred. Fair value of financial instruments Fair (market) value is the amount for which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing  parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation, and is best evidenced by a quoted market price, if one exists.  The fair values of the financial instruments are determined in accordance with the following methods and assumptions as  follows:  AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 84 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TL) unless otherwise indicated.) AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Financial assets Monetary assets for which fair value approximates carrying value are carried at cost in the financial statements and consists  of cash and cash equivalents, their interest accruals, and other financial assets; and considered to approximate their respective  carrying values due to their short-term nature and negligible credit losses. The carrying value of accounts receivable along with  the related allowance for unearned income and uncollectibility are estimated to be their fair values.   Financial liabilities Monetary liabilities for which fair value approximates carrying value including accounts payable, short-term bank borrowings  and other monetary liabilities are considered approximate their respective carrying values due to their short-term nature. The  bank borrowings are stated at their amortized costs and transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of bank  borrowings. The fair value of bank borrowings are considered to state their respective carrying values since the interest rate  applied to bank borrowings are updated periodically by the lender to reflect active market price quotations. The carrying value  of accounts payable along with the related allowance for unrealized cost is estimated to be their fair values.  Employee termination benefits Under the Turkish Labour Law, the Company is required to pay termination benefits to each employee who has completed one  year of service and whose employment is terminated without due cause, or who is called up for military service, dies or retires  after completing 25 years of service (20 years for women) and achieves the retirement age (58 for women and 60 for men). As  of 23 May 2002 since the related legislation was changed, some transition pre-retirement articles has been removed. Under the Turkish Labour Law, the provision has been calculated by estimating the present value of the future probable  obligation of the Company arising from the retirement of the employees (Note 14).  The Group has an employee benefit plan called Seniority Incentive Bonus (Bonus) which is paid to employees with a certain  level of seniority. The Group accounts for this Bonus according to IAS 19, Employee Benefits. Seniority incentive bonus  provision which is disclosed within the employee termination benefit represents the present value of the estimated total  reserve of the probable future obligations. Current and deferred income tax  Tax expense or income is the aggregate of current income tax and deferred taxes which are based on the gains and losses for  the period. Deferred income tax is determined, using the liability method and tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted by the balance  sheet date. Deferred income tax is provided in full, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and  liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.  Deferred income tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences are recognized to the extent that it is probable  that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. The carrying  amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable  that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Deferred taxes arising  from income and expenses accounted under equity are recorded under equity, accordingly.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is  realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed by the Group at each balance sheet date and reduced to the  extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax  asset to be utilized (Note 23).

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Earnings per share Earnings per share disclosed in the income statement are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number  of shares that have been outstanding during the related period concerned (Note 24). In Turkey, companies can increase their share capital by making a pro-rata distribution of shares (bonus shares) to existing  shareholders from retained earnings. For the purpose of earnings per share computations, the weighted average number of  shares outstanding during the year has been adjusted in respect of bonus shares issued without a corresponding change in  resources by giving them retroactive effect for the year in which they were issued and for each earlier period. Events after the balance sheet date The Group adjusts the amounts recognised in its financial statements to reflect the adjusting events after the balance sheet  date. If non-adjusting events after the balance sheet date have material influence on the economic decisions of users of the  financial statements, they are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable  that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.  Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate (Note 13). Contingent assets and liabilities Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the financial statements, but are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow  of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. A contingent asset is not recognized in the financial statements, but  disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Offsetting If the essence of the transaction and events requires offsetting, presentation of these transactions and events at their net  values or following up of the assets at their amounts after the deduction of impairment, is not evaluated as a breach of the  non-deductibility rule. Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies are recognised in the statements of income.  Goodwill The cost of a business combination is allocated by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets at the date of acquisition. Any  excess of the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, over the business combination cost is  accounted for as goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually at the same time for impairment and the impairment provision, if any,  is immediately recognised in the consolidated income statements. The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is  determined based on the value in use or fair value less cost to sell calculations. As a result of the impairment tests performed  under above assumptions, no impairment was detected in the goodwill amount as of 31 December 2011. Since the sales  cost-based fair value of the said cash generating unit is higher than the book value, the Group management did not make a  recoverable value calculation according to the use value (Note 12).

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The  chief operating decision-maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.  For an operating segment to be identified as a reportable segment, its reported revenue, including both sales to external  customers and intersegment sales or transfers, is 10 per cent or more of the combined revenue, internal and external, of all  operating segments; the absolute amount of its reported profit or loss is 10 per cent or more of the combined profit or loss or  its assets are 10 per cent or more of the combined assets of all operating segments. Operating segments that do not meet  any of the quantitative thresholds may be considered reportable, and separately disclosed, if the management believes that  information about the segment would be useful to users of the financial statements.  For at the Group the reportable segments are industrial segments. Reportable segment, its reported revenue, including both  sales to external customers and intersegment sales or transfers, is 10 per cent or more of the combined revenue, internal and  external, of all operating segments; the absolute amount of its reported profit or loss is 10 per cent or more of the combined  profit or loss or its assets are 10 per cent or more of the combined assets of all operating segments (Note 3). The Group assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax,  Depreciation and Amortisation, EBITDA.  The Groups reportable business segments are fibers, energy and the remained operations are reported as other. Among  the subsidiaries Aksa Egypt is included under fibers, Fitco and Ak-tops are reported under other segment (Note 3). The supportive functions of industrial segments namely Financial Affairs, Human Resources and Management of Systems,  Purchasing, Business Development, Research and Development, Head Office Expenses and other general administrative and  operating expenses are classified under unallocated corporate expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses are followed at the  Group level by management as the expenses are made to ensure the integrity of the Group by the management.   Derivative financial instruments The derivative instruments of the Group mainly consist of foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swap instruments.  These derivative transactions, even though providing effective economic hedges under the Group risk management position, do  not generally qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules and are therefore treated as derivatives held for trading (IAS  39). The Group shows its profits and losses relating to the hedging transaction under equities as hedging fund. All derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative (Note 16).

Related parties Parties are considered related to the Group if; a) directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, the party: i) controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, the Company (this includes parents, subsidiaries and fellow  subsidiaries); ii) has an interest in the Group that gives it significant influence over the Group; or iii) has joint control over the Group; b) the party is an associate of the Group; c) the party is a joint venture in which the Group is a venture; d) the party is member of the key management personnel of the Group or its parent; e) the party is a close member of the family of any individual referred to in (a) or (d); f) the party is an entity that is controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by, or for which significant voting power in such  entity resides with, directly or indirectly, any individual referred to In (d) or (e);  or g) the party has a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of the Group, or of an entity that is a related party of the  Group. Related party transactions are transfer of resources or obligations between related parties, regardless of whether a price is charged. A number of transactions are entered into with related parties in the normal course of business (Note 25).    Reporting of cash flow Cash flows during the period are classified and reported by operating, investing and financing activities in the cash flow statements. Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash flows of the Group generated from retailing activities.  Cash flows related to investing activities represent the cash flows that are used in or provided from the investing activities of the Group  (fixed investments and financial investments). Cash flows arising from financing activities represent the cash proceeds from the financing activities of the Group and the repayments  of these funds. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and bank deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily  convertible to known amounts of cash with maturities equal or less than three months and which are subject to an insignificant risk of  changes in value (Note 4). Government grants Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received  and the group will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to costs are recognised in the income statement by  deducting from research and development expenses. Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in non- current liabilities as deferred government grants and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected  lives of the related assets.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. 2.4 Critical Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements necessitates the use of estimates and assumptions that affect asset and liability  amounts reported as of the balance sheet date, explanations of contingent liabilities and assets; and income and expense  amounts reported for the accounting period. Although these estimates and assumptions are based on all management  information related to the events and transactions, actual results may differ from them.  The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets  and liabilities for the next reporting period are outlined below: a) Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable  assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.   The Group tests annually goodwill for impairment and carries goodwill at cost less accumulated impairment loss. The  recoverable amount of cash-generating unit has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These value-in-use  calculations include the discounted after tax cash flow projections, and these projections are based on USD financial budgets  approved by management covering a five-year period. The USD fair value is converted into TL by using the related foreign  exchange rate on the date of the balance sheet. Therefore, the value in use calculations is affected by the fluctuations in the  foreign exchange market. The discount rate used in the value in use calculations is 10,59% and the risk premium is 3%. The discount rates used are after  tax and reflect specific risks relating to the company. As of 31 December 2011, the Group did not determine any impairment in  the amount of the goodwill as a result of the impairment test performed by using the aforementioned assumptions. If discount rate used in goodwill impairment calculation has been 2% higher/lower with all other variables held constant, there  would not been any impairment define on goodwill amount. b) Net realizable value Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value as discussed in Note:2.3. Net realizable value is the estimated  selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the  sale (Note 9). c) Tangible and intangible assets useful lives Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss as discussed  in Note 2.3. They are initially recognised at acquisition cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful  lives. Useful lives of property, plant and equipment, rely on best estimates of management, these estimates are reviewed  balance sheet dates and if necessary adjustments are made necessary. Useful lives change of plant, property and equipment In 2011, Group has reviewed useful lives of some property,  plant and equipments in fiber segment according to IAS 16   Property, plant and equipment , as a result of the study, estimated useful lives of these tangible fixed assets have been  changed effective from 1 January 2011. As a result of this change, current period amortisation expense decreased by TL 8.299  compared to amount calculated with prior useful life estimation as of 31 December 2011.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Useful lives changes as follows; New  Useful lives Previous  Useful lives Machinery and equipment 17-30 years 10 years Land improvemens 30 years 15 years d) Doubtful provision In the event there is a situation which makes impossible for the Group to collect the amounts due payable, a provision for  loss is created for the trade receivables. The amount of the provision is determined with the assessment of the payment  performance of the customer and trade receivable aging. Provision for doubtful receivables is the accounting estimation that is  based on the past payment performance and financial situations of the customers (Note 7).   e) Provisions As discussed in Note 2.3, provisions are recognized when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result  of past events, when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligation and when reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation (Note 13). 2.5 Convenience Translation into English of Consolidated Financial Statements As of 31 December 2011, the financial reporting standards described in Note 2.1  (defined as  CMB Financial Reporting Standards) to the consolidated financial statements differ from IFRS issued by the  International Accounting Standards Board with respect to the application of inflation accounting for the periods betrween 1  January and 31 December 2005.Accordingly, these consolidated financial statements are not intended to present the financial  position and the results of operations in accordance with IFRS USD amounts shown in these consolidated financial statements have been included solely for the convenience of the reader  and are translated from TL, as a matter of arithmetic computation only, at the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey official  TL exchange rate. Thus, USD amounts do not form a part of the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with  generally accepted accounting standards issued by the CMB as at 31 December 2011.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. The provision has been calculated by estimating the present value of the future probable obligation of the Company arising  from the retirement of employees. IAS 19 Employee Benefits require actuarial valuation methods to be developed to estimate the enterprises obligation under  defined benefit plans. Accordingly the following actuarial assumptions have been used in the calculation of the total liability: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Discount rate (%) 2,91 4,66 Probability of retirement (%) 98,94 98,92 The principal assumption is that the maximum liability for each year of service will increase in line with inflation. Thus, the  discount rate applied represents the expected real rate after adjusting for the anticipated effects of future inflation. . As the  maximum liability is revised once every six months, the maximum amount of TL 2.805,04 effective from 1 January 2012 (1  January 2010: TL 2.623,23) has been taken into consideration in calculating the reserve for employment termination benefit of  the Group.

AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and subsequently are re- measured at their fair value. The derivative instruments of the Group mainly consist of foreign exchange forward contracts and  interest rate swap instruments. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Group designates certain derivatives as  either a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge), or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or a  firm commitment (cash flow hedge). These derivative transactions provide effective economic hedges under the Group risk management position and qualify for  hedge accounting under the specific rules and are therefore treated as derivatives held for hedging. Changes in the fair value  of derivatives that are designated as being and qualify as cash flow hedges and are highly effective, are recognised in equity as  hedging reserve. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, or when a  committed or forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is  immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, or when a  committed or forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is  immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement. As of 31 December 2011 the fixed interest rates vary from %2,5 to %4,2 (31 December 2010: %2,5 - %4,2). The main floating  rates are EURIBOR and LIBOR. Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity on interest rate swap contracts as  of 31 December 2011 will be continuously released to the income statement within finance cost until the repayment of the bank  borrowings (Note 5).

Adjustment to share capital represents the difference between the amounts of the restatement effect of cash and cash  equivalents contributions to share capital and the amounts before the restatements. The legal reserves consist of first and second reserves, appropriated in accordance with the Turkish Commercial Code (TCC),  The TCC stipulates that the first legal reserve is appropriated out of statutory profits at the rate of 5% per annum, until the  total reserve reaches 20% of the Companys paid-in capital. The second legal reserve is appropriated at the rate of 10% per  annum of all cash distributions in excess of 5% of the paid-in capital. Under the TCC, the legal reserves can be used only to  offset losses and are not available for any other usage unless they exceed 50% of paid-in capital.  In accordance with CMB Financial Reporting Standards, the Company classified the above mentioned amounts under  Restricted reserves, the amount of restricted reserves is TL52.542 as of 31 December 2011 (31 December 2010: TL 48.523). This  amount fully consists of legal reserves. In accordance with the CMB regulations effective until 1 January 2008, the inflation adjustment differences arising at the initial  application of inflation accounting which are recorded under accumulated losses could be netted off from the profit to be  distributed based on CMB profit distribution regulations. In addition, the aforementioned amount recorded under accumulated losses could be netted off with net income for the  period, if any, undistributed prior period profits, and inflation adjustment differences of extraordinary reserves, legal reserves  and capital, respectively. In accordance with the CMB regulations effective until 1 January 2008, Capital, Share Premiums, Legal Reserves, Special  Reserves and Extraordinary Reserves were recorded at their statutory carrying amounts and the inflation adjustment  differences related to such accounts were recorded under inflation adjustment differences at the initial application of  inflation accounting. Equity inflation adjustment differences could have been utilised in issuing bonus shares and offsetting  accumulated losses, carrying amount of extraordinary reserves could have been utilised in issuing bonus shares, cash dividend  distribution and offsetting accumulated losses. In accordance with the Communiqu No:XI-29 and related announcements of CMB, effective from   AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 106 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TL) unless otherwise indicated.)

The  valuation differences shall be classified as follows: - The difference arising from the Paid-in Capital and not been transferred to capital yet, shall be classified under the  Inflation Adjustment to Share Capital; - The difference due to the inflation adjustment of Restricted Reserves and Share Premium and the amount has not been  utilised in dividend distribution or capital increase yet, shall be classified under Retained Earnings, Other equity items shall be carried at the amounts calculated based on CMB Financial Reporting Standards.  Adjustment to share capital has no use other than being transferred to paid-in share capital. Dividend Distribution Based on CMB Decree No. 02/51, dated 27 January 2010, there is no mandatory minimum profit distribution requirement for  the quoted entities at the stock exchange for profits arising from operations in 2009. Regarding the dividend distribution for  the current and following years, the entities are to distribute their profits for the current and following years under the scope  of CMB Communiqu No. IV-27, their articles of association and their previously publicly declared profit distribution policies.  In regards to the profit distribution, in accordance with the decision of the General Assembly, the distribution can be made as  cash or as bonus shares or as a combination of a certain percentage of cash and bonus shares. It is also permitted to retain  this amount in the Company reserves if the first dividend amount is below 5% of the paid in/issued capital; however if the  Company has increased its paid-in capital without dividend distribution in the previous year when the outstanding shares have  been identified as old and new, it is mandatory for companies that will make profit distribution from the net distributable  profit of the previous year to make this first dividend distribution in cash. There is no other mandatory minimum profit distribution decision taken according to CMB.

The main  purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations. The Group has various other financial  instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations. The main risks arising from the  Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. The Group management reviews and agrees  policies for managing each of the risks as summarized below.    Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party  to incur a financial loss. The Group attempts to control credit risk by monitoring credit exposures, limiting transactions with  specific counterparties, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of the counterparties. It is the Group policy that all  customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit screening procedures and the Group also obtains collaterals  from customers when appropriate. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that  the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant. Trade receivables are evaluated by management based on their past   AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 113 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TL) unless otherwise indicated.)

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return  capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as  net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including financial liabilities, trade payables and  due to related parties, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as  equity, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet, plus net debt. The ratio of net debt to equity is as follows: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Total liabilities 745.994 522.288 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (Note 4) (85.106) (64.499) Net debt 660.888 457.789 Total shareholders equity 850.947 775.765 Total capital 1.511.835 1.233.554  AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 121 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TL) unless otherwise indicated.)

Debt/equity ratio %44 %37 NOTE 27 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value estimation Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties,  other than in a forced sale or liquidation, and is best evidenced by a quoted market price, if one exists. The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by the Group, using available market information and  appropriate valuation methodologies. However, judgment is necessarily required to interpret market data to estimate the fair  value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Group could realise in a  current market exchange. The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments: Financial assets Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the  balance sheet dates. These balances are anticipated to close their book value. The carrying values of significant portion of cash and cash equivalents are assumed to approximate to their fair value due to  their short-term nature.  The carrying values of trade receivables are assumed to approximate to their fair value. Financial liabilities The fair values of short term borrowings and trade payables are assumed to approximate to their carrying values due to their  short-term nature. The estimated fair value of demand deposits expresses the amount to be paid at the moment of withdrawal. The fair value  of the overnight deposits indicates the book value. The estimated fair value of the fixed interest deposits is determined by  calculating the discounted cash flows, using the market interest rates applied to similar loan and other debts. In case where the   AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 122 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TL) unless otherwise indicated.) AKSA AKRLK KMYA SANAY A.. maturities are short, the carrying values are assumed to reflect the fair values (Note 6). Fair Value Estimation: Effective 1 January 2010, the group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the  balance sheet at fair value, this requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement  hierarchy: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that  is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); Level 3 :Inputs for the asset or liability that is not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).  31 December 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Hedging derivative financial instruments - 4.175 - Total Liabilities - 4.175 - 31 December 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Hedging derivative financial instruments - 5.000 - Total Liabilities - 5.000 - The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.  These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible  on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instruments are observable, the instrument is   AKSA ANNUAL REPORT 2011 123 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 (Amounts expressed in thousands of Turkish Lira (TL) unless otherwise indicated.)
