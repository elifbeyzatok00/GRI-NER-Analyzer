Along with others in the international supplies sector LGS has faced  difficulties in these economically uncertain times.  The team has once  again shown its resourcefulness in turning challenges into openings in  many ways including the areas highlighted in the UNGC.    Retaining our principled approach is paramount as ever and it is with  pleasure that I can reiterate our belief in the importance of the UNGC  remains strong.     We look forward to another year of opportunities to embrace and uphold  the principles of the UNGC.            Lynda Scott- Tomlin  LGS Managing Director    Lynda Scott- Tomlin  LGS Managing Director           Page 4 of 15      THE 10 PRINCIPLES OF THE GLOBAL COMPACT    Below is an overview of the ways in which LGS complies with the  principles of UNGC. It also includes an outline of the company policies and  outcomes, and aims for the coming year.    HUMAN RIGHTS    Principle 1:  Business should support and respect the protection of  internationally proclaimed Human rights.    LGS places great value on the Human Rights of its employees. The respect  and support of human rights is not limited to the immediate workplace,  rather, LGS recognises the importance of upholding the human rights of  all workers existing within its sphere of influence.  LGS is very conscious that it engages in a worldwide supply management  chain. Therefore, it is within the companys responsibilities to ensure that  all operations involved in the supply process adhere to internationally  proclaimed Human Rights.              Page 5 of 15          Company Current  Policies    Actions  Outcomes   As a company we  adopt a non-  discriminatory policy,  therefore any  discrimination of  employees  throughout the  supply chain based  on age, gender,  religion, race,  culture or political is  not tolerated.     Subsequently, LGS  does not deal with  companies which we  see to breach human  rights.   Support of Howard  League     A large part of our  work is around  election projects,  largely in Africa.   LGS staff is made  aware of the  potential for  discrimination  against minority  groups and some  have taken part in  training courses to  combat such  behaviour.     Appreciation of  freedom of  speech and  expression     Greater  appreciation of  difficulties  faced by  minority  groups and  understanding  of importance  of the  democratic  process.    Future Aims: Support charities whose aim is to correct abuse of human  rights.          Principle 2: Business should ensure that they are not complicit in  Human Rights abuses.    LGS takes a breach of human rights within its supply chain very seriously.   Our multinational team help to ensure clear and accurate communication  with manufacturers, and therefore aims to avoid any misunderstanding  regarding the human rights of workers throughout the supply chain.            Page 6 of 15    Company Current  Policies    Actions  Outcomes   LGS does not  engage with any  company seen to  be breaching  human rights.     LGS only  participates in  bids which do not  violate human  rights.   LGS continues to engage in  regular factory visits.  As we  have started offering new  products this has involved a  significant number of visits  to suppliers in the supply  chain to check they adhere  to an acceptable level of  human rights.     Where a breach of human  rights is uncovered, LGS  takes appropriate action to  either insist that practices  are changed, or to switch  suppliers.     Suppliers  are made  aware of  this and  do we  believe  examine  some of  their  practices  as a  result.  Future Aims: To continue to keep vigilant in our choice of suppliers.               Page 7 of 15    LABOUR STANDARDS     Principle 3: Business should uphold the freedom of Association  and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.      As a company we value the choices and opinions of our employees.  All  workers are respected and listened to, and we uphold the freedom of  association. Managers are in place to improve communication between  employees. Collective bargaining in its purest sense is not relevant to this  companys environment, mainly due to the nature and size of the  company. However, the spirit of collective bargaining is recognised, and  employees withhold the right to voice their opinions collectively as well as  individually. After discussing the election of a workers representative, we  decided that due to the nature and size of the company, it is not the most  fitting solution. We resolved to maintain constant openness between all  staff.           Page 8 of 15    Company Current  Policies    Actions  Outcome   To respect and  listen to all  employees.     Employees have  the freedom to  join any  association.       Regular  communications  meetings  between  employer,  managers and  employees to  ensure effective  and efficient  communication  from both sides.     Improved  communication  between employees.     Improved working  environment.     Any issues that arise  are addressed and  dealt with  accordingly.    Future Aims: Whilst collective bargaining is not relevant to our business we  will positively encourage its use throughout our supply chain.                       Page 9 of 15    Principle 4: Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms  of forced and compulsory labour.    LGS is very sensitive to all forms and causes of forced labour. Our  multinational, multi cultural team allows effective communication with our  suppliers, to ensure that forced labour does not become part of our  practices without our knowledge.      Company Current  Policies    Actions  Outcome   All employees  have an  employment  contract.      Large scale  projects are  monitored  throughout the  supply  process.   Wherever possible  staff encouraged to  chat to factory  workers on regular  visits made to  production sites     Factory visits ensure  that we are aware of  the labour standards  employed throughout  our supply chain.   LGS supports a  charity that  provides shelter and  sustenance to  people who have  suffered misfortune  and who are  homeless.  This  vulnerable sector of  society can be  subject to  unsavoury work  practices.      Future Aims: LGS plans to formalise its approach to reducing forced labour  by requesting that suppliers confirm in writing that they are not using  inappropriate staff in their workforce.          Principle 5: Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of  child labour.    LGS condemns any practice of child labour, and works to ensure that  under no circumstances it is used within the companys supply chain.  However, discovering the practice of child labour can be challenging,       Page 10 of 15    despite stringent and regular factory visits. If use of child labour is  identified, LGS ensures that appropriate measures are taken.      Company Current  Policies    Actions  Outcome   LGS closely  adheres to  national labour  laws and  regulations as  well as minimum  age provisions.     LGS uses its  influence on  suppliers to  promote ethical  labour standards.   Factory visits attempt to  ensure that child labour is  not employed at any point  along the supply chain.     If an incident of child labour  is uncovered, LGS takes  positive action against its  practice, through either  working towards changing  the practices of the  company or by changing  their supplier.     LGS does not  knowingly  engage with  practices of  child labour.    Future Aims: To continue to visit new suppliers.          Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of  discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.    LGS UK team still includes English, Chinese, South African, Algerian,  Belgian and Bulgarian employees.  This in itself promotes equal  opportunities.     The company is a Home Office recognised sponsor of non-EU workers    We believe that our multicultural team allows effective communication  throughout the supply process and leads to efficient business.            Page 11 of 15                  Company Current Policies    Actions  Outcome   Recruitment of staff is  based purely on  qualifications, skill and  relevant experience.     Employee recruitment,  training and promotion  records are kept up-  to- date.   Training is offered  to all staff.   A multi â€“  cultural and  multi-talented  team.    Future Aim:  Leading by example, we will continue to encourage our  suppliers to adopt the same non discriminatory policies.         Page 12 of 15    ENVIRONMENT      Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach  to environmental challenges.     We try to establish whether more environmentally friendly options  regarding manufacturing, are available throughout the supply chain.       Company Current  Policies    Actions  Outcome   Consideration of the  impact of freight on  the environment.   We continue to push  for clients to organise  their required  purchases as early as  possible in order to  benefit from both cost  and environment  saving transportation  methods i.e. sea not  air     Again this year the  company will send out  Christmas e-cards,  not only does this  save on paper, but  the money saved in  the process will be  donated to charity.       Preservation  of the  environment  is a key driver  in our quest  to discourage  the use or air  transport  unless  absolutely  necessary  Future Aims: Continue to improve the sea-freight services we can offer our  clients               Page 13 of 15      Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote  greater environmental responsibility.    LGS continuously strives to be more conscious of its environmental  responsibility. We are continually looking for further ways to increase  energy efficiency and to promote environmentally friendly practices.       Company Current  Policies    Actions  Outcome   Communicating  with supplies to  try and achieve  better  environmental  performance.     Promote  environmentally  friendly practices  within the office.      Where possible, use  cleaner production  processes and source  closer to the delivery  destination.     Aim to recycle  kitchen waste where  possible.     Re-using paper which  has only been partly  used.     Improved  productivity  of resources.     Reduction in  office waste.  Future Aims: To continue to promote environmentally friendly practices.          Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and  diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.

Environmentally  friendly  practices.  Future Aims: Continue to improve our technology.
