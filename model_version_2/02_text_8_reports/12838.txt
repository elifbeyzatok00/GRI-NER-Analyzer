Celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of our establishment, we at  Korea Airports Corporation set up the Vision 2020 corporate  vision. This is to move beyond the achievements made for the last  thirty years and to advance into a world-class airports corporation. World-Class Airports Corporation Creating Biz & Life!  We will create customer values through sustainability  management, fulll the roles higher than expected for  an airports corporation, and carry out the economic,  social, and environmental responsibilities for all our  stakeholders.  FOCUS ON _ 01 Committed to Customer Fulllment,  Condence, and Happiness - Airports can be the start of an exciting journey for one person,  a perfect place to work or relax for someone else, and a combination of  exciting shopping and cultural experiences for another. - With Gimpo Airport already named the worlds best facility in its  class in terms of airport service quality by Airports Council International  in 2010, KACs reputation as a company that is committed to the highest  possible level of service and comfort has never been more secure.  Creating Green Values and  Caring for Nature FOCUS ON _ 02 - KAC is committed to protecting the earth and its environment for  the enjoyment of future generations. For this, we do our utmost to ensure  that our operations are environmentally sustainable. - This includes the creation of a Low Carbon Green Airport vision,  the publication of Koreas rst-ever carbon report by a public corporation,  dramatic reductions in the volume of airplane noise, and energy  conservation activities designed to deal positively and proactively with the  problem of climate change.  FOCUS ON _ 03 Flying higher with a Forward-Looking Vision  Based on Constantly-Advancing Technologies - KACs exports of aviation equipment to the whole world  and technology-based professional consulting services are a clear  demonstration of our technological excellence. - As our R&D business expands and strengthens, the future value  of KAC will increase exponentially.  CEO MESSAGE Growing into a  World-Class Airports  Corporation Creating Biz & Life  through our Vision 2020 corporate vision  Dear KAC Stakeholders: First of all, I would like to thank you for your unwavering support and encouragement. Korea Airports Corporation operates  fourteen airports across Korea, as well as an Area Control Center and ten VHF omni-directional air navigation systems. In  addition, we fulll our role as one of the countrys leading public corporations by carrying out our social responsibilities and  earning the trust and respect of all the members of our society. The year 2010 was especially meaningful for KAC, since it marked the thirtieth anniversary of our establishment. We also  faced some very demanding business conditions. They included continuing growth in the international aviation market, the  expansion of the Korea Train Express (KTX), and erce competition among airport operators. Our employees responded to  these challenges by developing a wide range of customer-oriented services, pursuing a number of high-value R&D projects,  improving the companys brand image, and enhancing the efficiency of our operations. Since we recently added non- aeronautical, overseas-based projects to our business portfolio, we took another important step by announcing our VISION  2020 to create a springboard for further growth. This is KACs third sustainability report. It outlines our vision of becoming a World-Class Airports Corporation Creating Biz &  Life, as well as our determination to continue practicing sustainability management. In accordance with the ten principles  08  of the United Nations Global Compact, we carried out activities for sustainability management in the areas of the economy,  society, and the environment in 2010, and accomplished certain results. The purpose of this report is to disclose those  activities and announce those results. One of the companys primary goals is to improve the operational efciency of its airports and contribute to the public good.  We do this by supporting the central governments policies for enhancing the financial soundness of the countrys public  institutions. This includes implementing operating strategies that are custom-tailored to the circumstances of each of our  airports, putting programs in place to reinvigorate the economies of the areas in which we operate, and supporting and  encouraging the development of low-cost carriers. In addition, we are leveraging our technological advances in the eld of  aviation R&D and our successful forays into foreign markets to continue diversifying our business portfolio and create future  growth engines. Given the publics growing interest in and demand for the practice of corporate social responsibilities, it is imperative that we  establish closer communications channels with all of our stakeholders. In 2010, one of our overriding goals was to operate our  airports in ways that met the real needs of air travelers and companies. This, in turn, allowed us to strengthen our customer  satisfaction management system. In terms of social contribution activities, we focused on ameliorating the damage caused by  aircraft noise and assisting low-income families who were suffering from it. We also helped members of multicultural families  residing in the country to visit their home countries.  Last winter, Korea experienced unprecedentedly cold weather and heavy snowfalls. Many people believe that this is proof  positive of the damage being inicted on our planet by climate change. Luckily for us, the Korean government had already  announced Green Growth as its new national vision, and both public corporations and private enterprises had joined  in the campaign. In line with this, KAC set its environmental vision as becoming a Low Carbon Green Airport. The vision  includes three strategies: practicing green management, becoming increasingly environmentally friendly, and enhancing  our relationships with local communities. In addition, we became the very first public corporation in Korea to publish a  carbon report. Some of the other environmental initiatives that we undertook include the Green Footprints program, which  encourages our employees to alter their daily work habits to reduce energy use, our collaboration with airlines and related  institutions through the Green Partnership Consultative Group, and the creation of a carbon-neutral forest. Airports are no longer just places where travelers wait for their ights to be called. Instead, they are being transformed into  venues in which we can carry on with our work, have fun, take a rest, and even go shopping. In short, they have evolved into  multi-functional areas for work and leisure activities and cultural events. KACs goal is to meet the challenge of satisfying the  needs of a multitude of stakeholders. We will do this by constantly changing and innovating to embrace the future. As always,  I look forward to your continuing support and encouragement. Thank  you. July 2011 President and CEO of Korea Airports Corporation 09 KOREA AIRPORTS CORPORATION 2011 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   Materiality Test KAC developed the structure of this report after analyzing and prioritizing issues of interest to its stakeholders in  various areas that constitute sustainability management.

How relevant are they to our vision and strategies?  How relevant are they to the industry to which we belong? ALIGN WITH CORP STRATEGY  Do they have a social impact?        Is effective implementation possible?  Do they have a long-term impact?   How effective is our investment in them?  COMMERCIAL / SOCIAL IMPACT DIFFERENTIATION  Are they helpful in differentiating ourselves from our competitors?   Are they helpful in leveraging our core competencies? Identifying Major Issues KAC identified major issues regarding its sustainability management activities by analyzing  both its internal and external environments. We then prioritized the issues according to their  significance and relevance to our overall sustainability management goals. Sustainability Issue Pool Prioritization ISSUE RELEVANCE   Financial influences, the results of KACs  management policies, the status of similar  businesses, and social issues were also  considered.   The influence of KACs organizational  behavior was also analyzed. SIGNIFICANCE   The impact of sustainability management- related issues on the organizations  decision-making and management activities  was taken into account. Media Research Industry Trends Global Standards KAC Vision Overseas BM Stakeholder Analysis  After developing this pool, KAC identified its key stakeholders by considering their  impact on all aspects of its operations–including its short-term financial results, core  competencies, and governmental regulations. Media Research - Media coverage, both in Korea  and abroad, was analyzed in  four different areas: general,  the economy, society, and the  environment. This allowed us to  understand the level of media  exposure that our sustainability  management activities enjoyed,  and assisted us in developing a list  of important stakeholder issues. Industry Trends - Major issues were also identified  from studies of local and overseas  sustainability management  programs--especially those being  carried out by leading international  airport corporations. Global Standards - We also took recent changes in  global standards and guidelines  (including the United Nations  Global Compact, ISO 26000, and  GRI G3) and other relevant issues  into consideration. KAC Vision - KACs management vision,  strategies, and goals were  analyzed to assist in the  development of major issues. Overseas Business Models - Up-to-date developments and  issues relating to sustainability  management were reflected  through in-depth analyses  of leading overseas airport  corporations.

In  addition to being an integral part of the companys overall Vision 2020 campaign,  they were designed to speed our evolution into a world-class airports corporation  creating higher-than-expected customer values. One of our main objectives is to  Realize Enhanced Customer Impressions through partnerships with a number of  our stakeholders, including airlines, our commercial tenants and contractors, and  organizations situated within the airports premises. KAC abides by all customer- related laws and regulations in such areas as PR and marketing, the protection  of confidential customer data, and safety and health.

When I have to go on a business trip away  from the big cities, I always travel by air. Even though theyre a little more expensive than  other transportation modes, airplanes save me time. Thats why I use them. One thing that I really like about Gimpo Airport (also known as the Biz-Port) is that I can  book and print out my tickets at home on the Internet. Its simple, easy, and convenient.  Unfortunately, a lot of other yers dont do this because they dont know about it. If it really wants to become Biz-Port serving Northeastern Asia, Gimpo needs to operate  more ights. Its greatest advantages are its fast and convenient check-in and immigration  procedures and its easy accessibility. But I cant fully enjoy these benets, since it doesnt  operate enough ights. If it keeps investing in advanced services, Gimpo will keep attracting  more and more tourists and businessmen and grow into Northeastern Asias leading air  travel facility.

By using it, passengers with access to the Internet can make reservations  and print out their boarding passes at home. Instead of checking in at a service  counter, they can now board flights using their home-printed boarding pass. Put  into full service in July 2010, the system is now being used by passengers taking  domestic flights operated by six airlines at all fourteen of our airports. As of July  2010, the average passengers waiting and boarding time was shortened by 2  minutes and 4 seconds. In addition, the maximum waiting and boarding time was  reduced by 20 minutes and 8 seconds. The objective of KACs u-Airport project is to automate all of its airport services,  providing customers with speedier and more accurate boarding services and  allowing it to start making further inroads into overseas markets. In 2010, after our  u-Airport technologies had been installed in all our airports, our service utilization  rate reached 70%. By 2012, as the system becomes more refined, we expect it to  reach 90%.

All customer responses are entered into a safe and secure  database. In 2010, the system was rened to deal with customers needs in a speedier and more accurate manner, allowing KAC to  provide world-class service at every customer contact point. VOC Analysis and Management Process KAC has also introduced a VOC service enhance- ment program to facilitate and improve the use of  customer information collected through the sys- tem. It enhances the companys ability to utilize  its capabilities to the fullest by moving away from  the manual use of the system.

Continued to manage areas where complaints were raised through VOC,  or where monitoring was not sufficient: Company-based trainers studied  contact points and conducted further training. In addition, the assessment  system for our business partners was improved (Service Level Agreement  was introduced, and other measures were taken).   Assigned innovation TF activities to business partners employees: This  helped to enhance their customer response service levels. Complaints Regarding Parking Facilities   Built additional parking facilities to tackle parking shortages: A new  car park building for domestic flight passengers was built at Gimpo  International Airport.   Enhanced efficiency of parking facilities by establishing an intelligent  parking management system.   Added extra cameras to help resolve disputes when complaints about  parking-related issues arise, such as damaged vehicles. Illegal Taxi and Other Public Transportation Activities   This problem has been under management since it was named as a key  VOC issue in December 2009: Crackdowns are conducted on a regular  basis, and extra equipment has been bought to help deal with it.   Installed 18 CCTVs to record illegal actions and made warning  announcements.

Second-Hand Smoke (Gimpo and Gimhae Airports)   Expanded and improved smoking areas - Outdoor smoking areas were  added at Gimpo Airport, raising the total to 11 - Cigarette smoke detectors  were installed at 12 sites, and will be installed at all our airports in 2011.   Designated 27 sites (including bus stops, which are the butt of the most  smoking-related complaints) as non-smoking areas. Complaints about Commercial Tenants Services and Prices   Improved customer satisfaction survey of commercial facilities and  strengthened incentives and penalties ( Offered rewards for best- practice tenants and reflected their performance when renewing  contracts. Enhanced rewards system and required people who were  complained about to undergo further customer service training).   Implemented best practices accreditation scheme and conducted PR  and marketing events.

My name is Autumn Garrett. Im working as a middle school teacher in Yongin-si. Ive  traveled around the world and used lots of international airports, but the airport services in  Korea are especially outstanding. Clean and convenient facilities, kind and professional staff,  and easy signboards (which are critical for foreigners) are some of the best things about them.  However, there is one small thing that needs improvement. Compared to Japanese or  Taiwanese airports, the information desks here seem a bit understaffed, especially around  the baggage claim and entry areas. When I was at an airport a while ago, I looked around  for someone to help me, but it was difficult to find anyone. I hope there will soon be more personnel available to help travelers, and especially  international flyers. Another suggestion is to offer courtesy phones for tourists who dont  have a cell phone that works in Korea or enough Korean money to borrow one.

After developing a wide range of service standards in 2005, the company went on to revamp its service manual, began  monitoring its service providers, and strengthened its customer response quality management processes. Other improvements are  being made on a continuing basis. Improving the Customer Charter and Enhancing Service Performance Standards KACs commitment to customer service is reected in its Customer Charter. In addition, its service implementation standard management  index was increased to 32 items (15 measurable, 17 non-measurable) per airport. Performance results are evaluated semi-annually. The  results can be viewed on KACs homepage or through public institution disclosures. Managing the Quality of Personalized Services KAC provides high-quality service at all its customer contact points. This includes on-site CS training to strengthen its employees  CS mindsets and remind them to always behave courteously. The company also carries out regular monitoring activities, using a  checklist it developed to ensure total objectivity. These efforts to provide the ultimate in personalized customer service will continue  going forward. CS Training Using Real-World Examples  KAC shares customer complaints and the results of its monitoring activities with employees who are responsible for CS training  and includes them in its service manual. Analyzing real-world examples from the customers point of view plays an important role in  enhancing the skill sets of employees working at customer contact points.

Self-Survey of Customer Satisfaction (KAC-CSI) I often fly to and from Japan on business. For me, Gimpo Airport is a workplace as well as a  travel facility, because I have to deal with my business for about an hour every time I visit it. There are so many time-saving services at this airport! Gimpo really provides me with an  optimal working environment. However, I would like to see even more meeting rooms with  all the necessary facilities and equipment, at the same reasonable prices as now. This is  important to me, because I often have meetings there with busy foreign businessmen who  are time-conscious too. The airports design and facilities are excellent, and its staff members are wonderfully kind. I  remember one of them carrying a big, heavy-looking bag for a student. While carrying it, he  said This bag is full of books. You must be a student studying overseas. I saw his kindness,  and was touched by his commitment to his work and helping people.  I think that it would be a good idea to show a short video clip at Gimpo and the countrys  other regional airports detailing KACs sustainability management programs and  performances, so that both local and foreign visitors can see them. If everyone can see how  hard KAC is working to reduce costs and energy use, they will be able to understand and  support its sustainability management practices much more easily.

According to Koreas Aviation and Railway Accident  Investigation Board, the company was not responsible for any aviation accidents during the past ve years. We are committed to  ensuring that our security and safety programs are able to continue this proud record. Results of Universal Safety Oversight Audit of  Countries with Major Airports – International  Standards Compliance Rate  Number of Comments by Government Inspectors  Enhancing Airport Safety  KAC is committed to safe ights and secure airports. In 2008, for example, we recorded an international airport safety standards  compliance rate of 99.73%--the best in the world. To ensure that we will continue to maintain that level, we carry out a broad range  of systematic and comprehensive ight safety and airport security management processes. As a result, the number of comments by  Korean government inspectors regarding our level of safety and security decreased by 18% from a year ago. International standards  compliance rate is assessed once every six years. Ensuring Safety through Airport  Classication System  Enhancing Air Safety by Revising Airport  Operating Regulations  The introduction of the airport classification system means that our inspections of  take-off and landing facilities, measurements of runway friction, and rubber elimination  cycle standards can be applied differently depending on the airport being studied.  Before this, the standard was applied universally, regardless of the number of ights.  This change has allowed us to enhance our operational efciencies dramatically. We apply international airport management standards to all our facilities, including  those that only handle domestic flights. This enhances our safety and security  operations considerably.

Number of Bird Strikes  Bird Deterrence Methods Participation by Airport Employees in Safety Management System (SMS) KAC has established a voluntary and confidential reporting system to enhance communications with  airport personnel regarding safety-related issues. This allows us to review our safety requirements  and make quick and effective corrective measures. The system facilitates the voluntary reporting of  potential risk factors by ensuring that the people making the reports are not penalized for their actions.  In that sense, the characteristics of the system are voluntary nature, confidentiality, and immunity.  Reports can be made both online (on our homepage) and offline, by phone, fax, or mail. In addition, near- accidents and instances of obstacles to aviation safety are reported according to Articles 8 and 8-2 of  the Enforcement Rule of The Aviation Act. Risk assessments and reduction measures are carried out  according to our risk reporting procedures. 2008 2009 2010 55 70 55 Establishing a 3D Obstacle Management System   Our fully-computerized, 3D Obstacle Management System allows us to determine whether any of our structures located within height  restriction zones surrounding our airports violate height limitations. We built it to eliminate factors that may cause risks to aircraft  flying near our airports. In 2010, we made five improvements to the system, including adding an instrument that clearly shows the  distance between an airplane and an obstacle.

In 2010, the economic performance of our non-aeronautical business area improved  steadily, thanks to the growing revenue from renting buildings at Gimhae, Jeju, and  other regional airports. Increases in the market share of low-cost carriers, a rise in  the number of passengers taking Jeju-bound flights, and economic recoveries in  neighboring countries such as China led to a rise in passengers, flights, and cargo  volume. These factors resulted in greater prots from our variable rents, augmenting  both our revenue and our net income.

KOREA AIRPORTS CORPORATION 2011 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  C H A N G E  Turning Gimpo Airport into Northeast Asias Biz-Port    After the bulk of its international routes were taken over by Incheon International Airport (IAA) when it opened in 2001, there were  growing calls for Gimpo Airport to brand itself as the airport that provided travelers with the easiest and most convenient access  to Seoul. It was also argued that this change would add to Koreas national competitiveness. In response, we adopted a Biz-Port  strategy of providing flights that are custom-tailored to meet the needs of business travelers. This included adding a new route  between Gimpo and Beijing, and increasing the number of ights to Japan. In addition to pressing for the deregulation of even more  international routes, we have maximized the use of the airport by revamping its interior to provide our customers with enhanced  shopping and leisure opportunities. Reinvigorating Regional Airports to Further Balanced National Development Strengths of Gimpo Airport  Status of Operational Routes and Passenger Numbers at Gimpo Airport  easily access both subway line 9 and the IIA railway.  been shortened dramatically.

Category Results in 2010 Operational Routes 11 Numbers of Passengers 14,405,000 Numbers of International Passengers  3,161,000   3,163 Advantages of the Gimpo-Beijing Route Regular ights between Gimpo and Beijing will be operated four times a day starting in July 2011. This new route will greatly enhance the convenience of business  travelers ying between Beijing and Seoul, and also make it easier for Chinese tourists to come to Korea. In addition, it will save travelers 50-60 minutes in time  and KRW 5,000-56,000 in costs compared to similar ights to or from IAA. KACs ultimate goal is to reinvent Gimpo Airport as a true Biz-Port by developing a  Korea-China-Japan One-Day Life-Sphere service that will make it possible to travel between Seoul, Beijing, and Tokyo in one day. Named Worlds Most Efcient Mid-Sized Airport  In July 2010, the Air Transport Research Society named Gimpo the worlds most efficient mid- sized airport, praising it for achieving remarkable growth by opening air routes to major cities in  Northeastern Asia and operating specialized commercial services through its Biz-Port project. We  also came first in an Airport Service Quality (ASQ) survey examining the level of operations and  services that airports offer. Gimpo Airport received 4.53 points out of a possible 5. CHANGE 42 REINVIGORATING REGIONAL AIRPORTS  Reinvigorating Regional Airports           KAC operates fourteen airports, but only those in Gimpo, Gimhae, and Jeju have been able to operate profitably since their  establishment. This is mainly due to fundamental constraints to creating demand, such as small populations, a poor tourism  infrastructure, short flight distances, and high fixed costs. In 2010, KAC developed a regional airports reinvigoration strategy to  strengthen their primary role as airports and their secondary function as publicly-owned institutions. The strategy was put into action  through a number of support projects custom-tailored to reflect the characteristics of each facility. They included reducing costs,  adding to the number of international routes and enhancing domestic ones, revising the countrys air transport licensing policy to  attract more low-cost carriers, reducing the fees paid for the use of airport facilities, and adding more aviation support equipment. Improvements to the Operations of Regional Airports in 2010 KAC is striving to upgrade the operations of its regional airports and revitalize local economies. Regional Airports Public Functions Enhancing Profitability Overhaul the air transport system, increase the  number of routes, augment profits from non- aeronautical activities, and readjust legal and  institutional infrastructures Improving Efficiency Increase operating efficiencies through  organizational restructuring: enhance operational  efficiencies, strengthen core functions, and  revamp other functions Adding to Public Value Develop airports special values and positive  impacts, and rationalize operations to increase  public value Gimpo/ Gimhae/Jeju  Cheongju/ Muan/Gunsan/ Yeosu/Pohang/ Ulsan/Daegu/ Gwangju  Yangyang/ Wonju/ Sacheon  KAC focused on  efforts to develop  them into Koreas  3 main domestic  airports. KAC introduced  a wide range of  support programs. KAC provided  additional supports  for areas with  underdeveloped  transportation  networks. Important National Facilities  Regional airports function as strategic facilities for national security, fill in for other nearby airports in  emergencies, and lead industrial progress and growth in science and technology; The Economy  Boost investments in areas around airports, create jobs that will benefit local economies, contribute to the  invigoration of local economies through the diversification of their industrial structures; Society and Culture Promote cultural exchanges both at home and abroad, provide rescue equipment during disasters, and  attract tourists and perform public relations functions for provinces and regions; and Transportation Methods Facilitate development of other modes of transportation and raise productivity by saving peoples time.  Main Results in 2010 KACs Efforts to Revamp Regional Airports Functions Merging Gwangju and Muan Airports The separate operations of airports in Gwangju and Muan are causing inefficiencies. To  tackle this problem and boost regional airports in the process, we are closely working with  the Korean Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs. By encouraging the relevant  local governments to reach an agreement, we will complete the merger by the time when  the Honam Line of Korea Train Express goes into service.

KACs Commitment to Joint Growth with Low-Cost Carriers (LCCs) As part of KACs mid- to long-term management strategy, a wide variety of supports will be provided to assist the growth of low- cost carriers. They include lowering the standards for opening international routes so that they can compete more easily against the  Korea Train Express (KTX). In addition, we have been working to develop niche routes serviced by small aircraft in an effort to operate  airplanes with the number of seats appropriate for the demand of each airport. Preparing for the Second-Stage Launch of KTX  KAC established an airport promotion plan in February  2010 to minimize the effect of reduced demand for  aviation services following the second-stage launch  of KTX.

Local airports are necessary to develop local economies, but their infrastructure is  insufficient, and consumer demand is too low. Thats why their rate of utilization is so small.  In addition, its too expensive for budget airlines to use or rent airport facilities, making it  difficult to maintain and develop local lines. In order to attract foreign tourists and increase  demand, budget airlines should be given incentives so that they can use local airports more  aggressively. Im suggesting this because then budget airlines could have a competitive  edge in using local airports, based on the nature of their business. We offer essential  services at reasonable prices. In sum, KAC needs to hurry up and start offering special  incentives to low-cost carriers like ours. Young-wook Kim, Director, Eastar Jet Relationship between Air Transport Business and New Growth Engines  Importance of Non-Aeronautical, For-Profit Businesses In line with the International Civil Aviation Organizations (ICAO) recommendation to recognize the importance of non-aeronautical, for- profit businesses, KAC is establishing strategies to encourage their development by benchmarking best practices at overseas airports. Creating New Growth Engines for Non-Aeronautical, For-Profit Businesses Ratio of Aeronautical/Non-Aeronautical Proceeds in 2010 (Unit: KRW 100 Million) Enhance Non-Aeronautical Profits Ease burdens on airlines and airport users by limiting increases in airport facilities user fees. Increase Demand for Aviation Services Contribute to the growth of non-aeronautical business profits, including rental income. ICAO Recommendations The ICAO policy on user fees stresses the impor- tance of non-aeronautical, for-profit businesses,  and recommends the development of a wide range  of these income sources. The policy excludes  licenses that are directly related to aeronautical  services, such as fueling, in-flight meals, and on- the-ground services.

This is being achieved through a positioning strategy  initiated by each airport. The strategy includes establishing differentiated  concessions management structures and holding cultural events. Property Development and Rental Business - As part of its strategy of diversifying its revenue sources through new  business opportunities, KAC is developing the areas around its airports.  Some examples include a multi-complex area called Sky Park and public  golf courses. R&D Business - KAC is also securing intellectual property rights in related business areas  through steady R&D efforts into aviation safety equipment. It is working  to either sell or receive royalties from them by strengthening its overseas  marketing activities. This includes participating in international exhibitions. Overseas Airport Development Projects - KAC has set a goal of winning 28 overseas airport development projects by  2020. This will allow it to raise its brand image and lay the groundwork for  becoming a truly global airports corporation. KACs Commitment to a Vigorous R&D  Business  KAC has set a goal of increasing the ratio  of its R&D business to its total revenue from  0.6% in 2010 to 14% by 2020.

Another of its goals is to produce equipment with independently  developed technologies that can be used in place of imported goods. The companys  ultimate goal is to establish itself as a global top 3 player in this business area. R&D Status The R&D Center has sold aviation safety equipment to twelve countries, including  Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. This demonstrates the high quality and cost  competitiveness of our products. 1,973 27 Establishing an R&D Master Plan Augmenting Aviation R&D Increasing Profits from R&D Developments Strengthening R&D Infrastructure Revenue (KRW 100 Million) Number of Aviation Equipment Developments (Total) Short-term (by 2013) Mid-term (by 2017) Long-term (by 2020) 182 12 1,089 21 Goals Implementation Tasks Winning Overseas Airport Projects Colombia As of 2010, KAC had been awarded consulting projects at six airports in Colombia.

The fixed  annual revenue from these projects, which will extend for fifteen years from  December 2010, is expected to reach KRW 4 billion. The Philippines  KAC is currently carrying out an operation & management (O&M) project at Clark  International Airport in the Philippines. A memorandum of agreement was signed in  2010 for designing airport facilities and operating the airport terminal for thirty years.  Total profits from the projects are estimated to be in excess of KRW 5 billion. The  main contract is scheduled to be signed in the first half of 2011.

In order to make good use of  these assets, a three-stage development plan was established. The first-stage  development, which was completed in 2004, turned the once-idle terminal into a  complex of shopping spaces, theaters, and convention facilities. When the second- stage development project ends this year, a hotel, theme park, and department  store will appear. The third, outer area, which is scheduled for completed in 2014  will feature community gymnastics facilities and golf courses. Once the project is  completed, its annual revenue is expected to reach about KRW 50 billion. The R&D Center and its accumulated technological expertise play a significant role in  KACs business success. For example, we are aimed at representing 20% of the companys  revenue by 2020. We export facilities, provide consulting services, and offer facilities grants  and other forms of aid. The R&D Center has immense potential. Our primary goal is to maximize efciencies and  reduce operating costs at the fourteen airports that KAC currently runs. The proof of our  success lies in the extremely positive way that KAC is received both at home and abroad,  heightening our brand value in the process. One obvious result of this was winning an  airport consulting order from the country of Colombia. We export aviation safety equipment that is based on our very own independently- developed, highly-advanced information technologies. The excellence of this equipment  is recognized globally, even though most of it is only two years old. This success is due  to KACs organizational stability as a public enterprise, as well as our superb information  technologies. We want to hold 15% of the worlds aviation industry market for safety  equipment by 2020. To accomplish this goal, were putting immense efforts into R&D. The R&D Center was only established three years ago, but our number of employees is  increasing rapidly. Sometimes decisions have to be made in a hurry; thats the nature of  the business. Thats why the center needs to have an independent business structure that  will allow it to respond to rapidly changing situations and enable fast decision-making.  Such a change in our business structure would also supplement, and even strengthen,  communication channels with stakeholders which are currently a bit insufficient. R&D  investment takes time to produce results. Given this, I hope our stakeholders will continue  to support and invest in the center from a longer-term perspective.

This laid the foundation for its further GHG reduction  activities. Information on GHG emissions from our airports across the nation is given in  the form of statistical data to ensure its objectivity and reliability. Our reduction target  has been set at 0.7%, which will bring us to our 2005 level by 2015, the equivalent of a  9.8% reduction on a BAU basis. Because energy management is a critical component of  its overall management activities, KAC operates an Energy Management System (EMS)  and an internal management unit that are tasked with GHG-related issues.

For example, our use of high-efciency equipment has resulted in less energy use  and fewer GHG emissions. We are also conducting R&D activities into a wide variety  of green technologies, including an aireld LED lighting system. KAC introduced its first carbon report in 2010, containing information on its GHS  emissions volumes, the measures it is taking to reduce them, and related activities.  New issues of the report will be published on a regular basis. We are also hoping to  collaborate with other airports and institutions through information exchanges and  the establishment of a Green Partnership Consultative Group. We also signed an  agreement with the Korea Forest Service to carry out a pilot carbon-offset forest  project. It will be the rst one in the country. Developing Low-Power Aviation Safety Equipment The independent development of aviation safety equipment offers KAC both  technological advantages and export opportunities. It also contributes to our  campaign to realize a green airport. Green Building Project KAC is working to develop green buildings that use less energy and emit fewer  greenhouse gases. One of them is part of the Sky Park project for the revitalization  of Gimpo Airport, whose terminal will be turned into an environmentally friendly  meeting and travel space by 2014. In addition, eco-friendly, high-efciency equipment  will be installed at Jeju Airport as part of the expansion of its international terminal.  This latter facility took many other steps toward becoming a green airport between  2009 and 2010, installing solar PV and geothermal systems and using high-efciency  pumps, environmentally friendly insulation materials, and recycled materials.

Airlines, commercial tenants, and on-site government agencies can claim these  rewards by converting their savings in electricity use into GHG reductions. Our goal in establishing a carbon-neutral forest is to work with local communities  to offset CO2 emissions. We began the program in collaboration with the Gangseo- gu Municipal Office, which administers the area that Gimpo Airport is located in. In  addition to providing us with a way of contributing to the larger society, it adds to  our standing as a caring and concerned corporate citizen. The memorandum of understanding between KAC and the local administrative office  includes details about the forests maintenance, funding, volunteer work, and public  relations activities. KAC will provide KRW 50 million annually for three years to assist  in its development, while the Gangseo-gu Office will choose a site and carry out  repair and maintenance work. In 2010, KAC planted 1,679 trees, worth KRW 50 million.

We set up a Green Partnership Consultative Group in 2009 to achieve this goal. The group consists of twenty-eight KAC team leaders and junior employees  responsible for dealing with GHG issues, along with representatives of eleven  airlines and on-site agencies. They meet every two months to discuss such issues  as joint responses to the governments low carbon policy, mutual support for CO2  reduction activities, and their GHG emissions reduction goals. Other topics that they  deal with include other ways of acting together, methods for reducing emissions,  the operation of the Aircraft Ground Power System (ACGPS), and replacing airport  vehicles with eco-friendly ones. Launching Ceremony of Green Partnership Consultative Group LOW CARBON GREEN MANAGEMENT CHANGE Aircraft now account for 3.5% of human activities affecting climate change, and the report  of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicates that this gure will reach from  5 to 15% by the year 2050. Since air travel is on the rise everywhere, the aviation industry  is experiencing correspondingly rapid growth. As a result, almost all of the airports around  the world are pursuing greater prots, while also attempting to minimize their environmental  impacts. This is why KACs vision of becoming a Low Carbon, Green Airport is so timely  and appropriate. I am very impressed to see how deeply KACs management is committed to  that vision. Thats why KAC received the highest prize at the LOHAS Management Awards  2010 in the service, nance, and distribution category from the Climate Change Center of  the Korea Green Foundation. A further proof of this commitment is the publication of this  sustainability report. One suggestion that Id like to make is to use specic gures for the previous years target,  results versus targets, and the next years targets to express this commitment more clearly.  If data on KACs greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption levels, water resources  management, and other subjects contained in this report were to be supplemented with  easy-to-understand gures, the places where the company has done well and has faltered  would show up more obviously. Then new measures and plans could be set up accordingly. In order to realize its vision of becoming a Low Carbon, Green Airport, KAC needs to  establish strategic relationships with all its business partners. The Green Partnership joint  consultative body that the company set up in 2009 is a good start at this. However, further  progress needs to be made in this area to achieve lasting results. Working with other major  stakeholders, including NGOs and research institutes that deal with climate change issues,  would be another good way of making new approaches to KACs sustainable development  activities. So-hee Kim, Director, Climate Change Center, Korea Green Foundation  52  Establishing a Competency-Based Human Resources Development System  KAC has established a human resources development system and a medium- to long-term career development roadmap to foster the  growth of value-creating employees who will make significant contributions to its future success. The roadmap is used to assist in the  creation of training courses based on employment position and work sector. We also established a mid- to long-term personnel policy  that dovetails with our Vision 2020 corporate goals. Its purpose is to foster the growth of employees whose expertise and capacity  for innovating and executing will turn our corporate vision into a reality through differentiation, efficiency, and professionalism.  Thanks to these efforts, KAC was awarded the 2010 Management Grand Award for human resources development in the innovation  leadership category by the Korea Management Association Consulting. Improving Personnel Policy through HR Management Reviews Aspects of KACs HR development system that need improving are discussed at workshops. They are based on information and feedback  gained from our employees and outside experts. We held a White-Collar Workers Workshop involving thirty four participants in May  2010 and an HR Insight Workshop in July. Follow-up briefing sessions were held the next August at the Head Office and in Jeju,  Gwangju, Gimpo, and Busan. These gave our employees an advance opportunity to learn about changes to our personnel policy.

This ensured  the efcacy of our educational and training programs by establishing a competency model-based HRD process that is custom-tailored  to meet our specic needs. In 2010, we offered courses that were designed to increase our employees knowledge of our core values  and vision, and stopped offering ones that were deemed to be inefcient and/or ineffective on a cost/benet basis. The courses were  ran more than four times. Establishing a Competency-Based e-HRD System Number of Employees Completing Education and Training Courses      In-house Training     External Training     Cyber Education Our rst goal was to identify specic training needs and requirements. To accomplish this, basic and necessary company-wide skills  were segmented into three divisions through the use of competency modeling. This was followed by the creation of a competency  pool, enabling us to identify specic factors that accompany each skill. We also carried out a survey of our working-level divisions to  determine our training needs on an organizational basis, and conducted skills evaluations with individual employees to identify them  at the worker level. Following that, educational and training courses were offered to enhance unsatisfactory skills sets.  We also determined that our career development policy needed to be revamped. As part of that process, we surveyed our employees  to determine what training methods and processes they would prefer.  2,129 1,171 341 2,965 1,032 337 2009 Total 4,334 2010 Total 3,641 As-IS (Program-centered) To-Be (Competency-centered) Level-specic education and  training Functions-based education and  training Functions-specic education and  training Special education Value-oriented Competencies  (Functions-based education  and training) Relation-oriented Competencies (Level-specic education and  training) Function-oriented Competencies (Functions-specic education  and training and special  education) HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT Workshop of Community Service Group Leaders Workshop of Employees in Charge of Each Section of  Code of Conduct CHANGE 54  INTERVIEW  WITH  STAKEHOLDER  Fostering the Development of Globally-Oriented Employees     From September to December 2010, KAC operated a simulation program in which the participants took on an imaginary project. The  goal of the exercise was to raise the competency levels of employees who will be involved in overseas projects in the future. Thirty- nine trainees were assigned to build and operate an imaginary airport with similar conditions (such as geographical location and  size) to those that the company is targeting for possible overseas management projects. The goal of the program was to enhance the  participants problem-solving abilities. We also provide a variety of other supports for fostering globally-oriented leaders, including  enrolling them in overseas MA and MBA programs, overseas training opportunities, and personnel exchanges with overseas airports. Results of Competency-Enhancement Training for White-Collar Workers       Attainment of Basic Competencies (Unit: People)     Skills Reinforcement (Unit: People)     Additional Development of Global Skills (Unit: People) KACs Customer Service Team members meet people who come to its airports. I believe that  enhanced customer support is a primary basis for realizing KACs Vision 2020. Thats why  our team is constantly thinking up new ways to meet the diverse needs of our customers.  For example, we responded to requests to deal with the problem of second-hand smoke at  bus stops by initiating a non-smoking campaign and installing smoke detectors around our  airports. However, KAC doesnt have a company-wide policy or proper incentives to encourage more  actions like this. If we had a corporate culture that stressed the importance of employee- led thinking about issues like these, Im sure that our workers would come up with a host of  interesting and workable ideas.  In addition, while KAC is committed to hiring more women, female employees still represent  less than 10% of the total workforce. If we truly want to increase the number of women  working here, we need to implement systematic training programs that can help female  employees strengthen their skills sets and keep them motivated.

This resulted in  a wage freeze, a radically restructured employee benets program, and reduced paid leaves. In 2009, we were the rst Korean public  enterprise to impose wage cuts. In 2010, labor and management signed an employment agreement based on the central governments  recommendations, freezing wages and eliminating special rules for retirement payments. Later on, in response to recommendations  made by the Board of Audit and Inspection in 2010, KAC abolished its paid Foundation Day leave, the ten-day long-service leave for  employees who have been working at KAC for ten years or longer, and long-term leaves for family events. These are all examples of  the efforts that KAC is making to develop harmonious labor-management relations that can overcome economic crises and enhance  management efciency. KAC has now enjoyed disputes-free collective bargaining procedures for twenty-three years in a row.

As of June 2011, 1,023 employees are unionized, representing 61.3% of the total  workforce (non-unionized employees include team leaders of level 2 or above, private police, and personnel engaged in HR, labor  management or auditing or undertaking secretarial duties). Communications with Employees KAC is enhancing its labor-management relationship by sharing  information regarding its management decisions and activities  with its employees and developing communications channels  for advanced labor-management relations. In 2009, we made a  thorough revision of outmoded parts of the collective agreement.  In 2010, additional revisions were made to it, bringing the revision  rate to 100%. Within KAC, there are no work areas in which  freedom of association and collective bargaining are likely to be  critically infringed upon.

To  ensure the complainants privacy, they have been instructed to use only private  email addresses while dealing with employee grievances. CPOs are responsible  for bringing complaints to a conclusion. Typical grievance items include transfers,  promotions, disciplinary actions, sexual harassment, child-rearing benets, worker  seniority, inter-personal disputes, family affairs, policies affecting female employees,  and ofce conicts.

As part of its contract system, KAC obliges its business  partners to sign an integrity agreement when they sign new agreements. Service  level criteria were agreed between KAC and the business partners. Based on them,  performance capability evaluation is conducted and the results are shared.  Efforts to Assist in the Development of Local Communities In order to contribute to the economic development of local communities and assist the growth  of SMEs, KAC joins with local construction companies in development projects worth KRW 5  billion or less. In addition, we specify that tenders for goods and supplies can only be made by  local companies.

In 2009, KAC revised its criteria for selecting its service  providers to ensure that their employees enjoy safe and healthy working conditions.  As a result, several new criteria were added. They include whether the firms pay  adequate wages, abide by all labor laws, give their employees retirement pay, and  provide all the insurance plans mandated by the central government. KAC is striving to enhance the level of its services by operating an integrated service  quality management system in collaboration with on-site agencies and airlines.  Our efforts included in this regard included installing an automated immigration  inspection system, providing customer training courses to on-site agencies  employees, and implementing a One-Pass Boarding system offering travelers faster  and more convenient boarding services. KAC has established a number of monitoring systems to measure the satisfaction  levels of its business partners. They include a survey of their employees satisfaction  level with their work environment and informal meetings with our business partners.  Through a conflict resolution desk, we address their complaints and listen to their  suggestions for improvement.  Business Partner Satisfaction Survey  66.6 points 72.8 points 2009 2010 KACs major partners include business part- ners, on-site agencies, commercial tenants,  and airlines. Commercial tenants using the  companys airport facilities are classified  as rent-paying businesses. They comprise  36% of KACs partners. This is followed by  business partners providing maintenance  and equipment services (at 24%) and on-site  agencies (at 23%). Airlines account for an- other 17%. Working relationships and areas  of support between KAC and its partners are  described below. 59 KOREA AIRPORTS CORPORATION 2011 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   60 SECTION. 04  ORGANIZATION TO RAISE ITS    FULFILL ALL ITS OBLIGATIONS.  61 KOREA AIRPORTS CORPORATION 2011 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  As one of Koreas leading public corporations,  a prominent member of the local communities,  and a caring and concerned corporate citizen  that wishes to play a central role  in conserving the earths environment,  we are working our hardest to make the world  a happier and healthier place for everyone.  KOREA AIRPORTS CORPORATION 2011 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y  Measures to Reduce Noise Levels  Koreas Aircraft Noise Prevention and Noise Prevention Support Act went into effect in September 2010. As a result, KAC began  taking immediate measures to reduce noise levels in areas affected by aircraft operations. Our main goals were to ensure that  people living in districts other than those designated as noise-affected areas did not suffer from aircraft noise, and to lower the  indoor noise level for regions designated for noise abatement measures to below 60 WECPNL. (By point of comparison, the standard  for undertaking noise abatement measures at Narita International Airport in Japan is 65 WECPNL). KAC is committed to reducing  the number of people suffering from aircraft noise, resolving their complaints about it, boosting their well-being and incomes, and  promoting rational land use. We are also taking steps to ensure the effectiveness of our noise reduction activities and provide fair and  equitable supports for noise-affected areas. Our 2010 budget for noise reduction activities was KRW 38 billion. Monitoring Noises In order to minimize noise pollution, KAC is installing an automatic noise measuring system that provides results on a regular basis.  The number of such system in Gimhae Airport will be raised up to three within this year. This will encourage the low-volume operation  of airplanes, and ensure that people living in non-affected areas will not be disrupted by aircraft noise.

This is the highest level of aircraft noise with the number of ights during day,  evening, and night weighted. The advantage of this measurement is that the results are close to the actual level of noise experienced by local residents. 60  WECPNL is equivalent to 65 to 70 dB in the normal listening level, which means there are no problems in studying or watching television.   RESPONSIBILITY 62  INTERVIEW  WITH  STAKEHOLDER  Supports for Areas Suffering from Noise Pollution People living in areas whose noise level was 95WECPNL or above were moved to new places. In addition, KAC has implemented a  wide range of support programs for other areas that are less affected. They include installing soundproofing and cooling facilities in  houses and schools, and offering subsidies for public service broadcasting reception costs. Schools and people who are receiving  public assistance to deal with their basic living costs are provided with cooling systems and subsidies for their electricity costs.

Yangcheon-gu is directly affected by airplane noise from Gimpo Airport; in fact, it accounts  for 78% of all the areas noise problems. We participate in KACs Noise Management  Committee in order to give local residents a voice in its deliberations and decisions. In  2010, we established our own Noise Management Consultation Group to make our thoughts  known more actively.  KAC seems to do its best to reflect the opinions delivered through those channels to the  extent possible. However, tangible results are still insufficient. Therefore, KACs Noise  Management Committee, which only meets twice a year currently, should meet on at least a  quarterly basis. This would allow the publics opinions to be delivered more effectively, and  should result in improvements to the situation. Jin-deok Kang, Team Leader, Clean Environment Department, Yangcheon-gu Office  63 KOREA AIRPORTS CORPORATION 2011 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   INTERVIEW WITH STAKEHOLDER  The Gimpo Airport Noise Management Committee has been representing local residents  for the past fifteen years, and KAC is committed to forging a mutually-beneficial and  cooperative relationship with them. Some of the steps that we have taken include installing  sound-proof windows, providing free meals for the elderly, and operating scholarship  programs. Despite this, the actual work that KAC have done to curtail airplane noise has been  insufficient. Although local residents are suffering both financial losses and physical  damage (such as hearing problems and tinnitus), there are as yet no concrete and practical  solutions in place. Japan has a compensation system to deal with areas that are affected by  aircraft noise, and residents of those areas are entitled compensation without even having  to le a complaint. If we want to establish a fairer and sounder relationship with residents  living near airports in this country, we need to adopt a similar program.  As for KACs social contributions activities, local residents are telling us that they would  like to see more resources channeled into areas that that are more closely related to their  everyday lives. Educational initiatives, such as the provision of textbooks, support for after- school activities, and scholarships would be examples of this.  KAC is also committed to strengthening local economies. Recently, it broke ground to  build public golf courses near Gimpo Airport. Unfortunately, the benets that should ow  from such projects, like more jobs and healthier local economies, arent realized equally  everywhere. Some areas prot from our actions, while others dont. This is another look that  we need to take a closer look at. Kyung-ja Gweon, President, Gimpo Airport Noise Management Committee  Residential Soundproong System  Satisfaction Survey  Job Priority for People Living in Noise  Mitigation Areas During the second half of every year, KAC conducts a survey of about 200  households in areas that are affected by airplane noise. This allows us to gauge the  residents satisfaction levels with their home soundproong facilities. In 2010, 91%  of the respondents said that they were satised or more than satised. KAC gives priority to people living in areas that are affected by noise when  hiring new employees. For example, the Gimpo International Airport Office held  consultations with ve social service organizations operating in noise abatement  areas, and signed a series of Job Creation Compacts with them in May 2009. As a  result, a number of local residents were given jobs as helpers for the disabled or  airport operations assistants. 2008 2009 2010 90% 90% 91% Share of Residents Saying They Were - More Than Satised AIRCRAFT NOISE ABATEMENT RESPONSIBILITY 64  Establishing an Energy Management System Energy controls are an important element of KACs management activities. For example, we have established a company-wide Energy  Management System (EMS) to ensure the systematic use of energy at each of our airports. Its objectives are to set targets and  guidelines for energy savings and to improve the mindsets of all our employees. As part of this process, a wide variety of plans and  practical measures have been put in place throughout the entire organization.

They include  installing new and renewable energy equipment and high-efciency LED lamps, and accessing clean energy sources. In addition, we  signed MOUs with the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs and the Korea Energy Management Corporation to verify our  emissions reductions in accordance with the UNs Convention on Climate Change. We also launched an energy targeting scheme in  accordance with the central governments energy use rationalization policy for public institutions. As a result, we were able to lower  our energy consumption level by 10.5% in 2010.

Our levels of emissions were forecast  on a business as usual (BAU) basis after analyzing the characteristics of each source, and appropriate reductions technologies  were selected following a multi-faceted review. As a result of this process, we set targets based on the anticipated benefits of our  reduction activities. First we divided our airports into three categories: regional main offices, mid-sized airports, and small-sized ones.  Then we reviewed multiple directions for each category, and developed our emissions reduction strategies. In order to cope with climate change in a positive and proactive manner, we set a mid- to long-term target that will constitute a 0.7%  reduction in terms of the 2005 baseline by the year 2015. In 2010, we recorded a 6.4% reduction in direct and indirect emissions on a  BAU basis. Installing New and Renewable Energy Facilities KAC is committed to increasing its use of new and renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic, solar thermal, and geothermal  power. In accordance with our energy optimization plan for indoor facilities, all our employees have pledged themselves to recycling and  saving resources. In addition, our provision of training and guidelines on energy savings and energy efficiency is being strengthened  throughout the organization. We are also taking practical measures to meet the central governments guidelines on energy savings and  emission reductions. In addition to the introduction of a geothermal energy system at Gimpo Airport and Jeju Airport in 2010, we are  planning to install an 8m 2 solar thermal system in the Booan VHF omnidirectional range/tactical air navigation system and a 25kw solar  PV power station at Gimpo Airport. Further steps will be taken to increase the use of green energy in the future.

For example, Green Footprints is a set of changes in everyday workplace habits  that can result in dramatic energy use reductions. All our employees are making  changes in the way they work, such as using their own mugs, turning off office  lighting during lunch-times, turning off computers when theyre not being used,  maintaining moderate office temperatures, and using fewer supplies for special  occasions. Some results are shown in the table below. Results of Energy Savings Type Green Footprints (2009) Green Footprints (2010) Doing Using personal mugs (producing disposable cups costs 11g of  CO2 emissions) Using a fan (this helps to meet the central governments target  of a 10% reduction in energy consumption at public enterprises) Turning Off   usage emits 9,000g of CO2)   usage emits 9,000g of CO2) Maintaining Maintaining moderate office temperatures (above 27 in  summer, below 19 in winter) Using carpools or public transportation Setting the default direction of copy paper in horizontal  direction Using fewer supplies for special occasions (refraining from  using disposable supplies, banners, etc., as well as simplifying  ceremonies) Purchasing high-efficiency products Not wearing ties in summer and wearing innerwear in winter Turning off the tap while brushing teeth Maintaining a moderate office temperature (above 27 in  summer and below 19 in winter) Pooling cars or using public transportation Setting the default direction of copy paper in horizontal  direction Using fewer supplies for special occasions (refraining from  using disposable supplies, banners, etc., as well as simplifying  ceremonies) Purchasing high-efficiency products Not wearing ties in summer and wearing innerwear in winter Saving tap water Banning the use of personal heaters Doing more during work-hours to reduce overtime Using e-documents rather than paper ones  Behavioral Changes Energy Savings Using Personal Mugs 3 each (daily use of paper cups) x 11g of carbon emissions x 1,551 people = 13 tCO2 per year Turning Off Lamps 233KW of electricity consumption x 262 working days x 0.000448 = 27 tCO2 per year Powering Off Standby electricity x 12 hours x number of computers in operation = 80 tCO2 per year ENERGY MANAGEMENT On-Site Inspection into Green Management Practices Green Footprints Poster Promoting the Use of a Fan RESPONSIBILITY 68  Goals of KACs Social Contributions Activities KACs goal is to be a world-class enterprise fulfilling its corporate responsibilities and sharing with the communities in which it  operates as a caring and concerned corporate citizen.

To facilitate  this program, we signed an MOU with the Korean Red Cross. Families who are  recommended by foreign missions, the Korean Red Cross, or social service  organizations are given round-trip airline tickets and an allowance to cover their  stay. Through this program, 341 people from 109 low-income multicultural families  living in noise-affected areas or agricultural or fishing villages visited six home  countries in 2010.

We help them by purchasing agricultural products from  them, helping the farmers during their busy seasons, and holding feasts for senior  citizens. In addition, students and the elderly are provided with medical assistance  and invited to cultural events at airports. In 2010, twenty-nine employees from the  Gimpo International Airport Office worked with farmers living in Ponae 2-ri, Wolgot- myeon, Gimpo-si to sow potatoes. Later, they harvested the potatoes and distributed  them to the needy.

KOREA AIRPORTS CORPORATION 2011 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  B A L A N C E  Shareholder Structure  Established in March 2002 under the Korea Airports Corporation Act, KAC holds all the properties, rights, and duties formerly vested  in the Korea Airports Authority, in accordance with Addenda Article 5 of the Korea Airports Corporation Act. KACs shares are 100%  owned and managed by the Korean government. As of 2010, paid-in capital was worth KRW 2,091,371 million. Voting rights on issues  regarding changes to the Articles of Incorporation, the appointment of executives, and the approval of account settlements are  vested in the Korean government. Composition and Activities of the Board of Directors (BOD) The Board of Directors is KACs highest decision-making body. It makes decisions on all major corporate functions, except auditing.  Based on Korean law and its own Articles of Incorporation, KAC exercises the right to decide on such issues as its management  objectives and budget. The BOD is composed of six Executive Directors (including the President) and seven Non-Executive Directors.  Non-Executive Directors account for 54% of the BODs membership. In order to ensure a fairer decision-making process, the Chair of the Board is elected from among the Non-Executive Directors. This  enables non-executive members to participate in management activities in a more responsible and independent manner. To facilitate  the BODs activities, KAC establishes an annual operating plan and noties the Board of agenda items in advance. It does not decide  on any issues through resolution by written agreement without convening a BOD meeting. In an effort to prevent conicts of interest  between the BOD members and the company, members of the BOD who have a special interest in any item or items on the agenda  are not allowed to participate in any discussions regarding it or them. In 2010, the BOD held thirteen meetings and dealt with seventy- four agenda items.  Compensation for the President, Auditors, and Executive Directors includes their basic salaries, performance-based compensation,  and retirement pay, all of which are decided at a General Shareholders Meeting and by resolution of the BOD.

It meets on a monthly basis.  In addition, the company has been operating a real-time auditing system called eMAS since 2009 that allows it to conduct audits in a  more systematic manner. If the system detects deviations in risk from a standard predetermined range based on function-specific risk  scenarios, a warning message is automatically sent to the auditor in charge. This enables the company to monitor its risk levels by  detecting warnings in advance.  The Commission of Auditors held fourteen meetings in 2010. It also presented its operational results at a best practices workshop  sponsored by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. e-MIRROR AUDIT SYSTEM Process for Appointing Directors President Position Executive Directors By recommendation of the Executive Recommendation Committee and request of the Minister of Land, Transport and Maritime  Affairs, the President of KAC is appointed by the President of the Republic of Korea after deliberation and resolution at the Public  Institution Operation Commission and a resolution at a General Shareholders Meeting.

In areas determined as needing  improvement, fundamental solutions were  taken (KRW 5,235 million saved). Internal Control Mechanism and Response to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)  In 2007, KAC evaluated the design and operation of its accounting system through an internal control mechanism. Since then, we  have been evaluating 412 internal control items and 182 core control items classied into nine sectors on a semi-annual basis. In  2010, we enhanced our evaluation activities to ensure the credibility of our nancial statements and strengthen the transparency of  our accounting procedures. As a result, twenty ve evaluation items that were subject to changes due to the introduction of the IFRS  were enhanced, while forty items relating to the design and overall operation of our accounting system were augmented. In order to  better prepare for the introduction of the new reporting standards in 2011, a working-level TF was established, and an IFRS auditor  position was created.

As a result, the ICAO  certified the Center to serve as its first-ever northeastern Asia aviation security  training base. This happened in September 2010, allowing us to play a central role in  establishing global aviation security standards in Korea.  Enhancing the Aviation Safety System KAC installed a Barrier Management System at its airports in Jeju-do and Yeosu in 2009 to meet international safety standards. In  2010, we began managing our airport operations certications more comprehensively, and developed additional barrier management  techniques to ensure that our aviation safety management system was operating as effectively as possible. As a result, we have  achieved a 100% pass rate for our ight inspections for seven consecutive years. In order to respond to disasters more quickly and  proactively, we began using a Situation Reporting System at all our airports, allowing us to deal with disaster situations on a real-time  basis. Other steps that we have taken to enhance our crisis preparedness include simulation exercises, map-based drills for disaster  management, and equipment mobilization exercises that are undertaken in tandem with our contractors. Climate Change and Aviation Safety The Korean peninsula experienced unprecedentedly abnormal weather conditions in  2010, such as heavy snowfalls, severe cold, and gale-force winds. In response, KAC  added ten winter service vehicles to its eet, bringing our total number to twenty-four.  We also succeeded in shortening our runway clearance service time by six minutes. As  a result, airplanes at Gimpo Airport can now land and take off in twenty-four minutes,  even if there is a 2.5cm accumulation of snow. Aviation Safety System Aviation Security System AVIATION SAFETY SYSTEM / AVIATION SECURITY SYSTEM National Crisis Management A host of VIPs flew to Gimpo Airport to attend the G20 Business Summit in Seoul in  2010. To ensure their security, KAC drew up an aviation security plan and took rigorous  measures to ensure a high level of safety at the airport. As a result, no incidents or  accidents occurred during the event. KAC was given a plaque of appreciation by the  Presidential Security Service for its role in supporting the meeting.

In addition to taking a series of steps to reduce the incidence of environmental pollution, we abide by all  environmentally-related rules and regulations, and have established in-house standards that are even stricter than those mandated  by statute. The following are some of the environmental principles to which we adhere. Establishing an Environmentally Friendly Airport Operating System  KAC acquired an ISO14001 environmental management system certification in  December 2000. In 2010, the number of our employees who were working on  certification-related matters was four at the Head Office, four at Gimpo Airport, and  seven at the airports in Busan and Jeju-do. They made 127 improvements in such areas  as the environmentally friendly operation of our airports and ensuring that all rules and  regulations pertaining to the environment are being adhered to. The number of requests  for improvements from certification institutes was only twenty-four in 2010, down  significantly from forty-nine in 2009. Environmental Training for Employees  In order to ensure the professionalism and credibility of our environmental management programs, we offer our employees periodic  training through outside professional institutions. In addition, we began offering two new in-house ISO14001 inspector courses  within the Aviation Technology Training Center to foster the development of environmental specialists. This was done to enable our  ISO14001 environmental management system, which we adopted in 2007, to take root. In addition, we have contracted with outside  environmental institutions to train our employees in such matters as environmental conflict management, ensuring that our staffers in  charge of environmental protection have been provided with up-to-date information and knowledge. Thirty employees completed this  program in 2010. Environmental Management System Green Purchasing KACs employees are very involved in the companys energy saving campaign.  For example, Green Footprints is a set of changes in everyday workplace habits  that can result in dramatic energy use reductions. All our employees are making  changes in the way they work, such as using their own mugs, turning off office  lighting during lunch-times, turning off computers when theyre not being used,  maintaining moderate office temperatures, and using fewer supplies for special  occasions. Some results are shown in the table below.  Minimize negative impacts on the environment by saving resources, and reduce emissions through energy saving.  Make the purchasing of eco-friendly goods a priority, and maximize the use of products that are recyclable and reusable.  Improve the environment by establishing realistic but detailed environment targets.  Minimize atmospheric and water contamination.   Guarantee the transparency of our environment management practices by providing our environmental principles and operational  results to stakeholders upon request. DNV Certification for the Head Office and Gimpo Airport 97.5% KACs Record in 2010 Green Purchasing  Activities Government Standard: 80% 79 KOREA AIRPORTS CORPORATION 2011 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   Managing Air Pollution KACs efforts to minimize air pollution in 2010 were based on the Ministry of Environments Comprehensive Air-Quality Index (CAI),  which measures air quality based on the health risk of six different categories of air pollutants. Some of the steps that we took in this  regard included installing wheel washers, car washes, and dust removal facilities at our construction sites to reduce the incidence of  scattered dust. There were no cases of major environmental impacts due to our service or business activities in 2010. Managing Indoor Air Quality KAC is placing its effort on enhancing air quality in the passenger terminals to enable the pleasant usage of the airport facilities by  minimizing particulate particles. To accomplish this, the frequency of changing air lters within the terminals have been reduced,  while greater focus has been placed on interior cleaning of the terminals. Monitoring frequency for particulate matters has been  extended from once every year to four times a year. By measuring airside emissions at more airports, the emissions grade was raised  to A in 2010 from B in 2009.

Specific waste materials, such as waste water, used deicing/anti-icing fluid, wastewater sludge, and  incinerated ash are stored in approved containers and sent to outside contractors for treatment. General waste materials, including  recyclable materials such as plastics, are separated and collected to reduce their volume.

To reduce the volume of water pollution at its passenger and cargo terminals and other ancillary  facilities and protect water resources, KAC operates wastewater treatment facilities whose capacity varies according to the size of  each airport. In addition, three automatic water-quality measurement networks have been installed in the drainage system at Gimpo  Airport, meaning that the quality of its water is measured twenty-four hours a day. Outside firms measure the quality of this water at  major drainage spots. Based on their objective data, the water at Gimpo is not polluted at all.  In addition, the company has established a number of water quality management plans to deal with non-point pollution at such areas as  its runways. The volume of pollutant materials in this water is measured regularly by an outside firm on a semi-annual or monthly basis,  depending on the airports treatment capacity. There have been no reported cases where the pollutant level has exceeded legal standards.

The test results showed that KACs total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) level was within  allowable limits, and that there was no leakage. KACs fuel storage facilities are inspected daily, monthly and annually. Airport Measurement Spot TPH Test Results (mg/kg) Gimpo Airport Tank Area 32.05 Pipe Area 32.40 Surrounding Area 32.50 Gimhae Airport Tank Area 87.50 Pipe Area 443.50 Surrounding Area 38.00 Pohang Airport Tank Area 10.30 Pipe Area 10.00 below Surrounding Area 10.00 below Activities to Protect Ecosystems Although KACs facilities are not located in areas that contain important biological life-forms or wetlands, there are always concerns  about birds colliding with airplanes. We are committed to nding environmentally friendly ways of tackling this problem. In addition,  we are continually reviewing the possibility that ecosystems in areas near our airports may be altered due to airplane noise. Our  actions include seeking advice from environmental experts. Going forward, we will pay special attention to any factors that could  precipitate this change, and focus on nding measures to deal with them. Soil pollution tests are carried out periodically  depending on the opening year of airports. Thus,  airports in Jeju, Daegu, Muan, and Yangyang were  not subject to the test in 2010. Measuring Soil Pollution Level_02 Measuring Soil Pollution Level_01 MINIMIZING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BALANCE 82  Winning the Human Resources Develoment Leader Award EMPLOYEE STATUS Organizational and Human Resources Management KAC manages its organizational and human resources in accordance with the central governments plan to advance public  corporations while rationalizing their management. As part of its efforts to fulfill its social responsibilities, KAC strives both to create  jobs and to seek organizational efficiencies through downsizing. Our 2008 to 2011 goals of minimizing the workforce at Yangyang  Airport and cutting 305 surplus jobs at all our facilities through outsourcing were achieved in 2010, a year earlier than originally  scheduled. We are now taking a variety of steps to remove obstacles to downsizing without having to resort to forced layoffs. For  example, workers who opt for voluntary retirement are entitled to a period of up to six months to prepare for their transition to new  jobs while being paid their basic salaries. This enables prospective retirees to leave the company whenever they choose. Adhering to Global Standards  KAC abides by all regulations set by the International Labor Organization (ILO) prohibiting forced and child labor. In addition, we hold  twice-yearly training sessions to educate our employees in gender discrimination and harassment issues. During the period covered  by this report, no cases of discrimination based on gender were reported to us. Creating Jobs  In order to fulfill its responsibilities as a publicly-owned enterprise, KAC is actively participating in the Korean governments job- sharing policies. In 2010, we hired ninety-five interns, providing them with the same training opportunities enjoyed by our existing  employees. One of them was hired afterwards as a contract employee. If he then applies for a regular position after having worked  with us for more than a year, he will be given an extra 10% on the results of his written test. As of March 2011, there were thirty-five  interns working at KAC. Twenty-four of them were female, twelve had science and engineering backgrounds, and twenty five came  from outside the Seoul Metropolitan Area.

In 2007, we abolished  all hiring restrictions based on educational level, major at university, and age. In addition, we ensure that our employees are not  discriminated against based on their gender or place of birth, either in terms of working conditions, promotions, or pay. Our Sky  Park and public golf course construction projects created 7,455 jobs. Strategy for Hiring High-Quality Human Resources In order to ensure that it always hires the most qualified and skilled candidates possible, KAC has established a two-part hiring  process comprising a written exam and an interview. The interviews are carried out by outside experts to ensure transparency  and fairness. After an employee has gone through a step-by-step employment process that ranges from being an intern to being a  contract employee to being a regular worker, KAC is able to determine his or her work capabilities extremely accurately.  In the case of core positions, an open, competency-based hiring process is carried out through advertisements. Candidates from  inside or outside the company can apply. We also have a policy to ensure that female employees, the disabled, and those under  employment protection are able to retain their jobs. In addition, we attend Public Corporations Job Fairs and publicize our hiring  process as part of our effort to support the governments goal of realizing a fairer and more harmonious society. Equitable Working Environment In order to encourage the development of a professional female workforce, KAC has enrolled one female employee in a high-level  management training course and another in its next-generation leadership development program. In addition, our maternity leave  period has been extended from three years to four, while the child-birth leave for new fathers has been increased from two days  to three. Other programs to help our female employees stay at their jobs and enjoy enhanced benets are being developed. This  includes a counseling service that helps female employees deal with instances of gender discrimination. We also uphold the central  governments requirement that disabled people and seniors must constitute at least 2% of a workforce, and give priority in hiring to  persons of national merit.

One of them is a free annual medical check-up  to protect their health. Results of Employee Satisfaction-Oriented Management Employee Benefits KAC is committed to following the central governments guidelines on rationalizing the costs of its various employee benefits  programs, with a special emphasis on female workers benefits. We conduct surveys of our employees level of satisfaction with  various items in our employee benefits package, and use the results to make improvements to it. Our workers level of satisfaction  with our cafeteria services is also surveyed. Suggestions like diversifying the menu are then delivered to the catering firms. Internal Employee Benefits Programs Management for Employee Satisfaction Promoting Labor-Management Harmony  to Enhance Employee Well-Being  In order to enhance the well-being of its employees, KAC is encouraging the  development of improved discussion channels between labor and management. Our  jointly-operated Labor-Management Council is one of the bodies that are tasked  with improving the well-being of employees. The areas where such improvements  were actually made include employees benefit cards, the night shift system, our  sports fields, employee cafeterias, and the welfare programs for youth interns. In  2010, KAC increased its number of vacation facilities from seventeen to twenty-two,  improved the environment of employee cafeterias, and carried out a remodeling of  staff lounges.

In addition, we strengthened the  programs foundation by depositing 92% of the pension money that we had collected  in outside institutions. This will enable us to provide our pension subscribers with  more secure retirements. Employee Health and Safety KAC abides by all of the International Labor Organizations labor standards and regulations and Koreas Industrial Health Management  Criteria, and attempts to prevent accidents by informing its employees about essential health and safety practices. These efforts  enabled us to achieve an accident-free year in 2010. As part of our goal of protecting our workers from the hazardous effects of  smoking, we are carrying out an anti-smoking campaign. We also promote the health of our employees by enrolling them in programs  in which they can calculate their health in detail and engage in physical training methods to avoid illness and the development of  diseases of the muscles and bone.

Common Use Terminal Equipment (CUTE) A standardized system that allows airlines sharing check-in counters (including  boarding gates). This is possible by flexibly assigning counters to airlines  depending on congestion within terminals. New airlines can secure check-in  counters more easily thanks to this system. Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) A system that continues sending the information on distance between the  location of the system to flying aircrafts using frequencies. Doppler VHF Omnidirectional Range (DVOR) Equipment that provides flying aircrafts with data on a full 360-degree range from  the point of the system installed. Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, GRI is an organization established in  1997 to set internationally accepted guidelines on corporate sustainability  report. CERES, a US network of environmental organizations and the United  Nations Environment Program (UNEP) led the creation of the organization. Since  announcing the first guideline in June 1, 2000, the organization set a policy to  revise the guideline every two to three years in accordance to the changing  environment. Accordingly, GRI G2 Guideline was announced in May 2002 and the  G3 Guidelines, in October 2006 (www.globalreporting.org). International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Under the convention on International Civil Aviation (also known as Chicago  Convention signed in 1944, the ICAO was established as a specialized agency  of the United Nations In 1947. Its objectives are developing the international  civil aviation transport industry and securing safety; creating an efficient and  economical transport industry; and realizing development in airplane design and  aviation technology. Major bodies within the organization include the General  Committee, Board of Directors and Executive Office. The Board of Directors'  support commissions include the Air Navigation Commission, the Air Transport  Commission and the Legal Commission. (www.icao.int) Low Cost Carrier (LCC) LCC refers to airlines offering less in-flight services at lower fares. There are  currently five such airlines operating domestically. ONE-PASS Boarding Service The ONE-PASS Boarding Service provides a swift boarding process using  automatic recognition system thereby lessening passenger inconveniences due  to congestion caused by manual identification process. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Wireless radio-frequency technology used to store and manage individual  identification information in tags with integrated circuit (IC) chips and antennae  embedded. KAC established the RFID-based baggage tracking system, with  which RFID tags are attached to passenger baggage and then tracked through  the reader throughout the entire cargo handling process. KAC hopes to lay the  foundation to create a u-Airport based on the system. Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) TACAN is a navigational method to find the relative direction and distance  between airplane and ground control. Once the airplane's TACAN system channel  is adjusted to ground control's TACAN channel, a radio wave is automatically  sent to ground control from airplane. The response signal from ground control is  used to simultaneously display the direction and distance from ground control  on the navigational instruments of the airplane, enabling the pilot to identify the  airplanes location. UN Global Compact The UN Global Compact was initiated at the proposal of the former Secretary  General of the United Nations, Kofi Anan at the Davos Forum, Switzerland in  January 1999. The Compact is a voluntary agreement under the UN, comprised  of ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the  environment and anti-corruption based the Global Human Rights Declaration, ILO  Declaration, Rio Declaration and UN Anti-Corruption Agreement. KAC joined the  Compact in October 2007. (www.unglobalcompact.org) Weighted Equivalent Continuous Perceived Noise Level (WECPNL) WECPNL is a noise evaluation measurement unit recommended by the ICAO.  The aircraft noise for landing and taking-off is comprehensively evaluated by  applying weights according to the flight frequency, time, and maximum noise  level. WECPNL is calculated by adding the weighted average by time period to  the average dB of the maximum aircraft noise level every time an airplane. The  current aviation law stipulates to classify the areas experiencing the noise level  of over 80 WECPNL as potential noise affected areas. Areas experiencing over 90  WECPNL are considered noise affected areas. In this case, related government  agencies should set up and implement measures to move affected households or  prevent noise. ISO 26000 International standard on corporate social responsibility launched by the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It consists of seven  core subjects (organizational governance, human rights, labor practices,  the environment, fair operating practices, consumer issues, and community  involvement and development) and guidelines on thirty six issues. Although  not legally binding, the standard has become major international criteria for  social responsibility. Thus, it is expected to serve as an important yardstick for  corporate management.  99 KOREA AIRPORTS CORPORATION 2011 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   Questionnaire for Readers - We wants to hear from our stakeholders with regard to this 2011 Sustainability Report.
