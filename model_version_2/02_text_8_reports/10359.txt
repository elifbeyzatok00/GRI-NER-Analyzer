Our Commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility    On behalf of the Turkish Cypriot Chamber of Commerce I would like to declare our strong commit- ment to the values of the UN Global Compact initiative and to the corporate social responsibility. We respect  the Global Compact principles and we work through their implementation in our business practice. One of our  major activities in the above area was the bicommunal Global Compact Environmental Principles Project meas- uring the corporate environmental responsibility of businesses in Cyprus. Additionally, our staff attended a one  month education program on corporate social responsibility, sponsored by the USAID and aiming to introduce  the concept as a sustainable strategy in businesses in Cyprus. For the next year we aim to develop our holistic  social responsibility strategy with clearly set up targets and activities thus becoming a model for our members  and for the business community in Cyprus. I sincerely hope that the Global Compact Cyprus network will ex- pand with continuously increasing number of socially responsible companies.
