Inditex is the result of shared core values coupled with  decades of daily hard work and dedication by a great  team. This team and these values are unquestionably the  Groups most prized asset, the foundations on which it  aims to continue to build a solid future and our warranty  that our thirst for a job well done and excellence continues  to be instilled in all the new talent joining this communal  endeavour. This year I am pleased to report that almost  10,000 new professionals have joined the Group, bringing  the total headcount to 110,000. This human dimension provides us with a global cultural  wealth of which we are particularly proud. This is a  company which lives and breathes fashion across all  five continents and attempts to connect with each of the  streets on which its stores are located. Accordingly, the  Groups diversity adds to the universal image it seeks to  project. By the end of 2011, the Group was present in 82  markets, having opened its inaugural stores in Australia,  South Africa, Taiwan and Azerbaijan, enabling it to take  the collections designed with the southern hemisphere in  mind to the next level. In all, the Group opened 483 new  stores in no fewer than 49 different countries. This growth also trickled down to the chains business  headquarters in Spain, where the design, creation and  product development centres are located as well as the  bulk of in-house manufacturing and logistics activity.  Both the corporate head office, which is about to be  extended by some 70,000 square metres, and the various  logistics platforms, which are also set to receive facility  expansions and upgrades, including pioneering textile  industry technology, continue to benefit from significant  capital expenditures destined to create a substantial  number of jobs.  Under the umbrella of the companys global strategy,  I would like to stress the rising prominence of internet  at Inditex, which has always targeted its efforts at direct  contact with its customers. The various retail chains have  expanded their online platforms. Online sales have been  enabled in many European countries and in the case of  Zara, also in the US and Japan. This gradual deployment  will continue until online shopping is a reality in all of  Inditex operating markets.  Consolidated revenue at the Inditex Group rose by 10%  over 2010, driven by both new store openings and same- store sales growth of 4%. This profitable growth allowed  us to continue to put money back into the company, as is  our philosophy, to the tune of 1,300 million. Some of the  most noteworthy investments completed in 2011 included  the flagship store on New Yorks Fifth Avenue (which  opened its doors in 2012). This stores inauguration was  used to present the new Zara concept: an architectural  space combining beauty and utility, as well as the latest  achievements on the eco-efficiency front. In sum, the  stores scale and location has made it a genuine global  flagship store for the Zara brand. Continuing in the environmental vein, 2011 was the first  year under the Sustainable Inditex 2011-2015 strategic  environmental plan, which extends and expands the  targets attained under earlier multi-year plans. The  cornerstone of the new plan is the eco-efficient store  program. The new stores being opened to the Groups  stringent standards are achieving the highest ratings  from the most demanding external certification entities.  Under this ambitious program the Group intends to  design and build fashion showrooms which perform  to the highest energy efficiency standards, ensuring  rational consumption as well as the use of certified  environmentally-friendly materials, smart water and  cardboard recycling processes and waste sorting.   - 7 - annual report 2011 Thanks to these initiatives, energy consumption has been  cut by 20% and carbon emissions, by 30%. The plan,  which is the result of years of academic research, calls  of implementation of these standards in all the Groups  stores worldwide by 2020.  Social sustainability is the other bedrock of our  philosophy. Inditex unquestionably boasts the best textile  suppliers in the world and has opted philosophically to  follow a very well-defined protocol based on two core  principles: (i) zero tolerance of breaches of its Code of  Conduct; and (ii) empowerment of its teams to improve  conditions throughout the supply chain, articulated in  a clear commitment to gradual enhancement of social  conditions and the creation of jobs and social wealth.  Without a shadow of a doubt, we can call on the best  allies, all of whom similarly engaged, in this cause.  Our involvement in international platforms such as  Ethical Trading Initiative, and/or the reinforcement of  our agreement with the International Textile, Garments  and Leather Workers Federation (ITGLWF), in addition  to our commitment to Global Compact, have proven  to be learning tools regarding the enforcement of best  practices, and knowledge tools to anticipate and resolve  any incidents. Turning to 2012, I would like to underscore the assurance  and conviction with which the company is approaching  its global growth strategy, underpinned by significant  investment wherewithal that will pave the way for  continued job creation. The Group plans to start up new  operations in several markets, extending the intense  pace of new store openings.  Online, Zara plans to  launch its online store in China, while the other chains  will consolidate their online presence in their existing  operating markets. In the year ahead, we will make  further progress on all the aspects that have made the  Group one of the benchmark international players in the  world of fashion.  We aim to continue to enjoy our fascinating relationship  with our customers across all five continents, offer the  highest standards of quality and service and sell fashion  lovers everywhere reliable, socially responsible and  sustainable products. I know for sure that every single  person working at this company shares this unwavering  calling, a determination of which I feel particularly proud.   Pablo Isla Chairman  - 8 - Business model our commercial formats Business model The place where customers  desire for fashion meets the  offers of each chains design  team. They are the main image  material for our brands:  privileged locations in the  main towns; meticulously  conceived storefront; a  unique internal and external  architectural conception;  precise coordination of  the product and excellent  customer services.  5,527 stores in 82  markets and five  continents 483 new stores all of  which have criteria of   eco-efficiency store Over 1,000 professionals  devoted to the design and  development of products.  Each chain has its own team,  whose work is concentrated  on market analysis with the  aim of reacting to customers  wishes in the shortest time  possible.  design Over 21 million  followers on   Facebook  Over 109,000  professionals Over 1,300  suppliers In 2011, marketing of  over 1.9 million organic  cotton garments  customers employees suppliers  - 9 - annual report 2011 Over 50% of Inditexs  manufacturing takes place in  suppliers from proximity.  At the end of 2011, Inditex  had 1,398 active suppliers  with whom it maintains stable  relationships based on ethics  and responsibility governed  by the Code of Conduct for  External Manufacturers and  Suppliers, which must be  accepted in order to maintain  commercial relations with the  Group. 250,000 chemical  analyses of products  2,300 audits The logistical system is  designed to ensure constant  renovation in the options  available in store.  Every store in the world  receives new models twice  a week from the logistics  centres of each one of the  chains, all of which are located  in Spain. From the logistics  centres, the product reaches  European stores in 24-36  hours and those in the rest of  the world within 48 hours.  manufacturing distribution Over 600,000  beneficiaries of social  programmes Over 60,000  investors who trust  Inditex business model The objective is to reduce  the emissions from  logistical activity by 20%  by 2020 community shareholders  - 10 - A look back  over 2011  - 12 - a look back over 2011 The strategy of multi-channel global growth has  been supported by the results obtained during the 2011  financial year, which are at the same time a demonstration  of the strength of the business model. In this period,  the sales have increased significantly by 10% reaching  13,793 million euros. The increase in the turnover and  the improvement in operating efficiency have made  it possible to raise EBITDA by 10%, up to 3,258 million  euros. Thus, the profitability of the Group continued to  improve: the net profit rose by 12% and reached 1,932  million euros. These satisfactory results, together with the opportunities  for global growth, have made it possible to re-invest the  funds generated in the expansion of the Group, thus  reinforcing the strategy of organic growth. During the  2011 financial year, expansion has been centred on the  opening of new stores located in the best commercial  areas of countries with a great potential. In this regard,  the entry into five new markets is particularly important:  Taiwan, Azerbaijan, Australia, South Africa and Peru, with  which the commercial presence of Inditex is extended to  all five continents. The last three are a reinforcement  of the differentiated commercial strategy which Inditex  has been applying to markets located in the southern  hemisphere.  Flagship stores Outstanding examples of openings in significant  locations are the Zara stores in Pitt Street (Sydney),  Burke Street (Melbourne) or the Taipei 101 building  in the capital of Taiwan. The four-storey store in the  district of Shibuya with which Bershka began its activity  in Japan, and the privileged locations of this chain in  Rue Saint Franois (Lausanne) or Bagdad Cadesi  (Istanbul) are also significant. Although, without a  doubt, the greatest landmark for Bershka has been  the opening of its store in the centre of Berlin, which is  the most advanced example of an eco-efficient store in  the chain and which has achieved Platinum category in  the LEED environmental certification, the highest that  the US Green Building Council awards. Pull&Bear has  also opened up an emblematic store in Lijbaan Street  in Rotterdam. This store brings together the latest  advances in the environmental sphere, in line with all  the new openings of the Inditex Group, as a fundamental  part of "Sustainable Inditex 2011-2015", the strategic  environmental plan of the Group for the next few years  and with which it aims to reduce its emissions of CO2 by  10% in 2015 and by 20% by 2020. Among other significant Group openings in 2011, the first  appearance of Zara Home in Germany, with a large store  in the most important commercial area in Frankfurt   - 13 - annual report 2011 (Rathenauplatz) and other stores in George Street  (London) and Van Baerlestraat, next to the Museumplein  in Amsterdam, are particularly significant. In this same  area of the Dutch capital, Massimo Dutti has been  established. Massimo Dutti also opened in Tverskaya  Avenue in Moscow. In turn, Stradivarius boosted its  presence in Italy in places such as the Corso Buenos  Aires in Milan or the Via Roma in Turin, and Uterqe set  up on the Paseo del Born in Palma de Mallorca and in  Lippenslaan, in the Belgian tourist resort of Knokke. With an effect on the multi-channel strategy, the 2011  financial year saw the launch of internet sales in all the  chains in the Group and the opening of the online Zara  stores in the United States and Japan. In this way, at  the close of 2011, the Group had an online commercial  presence in eighteen European countries, as well as  Japan and the United States. During the 2011 financial year, the growth in Inditex's  commercial area has continued with 483 new stores,  which brings the total at the end of the year to 5,527 stores  in 82 markets. This means that the commercial area has  increased by 250,000 square metres, with the result that  on 31st January 2012, it amounted to more than 2,800,000  square metres. Zara continued to lead this growth: it  had over a hundred net openings and contributed two- thirds of the Group turnover. The remaining chains  also significantly increased their commercial presence  during the financial year as they entered new markets.  Let the fact that, during 2011, Inditex opened stores in 49  different markets serve as an example of the capacity of  the Group to take advantage of global opportunities.  Europe and Asia remain the priority axes of the expansion  of the Group. In the first case, over 200 new stores were  opened during the financial year, especially in Eastern  Europe. Asia, for its part, was responsible for 165 new  stores and now represents 18% of company sales. The  majority of the new stores (132) were in China, a country  in which two of the Group commercial formats have made  their debut: Oysho and Zara Home, with seventeen and  five stores respectively. Thus, China now has 275 stores  from all Inditex brands. Given the excellent reception of  its options and given that Inditex considers China a key  market, the company plans to keep up the rhythm of  openings in this country over the next few years and to  conclude 2012 with about 425 stores in over fifty cities.  2011 also saw the arrival of Bershka in Japan and  Korea, and of Pull&Bear and Stradivarius in Korea. In  turn, Zara opened three new stores in India (Bombay,  Pune and Bangalore) and set up its first stores in  Taiwan and Australia. 2011 meant the  consolidation of  Inditex's strategy of  global expansion with  commercial operations  on the five continents  and its commitment to  electronic commerce During the 2011 financial  year, the Group opened  over 200 new stores in  Europe and 165 in Asia  45 %  Europe (except Spain)  25 %  Spain 18 %  Asia and the rest of the  world 12 %  America Sales by geographical area  - 14 - a look back over 2011 Sustainable supply chain In the area of Social Responsibility, in 2011 the  strengthening of the activities of supervision of  the fulfilment of the Code of Conduct for External  Manufacturers and Suppliers continued. With this  respect, membership of Inditex at the United Nations  Global Compact Supply Chain Sustainability Advisory  Group, and its adherence to the CEO Water Mandate,  also at the initiative of the United Nations, has allowed  the Group to take a step further in specific social and  environmental progress, sharing and enforcing best  practices on sustainability worldwide in respect of  suppliers to our business model, which has been the  hallmark of the Group from inception. During 2011,  Inditex carried out over 2,000 audits on suppliers and  manufacturers, which reflected a notable reduction in  the number of suppliers in breach of several aspects of  the Code of Conduct (classified as D). While the total  number of active suppliers has increased, the number of  them with a D classification has been reduced by 27%.  Currently, 89% of Inditexs production is concentrated  with A and B suppliers. During 2011, Inditex has reinforced its control system  by means of specific and comprehensive audits to  monitor the ongoing improvement within factories,  and awareness-raising activities were carried out with  a number of manufacturers. In other markets, the  mechanisms for monitoring the fulfilment of the Code  of Conduct for Manufacturers have been reinforced in  collaboration with trade unions, NGOs and academic  and business institutions. Likewise, the environmental strategy of the Group within  its supply chain through the Inditex Green Code should  be pointed out. This project encompasses assessment  and environmental control criteria within the facilities of  Inditex suppliers. During the 2011 financial year, Inditex maintained its  commitment to employment and created 9,374 new jobs,  with the result that at the end of the period, it was over  109,000 employees around the world. Eight out of ten  had a permanent contract, with an average of 26.5 years  of age in Spain. 79.5% of the staff are women. As a direct  consequence of the company's global presence and  vocation, the staff of Inditex is made up of professionals  of 140 different nationalities. This factor contributes  decisively to our diversity, which constitutes one of the  principal elements of the corporate culture of Inditex. The Group's activity in the 82 markets in which it  operates promotes indirect business activity through  the long list of suppliers of products and services that  it uses. This network is especially significant in Spain,  where the Group has over 5,000 suppliers of services,  store furniture or systems, among others.  Inditex has an online  commercial presence for  all its brands in eighteen  European countries, as  well as the United States  and Japan with Zara The Group maintained its  commitment to employment  with the creation of  9,374 new jobs in 2011 Evolution of the number of stores 5,527  5,044 4,607 4,264 3,691 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 6,000 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000  - 15 - annual report 2011 Rewards for the shareholder In the 2012 financial year, rewards for the shareholders  will undergo a considerable increase, with the support  of the Group's solid financial position. At the General  Meeting of Shareholders which will be held in July, the  Inditex Board of Directors will propose a payment of  a dividend of 1.8 euros per share, 12.5% greater than  last year. By means of the combination of attractive  rewards for the shareholder and re-investment in the  business, Inditex guarantees, at one and the same  time, its capacity to continue to grow in a profitable  manner in the future, thus creating value for its  shareholders, and to generate employment and wealth  in its surroundings.  In summary, 2011 has for Inditex involved the  consolidation of its strategy of global expansion,  with commercial operations on the five continents,  and a turning point in its commitment to a multi- channel presence, with the launch of online sales in  all its formats. Two events related with Zara will be  landmarks in next year's Annual Report: the opening of  the store at number 666 Fifth Avenue in New York, both  as a result of its location and due to its characteristics  (over 3,500 square metres on three floors, fulfilling  the criteria of sustainable construction of the Group's  eco-efficient stores) and the inauguration of the online  store of this chain in the Chinese market.

Asia and the rest of the world Asia is an important geographical area in the growth of  Inditex. In 2011, 220 stores were opened in this region,  45% of the total Group openings. China deserves a  special mention as it saw 132 new stores. In Asia, the  number of new stores in Japan and South Korea, with  15 and 13 openings respectively is also important. These  include Bershka's first in both markets and the first for  Pull&Bear and Stradivarius in Korea.

In this period,  Zara began its commercial activity in five new markets:  Taiwan, Azerbaijan, Australia, South Africa and Peru.  With the entry into these last three countries in the  Southern Hemisphere, the strategy of global supply is  reinforced, apart from achieving a presence on the five  continents. Given the climatic difference with the stores  located in the Northern Hemisphere, Zara has a team  of designers who create specific fashion proposals for  women, men and children. The latest trends are thus  reflected in garments and textiles that are suitable for  both hemispheres, in options which are continually  renewed.  For entry into these new markets, Zara selected  emblematic stores in outstanding locations such as Pitt  Street, in Sydney; Burke Street, in Melbourne; Sandton  City, in Johannesburg; or the Taipei 101 building in the  capital of Taiwan. In total, Zara opened 107 stores during  the financial year, 30 of which were in China, where the  chain already has over 100 stores. If the previous financial year was the year of the launch  of the online store, in 2011, Zara took a qualitative leap  in this channel with the start of online sales in the  United States and Japan, in September and October,  respectively. With the Dear America and Dear Japan  campaigns, made up of a collection of photographs of  each one of the regions of each country taken by local  artists, Zara presented its new online store directly  to its customers in both countries, receiving a warm  welcome. At the close of the financial year, the Zara  online store was operating in eighteen countries with  over a million visits daily. Zara.com has become one  of the brand's most popular storefronts thanks to the  permanent sections such as Lookbook, where the latest  of the chain's articles are shown, or People!, an initiative  in collaboration with the customers, who send photos of  their own fashion displays from the latest Zara trends.  www.zara.com  - 29 - Principal indicators 2011 (in millions of euros)  Net sales EBIT 957 140 Contribution to   the total sales 6.9% Number of stores at the  close of the financial year 747 Net store openings   in the year 65 Markets 49 New markets in the   2011 financial year 3 Pull&Bear, a chain of young people's free-and-easy  fashion celebrated its 20th Anniversary with Pull&Bear  Ecologize-Me: 20 years of reinvention, a real declaration  of intentions. During this financial year, the brand took  its commitment to the environment to its stores and  its customers with awareness-raising, manufacturers  and events. The final touch to a "green" year came in  December with the opening in Rotterdam (Holland)  of a unique store in the matter of eco-efficiency. The  chain's largest store, which consumes 30% less energy  with regard to the average yearly consumption of a  conventional store and reduces water consumption by  40%. It has the Platinum classification, the maximum  available from the environmental LEED certification. It  is the model in eco-efficiency for the new stores in the  chain. In 2011, Pull&Bear launched a store with a new image  under the format of the loft concept. The new stores,  inspired by the lofts of New York, have relaxed decoration  and spaces where the latest technologies make it  possible for customers to interact and share experiences  and their looks in real time through the social networks.  A Corua was the first city with this new concept of store,  to which the first openings of the chain in Holland in May  2011, in Tilburg and the Hague were added. During the  financial year, Pull&Bear also opened its first stores in  South Korea and Morocco. Just as for five of the Inditex chains, 2011 was for  Pull&Bear the year of the launch of its online store in  thirteen European countries (Germany, Austria, Belgium,  Denmark, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Holland, Poland,  Portugal, the United Kingdom and Sweden). Among the actions in celebration of its 20th birthday,  Pull&Bear made a gesture to customers who over these  two decades have grown with the brand with two very  special collections: Heritage and Pull&Bear for Kids. www.pullandbear.com  - 31 - Principal indicators 2011 (in millions of euros)  Net sales EBIT 1,013 238 Contribution to   the total sales 7.3% Number of stores at the  close of the financial year 573 Net store openings   in the year 43 Markets 51 New markets in the   2011 financial year 1 Massimo Dutti ended 2011 showing strong sales growth  of 13% reaching 1,013 million euros. Over this period,  the Inditex Group chain, with a range of fashion options  designed for independent men and women, who are urban  and cosmopolitan, opened 43 stores in 13 countries,  including a new one, Lithuania, where it opened its first  store in the capital, Vilnius. During this financial year,  the powerful expansion of Massimo Dutti in China was  outstanding, where fifteen stores were opened, many  of them in towns where there had previously been no  presence, such as Daqing, Shijiazhuang, Guangzhou and  Shenzhen, among others, and the chain closed the year  with 24 stores. The chain opened some of its new emblematic stores  in Europe, among which were one in Amsterdam, in the  area of the Museumplein, and another in Moscow, on  Tverskaya Avenue, one of the busiest shopping streets in  the Russian capital. Nevertheless, perhaps the chain's  most emblematic opening during 2011 was that of its  online store. Since September 2011, Massimo Dutti has  had an internet sales platform in ten European markets  (Germany, Austria, Denmark, Spain, France, Ireland,  Italy, Monaco, the United Kingdom and Switzerland), with  a successful reception from its customers. Weeks before  the launch of its online store, Massimo Dutti inaugurated  on its website,MD Journal, a communications platform  with recommendations, lifestyle keys, cultural events  and news aimed at the tastes of their customers, which  has become an interesting meeting point with all the  internet users who love the Massimo Dutti universe. Always attentive to the needs of its customers, Massimo  Dutti makes periodical innovations both in its collections  and in its stores, with the aim of advancing at the speed set  by its followers. If in previous years, the chain launched the  service of made-to-measure suits, during 2011, it launched  Shoes made to order: men's made-to-measure shoes  on order. With this initiative, available from a selection of  stores in the chain, it offers the customer a selection of  colours, materials and details of finishes to create a shoe  to his taste.  www.massimodutti.com  - 33 - Net store openings   in the year 91 Markets 57 New markets in the   2011 financial year 7 Number of stores at the  close of the financial year 811 Contribution to   the total sales 9.5% Principal indicators 2011 (in millions of euros)  Net sales EBIT 1,316 159 Bershka, the chain with the youngest options of the  Inditex Group, closed the 2011 financial year with a  strong boost to its international expansion. During this  year, Bershka opened stores in seven markets -Korea,  Indonesia, Morocco, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Germany and  Japan-, and closed the year with stores in 57 markets,  which makes it the Inditex chain with a presence in the  most countries, after Zara. In some of these new markets,  such as Japan and Germany, Bershka began its activity  with very special stores. For its entry into the Japanese  market, in April, the chain decided on a four-storey store  and an impressive glass faade delimited by yellow neon  lights, in the district of Shibuya, one of Tokyo's most  important shopping areas. This store contains the latest  audiovisual technology and a design especially created  for the occasion. Four months later, Bershka opened its  first establishment in Germany with a store in Berlin,  located on Tauentzienstrae. This store, starting with  the interior design from the Tokyo store, took a further  step by emphasising the young, avant-garde nature of  the brand through the use of colour and lighting. What  is more, Bershka wanted its first store in Germany to  also be a standard-bearer for the chain's sensitivity to  environmental matters. The result is an eco-efficient  store which has achieved the Platinum category, the  best that is awarded by the LEED certification, the most  demanding standard for sustainable architecture in the  world.  The list of emblematic Bershka stores in 2011 is  completed with other important openings in superb  locations such as Rue Saint Franois, in Lausanne  (Switzerland), and Bagdad Cadesi, in Istanbul (Turkey).  What is more, together with another five Inditex chains,  Bershka began its commercial activity on the internet.  To be exact, the online store was operational in twelve  European markets (Germany, Austria, Belgium, Spain,  France, Ireland, Italy, Holland, Poland, Portugal, the  United Kingdom and Switzerland). For the online launch,  Bershka put a mysterious question to its followers  on the internet and the social networks: "Where is  fashion?", which achieved extraordinary interactivity and  the answer to which was revealed on the day that online  sales began: "Fashion is in shop online!"

Among the eighteen countries in which the "treble  clef" chain opened stores in 2011, the powerful drive of  its expansion into markets such as China, Russia and  Poland, with 23, 18 and 10 new stores, respectively, was  outstanding. During the year, its presence in Italy was  strengthened with emblematic stores in such outstanding  locations as Corso Buenos Aires, in Milan, and la Via  Roma, in Turin and it has started its commercial activity  in three new markets: South Korea, Indonesia and El  Salvador. It closed the year with a commercial presence  in 46 countries. During 2011, Stradivarius completed the renewal of its  image on the internet which it had begun the previous  year, with the launch of online initiatives that are close to  the profile of its customers: young women with an informal  and imaginative style. For them, the chain launched from  Trendtation, a social network specialising in fashion, the  looks competition Be our Stradiva, with which the brand  managed to intensify its bi-directional communication  with its followers. Another of the chain's most outstanding  initiatives on the internet was the launch of the online  Stradivas Magazine, which offers something more than  a catalogue of products, with recommendations, general  trends and fashion and lifestyle suggestions. Both projects  were the best possible preamble for the launch of the  chain's online store. Stradivarius.com began its activity on  the internet in six European countries: Germany, Spain,  France, Italy, Poland and Portugal. The chain closed the year with an increase of 12% in sales,  reaching 871 million euros. Following the style of social  growth of Inditex, Stradivarius combines its commercial  growth with actions aimed at social integration.  www.stradivarius.com  - 37 - New markets in the   2011 financial year 6 Markets 31 Net store openings   in the year 51 Number of stores at the  close of the financial year 483 Contribution to   the total sales 2.3% Principal indicators 2011 (in millions of euros)  Net sales EBIT 313 36 Oysho is celebrating its tenth anniversary full of energy  and projects: six new markets, a change of logo,  more attractive stores and interesting commercial  initiatives. The female undergarment chain has been  revolutionising the lingerie sector for ten years with  proposals that are fun and sexy. The options also include  casual wear, clothing to be comfortable in at home and  original accessories. In this decade, Oysho has opened  483 stores in 51 countries, including six new markets  that it entered in 2011: The Ukraine, Egypt, Morocco,  Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and China. In the  latter market, Oysho has opened 17 online stores with  the powerful expansion of the Inditex Group in Asia.  During the year, Oysho also began its online expansion  with the launch of its internet store in ten European  countries (Germany, Austria, Belgium, Spain, France,  Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and the  United Kingdom). On its tenth birthday, Oysho renewed its logo by giving it  a more balanced and serene image. From the synthetic  lines of the old version, the brand has gone on to a  typography which fits perfectly with the new interior  design of its stores: small enchanting boutiques,  simple and welcoming.  In the commercial area, Oysho has launched a line of  sports clothing in collaboration with Adidas. Oysho's  GYM collection has a wide range of garments which are  adapted to the specific needs of each kind of training  (running, fitness, dance or yoga, among other activities).  For this collection, Adidas has created sports shoes for  sale exclusively in Oysho.  www.oysho.com  - 39 - Principal indicators 2011 (in millions of euros)  Net sales EBIT 317 39 Contribution to   the total sales 2.3% Number of stores at the  close of the financial year 310 Net store openings   in the year 26 Markets 30 New markets in the   2011 financial year 3 Zara Home closed the 2011 financial year with sales of  317 million euros, which is an increase of 8% with regard  to the previous year. For the home fashion chain from the  Inditex Group, 2011 was a year of significant openings.  It opened twenty-six new stores in fourteen countries,  three of which were in new markets (Germany, China  and Costa Rica). Zara Home's opening in Germany  and China is especially relevant for the chain. In the  case of Germany, Zara Home opened its first physical  store, located in Frankfurt, in Rathenauplatz, one of the  busiest streets in the city. With this opening, Zara Home  has responded to the continual demands of its German  internet customers as the chain began online sales in  this market in 2007. During 2011, it also opened stores in  other German towns like Hamburg and Dsseldorf.  For its debut in China, Zara Home chose The Place  Shopping Centre in Beijing, where Zara and Massimo  Dutti already had a commercial presence. During the  same year, the chain also opened stores in other cities  such as Changchun, Tianjing and Guangzhou. Other significant Zara Home openings during 2011  included George Street, in London, and Van Baerlestraat,  next to the Museumplein in Amsterdam. In A Corua,  Zara Home opened its store number 300, a two-storey  flagship in which natural light predominates, bringing  out the simple and elegant character of the brand.  The chain has continued with its online expansion, with  its entry into two new markets, Switzerland and Norway,  closing the year with an online store in 17 European  countries. Zara Home was, in 2007, the first chain of the  Inditex Group to begin to sell on the internet. Over the  last few years, its experience in this channel has been an  indisputable reference for the launch of the online stores  of all the chains in the Group (Zara, in 2010, and the rest  of the chains, in 2011).  www.zarahome.com  - 41 - Principal indicators 2011 (in millions of euros)  Net sales EBIT 68 -8 Contribution to   the total sales 0.5% Number of stores at the  close of the financial year 89 Net store openings   in the year 9 Markets 17 New markets in the   2011 financial year 1 Uterqe, Inditex's youngest chain, which was only  created three years ago, closed a year in which it  laid down the basis for its brand and its commercial  options. During 2011, the brand which is devoted to  fashion accesories and a careful selection of garments  in textiles and leather of excellent quality, achieved  sales of 68 million euros, consolidating its position as a  cosmopolitan and exclusive brand with 89 stores in some  of the most select shopping areas. Thus, for example,  during the year, Uterqe reached Palma de Mallorca,  with a store on Paseo del Born; in Casablanca, its first  location in Morocco, or on Lippenslaan in the tourist  resort of Knokke in Belgium. In this market, the Inditex  Group purchased the network of Uterqe stores (seven  in total) which had hitherto operated as franchises so as  to manage them directly.  During 2011, the chain transferred its headquarters from  Arteixo (Galicia), where the corporate headquarters of  Inditex is located, to Tordera (Barcelona), an area in which  the central offices are also located and the commercial  centres of Massimo Dutti, Oysho and Bershka, and where  it has its logistical platform. In this new location, which  is larger and nearer to its logistical operations, Uterqe  and its design and commercial teams are prepared to  continue to grow globally.  For Uterqe, just as for some of Inditex's other chains,  2011 was the year of its online commercial launch in six  European markets (Germany, Spain, France, Portugal,  the United Kingdom and Switzerland). For its internet  store, the chain decided on a careful image with the aim  of faithfully reflecting the quality of its materials and  products, and a professional service to its customers,  as both the quality of the products and its customer  services are two key elements in the chain's identity. www.uterque.com  - 42 - Customers  - 43 - annual report 2011 For Inditex business model, customers are at the heart  of any activity. Processes of the Group revolve around its  customers decisions and needs, both from the fashion  point of view and in all the other aspects that complete  the purchasing experience, including quality, safe and  sustainable products, local stores in the main shopping  areas of cities and superb attention from the staff.   For this reason, Inditex's commitment to the customer is  expressed in the social responsibility policy that inspires  all the activities of the Group. From the store, where their  requirements are noted; to the tables of the designers,  who transform those wishes into fashion proposals; and  including the production processes to make the garments  and the logistical distribution, which are all carried out in  accordance with the highest standards of quality, safety  and environmental sustainability.  From this year onwards, this commitment by Inditex to the  customer broadens its spectrum with the online launch of  all the chains in the Group. The internet stores that Zara  and Zara Home already had were joined by the remainder  of the chains in the Group (Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti,  Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho and Uterqe) in a range of  European countries. All of them have the latest trends  and the same level of rigour as in the physical stores.  In fact, the internet, together with the social networks,  has become one of the main barometers of customer  satisfaction of all the brands in the Inditex Group. Zara's  web site, for example, now has over a million daily visits  and on Facebook, Inditex chains have over 21 million  followers.  Inditex's commitment to  its customers is increased  with interaction through  online stores  - 44 - customers Quality products The commitment to our customers in the sphere of the  product includes the application of the most demanding  international regulations in the matter of health and safety.  For this purpose, throughout the last decade, Inditex has  developed two internal standards on product health and  safety (Clear to Wear and Safe to Wear) in collaboration  with the University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain).  Clear to Wear ensures the healthiness of the product  and Safe to Wear guarantees its safety. Both standards  are constantly updated, for the purposes of meeting  the most exacting requirements regarding product  quality worldwide, and compliance thereof is mandatory  for all Groups suppliers. Moreover, Inditex conducts  programmes to certify implementation and supervision,  and it does so in co-operation and dialogue with business  associations, suppliers, manufacturers and auxiliary  firms. A constant effort is made so that the procedures  of analysis and monitoring are more and more rigorous,  rapid and sensitive. The acceptance of the standards on the part of the  Group's suppliers is accompanied by regular inspections  of the production processes and continuous analyses of  the products. In 2011, over 250,000 chemical analyses  of products were carried out, as well as 1,900 factory  inspection visits and 17,000 tests and analyses.  This policy guarantees that none of Inditex's garments  involves risks to the health or safety of the customer.  Clear to Wear and  Safe to Wear are being  continuously updated  to always meet the best  quality standards Safety standard The Safe to Wear protocol guarantees that the  articles marketed by Inditex do not present any  problem for the physical safety of customers.  In this regard, Safe to Wear delimits the  characteristics that the following elements must  have when they are present in our products:  - Laces and cords in clothing for those younger  than fourteen years.  - The small parts in articles for those under  three years of age. - Objects with pointed/sharp edges. - The inflammability of products. Health standard The Clear to Wear standard – which must be  compulsory and generally enforced in respect of  all apparel, footwear, accessories, haberdashery  and fabrics –aims at sizing the composition of  each garment, to meet the most exacting quality  levels.  Clear to Wear includes four kinds of provisions  which are obligatory for all Inditex suppliers:  - Substances of legally limited use. - Substances not included in any legislation,  but which might mean a risk to health. - Legally limited parameters. - Provisions from European regulations:  Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and  Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).  - 45 - annual report 2011 Sustainable products Inditex's commitment to responsible manufacturing  inevitably includes respect for the environment. The  Sustainable Inditex plan 2011-2015 brings together the  objectives of the Group strategy in the matter of water  and natural resources management. In the first case,  it is a question of measuring and managing the water  footprint of products, as well as the reduction and  optimization of the consumption of water in all Inditex  activities and its value chain. On the other hand, the  use of textile fibres obtained from traditional production  systems and of sustainable fibres which avoid the  contamination of soils and water is encouraged. In this  regard, Inditex is collaborating, in the framework of its  Green Code programme, with organic and conventional  cotton farmers to evaluate the environmental impact of  both systems, with very positive results on the options for  reuse of the waste generated.  Moreover, several chains from the Group have created  lines and collections of 100% organic cotton in accordance  with the OE100 standard. In 2011, Zara marketed 1.9  million units of 100% organic cotton.  In accordance with this same philosophy, Inditex  purchased in 2011 over 1,000 tons of tencel, a fibre  which is manufactured from eucalyptus wood and which  is totally biodegradable, while at the same time being  especially suitable for sensitive skin as it does not cause  any cutaneous irritations.  At the Shareholders Meeting in 2011, held in July, the  Chairman of Inditex, Pablo Isla, announced that the Group  was supporting two of the international organisations that  are most representative in boosting policies of environmental  and natural resource management: Better Cotton Initiative  and The CEO Water Mandate. Policy on the use of animal-skin products Inditex applies standards for the responsible manufacture  of its products as regards the use of elements of animal  skin (leather) and of skin with hair (fur). In the first case,  the Group uses skin which comes exclusively from  animals raised on farms for providing food and under no  circumstances from animals killed exclusively in order  to market their skins. As regards fur, or skin with hair,  Inditex does not use this product, wherever it comes from. Inditex is also a member of the Leather Working Group (LWG),  which develops a protocol of environmental auditing  to evaluate and promote environmental practices that  are more sustainable within the leather industry (more  information on page 61).  Better Cotton Initiative is a not-for-profit association  which brings together farmers, manufacturers  and distributors whose activity is related with  cotton and which has as its objective to ensure  that cultivation is carried out in a manner which  improves the living conditions for the producers  and has a positive impact on the environment. The  regions which currently incorporate BCI practices  are India, Pakistan, Mali and Brazil, among others.  www.bettercotton.org Inditex is also a member of the Textile  Exchange (TE), an NGO which encourages the  most sustainable textile practices, especially  regarding the cultivation of organic cotton.  www.textileexchange.org The CEO Water Mandate is a programme  included in the Global Compact initiative of  the United Nations to promote appropriate  and sustainable water management, a unique  resource which is indispensable and scarce.  Inditex has undertaken to guarantee and  encourage  sustainable  solutions  regarding  the use and management of water in each  one of the six areas covered by The CEO Water  Mandate: direct operations, management of the  supply chain, collective action, public policy,  participation of the community and transparency.   www.ceowatermandate.org  - 46 - customers Clean logistical distribution In customer satisfaction, Inditex's rapid and effective  logistics plays a key role. Inditex's distribution process  is designed to ensure that the in-store options are  constantly refreshed. All products, independently of their  origin, are distributed to the stores from the logistical  centres of each one of the chains in the Group, in such  a manner that every store in the world receives goods  twice a week, and each shipment includes new models.  This system makes it possible to get the products from  the distribution centre to European stores in an average  of 24 hours, and in 48 hours to those of America and  Asia.  The transport and distribution operations are carried out  in their totality by external operators with the result that  the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with  these activities are classified as scope 3 in accordance  with the criteria of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG  Protocol), the international tool used by most companies  and institutions to measure GHG emissions. The Group has developed a software tool to calculate  these emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol  and at the same time to propose plans for reducing  them to the different logistical operators. In 2011, it was  implemented at Tempe and is at the design phase for  Zara. With regard to the logistical centres, from which all  shipments to all Inditex stores around the world are  managed, they are all in Spain, close to the headquarters  of each of the chains and, just like the corporate  headquarters of each brand, they are built and managed  with criteria of sustainability. All the Inditex logistics  centres have an Environmental Management System  which is certified in accordance with the ISO 14001  standard and all the employees have had environmental  training.  In 2011, the final extensions of the logistical centres in  Elche (Alicante) and Tordera (Barcelona) were completed.  Both extensions were carried out on the basis of energy  innovation criteria established within the Inditex IEMA  (Energy and Environmental Integration) project for  concepts such as insulation, lighting and efficient use of  energy.The new logistics centre at Tordera (Barcelona)  is one of Inditex's most important distribution centres.  Made up of five buildings with a total built area of  approximately 200,000 square metres, it supplies the  stores of Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Oysho and Uterqe. The new extension to the centre, with approximately  100,000 square metres of built area, has achieved  the LEED Gold Preliminary Certificate and it is hoped  that in 2012 it will achieve the definitive LEED Gold  certificate. In the extension of the distribution centre,  criteria of sustainability have been integrated such as  the sustainable location (a plot without any significant  environmental value), efficiency measures in water  consumption, in energy and lighting and the use of  materials that are respectful to the environment or are  recycled.  The objective is to reduce  the emissions of greenhouse  gases (GHG) in logistical  activity by 20% by 2020,  taking 2005 as the reference   - 47 - annual report 2011 Energy efficiency in logistics centres Within the Sustainable Inditex 2011-2015 Plan and as  an extension of the Inditex Strategic Environmental  Plan 2007-2010, the Inditex Pro Kyoto project has  as its general objective to reduce the CO2 emissions  associated with Inditex's activities of transport and  distribution. Both plans include periodic improvements  in the logistical centres initiated in 2007 and which  include the use of efficient lighting, appropriate systems  of insulation, systems of control of air-conditioning and  the use of bicycles for internal movements of employees.  Furthermore, in order to improve the energy efficiency  renewable energies and high-efficiency tri-generation  are used.  The objective is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse  gases (GHG) by 20% by 2020, taking 2005 as the reference.  As part of this project, the following measures were taken  in 2011:  - Transportation audits for route optimization at  Pull&Bear. - Evaluations of Tempe and Zara transport  suppliers. - Purchase of a fleet of electrical vehicles and  electric motor bikes for internal use at the logistical  centres in Arteixo (A Corua), Tordera (Barcelona) and  Elche (Alicante). - Creation of charging points at all the logistical  centres which have electric vehicles. - Awareness-raising actions for the employees  to encourage sustainable mobility among employees,  customers and logistical operators. - Start up of a 1 MW tri-generation plant at the  logistics centre in Tordera-Palafolls (Barcelona). This  energy plant uses Cummins C995 N5C natural gas  motors with a low level of emissions and with electrical  performance of more than 40%, which will mean a  saving of 15% in the consumption of primary energy  and 25% in the costs of thermal energy, preventing the  annual emission of 1,400 tons of CO2. - Beginning of the High-Efficiency Logistics  Centre project to maximise the energy efficiency  per square metre at the distribution centres which  will be started up in 2012 and will make it possible  to significantly reduce the use of energy, water and  waste generation. Reuse of cardboard and recycling Reuse of the material and recycling amount to work that  is rooted in the tasks of both logistics centres and stores.  One example is the reuse and recycling of cardboard. The  cardboard boxes used in the transport of products from  the logistical centres to the stores are reused between six  and eight times. The stores return them to the logistical  centres together with the plastic coat hangers and the  alarms on the garments, which will also be reused or  recycled if they cannot be used any more. In 2011, three  millions kilograms of recycled cardboard were used.  Inditexs power consumption is detailed in the Environmental  Indicators Schedule (page 259). Bicycles for employees at the Tempe facilities in Elche (Alicante).  - 48 - customers Eco-efficient stores The store is the setting in which Inditex's unique business  model starts and ends, with the customer as its main  asset. It is the place at which the customer's wishes  are channeled, regarding both fashion and the optimum  purchasing experience in a suitable environment. In this  way, in all the store projects carried out by the architectural  studies of the Group chains, eco-efficiency and respect for  the environment are key aspects, taking into account the  levels of energy consumption in the stores.  Inditex stores have the most innovative technology in  energy management and saving, making it possible to  reduce carbon dioxide emissions (CO2). Since 2007, over  800 eco-efficient stores have been built around the world  and the objective is that in 2020 all the Group's stores  should be eco-efficient. The sustainability and efficiency  measures in these stores make it possible to save 30% on  electricity and 50% on water consumption.  In this regard, the actions collected in the Inditex Sustainable  Plan 2011-2015 relating to stores show different objectives  for those that already exist and new stores.  Eco-alterations  In stores opened before 2005, eco-alterations are being  carried out to achieve a reduction in electricity consumption  of up to 30%. For this purpose, the lighting is renewed,  including high-efficiency lamps; the air-conditioning  equipment is replaced with more efficient class A models,  guaranteeing the absence of gases that are prejudicial to  the ozone layer, among other measures.  Up to the present, a system of centralised control and  management of lighting and air-conditioning has been  installed in 318 stores. In the period 2010-11, ninety- seven stores have been renovated in Spain, and over the  next four years, another 852 stores will be renovated in  Spain, Portugal, France, Italy and Germany.  Moreover, all Inditex Group stores have wooden furniture  with an FSC or PEFC certificate, which guarantee that the  wood comes from woodlands managed in a sustainable  and responsible manner, just like the paper bags and the  labels used in the Group. Plastic bags are manufactured  with d2w. This ingredient facilitates faster biodegradation  and makes recycling easier.  Newly-opened stores For the Group's new stores, the work includes the  implementation of an Environmental Management System  and centralised control which makes possible a continual  improvement of the environmental parameters, as well  as the identification of new eco-materials for building and  techniques of optimization of packaging and containers.  The application of these sustainability criteria has meant  that several chains in the Group already have certification  of the maximum possible recognition in the matter of  sustainable building and energy efficiency. In 2011, the  first Bershka store in Germany and the first Pull&Bear  in Rotterdam (Holland) received the LEED Platinum  certification, the highest award of the US Green Building  Council, one of the most demanding organisations in the  world in sustainable architecture.  The Bershka store in Berlin, with two sales floors and an  impressive faade, is located on Tauentzienstrae, one  of the main shopping areas in the heart of the German  capital. Among the measures adopted in the design and  construction of the store which have allowed it to obtain  the LEED Platinum seal, the most important are:  - Insulation  which  avoids  sudden  changes  of  temperature in the interior of the premises, including  30% plant covering on the roof of the building.  - A lighting system which makes it possible to save  30% in comparison with a traditional store.  - A system of selective collection of recyclable  materials and specific systems of recycling for coat  hangers, alarms and transport packaging.  - The materials such as stone, flooring or surface  coatings are free of contaminating substances which  might be freed during its useful lifetime or as waste. - Centralised and independent systems for measuring  different consumptions, which manage to keep energy  savings constant and to rapidly detect any incidents. - A double front doorway with automatic opening which  makes it possible to maintain the internal temperature  with less energy use.  Tempe - the company that designs, manufactures and  distributes the footwear and accessories for the eight  commercial formats of the Inditex Group - has also  achieved milestones in the matter of energy efficiency. Its  outlet store, inaugurated in October 2010 in Elche (Alicante),  in 2011 received the Energy Classification A granted by the  Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade through  the AVEN (Valencian Energy Agency). The A classification  means that the store is at the maximum level in terms of  building energy efficiency. Tempe's outlet store forms part  of the network of stores in the For&from project for the  integration of people who are at risk of social exclusion.  The model of the eco-efficient store is in on-going  development.  New  characteristics  and  technical  requirements are incorporated so as to continue  improving the model's energy efficiency and reduce  environmental impact both during construction and day- to-day operations of the store.  - 49 - annual report 2011 Pull&Bear  Linjbaan St - Rotterdam - Holland Pull&Bear began its commercial activity in Holland in  2011 with stores in Tilburg, the Hague and Rotterdam.  In Rotterdam, the eco-efficient store obtained the  LEED Platinum classification. The store consumes 30%  less energy in comparison with the average annual  consumption of a conventional store and uses 40% less  water.   - 50 - customers Bershka  Tauentzienstrasse - Berlin - Germany The Bershka store in Berlin is the first one of this chain  in Germany and has obtained the LEED certification in  the Platinum category. The Bershka store in Berlin, with  two sales floors and an impressive faade, is located on  Tauentzienstrae, one of the main shopping areas in the  heart of the German capital. The store, with a commercial  area of 1,500 m2, is one of Bershkas largest anywhere in  the world.  - 51 - annual report 2011 Customer Care Customer service is one of the fundamental pillars  around which the Inditex human resources policy is  built. In the periodic training sessions for the store  operatives, customer care is one of the main subjects.  In addition, customers have other communication  channels with the Group for resolving any questions  regarding products or the organisation that could not  be dealt with in the store. Both the chains and the  Group's headquarters have specialised professional  teams who offer personalised care to all customers  who require it, by phone, e-mail or post. With the  aim of making the service as personal as possible,  consultations are dealt with in several languages.  The opening by all the chains of their respective online  store has meant a further step in customer services,  with the development of specific departments for each  of the countries. At the same time, the store employees  of each one of the chains in the Group have received  specific training in customer services online, given that  purchasers can pick up the goods bought on the internet  at any of the chain's corresponding physical stores.  In 2011, Inditex's different channels of customer services  responded to almost 172,000 enquiries, 40% more  than the previous year. These enquiries were raised  by consumers via the e-mail of the different chains,  Inditex.com or by telephone. As regards complaints,  customers made a total of 4,577 complaints to the  Spanish consumer authorities in 2011. This amounts to  one complaint for every 64,619 garments on sale, a very  low figure, which serves as an indicator of the level of  customer satisfaction.  Affinity Card The Affinity Card is the Inditex Group card and it operates  as a means of payment which is valid in any of the stores  of the eight chains: Zara, Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti,  Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Zara Home and Uterqe  in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Mexico. Customers  resident in Spain have been able to enjoy the financial  advantages and the different forms of payment offered  by this card for over 15 years. The Affinity Card also has  holders in Mexico and Greece, where it was launched in  2007; Portugal, where it arrived one year later, and Italy,  where it has been available since 2010. Adding together  the cardholders from these five countries, Affinity Card  already has over 1.3 million adherents.  In order to attend to the cardholders in a more individual  manner, Affinity Card has a web page in each of the  countries where it is available. In the case of Spain, the  affinitycard.es website had more than 350,000 visits  during 2011, 30% more than the previous year. Through  the web site, the Affinity Card holders can make any  question or suggestion known, or can take a look at  the statements and movements on their cards. 115,000  persons in Spain receive the Affinity newsletter, which  comes out monthly and includes information on fashion  trends and the latest commercial news from the Group's  fashion brands.  During 2011, Affinity Card carried out the third edition of  its campaign, Shop in the City, which allows the Inditex  Group cardholders to enjoy an exclusive advisory service  on design with a professional image consultant. Over  7,000 people took part in this campaign, which recorded  over 36,000 operations.  - 52 - customers Zara  Bourke St - Melbourne - Australia This store is located on the main shopping street in  Melbourne. Of particular interest is the restoration and  rebuilding work carried out by the construction and  architectural teams on the ornaments on the front, giving  a beautiful commercial faade back to the city. For Zara,  2011 meant entry into five new markets: Azerbaijan,  Taiwan, South Africa, Peru and Australia. With its arrival  in Australia, Inditex has consolidated its position as a  global fashion retailer, with a presence on five continents.  This commitment to the Southern hemisphere is clearly  reflected in the specific team of designers that Zara has  to prepare exclusive options for this part of the world.   - 53 - annual report 2011  - 54 - Suppliers  - 55 - annual report 2011 Inditex selects suppliers all over the world to produce  its collections and has an extensive supply chain with a  presence in over 40 countries. The fact that a significant  part of its supplies are carried out in areas close to the  headquarters of each of the chains (where the design and  logistics teams are located) makes possible a rapid and  flexible response to the market.  Inditex's production needs increase each year and, for  this reason, it is one of the Group's strategic priorities  to ensure the sustainability of its supply chain, both  through the fulfilment of the Code of Conduct for External  Manufacturers and Suppliers, which has been in force  since 2001, and the strictest standards for product quality,  health and safety.  Inditex ensures that all its suppliers and external  workshops undertake to comply with such Code. The  entire Group participates in this task coordinated by the  Department of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). In  order to carry out its policy, Inditex has local Corporate  Social Responsibility teams in India, Bangladesh, Turkey,  China, Morocco, Brazil, Portugal and Spain, which work  with the objective of offering and guaranteeing customers  of any of the brands of which Inditex is made up a product  which has been prepared with maximum respect for  the Fundamental Employment Standards as well as the  strictest requirements which are progressively added to  the regulations. The internal Corporate Social Responsibility teams,  supported also by external staff, are responsible for  developing programmes of various kinds, evaluating the  fulfilment of the requirements mentioned in the factories  which make up the Inditex supply chain and helping with  their implementation. In both cases, monitoring and  guaranteeing the fulfilment of the employment conditions  of the workers in the factories and also in environmental  matters.  Conscious that the fulfilment of the employment and  environmental legislation is a point which requires  a continuous process of improvement in the textile  industry, Inditex has the key support of its groups of  interest, which basically include trade unions, NGOs,  business associations, governments and members  of civil society, who participate in dialogue platforms,  clusters, the Social Council and other tools that Inditex  has developed to guarantee their active participation in  these activities. Inditex considers that these activities  are only successful if they start off with a joint effort and  that, even though it is indispensable, Inditex cannot work  alone. For this reason, work goes on all over the world  with independent organizations and institutions that  are working for the same goals. Two of them must be  mentioned in a very special way, both for their defence  and encouragement of the application of Human Rights  and for their contribution to the improvement of the  employment conditions of the workers: Global Compact  and Ethical Trading Initiative. The participation of Inditex during the 2011 financial  year in the United Nations Global Compact Supply Chain  Sustainability Advisory Group, with the aim of pooling best  practices in the sustainable management of the supply  chains has made it possible for the group to advance by  sharing and applying the best practices in sustainability  at the world level in the matter of suppliers.

(**) Suppliers discarded for breaches of the Inditex Code of Conduct or commercial reasons.  - 56 - suppliers The monitoring and improvement  of the supply chain:   This is how our teams work Guaranteeing satisfactory working conditions for each  one of the employees of Inditex manufacturers and  suppliers is an indispensable and non-negotiable  condition in the Group's business model. The policy of  Corporate Social Responsibility at Inditex in relation  with its suppliers has as its main instrument the Code  of Conduct, which is binding on everybody. Apart from  the express commitment to the Code by all the suppliers  acceptance  involves  inclusion  on  the  fulfilment  programme for the Code of Conduct.  This programme is put into effect mainly via periodic  audits, carried out both by Inditex's internal teams  of Corporate Social Responsibility and by external  auditors, whose aim it is to detect the areas in which  improvements need to be introduced. Inditex applies  a zero tolerance policy with certain practices, such  as under-age working, forced labour or the breach of  proper salary policies.  The detection of a breach involves the immediate  commencement of a Corrective Action Plan, which sets  objectives and deadlines. If suppliers wish to keep their  business relationship with Inditex, the factories and  workshops associated with them must implement those  correction plans, and to do so, they rely on the direct  collaboration and involvement of Inditex CSR teams.  Inditex's objective with this policy is not only to  eradicate undesirable practices in its supply chain  but also to promote the continual improvement of  the working conditions among its suppliers. In this  regard, its commitment is expressed also in its work  on international dialogue platforms such as the  Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), which brings together the  companies, trade unions and NGOs in the struggle for  improvement in working conditions at the world level,  or its agreement for global action with the International  Textile, Garment and Leather Workers Federation  (ITGLWF). Inditex's internal and external audit teams are made up  of over 270 professionals around the world. These teams  are responsible for verifying that all suppliers fulfil the  Inditex Code of Conduct for External Manufacturers and  Suppliers and also for guiding those who wish to have  more sustainable factories. The fulfilment programme  is made up of six phases:  - 57 - annual report 2011 1.- Raising awareness Internal training for the teams of Inditex buyers in  the matter of the Code of Conduct, and all its updated  versions. It also includes training and awareness raising  for all those suppliers who have shown interest in forming  part of the Group supply chain. In order to carry out these  activities the Corporate Social Responsibility Department  has training materials which set out the contents of  the Inditex Minimum Requirements: the set of Inditex  requirements in social, employment and environmental  matters as well as product health and safety. 2.- Self-evaluation by suppliers   (pre-assessment)  A tool for self-diagnosis for Inditex's potential suppliers with  which they analyse themselves in the matter of fulfilment  of the Code of Conduct for External Manufacturers  and Suppliers, standards of product health and safety,  environmental standards and the capacity for commercial  response. The supplier must sign the Inditex Minimum  Requirements in order to be able to receive its first order  from Inditex. During 2011, updates have been added to the pre- assessment questionnaire in order to adapt to the most  demanding social, environmental and employment  legislation.  3.- Audits Further  to  the  adherence  to  Inditex  Minimum  Requirements, Inditex CSR teams conduct a social audit  within the facilities of the suppliers and within the factories  and workshops they work with. This audit, carried out  both through independent external social auditors and  internal Corporate Social Responsibility teams from  Inditex, includes unannounced visits to the facilities,  interviews with the factory managers, employees, trade  union representatives, representatives regarding health  and safety; documentary review (management systems,  salaries, hours worked, production, documentation of  workers and licences); and review of waste management,  emissions and consumption of resources, mainly.  Unauthorised subcontracting is not permitted. If there  are factories that are sub-contracted by a supplier, they  have to fulfil all Inditex requirements in the same way and  must likewise submit to the requirements of audit and of  the Code of Conduct set down for direct suppliers.  In order to detect possible cases of unauthorised sub- contracting, the Inditex Corporate Social Responsibility  teams have a range of tools which serve as the basis  to evaluate and compare the productive capacity of the  supplier.

PR Supplier: In an auditing process  Basic fulfilment of the Code of Conduct  - 59 - annual report 2011 5.- Application of corrective action plans  Inditex's philosophy is to grow and improve together with its  suppliers, with the result that the social audits are always  completed with proposals for solutions to the breaches  detected. Inditex`s Corporate Social Responsibility teams  actively support suppliers interested in continuing to work  with the Group with corrective action plans which have  as their objective remedying the breaches. All the parties  involved (factory managers, local and international trade  unions and the Inditex Corporate Social Responsibility  teams, among others) participate in these plans. 6.- Monitoring programmes After drawing up the specific corrective action plans  for the supplier, audits are established for monitoring  purposes which include unannounced visits to verify that  the improvements agreed have been carried out within the  deadlines set. According to the level of rating obtained by  the supplier in the initial audit, the monitoring audits are  carried out in different periods.  As a consequence of the correction plans, the classifications  of the Inditex suppliers improve as the duration of the  relationship with our Group continues. Among the suppliers  whose relationship with Inditex is less than one year, the  sum of the A and B classifications is less than 40% of the  total. This percentage rises to 57% with the suppliers who  have been working for the Group for at least two years and to  77% among those who have been working for at least three  years. The volume of production from suppliers classified  as A or B rises every year, reaching a total of 89% in 2011.  Protocol for the Prevention of Child Labour  One of the most relevant points in the strategy for the  implementation of the Inditex Code of Conduct for  External Manufacturers and Suppliers is the prevention  of child labour. In 2009, Inditex designed, in collaboration  with the ITGLWF, a protocol of action for the prevention  of child labour in the supply chain. The protocol is based  on the best practices in the industry and includes the  main Conventions and Recommendations established  by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in relation  with the prevention of child labour. Furthermore, it is in  line with the UN framework, Protect, Respect, Remedy. Likewise, in 2012, Inditex will go more deeply into aspects  such as: — Training of internal social auditors in techniques  of social auditing. — Establishment of pilot projects in the matter of  monitoring and prevention of child labour.  — Implementation of processes of improvement  of the procedures and systems of formal management in  suppliers and manufacturers which make up the supply  chain.  12 months 18 months 24 months 6 months Supplier A Supplier B Supplier C Supplier D Classification of the suppliers according to the years of commercial relations with Inditex  Period of time for the conduct of audits according to the rating A B C D PR 100% 80% 70% 90% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% Between one and   three years Over three years Less than one year 22.55% 17.33% 7.93% 9.6% 42.59% 34.19% 41.32% 22.88% 35.37% 12.16% 6.58% 4.57% 12.08% 9.77% 21.08%  - 60 - suppliers Training in product health and safety Inditex,  in  collaboration  with  scientific  and  technological institutions and companies, has started  up a programme of training support for its suppliers on  specific and relevant aspects of the Inditex health and  safety protocols Clear to Wear and Safe to Wear. During  the 2011 financial year, twelve training meetings have  been held, attended by 358 suppliers.  Furthermore, best practice manuals for suppliers have  been designed as well as guidebooks for identifying  risks of dyeing for textile and leather products,  procedures for the improvement of solidity to rubbing,  responsible dyeing procedures, and analysis of the  origin of breaches in colour solidity and the composition  of textiles. These manuals are the result of technological innovation  actions aimed at resolving specific quality problems and  are carried out in collaboration mainly with companies  in the sectors of dyeing, printing and chemical products.  The  procedures  developed  supply  technological  alternatives to the methods used up to now and present  important competitive advantages which facilitate the  production of articles of higher quality, minimise the  use of chemicals, water and energy; they fulfil the most  demanding requirements of environmental control and  help the garments manufactured using these processes  to perfectly fulfil the provisions of Clear to Wear and Safe  to Wear. Sandblasting techniques The process of sandblasting consists of a process of  wear, especially of denim, for which an air compressor  is needed. This process, carried out without proper  protection, represents a high risk regarding the generation  of silicosis in the workers who carry it out.  The techniques of sandblasting are strictly prohibited in  Inditexs working practices. In 2010, the Group carried  out research with its suppliers to guarantee that only  techniques which did not put their workers health and  safety at risk were used. This process eventually led  in 2011 to the signature of the Call for a global ban on  apparel sandblasting, promoted by the ITGLWF, and  under which Inditex undertakes to: — Prohibit the practice of sandblasting and to  guarantee its eradication. — Working with suppliers to ensure alternative  methods. During 2011, moreover, Inditex started a process of  continuous monitoring of all laundries used by its  suppliers, starting from the general methods of auditing  which are used by its fulfilment teams and from a specific  methodology for the identification of the processes of  wear used in laundries.

Green Code Inditex Project  Green Code is a project to give a boost to the environmental  policy for application to the supply chain and industrial  processes of Inditex. It forms part of the Inditex Minimum  Requirements and includes criteria of environmental  evaluation and monitoring of suppliers.  The Green Code responds to the following specific  objectives:  — Getting to know in detail the specific environmental  problems at each stage of production of the Inditex supply  chain. — Identifying and controlling the environmental risks  associated with the supply chain. — Establishing  programmes  of  environmental  improvement in the supply chain.  — Anticipating and giving a response to the  concerns of external organisations in environmental  matters.  — Anticipating and giving a response to future  legislation which is more restrictive. The Green Code project has two implementation phases.  The first (2011-2012) includes the conduct of analyses of  effluent and waste management processes, and the design  of tools of evaluation and control of suppliers. Within this  phase, in 2011, three pilot projects in Spain, Portugal and  Turkey were completed to identify, measure and evaluate  the value chain of a cotton T-shirt.  The results of the pilot projects satisfy a double objective.  On the one hand, they define future areas or lines of  action to improve sustainability of products and, on the  other, they supply training to the teams for creation of  products and design to get to know the environmental  implications of their decisions. In the second phase (2013-2014), plans for environmental  improvement  will  be  established  with  continual  evaluations in the supply chain and studies will be carried  out of new alternatives for processes and chemical  compounds.  Leather Working Group (LWG) LWG is a working group created in 2005 to develop a  protocol of environmental auditing which would make it  possible to evaluate the fulfilment and the environmental  practices of the tanneries and which, in turn, promotes  more sustainable environmental practices in the leather  industry.  LWG aims to improve the sustainability of the tanning  industry, by working in a transparent manner through  the participation and representation of brands, tanneries,  retailers and other interested parties in the sector. The  group also enjoys the participation of the main centres of  excellence and research of the sector and the review of  the auditing system by non-governmental organisations,  academic institutions and other interested organisations.  As a member of LWG, Inditex will evaluate and measure,  in a rigorous manner, the technical-environmental  processes of tanneries and the capacity to define  improvements with its suppliers. The audits will be  carried out by leather industry experts. In November 2011, Inditex signed to join the  Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC). This organisation  brings together the textile companies which share  the objective of reducing the possible social and  environmental impacts associated with its activity.  Inditex is participating actively in the preparation  of the Sustainable Apparel Index, which will make it  possible to evaluate the environmental and social  performance of all stages of the textile production  process, and which will be published in 2012. Through  this index, it will be possible to define priorities and  opportunities for improvement in the use and quality  of water, in the reduction of energy and greenhouse  gases, in waste management and in the use of  chemicals.  - 62 - suppliers Framework Agreement between  Inditex and the ITGLWF During 2011, important advances were made both in the  management and in the projects carried out based on  the international Framework Agreement signed between  the International Textile Garments and Leather Workers  Federation (ITGLWF which unites 217 local trade unions in  the textile sector in 110 countries) and Inditex to ensure  the fulfilment of the Fundamental Labour Rights in the  Inditex supply chain.  The Framework Agreement defines the environment  in which the labour relations must be developed, with  the firm commitment to advance towards a greater  integration of the shared processes of action. For this  reason, in September 2011, the "Statement of Intentions  to extend the role of Trade Unions in the application of the  International Framework Agreement within the Inditex  Supply Chain" was signed. This agreement increases  the capacity for action of the local and international  trade unions as well as the mutual responsibilities  when dealing with the challenges which a global supply  chain involves. To be exact, through signing the above- mentioned statement of intentions aspects such as the  following were developed: — The strengthening of the supplier monitoring  system. — Access to a detailed list of suppliers and  external manufacturers on the part of the ITGLWF. — The participation of the members of local trade  unions in the processes of monitoring suppliers. — Involvement of the members of the local trade  unions in the development of the corrective action  plans.  — The promotion of mature industrial relations  in the supply chain starting from the application of  training courses to workers, managers and trade  union representatives.  During 2011, several joint interventions were carried out in  the sphere of the Framework Agreement between Inditex  and the ITGLWF for the protection of the Fundamental  Labour Rights in the supply chain. The following are  some of these interventions: India Turkey Brazil Date of joint intervention of ITGLWF - Inditex: 25-07-2011 17-08-2011 01-09-2011 Number of workers involved 7 55 15 Date on which dispute was settled Settled during the   2012 financial year 04-01-2012 19-12-2011 Parties involved Management of the factory/factories    Other international frameworks present at the negotiations   Local organisation of workers' representatives    ITGLWF    Other agents of the third sector   Conclusions Compensation to the workers   Guarantee of the right to Freedom of Association and Collective  Negotiation   Start of a process of dialogue aimed at developing mature industrial  relations between management and workers   - 63 - annual report 2011 Turkey Project One of these interventions took place in one of the most  important textile-sector companies in Turkey, to be exact,  in two of its factories, with over 1,000 workers each.  In late 2010, the local trade union, TEKSTF, began intense  affiliation activity in the workplaces which was made  more difficult in some aspects by the management,  which contravened the Inditex Code of Conduct. On the  basis of the Framework Agreement, the ITGLWF alerted  Inditex of the situation and an intense process of work was  begun jointly for the verification of the facts and to bring  about talks between the parties involved, culminating  in a meeting held in Istanbul with the participation of  Turkish and international trade union representatives,  the company and Inditex. At the end of January 2011,  and after a round of negotiations between the parties,  an agreement was reached with the presence of ITGLWF,  Inditex, the local trade union and the management of the  company in two main aspects: 1) Formal recognition of the local trade union as a  valid interlocutor by the company.  2) Programming of the beginning of collective  negotiation of the company agreement at the moment  at which the trade union obtained the representation  demanded by the Turkish legislation.  This activity is an example of the experience of  implementation of the Framework Agreement for the  improvement of and respect for the working conditions of  the workers in the Inditex supply chain, which is added to  the activities carried out with the ITGLWF in the context of  the application of the Framework Agreement during 2011  in Bangladesh, India and Brazil, among others. Cambodia Project In September 2010, clothing workers in Cambodia were  dismissed from their jobs for having taken part in a  national strike demanding an increase in the minimum  salary in the sector.  Since the beginning of the conflict, Inditex, jointly with  the ITGLWF, and in collaboration with the interest groups  involved - C.CAWDU, GMAC and ILO-Better Factories  Cambodia, mainly-, have carried out different actions  on the ground with the aim of ensuring the rights of free  association and collective negotiation.  During 2011, as a fruit of these actions, the peaceful  resolution of the conflicts which had arisen at some of  Inditexs suppliers in Cambodia was achieved through the  signature of two statements of intent, which included a  consensus on the following:  — The re-admission of the 164 workers who were  suspended or dismissed as a consequence of their  participation in the September strikes.  — Making the payments corresponding to the  whole salaries of the suspended or dismissed workers. — The withdrawal of all the charges made against  the workers who had taken part in the strikes. These agreements are intended to be the driving force  for change so that, as is set down in the international  protocols, the local agents - trade unions and  manufacturers, mainly - are able to achieve the peaceful  resolution of conflicts at the local level, relative to the  mediation of the Cambodian government in the process  of conciliation by means of sending the cases to an  arbitration tribunal created for the purpose.  Finally, Inditex in collaboration with the ITGLWF, has  designed a training plan for those factories which make  up its supply chain in Cambodia with the aim of supplying  both the workers and the factory management with  suitable knowledge in the matter of Fundamental Labour  Rights to avoid potential conflicts in the future.   - 64 - suppliers Clusters of suppliers Currently, Inditex is promoting seven business clusters  in relevant countries in its supply chain: Portugal,  Morocco, Turkey, India, Bangladesh, China and Brazil.  With the consolidation in 2011 of the activities of the  clusters in China and Brazil, the management structures  of suppliers through the model of clusters, including  Spain, represents 87% of Inditexs total production.  The clusters of suppliers are defined as spaces of  co-operation made up of suppliers, manufacturers,  trade unions, business associations and international  purchasers with the common objective of promoting  a sustainable productive environment in a strategic  geographical area for the development of the Inditex  business model and within a framework based on the  fulfilment of the Fundamental Labour Rights.  Main activities in the clusters in 2011 PoRTuGAL After signing an agreement in 2010 between Inditex and the  Portuguese Catholic University (Oporto) for the training  of social auditors in Portugal, in 2011, the relations with  this university have been extended for the development  of activities of strengthening the supply chain. Moreover,  through the local Inditex Corporate Social Responsibility  office in this country, training has been given to social  auditors in the methodology of verification and courses  have been given to 29 suppliers on product health and  safety.  TuRkey Although the Inditex cluster in Turkey has been  operative for several years, the Group gave a boost in  2011 to the Corporate Social Responsibility work in this  country with the establishment of an office with a local  team. Through this local team and the external agents  involved in the cluster, a project of consolidation of the  country's supply chain (Evliya Celebi Project) has been  carried out to get to know the most sensitive matters  which affect the sector. Educational projects have also  been carried out:  — Training in the requirements of the Inditex Code  of Conduct given to 135 factories of 34 suppliers.  — Training of social auditors in the methodology  of verification. — Training to 31 suppliers in the matter of product  health and safety.   - 65 - annual report 2011 MoRoCCo  During this year, activities of monitoring of the supply  chain have been carried out in collaboration with the  internal purchasing teams and the implementation of  corrective action plans in some suppliers. Regarding  training, that given to local auditors on the Inditex  methodology of verification and the training that has been  received by the suppliers on product health and safety are  particularly important.  ChInA Inditex has consolidated its activities in this country's  cluster with the establishment of a permanent office  for the local Corporate Social Responsibility team, and  a powerful boost to the training of employees, suppliers  and local auditors:  — Four training sessions to over 100 suppliers  and local manufacturers.  — Conduct of 23 courses for manufacturers on  their premises. — Training to 70 local auditors. — Training to the local purchasing team. — Training to 64 suppliers in product health and  safety. BAnGLADeSh During 2011, within the Bangladesh cluster, Inditex  maintained an active strategy of participation in dialogue  platforms, with the objective of achieving consensus  between local interest groups about matters relating to  human and labour rights in the textile industry of the  country: Buyers Forum Bangladesh, ILO/Better Work  Project and Fire Prevention Measures Event, among  others. Outstanding among the training activities are: — Visit and training to 116 local manufacturers.  — Conduct of 35 training activities on labour rights  for suppliers and local manufacturers.  — Training to 37 suppliers in product health and  safety.  — Raising of awareness on fire prevention to 85  manufacturers. — Classification visits to advise manufacturers on  the process of implementation of the corresponding  corrective action plans.  During 2011, water analysis was carried out at 116  factories to ensure the distribution of drinking water for  over 235,000 workers and eight product health and safety  audits were carried out in laundries, in collaboration  with DyStar, one of the world's main manufacturers and  distributors of textile colourants in the world. Moreover,  in this year the Spectrum project came to an end, with the  final payments into the pension fund for the victims of the  collapse of the Spectrum Garments factory in 2005.   Clusters detalled information in the section of the Social Indicators  (page 276).   - 66 - suppliers InDIA India was one of the most active clusters in 2011.  Bearing in mind the business fabric of this sector  in India, characterised by its atomisation in small  manufacturers, Inditex has since 2009 been carrying out  an intense programme of identification and monitoring of  unauthorised subcontracting, especially in northern India.  This task continued to be carried out intensively during  2011, thanks to the work of the cluster, accompanied by  classification visits to suppliers for the implementation of  corrective action plans in the supply chains.  Among the training plans which were started up in  2011, there were 19 sessions for over 90 suppliers and  manufacturers with the attendance of over 160 heads of  manufacturing; training to 81 suppliers in the matter of  product health and safety; and preparation of a health  and safety manual to improve the working conditions of  the workers in the embroidery sector in the north of India. Within the cluster work has also been done on boosting,  among the suppliers, the best practices related with  the operation of the works councils, as well as the  strengthening of the mechanisms for payment of salaries  to the employees of the manufacturers in collaboration  with the PSG College of Arts & Science, Department of  Social Work. Sumangali Project Under the Sumangali system, many young Indian women  are sent to work by their families in the spinning and  manufacturing factories for a period which is usually  of three years. It is only at the end of this period that  the worker receives the majority of her salary, which is  devoted mainly to the payment of the dowry when she  marries.  During 2011, Inditex made a special effort to deal with the  Sumangali practices in the textile factories in southern  India, including the identification of risks in the matter  of health and safety for women employed in the textile  sector in this region. After carrying out a programme of specific audits in this  sphere, Inditex has verified that none of its suppliers in  India uses the Sumangali system in its facilities. The Code  of Conduct, which is obligatory for all the Group's suppliers,  sets down the conditions under which the manufacturing  of the garments marketed by the Group must be carried  out, and expressly prohibits forced labour. Among the research actions that Inditex carried out in 2011  to verify the absence of Sumangali in suppliers' facilities,  the identification of all the spinning workers who are  employed by Inditex suppliers is included. Furthermore,  interviews have been carried out with ex-workers from  the textile sector and with their families in their villages  of origin and the payment of workers by Inditex suppliers  via bank accounts has been encouraged with the aim of  increasing the transparency in the system of payment of  salaries.  On the other hand, in the framework of the international  organisation, Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) -of which  Inditex has formed part since 2006 and which brings  together companies, trade unions and non-governmental  organisations fighting to improve the working conditions  in the supply chain-, Inditex has encouraged and actively  participated in the work carried out by the Sumangali  Bonded Labour Group of this organisation. Likewise,  Inditex is one of the founder members of the Tirupur  Stakeholder Forum, an initiative encouraged by the  textile industry in the south of India to eradicate these  employment problems. Currently, Inditex, together with the rest of the members  of the ETI and under the aegis of this organisation, is  working on initiatives to extend the process of social  audits in spinning factories that the manufacturers  use for production; evaluating the socio-economic  behaviour of the young female workers in the spinning  factories and their families; and promoting processes of  improvement of the social and employment conditions  in southern India with the help of local development  organisations.   - 67 - annual report 2011 Vidya Project The Vidya Project is an initiative of the Corporate Social  Responsibility teams of the Inditex Group to improve the  working conditions among the suppliers in the northern  region of India. In 2009, Inditex started up a programme  to monitor sub-contracting in India. Out of the upwards  of 100 suppliers who work in the area,  the CSR team  identified 24 of them in the Delhi area – not exclusive  suppliers of Inditex – ranked D, the lowest as per the  Group standards.  The Corporate Social Responsibility teams revealed  that the risk arose in the second line of production,  subcontractors, many of which were not notified to Inditex  and therefore were not authorised by Inditex either. In  order to begin the analysis, the Inditex teams recorded  and photographed numerous examples of the conditions  of the subcontractors who were alerted to the risk that  was being run if part of the production were to come to  these manufacturers.  All the documentation and the research materials, as well  as the objectives of the Vidya project, were shared with the  international platform, the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI).  The Vidya Project consists of five areas of work:  — Eliminating any possibility that there might be  cases of workers of less than 18 years of age.  — Ensuring the supply of drinking water at  all workplaces and the periodic verification of the  conditions of health of this supply. — Introducing proper standards in all matters  relating to safety and hygiene at work. — Guaranteeing the payment of salaries in  accordance with the provisions of the laws and that, in  the final instance, they should assure a decent lifestyle  to the workers and their families.  — Promoting the increase in the capacity for  direct production of the Inditex suppliers, in such a  manner that the need for subcontracting is reduced to  a minimum or completely eliminated. The development of these plans for improvement is based  on the identification of gaps in the Inditex supply chain in  India by means of 700 unannounced visits to suppliers.  These audits gave rise to the start up of corrective action  plans for each one of the suppliers at which breaches  were detected. Additionally, the Inditex Corporate Social  Responsibility team organized over 400 classification  visits, in which specific work was done with the suppliers  to help them in the implementation of the improvements  required, as well as over 70 training sessions with  suppliers devoted to concrete aspects of the fulfilment of  the Code of Conduct.  After two years of hard work, the seventeen suppliers  on the project who are still working for Inditex have  managed to rise out of the "D" Classification: three  achieved the A classification in 2011; seven gained a  B classification and another seven, classification C.  Three of the initial twenty-four were eliminated during  the process as they persisted in breaches of the Code  of Conduct and another four did not continue due to  commercial reasons.

The Group has consolidated  social and employment conditions at the facilities of its  suppliers.  These measures have been accompanied by  giving support, together with its suppliers in Brazil, to the  National Agreement for the Eradication of Slave Labour,  joining the Instituto ETHOS, the creation of a telephone  number for receiving complaints of irregular situations  in the supply chain and the training of social auditors in  verification methodology.  Brazil Project At the end of July 2011, the Regional Superintendency of  Work and Employment (SRTE) of the Ministry of Labour and  Employment (MTE) of So Paulo (Brazil) contacted Inditex,  indicating that two dressmaking manufacturers had  been identified in an irregular situation, which had been  subcontracted by one of Inditex's suppliers in the country.  According to SRTE's information, these manufacturers  presented deficiencies in the facilities which involved a  risk to health and safety at work, as well as irregularities  regarding the registration of their employees.  Research into the facts carried out by Inditex on the days  immediately subsequent to the notification discovered  that these two manufacturers had been subcontracted  by the supplier without Inditex's authorisation. Breaches  were likewise detected of the Code of Conduct for External  Manufacturers and Suppliers of Inditex relating to safety  and hygiene at work, the working timetable (not adapted  to the applicable legislation) and the irregular work.  Inditex and MTE demanded that the supplier responsible  for the fraudulent subcontracting should immediately put  this situation right. The supplier recognised that Inditex  was totally unconnected with this sub-contracting and  corrected the labour conditions of its subcontractors  to put them at the level stipulated by the Inditex Group  Code of Conduct. Given the seriousness of the breach, all  business activity with this supplier was suspended. After this situation, Inditex began the exhaustive review  of the production system, both of this supplier and the  remaining companies in Brazil, to guarantee that a case  like this cannot be repeated. In this process of review,  Inditex has reinforced its monitoring procedures in Brazil  for the supply chain.  The measures started up on the ground by Inditex,  working on the basis of the consensus with the interest  groups involved, were set out in an agreement signed  on 19th December 2011 with the Public Ministry of  Employment and the Ministry of Work and Employment.  The  agreement  includes  the  proposal  for  the  consolidation of the social and employment conditions  in the supply chain of Zara Brazil. The objective is to make a collective effort and to promote  a broad commitment to society to ensure the best working  conditions all along the supply chain.  This agreement starts from: — The verification of a problem which affects  the social integration and employment regularisation  of thousands of workers of immigrant origin who work  in the Brazilian dressmaking industry in an irregular  manner, which goes far beyond the isolated cases which  it has been possible to detect and clear up in the Inditex  supply chain in Brazil.  — Our conviction is that the solutions to this  problem must come from collaboration between the  authorities, employers, business people, trade unions  and all those national and international agents who  can supply efficient solutions so as to bring this social  question to an end. — The main objective of this work should be the  identification, integration, protection and rehabilitation of  the victims of forced labour or precarious employment,  ensuring the fulfilment of the laws and that this objective  forms part of Inditex's commitment to Brazilian society.  As a result of the above-mentioned agreement, a strategy  of intervention based on the following three areas of  action has been established:  1.  The control of the  Zara supply chain  in Brazil 2.  The improvement  of the labour  conditions in the  sector  3.  The support  for the social  integration of  migrants  - 69 - annual report 2011 1.- The control of the zara supply chain in Brazil  This programme, which includes both suppliers and  subcontracted manufacturers with the authorisation of  Inditex with a total of 11,500 workers, involves collaboration  with social auditing firms such as SGS, Intertek or Apcer,  for the conduct of periodic social audits, among other  measures. The commitment includes: — Conduct of 150-200 annual social audits. — Development and verification of the corrective  action plans within a maximum of six months.  — Adaptation of the production capacity to the  volume of orders from suppliers and manufacturers.  — Execution of the commitment to information and  collaboration with the Brazilian Public Administration.  — Creation of an additional team of 10-15 external  social auditors. 2.- The improvement of labour conditions in the sector  In collaboration with Uniethos, the Ethos Institute (study  division) and Sebrae, (the Brazilian agency for support  to the entrepreneur and small businessman), Inditex  has begun a pilot programme with 110 companies (2,100  workers) to increase competitiveness and sustainability.  This pioneer programme is centred mainly on training  actions regarding business management, technique,  human resources or any other subject which has an  effect on the improvement of productive capacity. The  collaboration with Uniethos and Sebrae involves the  possibility of extending the best practices which arise  from this pilot programme to all the textile sector.  Moreover, in the area of Inditex suppliers in Brazil,  programmes to raise the awareness of workers and  owners in the matter of labour and migrant rights, courses  of professional training in the textile industry, careers  guidance for young people and Portuguese courses, will  be held as well as training courses in computing together  with national organisations in support of migrants  (CDHIC, CAMI and CPM).  3.- Support for the social integration of migrants Likewise, together with national organisations for giving  support to migrants (CDHIC, CAMI and CPM), activities  will be carried out for the defence of the human rights  of the immigrants covering 150,000 persons. Among the  initiatives contemplated, the creation of a fund for food  support and emergency accommodation is particularly  important; hiring specialist staff for centres of attention to  migrants; provision of infrastructures and equipment for  the NGOs involved, legal advice to immigrants; conduct of  activities of cultural promotion; and professional training  to help young people to find work.   - 70 - Employees  - 71 - annual report 2011 Inditex is an ever-growing company, and this growth  also applies to its human capital. During FY2011, 9,374  new employees joined the company, thus totaling a  global workforce worldwide of 109,000 people. Over and  above the professional skills of Inditex staff, these people  share common characteristics, essential traits that make  the company a leader in fashion distribution. The average  age of Inditex employees is 26.5, and they all have critical  sense with regards to all procedures, internal and external.  This non-conformity makes continuous innovation a  fundamental pillar in the Groups business model. The  average profile of any employee of the Group is defined by  always being open to changes, their passion for the fashion  world and a firm belief that results are achieved through  team work. In order that these professionals continue  rigorously,  ethically,  and  enthusiastically  pursuing  their skills, Inditex is committed to a flat organisational  structure and an environment that encourages people to  express their ideas and exchange opinions. The integrity  of all Inditex teams is guaranteed by the Internal Code of  Conduct and the Internal Directive on Responsible Staff  Practices for the Inditex Group. All employees are familiar  with and share these Codes and Directives from the time  they start with the Group.  Likewise, the social commitment of the company and its  employees, and their relationship with their surroundings  is reflected in the business model: Inditex people promote  social volunteerism as an engine of change. This way of viewing company growth, in parallel with  personal growth and growth of society, is a standard for  many business people and young professionals. As a  result, in 2011 Inditex was chosen as the best company  to work for in Spain. It was chosen based on the annual  Merco  (Corporate  Reputation  Business  Monitor),  prepared from the opinions of students, business people,  and professionals. Being recognised as a company  that generates employment and creates professional  opportunities for its employees is a reason for pride. Our  objective is to continue working along these lines.

During 2011, two of the principle milestones reached by  the Group's Human Resources teams were entry into  new markets and launching the online store for six of the  Group's chains.  With its entry into Australia and South Africa, Inditex  initiated commercial activity in two of the markets  furthest from its headquarters in Spain. Its logistics  teams reinforced their capabilities so as to offer these  countries the same high level of service as they offer in the  rest of the world. In addition, the launch in Australia and  South Africa as well as Peru, increased Inditex's offering  in the Southern hemisphere. The countries where it was  already operating, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay,  are seeing their service reinforced as a result.  With regards to the launch of online stores for six of the  Inditex chains, the experience of Zara Home and Zara in  this area has provided the best starting point. More than one hundred new online  professionals After the online sales sites for Pull&Bear,  Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho  and Uterqe were launched, from 6 September  2011, all of the Inditex commercial formats have  their own online stores. Zara Home and Zara  have had internet operations since 2007 and  2010, respectively. This was one of the biggest  Human Resources challenges for Inditex in 2011,  likewise the start up of online Zara sales in the  United States and Japan, also during 2011. Around a hundred professionals - primarily  photographers, retouchers, stylists, sales people,  and customer service professionals - were added  to the group in 2011. On the other hand, 21%  of the professionals in the online department  team pertain to internal promotions: people  from the chains that have moved to online store  management.  - 73 - annual report 2011 Distribution of Inditex Group employees by country EUROPE Germany 3,553 Austria 733 Belgium 1,635 Bulgaria 359 Croatia 507 Denmark 84 Slovakia 108 Spain 39,098 France 5,967 Greece 3,197 Holland 1,114 Hungary 545 Ireland 714 Italy 5,276 Luxembourg 105 Monaco 33 Montenegro 81 Norway 151 Poland 3,277 Portugal 5,977 UK 4,165 Czech Republic 331 Romania 1,301 Russia 5,645 Serbia 373 Sweden 408 Switzerland 686 Turkey 2,748 Ukraine 840  TOTAL 89,011 AMERICA Argentina 756 Brazil 1,936 Canada 942 Chile 603 USA 2,755 Mexico 4,254 Uruguay 186 TOTAL  11,432 ASIA AND THE REST OF THE WORLD Australia 300 Bangladesh 29 China 5,260 South Korea 745 India 317 Japan 2,288 South Africa 130 TOTAL 9,069 TOTAL 109,512 The growth of the group  in Southern hemisphere  countries like Australia,  South Africa, and Peru has  been accompanied by a  strengthening of the area's  design teams  - 74 - employees Attract A new way to attract talent In 2011, Inditex renovated support for the hiring process  through the Joinfashion! project. This innovative  recruitment tool required re-invention of the Inditex  Group's people management style. The objective was to  maintain continuous evolution, continuous adaptation to  all those who will belong to the Inditex team in the future,  as well as to those who belong today. www.joinfashioninditex.com is the main channel for  Joinfashion! All Group job offerings are centralised and  presented there in an artistic style in keeping with the  company's fashion image. Starting with the home page,  this web site exudes the elements that characterise  working at Inditex: energy, talent, difference, challenges,  and inspiration. All of the work offers are associated with  videos that communicate the Inditex work philosophy  and the essence of its business model. This is done  with professional testimonies from different areas of  the business like stores, product, and logistics among  others.  In 2011, Inditex enhanced its talent attraction process  with the opening of a new selection and training centre  in Moscow. The centre has a dynamic Joinfashion! type  image and is added to those already existing in Madrid,  Barcelona, and London. Using these centres, the different  Inditex Group chains take their philosophy and way of  working to all those people interested in becoming part  of the Group.  There have been personnel selection pilot events in other  cities, such as Fashion Night in Paris, in order to take  the Group philosophy closer to the those passionate  about fashion and interested in joining the company. On  1 October during Fashion Week in Paris, the Zara Opera  store became a job fair for a few hours. Before, interested  candidates sent their CVs to a special web site for this  purpose, and those selected were interviewed at the  store. After the success of this event, the Group plans to  duplicate it in different cities throughout 2012. The Inditex Human Resources teams are convinced that  universities are one of the places where creative talent  is concentrated. Inditex launched the Cantera project  in 2010 in order to reach this young innovative talent.  The Cantera project targets recent graduates and 14  European universities participate. Recent graduates  from these universities can select a specific four to six  month training plan in the Inditex Group's commercial  and design areas. The young people selected are  always guided by an internal tutor and review all areas  of activity related with these fields. Upon finishing  the training period they may begin a professional  career with the company. A total of 65 students had  participated in this project at the close of 2011. In 2011 Inditex  strengthened the process  for attracting talent by  opening a new selection  and training centre  in Moscow, adding to  those already in Madrid,  Barcelona, and London Part of the Inditex HR team in A Corua.  - 75 - annual report 2011 Support Personal and professional development Many of Inditex's current managers began their  professional careers with the Group as store employees,  or in technical or entry-level positions. Inditex, conscious  that the professional and personal growth of its workers  translates to positive business development, believes  in the talent of people and their capacity to develop  themselves within the organisation. As a consequence,  training and internal promotion are key to the Group's  business model, based on continuous innovation and  teamwork.  In 2011 Inditex gave 930,000 hours of training in Spain  with 32,000 attending. Internal training plans are adapted  to the requirements of each professional profile found in  the organisation. Among them are the following: — Orientation programme for new employees:  composed of a la carte plans in line with the professional  profile; if indeed they all have a common denominator,  they spend a training period in a store, independent of the  job to be occupied within the organisation.  — Risk prevention: the emergency and first-aid  areas received more than 38,000 hours of training in 2011. — Environment: specific training for all employees  with regard to the specific implications the global  environment problem has on their job. It includes video  productions and sensitisation material, online training for  branches, news letters with regards to new technologies  and environmental experiences. — Skills: the investment made in the area of  logistics for skills training is notable. More than 500  people attended communications, leadership, time  management, and stress management sessions for a  total of more than 8,000 hours. -  Store management -  Specialisation -  Languages -  Computer Science In addition to the training plans developed by the Human  Resources department, the CSR teams organise training  on product health and safety subjects in order to eliminate  potential risks in the design and manufacturing processes.  During fiscal 2011, there were 17 specialised courses taught  to 678 people.

The most frequent and eminently  practical training activities address customer service,  products, trends, prevention of occupational hazards,  and continuous learning through the Store Management  Terminal (TGT). There are also daily meetings where the  supervisor deals with subjects such as sales techniques,  caring for garments, and customer requirements.  To make training more homogeneous and assure its  quality, each chain has specific instructive materials  such as the Store Organisation Manuals, which are  constantly updated. These manuals detail all aspects of  store work, from environmental impact to operating the  cash register. In addition to the Group's general plans, every year each  chain and country carries out specific training activities  depending upon their needs. In 2011, there was special  attention paid to the Infactor project executed in Italy. One  hundred and six store managers and supervisors from  different Group chains participated in a training activity  intended to maximise professional skills. In Poland, 350  people took part in the Career Designers programme.  Fashion work shops and meetings with trainers have been  used to develop participant skills in order to internally fill  store supervisor positions. In 2011, 29 store sales people  who participated in the Career Designers programme  were promoted to managers and another six were given  positions in the Group office in Poland.  More than 1,300 students from 690 Spanish and French  commercial education centres were trained as sales  people for Group stores as a complement to their  theoretical training.   - 76 - employees Classroom training Classroom training is another of the training blocks  designed by the Group to improve the professional skills  of its employees. During 2011, the Inditex School gave  courses for new managers with missions to support the  expansion of the group in China. There were also instructive  courses for internal promotion, focusing on improving  the performance of current managers. In addition, the  Inditex School continued offering its programme with a  commitment to hire in collaboration with the Comunidad  de Madrid and SOC (Catalunya Employment Service). Of the  140 students who participated in 2011, 75 were hired, and  90% continued with the Group. Internal promotion  From its beginnings, Inditex has encouraged the creation  of suitable working environments so that employees  can develop their professional skills and grow within the  company. In fact, the vast majority of store managers  started in the Group as shop assistants, this is evidence  of team management which evaluates performance in all  jobs and of attitudes appropriate for obtaining the best  results.  In 2011, more than 1,000 people were promoted to  different positions of responsibility within stores or  within the Inditex structure in Spain. Generally, each  year around 10% of the Inditex Group staff participate in  internal potential-developing programmes. The fact that  75% of vacancies occurring during fiscal 2011 were filled  through internal promotion shows Inditex's commitment  to the professional development of its workers.  Each year, 10% of  the Group's staff  participates in internal  programmes for  developing potential  - 77 - annual report 2011 Caring Equality, multiculturalism, and conciliation Diversity is intrinsic to the essence of Inditex. There are  more than 140 nationalities (30 in the central office) and  40 languages co-existing among the Group's 109,512  employees. All believe in equal opportunity in the  selection process and internal promotion. The criteria for  evaluation, development, talent, and work dedication are  unique and equal for the entire staff.  Women make up 79.5% of the workforce, the other 20.5%  being men.

This commitment to equality was  endorsed in 2006 with the ratification of the Equal  Diversidad Activa Project, co-financed by the European  Commission and managed by the Spanish Coordinator  from the Women's European Lobby and the Carolina  Foundation. The objective is to encourage companies to  implement measures reducing imbalances between men  and women. In addition, Inditex has an action protocol for confronting  gender discrimination and sexual harassment. A report  from any employee results in an internal investigation  being launched in order to understand and verify the  facts, and if appropriate, to hold those responsible to  account.  During fiscal 2011, Inditex continued along the same  lines as previous years incorporating equality plans in  the Group chains. Protection of the victims of gender  violence and conciliation between family and work  life have been keys for the organisation's activities. To  follow-up on its implementation, nine employees from  the different chains have been made equality agents and  ensure correct execution of social plans.  Inditex constantly works to improve all aspects of  the balance between work and family life; such as  protection of pregnant and nursing women, prevention  of occupational hazards during pregnancy, balancing  the work day with caring for young and dependent  children, or in the case that the employee would like to  be able to work and study or do volunteer service. To do  this, the Group contemplates a series of leaves during  which a person can maintain their position. The leaves  could be for studying, for social volunteering, or special  volunteering. In 2009 Inditex took a qualitative step in this area by  signing a Global Agreement with the UNI Global Union.  The UNI Global Union certifies respect for the Group's  workers' rights in each of the countries where it operates,  as well as the organisations sustainable growth.   - 78 - employees Labour policy Flexible working hours are one of the main aspects  of the Inditex business model. It is reflected in people  management  policies,  facilitating  personal  and  educational development of its employees outside of  work. The Group offers positions with different work  hours in order to facilitate, to the extent possible, stable  work shifts.  Staff distribution in Spain by working day In 2011  In 2010   44%  Part time 56%  Full time 41%  Part time 59%  Full time Inditex is committed to stable job creation. In 2011,  permanent contracts represented 82% of all contracts,  as compared to 80% in 2010. Staff distribution in Spain by contract type  In 2011  In 2010 18%  Temporary 82%  Indefinite 20%  Temporary 80%  Indefinite Compensation policy All  areas  of  Group  activity,  independent   of their direct or indirect relationship with the store, are  committed to responding to the demands of customers.  This means that apart from the variable portion of the salary  associated with sales for store employees, those who work  in logistics and production also have elements of pay linked  with productivity. Many jobs in the corporate structure  also have a variable component to their salary. Employees  of the Groups central services have part of their variable  compensation tied to common quantifiable objectives, and  another part of the variable portion at the discretion of  those responsible for area objectives and specific projects. Merco Personas 2011 MERCO  (Corporate  Reputation  Business  Monitor) has been evaluating the reputation  of companies that operate in Spain since  2000. Specifically, Merco Personas, prepares  a ranking of the best companies to work  for based on variables such as professional  development, motivation, working environment,  pride in belonging, promotion of creativity, and  salary. In 2011, Merco Personas identified  Inditex as number one on the list of the best  100 companies to work for in Spain. The  survey included more than 12,000 people. They  highlighted the potential of the Group as an  employer as well as how employees identify  with company objectives.   Expansin y Empleo Awards  for Innovation in Human Resources In 2011, the IE Business School Expansin  y Empleo awards recognised the President  of Inditex, Pablo Isla, for providing the most  support to the efforts of the Human Resources  department of his company in Spain.  - 79 - annual report 2011 (in thousands of euros) 2011 2010 Var. % Fixed and variable  salaries 1,843,020 1,651,462 11.6 Inditex contributions to  Social Security 391,158 357,967 9.3 Total personnel  expenses 2,234,178 2,009,429 11.2 Health and safety Caring about employees also means providing the  best atmosphere for them to work in and providing the  appropriate health and safety measures in the work  environment. The measures developed by Inditex for  the Prevention of Occupational Hazards are especially  significant in its factories and logistics centres. Some of  the actions taken in 2011 are the following: — Preventative and therapeutic plan for factories  and pattern teams in A Corua: the courses and treatment  session include Preventative Care intended to help the  worker form regular habits of physical activity, greater  vitality, to prevent discomfort caused by certain postures,  and to develop relaxation therapies; and Therapeutic Care  focusing on prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal  injuries, reducing occupational illnesses, and correcting  bad postures. — INDICAE document manager to assemble risk  information and share between Inditex and its suppliers. — Bershka and Zara participated in an Ergonomic  Hazard Reduction programme sponsored by the  government of Catalonia. It focused on work accidents  deriving from musculoskeletal disorders, repetitive  movements, and unnatural postures.  — Continuation of the implementation of an  Internal Occupational Health and Safety Management  System (SIGSST) under the OHSAS 18.001:2007 standard,  initiated in fiscal 2010. Inditex has also taken the following  steps: - Follow-up audit for European Platform SIGSST  started. - Audit for Bershka Logstica certification started. - Implementation of SIGSST begun for the  Leon Platform and Pull&Bear Logstica, the Meco  Platform and Zara Home Logstica, Zara Logstica,  and factories.  - 80 - employees Social Commitment Volunteering One of Inditex's main priorities is active participation in  the society where it operates its business, it is committed  to that society's improvement. In addition to the social  activities carried out by the Corporate Social Responsibility  area (see the chapter on Community, page: 84), Inditex  employees propose and participate in diverse volunteer  social projects with the support of the company, showing  its on-going commitment and motivation.  Given the constant activity of Inditex employees  volunteering in the social action environment, Inditex  wanted to facilitate and strengthen these selfless acts by  employees and in 2011 created a communal tool: Inpulse  Project. In 2011, Inditex donated  286,000 euros and 1,300  work hours so that  employees could carry out  their volunteer projects  - 81 - annual report 2011 In addition to the initiatives proposed by the employees  themselves, Inditex works in the area of social inclusion of  vulnerable groups. As such, the Salta and Jeunes projects  were continued in 2011 and offered work opportunities to  many people. The Salta Project Inditex started Salta in 2010 in collaboration with the  Barcelona Raval neighbourhood Surt association. It is an  integration and training programme for women at risk of  social exclusion. During fiscal 2011 it completed its third  programme and with it the addition of 40 people to the  staff of the eight Group chains in Barcelona. All of them  participated in a training process that includes trends,  sales skills -taught by volunteer employees-, and three  weeks of in-store practice. 2012 will see the project's  fourth programme as well as its arrival in Madrid. Jeunes Project During fiscal 2011, Zara France continued its Jeunes  Project solidarity programme in collaboration with Force  Ouvrire labour union. It has completed its 9th cycle. The  purpose of the project is to provide the opportunity for  work to underprivileged youth in the Paris metropolitan  area. The director of Inditex France, Jean Jacques Salaun,  was recognised with the Legin de Honor for his work  which includes 50 young people hired by Inditex. This  decoration is the most important recognition in France  for extraordinary merit achieved within civil or military  areas. Other activities The Inditex chains carried out numerous social activities  during 2011; solidarity breakfasts, toy collection, activities  and collaboration with the International Red Cross, ONCE,  and the Spanish Association Against Cancer (AECC),  among others. Inpulse Project Inditex launched the volunteer and social action  portal Inpulse as a response to employee  demand. Inpulse has an internal web site where  all Group brands publish information about the  assistance programmes they are developing.  They receive suggestions, comments, and  personal help from employees.  During the year the new Inpulse programme was  "The Big Idea", a social or environmental projects  contest for employees. More than 200 employees  presented their projects for collaboration with  different non-profit social organisations or  entities. The Inditex Social Council selected  twelve of these projects and provided the  necessary resources, both financial and time, to  be able to execute them with direct participation  of Group employees. In its first phase, Inditex  donated 286,000 euros for the twelve projects  and their promoters dedicated more than 1,300  work hours to carry out their social projects.  The subjects of the winning programmes are  diverse. They range from organising a sewing  factory for women at risk for social exclusion  (Artisan Hands Project) to bringing poor children  with serious diseases from countries like  Mauritania, Equatorial Guinea , Madagascar, and  Morocco to be treated in Spain. During the pre  and post surgical periods they live in the homes  of volunteers (Travel for Life).  - 82 - employees Integration To complement the creation of direct and indirect  employment generated by our operation, Inditex carries  out various activities intended to place especially  vulnerable people into the workforce.  Stylepack Programme The Inditex logistics centre in Zaragoza has housed a  special employment centre since 2010. It provides jobs  for twelve people with physical or intellectual disabilities.  The workers, who are constantly supervised by two  monitors, work primarily at applying and removing  alarms, reading tickets with store order terminals, and  printing price stickers. The help and willingness of all  Inditex employees at the centre is making it possible to  completely integrate these people into the the daily work  routine. There are also integration projects at the stores. Currently  in A Corua, Bilbao and Madrid there are people with  Down's syndrome working in some Group stores in a  project to both provide them with jobs and personal  achievement. Those included in this project have a tutor  who analyses their development and integration with the  rest of the staff. for&from programme This project involving integration of disabled people into  the work force was launched in 2002 by Inditex's will  to provide innovative and sustainable solutions related  to its business model and that generate financial and  social impact. Inditex, in collaboration with the Mol  den Puigvert Foundation, the Galician Confederation  of Disabled People (COGAMI) and the Pro-Intellectually  Disabled Association of Alicante (APSA) have started  a social project that is currently made up of five  commercial establishments: a Massimo Dutti and a  Bershka store in Palafolls (Barcelona); a Massimo Dutti  and a Tempe store (accessories and shoes from all  Inditex Group chains) in Allariz (Ourense); and a Tempe  store in Elche (Alicante). The for&from stores are managed entirely by people with  some type of physical or intellectual disability. Also, the  stores are completely fitted out to guarantee accessibility  to any person with a physical disability. Currently, the  programme provides stable employment for 37 people  with some type of disability. The experience with this project has served as a bridge  for placing disabled people into the workforce. Several  people have been incorporated into the ordinary Group  stores through their work experience in the for&from  establishments.  The for&from stores are  managed entirely by  people with some type of  physical or intellectual  disability  Detailed information about the for&from programs is provided on  the Social Indicators Schedule (page 277) Unai is part of a integration project at a Zara store in Bilbao.  - 83 - annual report 2011 for&from Tempe  Elche - Alicante The Tempe store that was inaugurated in October  2010 in Elche (Alicante) received an A Energy Rating  in 2010 from the Ministry of Industry, Tourism, and  Trade via the Valencian Energy Agency (AVEN), the first  received in the Community of Valencia by a commercial  establishment. This A rating is the maximum rating  for energy efficiency in buildings. This establishment  is part of the for&from project store network for the  integration of people at risk of exclusion.  - 84 - Community  - 85 - annual report 2011 Conscious of its size and potential for growth,  Inditex knows it could not pursue its activity without the  collaboration of its stakeholders. In addition to all of its  activities that are directly linked to the business the Group  does for and with customers, suppliers, employees, and  shareholders, Inditex implements its model also taking  as a reference its responsibility towards local, national  and international communities where it conducts its  business. The commitment is articulated by three basic areas of  activity: — Co-operation  for  development:  education  related activities as a means for transforming and  promoting justice and solidarity. — Humanitarian activities: solidarity activities  focusing on protecting human life, safety, and dignity  in circumstances where they are threatened by natural  catastrophe or armed conflicts. Inditex's humanitarian  activities encompass not just immediate intervention  with emergency assistance and aid but rehabilitation and  reconstruction after a catastrophe, as well as monitoring  beneficiaries of the assistance programmes. — Fostering  employment:  programmes  for  promoting employment in vulnerable groups making  possible the integration of people at risk of exclusion into  the workforce. These three types of activities are carried out through  specific community programmes: - Community development programmes - Monitoring programmes - Emergency Programmes - Network of universities - Sponsorship and patronage - Environmental programmes  A break-down of the consolidated social investment per project and  social cash-flow is found in the Social Indicators schedule (page 278)  Argentina Brazil Chile Mexico Peru Uruguay Venezuela Colombia Panama Haiti Ecuador Guatemala Morocco Spain Ghana - 86 - community Morocco Programme Medical and psychological  care for 450 sub-Saharan  migrants per month 300,000 euros invested Emergency Unit (Haiti, Central African Republic,  Democratic Republic of Cong,  Zambia, Uganda, Libya, Niger,  Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya,  Somalia and Guatemala) Financing of the Mdecins  Sans Frontires Emergency  Unit 300,000 euros invested Sponsorship and patronage 3.5 million invested in areas  like cultural activities, sports,  social assistance, and health.

The key to  this is training. As such Inditex's community development  programmes are intended to improve people's quality  of life and their surroundings through training and  generation of opportunities in their communities.  Inditex carries out these projects with not-for-profit  organisations  like  the  Entreculturas  Foundation,  Caritas, the Carolina Foundation, and their associated  organisations in each country with experience in the  areas of training and co-operation. The objective is to  promote education as a development factor in those  communities where Inditex operates with production,  distribution, or sales. Currently, there are community  development projects under way in seven Latin  American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico,  Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela), Bangladesh, India and  Cambodia. Bangladesh programme Inditex collaborates with Caritas in underprivileged areas of  Bangladesh, the objective being to support primary education,  professional training, and socioeconomic reinforcement  of rural communities in marginalised areas of Dinajpur,  Mymensingh, and Rajshahi. The purpose of this programme  is to eliminate problems like illiteracy, malnutrition, and  unemployment that affect the communities of this region. The Bangladesh programme in 2011 Primary education - Provision of materials for 52 preschools and primary schools. - 4,160 children signed up for school. - Training and contracting of 104 teachers.

Likewise, this project focuses  on AIDS prevention and treatment, and the launching  and maintenance of shelters. Inditex is committed to this  project for a five-year term, with an annual investment  of 30,000 euros. Latin American programme Inditex  has  collaborated  with  the  Entreculturas  Foundation and its associates since 2002. The objective  is to promote quality education in several Latin American  countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico,  Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela). The twenty or so projects  in this programme are intended to increase educational  coverage and improve its quality in vulnerable areas. They  also promote access to decent employment for young  people who receive professional training. The programme  is organised around five pillars: — Access to education, facilitating the conditions  and infrastructure necessary for children to able to attend  class. — Quality education, improving training of the  teaching staff, and improving study plans at the schools  where the programme is implemented. — Institutional  reinforcement  so  that  local  organisation can improve their management and  sustainability. — Professional training so that young people with  scarce resources have adequate facilities and study plans  to facilitate entry into the labour market. — Social promotion through the support of  farmers, indigenous, migrant and defense of Human  Rights organisations; and proposals for improving social  conditions in the communities where the programmes are  active. Currently there is an active three-year programme which  has 186,640 beneficiaries. In 2011 schools were built  and remodelled, educational materials were delivered,  educational publications were distributed, psychological,  legal, and health issues were addressed for children,  young people and adults.

They are linked to both emergency  assistance and long term rehabilitation of communities  affected by catastrophes or armed conflicts. For this type of project, Inditex has maintained on-going  collaboration with Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) and  the Jesuit Refugee Service (SJR) for several years and for  specific programmes in areas like India, Somalia, Morocco,  and other African countries. There is also a specific project  for Colombia and other neighbouring countries (Venezuela,  Ecuador, and Panama) that receive people displaced by the  Colombian armed conflict. Morocco programme Collaboration between MSF and Inditex in Morocco  made it possible to attend to an average of 455 people a  month in the Oujda area (passage area of sub-Saharan  migrants to Europe) in 2011. These people have suffered  the consequences of crossing the Maghreb area. Sub- Saharan migrants have received direct medical attention  at the Moroccan border through this programme,  including urgent medical care, planned consultations,  and psychological care. The people attended come mainly  from Nigeria, Ghana, Mali, and Cameroon. In 2011 Inditex  invested 300,000 euros in this project. Somalia programme The purpose of the Mdecins Sans Frontires and Inditex  project in Somalia is health assistance for the people of  the state of Jowhar. In Jowhar and Mogadishu, Mdecins  Sans Frontires offer complete medical assistance to  a population suffering the consequences of endemic  violence as well as frequent natural disasters.

In 2011 the medical-humanitarian organisation  managed the therapeutic nutritional hospital centre and  and the Biraul ambulatory nutritional programme.  It is extremely important to call attention to children  suffering from malnutrition that are outside the spotlight of  emergencies. Unni Karunakara, International President  of Mdecins Sans Frontires.

Investment by Inditex: 333,333 euros Positive Generation Positive Generation is a Mdecins Sans Frontires project  carried out in collaboration with companies like Inditex. The  project supports the fight against Aids and HIV in Africa.  The project has made children and adolescents living with  the illness visible. This helps alleviate the stigma of being  HIV positive, while at the same time raising funds for the  programmes that MSF is operating to combat paediatric  Aids in Zimbabwe. Inditex's participation in this project  consists of selling playbutton mp3 devices in their nearly  2,000 Spanish establishments. The devices contain songs  by popular Zimbabwe choirs in collaboration with artists  such as Alejandro Sanz, Antonio Carmona, and Javier  Limon.  Income from the sale of these devices is wholly destined  to MSF programmes fighting paediatric Aids in Zimbabwe.  At the end of the project (19 February 2012), 16,404  devices had been sold for a value of 164,040 euros, to  which Inditex in turn added an additional contribution of  335,960 euros. The contribution is accounted for in 2012  as the project concluded during this fiscal year.

Zambia Uganda Libya Niger Ghana - 92 - community Emergency programmes Inditex develops plans for use in emergencies, to alleviate  the consequences of natural catastrophes occurring  anywhere in the world. Participation in crisis scenarios  through short-term emergency assistance consists of  providing goods and services essential for the survival  of those affected by disaster (water, food, shelter,  medicines, and health care). Humanitarian assistance  is provided for the long-term and consists of renovation  or reconstruction of infrastructures and homes. These  projects are different every year depending on the  critical situations that may arise in the world. In 2011,  Inditex activities were concentrated in Ethiopia-Somalia,  Japan, and in financing the Emergency Unit of Mdecins  Sans Frontires.  Drought in Ethiopia In June 2011 and in collaboration with MSF, Inditex  responded to the emergency situation triggered by the  drought that devastated the Liben region of Ethiopia.  This disaster affected the Somali refugees settled in this  area. They were already suffering the consequences of a   long-term armed conflict.  The launch of this emergency programme provided  health care to those recently arrived as well as those  already in refugee camps. In addition, nutritional  programmes were established in three of the refugee  camps (Bokolmayo, Malkadida and Kobe) and a massive  vaccination plan against measles carried out in one of  them (Kobe).  105,000 people were attended to during the year. 26,082  of them were children under 5 years of age and 4,029  pregnant or lactating women. 12,961 children between  6 months and 15 years old were vaccinated. Therapeutic  foods were distributed to 18,493 children under five  with severe acute malnutrition. Inditex earmarked one  million euros for this emergency humanitarian project. Earthquake and tsunami in Japan In order to alleviate the consequences of the earthquake  and tsunami that devastated northeast Japan on 11  March 2011, Inditex contributed one million euros  through the Spanish Red Cross for their Japanese  counterpart to carry out an emergency plan. The  funds will be employed during the next three years  to finance programmes for assistance, recovery, and  reconstruction of the devastated areas. According to the President of the International Federation  of the Red Cross and the President of the Japanese Red  Cross, Tadateru Konoe, "the funds will be used for the  most urgent requirements in areas where they will best  help people to improve their lives and take the first steps  towards recovery. Inditex's contribution of one million euros has enabled  the construction of 52,706 prefabricated homes and seven  temporary hospitals providing service to 60,000 people.  In addition, 500,000 kits with materials for temporary  lodging were delivered to more than 125,000 families. Investment in emergency programmes (in euros) MSF Ethiopia 1,000,000 Japanese Red Cross 1,000,000 MSF Emergency Unit 300,000 Total 2,300,000  - 93 - annual report 2011 Emergency Unit In 2011 Inditex and Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF)  signed a collaborative agreement providing that the  company finance the Emergency Unit of the medical- humanitarian organisation, making it possible to move  teams and material to the areas where they are needed.  As such, Inditex has committed to defray the costs for  three years of stable teams of MSF in Nairobi (Kenya) and  Panama with an investment 300,000 euros per year. This decentralised emergency structure enables MSF,  when faced with any humanitarian crisis, to move teams  and materials in less than 48 hours.  During 2011, 12 emergency actions were carried out in:  Haiti and the Central African Republic (emergency to  alleviate cholera outbreak), Democratic Republic of the  Congo and Zambia (measles outbreak), Uganda (Ebola  outbreak), Libya and Niger (armed conflict), Ghana  (social tensions), Ethiopia and Kenya (malnutrition),  Somalia (support to the regular mission), and Guatemala  (floods).  In addition they have made eight exploratory interventions  in Kenya and Sudan, Burkina Faso (conflict); Yemen  (preparation for emergencies); Peru and Paraguay  (outbreak of dengue fever); the Dominican Republic  (cholera outbreak) and the Bahamas (emergency to  alleviate the effects of a hurricane). One hundred and eighteen international workers and  six national workers participated in these projects.  In addition there was a team of six regional workers  deployed to help the regular missions in the region. Employment programme for  people at risk of social exclusion Eighteen employment and training projects were  completed as a result of the collaborative agreement  signed between Inditex and Spanish Caritas in 2011.  Inditex contributed one million euros. Thanks to the  occupational training received, non-labour internships  in companies, and labour intermediation activities, the  participants increased their possibilities for finding  employment. In the end, many were able to get a job. On  the other hand, socioeconomic projects that find creative  ways for generating jobs were launched or strengthened.  Specifically, during 2011: — 42 occupational training courses for different  sectors like hospitality, home assistance, residential  socio-health  care,  textile  confection,  ecological  agriculture, services (sales, cleaning, warehousing, etc.). — two special centres employing disabled people  were created in Coria (Caceres) and Barbastro (Huesca),  they do jobs like gardening, ecological farming, and  industrial laundry. — a recycling project and two textile recovery  projects that were being wound down were consolidated.  They introduce quality improvement and process  optimization, improving productivity and maintaining  many jobs. In general terms, this programme, composed of the  financing of 18 projects, has facilitated the training  of more than 600 people, and the creation of 248 jobs,  meaning a 33% rate of insertion. This year, Inditex joined the Social Responsibility with  Entrepreneurs Initiative, promoted by the IE Business  School in collaboration with private corporations. The  objective is to promote support of entrepreneurs.  - 94 - community Network of universities Inditex is committed to education as a pillar in its Corporate  Social Responsibility strategy. As such, it collaborates  with different university educational programmes around  the world, such as the National Institute of Fashion  Technology (India), the Portuguese Catholic University  of Porto (Portugal), the University of Northumbria (U.K.),  and the Galician universities (A Corua, Santiago de  Compostela, and Vigo). For 2011, the Inditex chairs at the  University of A Corua (Spain) and at the University of  Dhaka (Bangladesh) should be noted. The Inditex Social Responsibility Chair -  UDC The objective of this chair, established in 2010 with  the collaborative agreement between Inditex and the  University of Corua, is to promote academic training,  applied research, and the transfer of social responsibility  material results, with public administrations, universities,  companies,  and  not-for-profit  entities.  Inditexs  investment in 2011 has amounted to eur 40,000. In 2011, within the institutions' collaborative framework,  the first University of Corua Social Responsibility  Report was presented. It places this university at the top  of Spanish universities with regards to complying with  objectives set out by the 2015 University Strategy for  Social Responsibility. In addition, the first postgraduate course in Social  Responsibility was presented. It targets university  graduates and professionals. The first course will  begin in February 2012. Inditex Spanish culture and language chair at  the University of Dhaka (Bangladesh) This chair was established with the agreement signed by  Inditex, the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC),  the University of Corua (UDC), and the University of  Dhaka in order to promote Spanish culture and language  within the Bangladeshi community. Specifically, the chair intends to develop different teaching  programmes and encourage cultural diffusion.  — Exchange of teaching staff for the Spanish  Culture and Language area as well as of researchers  and students. — Training of teaching staff and researchers in  the area of Spanish Culture and Language.  — Financing of undergraduate and postgraduate  courses and seminars related to Spanish Language  and Culture for students in Bangladesh.  — Carry out seminars, conferences, debates,  reunions, and sessions in Bangladesh, mainly dealing  with studies related to the Chair.  — Promote publication and realization of scientific  projects related to Spanish Culture and Language in  Bangladesh.  Spanish as a foreign language class was taught to 123  students in 2011. There were also complementary  manufacturers attended by 116 students in facilities  financed by Inditex on the University of Dhaka campus.  Inditex invested 394,160 euros in this project in 2011. Inditex/ITGLWF Chair at the University of  Northumbria The Textile Sector Labour Rights Chair (previously called  the Ethical Fashion Chair) in the Design Faculty at the  University of Northumbria was created in 2008, one year  after the signing of the international agreement between  Inditex and the International Textile Garment and Leather  Workers Federation (ITGLWF). This chair constitutes a  strategic intervention in higher education with the idea  of developing new and innovative focuses for teaching  fashion students, and of contributing to an on-going  research agenda in the area of ethical commerce.  During the 2010-11 course, a generic fashion world  ethical commerce programme was introduced. It is  intended for undergraduate students (some 180) and has  three fashion programmes (Fashion Design, Marketing,  and Communication). At a postgraduate level, some  50 international students began a course in ethical  and environmental values. The investment in 2011 was  321,349 euros.  - 95 - annual report 2011 Environmental programmes Inditex has also launched various environmental projects  with the objective of reducing the ecological footprint  of activities deriving from their business model. These  projects are framed within the Inditex Sustainable  Environmental Strategic Plan 2011-2015. Roba Amiga Project In 2011, Inditex launched the Roba Amiga project. Its  objective is to improve the management of textile waste in  Catalonia. Each year this community generates more than  185,000 tons of textile waste, making up 4% of the city's  total waste. Fifteen thousand tons of this is collected, of  which 40% is usable. With this collaborative agreement signed by the Catalonia  Land and Sustainability Council and the Roba Amiga  Cooperative, Inditex commits to 450,000 euros aimed  at improving the textile waste management facilities,  enlarging the network of selective collection, and the  creation of jobs for social re-insertion. Terra Project  Inditex has maintained an agreement with the Galician  Government Rural Ministry since 2007. Its purpose is to  improve the the genetics of the Pinus pinaster (Maritime  Pine), Pinus radiata (Monterrey Pine), Castanea sp  (Chestnut), and prunus avium (Wild Cherry). In 2011,  Inditex extended the agreement for three years. The  project's main objectives are: — Promotion of activities to protect the natural  environment, habitats, and ecosystems.  — Create enough forest to close the CO2 cycle and  to absorb greenhouse gas emissions resulting from  fossil fuel and electrical energy consumption. As such, the commitment that Stradivarius and  Pull&Bear have shown by eliminating their catalogues  in printed form and only publishing the online versions  is significant. Each visit to the digital catalogue prevents  400 grams of CO2 emissions. In the case of Pull&Bear,  the project was topped-off with a reforestation project  in the Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve (Mexico) where  16,500 trees were planted.  Social Awareness Several consumer information projects were started in  2011. Their purpose is to promote responsible product  consumption and protection of the environment: — Creation of product information labels with  environmental information such as the content of  organic cotton or other sustainable fibres, and advice  regarding energy efficient washing and drying.  — Leaflets containing environmental information,  printed on seed paper that may be planted once the  leaflet is read.  — For several years, Inditex has taken part  in turning out the lights during "Earth Hour", an  environmental sensitization initiative organised by the  WWF with a symbolic stop of electricity consumption  during a predetermined hour. Inditex participated in  this initiative and turned off the show window lights  of its stores on the main commercial streets of the  world.   - 96 - community Sponsorship and patronage Inditex's strategy for social investment, channelled  primarily  by  the  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  Department, is rounded off by sponsored activities  under the authority of the Sponsorship and Patronage  Commission. This internal body, made up of the General  Secretary and Secretary of the Board, Antonio Abril; the  General Manager of Communication and Institutional  Relations, Jess Echevarra; and the Manager of Corporate  Social Responsibility, Flix Poza, studies the candidate  projects and evaluates how to use them to meet Group  commitments in the societies where it operates. The involvemen described to this point focuses on  vulnerable communities and groups in a geographic  area, mainly international. However, sponsorship and  patronage activities, where culture and sport take on  the important role, are mainly limited to local activities.  The communities near the company headquarters in  Galicia and Spain are the main beneficiaries of these  investments.  In many cases, collaboration between Inditex and different  beneficiary institutions is an on-going commitment. This  is the case with the Pro-CNIC Foundation, the Spanish  Royal Academy, and the Symphonic Orchestra of Galicia,  among others. In other cases, Inditex lends assistance  when an organisation needs financing for a specific plan. Inditex actively collaborated with nearly 50 domestic  and international institutions in 2011. Those institutions  received more than 3.5 million euros.

This foundation, among other things,  promotes musical creation and interpretation, and young  pianists. Additionally, the Group renewed its commitment  to the Spanish Royal Academy. This collaboration has  been on-going since 2009.  In Galicia, the Group gives stable support to the  Symphonic Orchestra of Galicia and the Corua Friends  of the Opera Association, as well as to other cultural  institutions. In the field of sports, Inditex' sponsorship  focuses on amateur sport to encourage activity among  the youngest.  Health Just as during the last seven years, Inditex is contributing  to the sponsorship of the National Cardiovascular  Research Centre Foundation (PRO-CNIC Foundation).  The foundation's objective is to provide cardio vascular  research with the best infrastructure and stable financing.  It is a State institution which since 2005 contributes to  the study of cardiovascular illnesses, to professional  training in this area of medicine, and to international  collaboration between National Health System centres  and hospitals. CNIC's mission, under the authority of the  Carlos III Health Institute, is to become an international  medical leader for what is today the greatest cause of  death in developed countries.   - 97 - annual report 2011 Social assistance Social assistance sponsorship and patronage activities  round out the work done by the Group Corporate  Social Responsibility Department in 2011. Child and  youth protection, as well as protection of women in  underprivileged situations, are some of the significant  interventions made by Inditex in this field. Of importance  as well, are the monetary and in-kind donations that Group  affiliates have made in their domestic communities. In fiscal 2011 Inditex provided funds for the construction of  a shelter in collaboration with the International Education  Foundation. The objective of the centre, situated in  Madrid, is social and labour integration for minors living  there with their families.  Training Inditex believes that constant innovation and training  are the engine of growth. As such, pushing university  education in addition to internal training are key values of  the Group's business culture. During 2011 Inditex renewed  its commitment of stable donations to the Universities  of A Corua, Santiago de Compostela, and Vigo. At an  international level, the collaborative agreement with MIT  (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) begun in 2008 is  significant.  The Social Council The Social Council is Inditex's external advisory body on  matters of Corporate Social Responsibility. It is made  up of people and institutions which are external and  independent of the Group. Its function is to formalize and  institutionalize dialogue with intermediaries considered  key in Civil Society where Inditex operates its business  model.

Since then  it has maintained its place on those indexes and earned  growing valuations with respect to its labour practices  and suppliers. As a prerequisite for entry, and for subsequent listing  on the above-mentioned indexes, the participants must  undergo a rigorous analysis and selection process led by  an independent external agency. This analysis evaluates  the quality of management at companies in areas related  to corporate governance, risk management and branding,  employment practices and environmental actions, among  others. FTSE4Good Inditex has been a member of FTSE4Good for the  last nine years. It is a stock exchange sustainability  index that includes the most committed multinational  companies in the field of corporate responsibility. The  Ethical Investment Research Service (EIRiS) provides  the analyses of companies on this index. Those analyses  evaluate various environmental and social aspects as well  as corporate governance. In its most recent evaluation  EIRiS awarded Inditex a global rating of 4.3 out of 5.

In this context, good corporate  governance refers to the administrators and managers  responsible for governance acting diligently, ethically and  transparently in performing their functions. Article 5.4. of the Regulations of the Board of Directors of  Inditex says that The Board of Directors shall perform its  functions in accordance with the corporate interest, defined  as the long-term viability and maximization of the value of the  company in the common interest of all shareholders, which  should not impede other legitimate public or private interests  being taken into consideration as they affect the performance  of company activity and especially those that affect other  stakeholders in the company: employees, customers,  suppliers and society in general. The Board will determine  and review the companys business and financial strategies in  the light of this principle, attempting to establish a reasonable  balance between the chosen proposals and the risks taken.  The maximization of company value may therefore only  be understood as the continuous creation of value for  each and every stakeholder: employees, shareholders,  customers, business partners, suppliers and civil society  in general, i.e. a model of a socially responsible company  involved in a continuous two-way dialogue that benefits  every related agent. So the concept of good corporate governance becomes a  necessary instrument to meet the objective of long-term  total net wealth creation, which is achieved by management  acting ethically and transparently, while being subject to  internal and external verification and control. Such good corporate governance is an element of corporate  social responsibility, understood in its widest sense,  and thus becomes a strategic instrument for company  efficiency to achieve competitive advantages in conjunction  with social action and social responsibility in the strictest  sense and with environmental sustainability. As such, the Annual Corporate Governance Report  (ACGR) approved by the Inditex Board of Directors, in  accordance with the legally established model, is designed  as a document that provides complete and reasoned  information on the companys governance structure and  practices. This enables the market and stakeholders  to form a faithful image and complete, well-founded  judgement of the corporate governance of the Inditex Group  and regarding the degree to which the recommendations  of good governance approved to this effect have been  observed.  Corporate governance regulations They consist of:  — Social Statutes, approved by the General  Shareholders Meeting in July 2000, with various  subsequent modifications, the most recent having been  approved by the General meeting held 19 July 2011. — Regulations for the General Shareholders  Meeting, approved by this body at its 18 July 2003 meeting  and modified at General Meetings in subsequent years.  The most recent modification of this regulation was  approved at the General Meeting held 19 July 2011. — Regulations for the Board of Directors,  approved by the Board of Directors in July 2000. After  various modifications, the most recent was approved by  this body at its 13 July 2010 meeting.  — Internal Regulations for Conduct for Inditex and  its company group with regard to subjects related to the  Securities Markets, approved by the Board of Directors in  July 2000, it was written at the Board of Directors meeting  held 13 June 2006. — Internal Code of Conduct and Code of Conduct  for Inditex External Manufacturers and Suppliers, approved  by the Board of Directors on 23 February 2001, the latter  being rewritten at the meeting of the 17 July 2007. — Internal Directive on Responsible Staff Practices  for the Inditex Group, approved by the Board of Directors  on 13 June 2006.  During 2011, Inditex has continued with practical  application and consolidation of the changes made to the  above-mentioned standard so as to adapt it to the Unified  Code of Good Governance, maintaining nearly complete  compliance with recommendations of the cited Code.  For these reasons the Company Articles of Incorporation  and Regulations for the General Meeting are being  adapted to the newly revised text of the new Corporate  Law. Likewise, modifications to the form and content of  the announcement for the General Shareholders Meeting  is being modified in the Articles of Incorporation. The  functions of the Audit and Control Committee are being  adapted to the new text of resolution 18 of the Securities  Market Law and the content of the web page adapted in  order to improve shareholder information. Corporate Governance bodies and  mechanisms Inditex corporate governance is carried out through  the following institutional and operational bodies and  mechanisms:  - 107 - annual report 2011 1.- The General Shareholders Meeting.- Inditex practices  the principle of one share, one vote. Attendance at  General Meetings is not conditioned by the possession of  a minimum number of shares and there are no blocking  provisions in the Articles of Incorporation. This results in  the optimum degree of good governance. 2.- The Board of Directors.- Being made up of an Executive  Director Representing Controlling Shareholders, who  is Chairman and founder of the company, two executive  directors, a director representing controlling shareholders,  and six independent directors, to the extent that they  are all people of professional prestige and completely  separate from the executive team and main shareholders,  the percentage majority of independent directors is  proportionally much greater than would be expected  considering the companys floating capital. During the five  meetings held throughout the year, the Board of Directors,  in addition to other business, accepted the matters  dealt with by the Audit and Control Committee and the  Appointments and Remuneration Commission, analysed  and approved the results that the company is regularly  required to provide to the market and its supervisory bodies,  approved the Annual Corporate Governance Report for the  year 2010 and the Triple Report as well as the Report on  the remuneration policy for the Board of Directors itself.  3.- The Audit and Control Committee.- Exceeding legal  requirements as well as its own recommendations, this  Committee is made up of six directors, all independent as  explained above. During 2011, it met on five occasions and,  as well as examining the results of the company and the  information supplied to the market, it considered such relevant  issues for good governance as the protection and supervision  of the Inditex Group Internal Audit function, the identification  and evaluation of threats to the Group, and the analysis of the  annual report presented by the Ethics Committee.  4.- Appointments and Remuneration Commission.- This  commission is also made up of six independent directors.  During the fiscal year it held five meetings where it analysed  and reported on, among other matters, the appointment  of managers, the appointment of the new Chairman of  the Board of Directors and his executive committee being  especially important, as well as transactions with related  parties and the human resources policy of the company.  5.- The  Regulatory  Compliance  Committee  and  Management.- Reporting directly to the Audit and Control  Committee, the Regulatory Compliance Committee, made  up of the companys Chairman and Chief Executive who is  also Chairman of this Body, the General Secretary who is also  the Regulatory Compliance Manager, the Capital Markets  Manager, and the Human Resources Manager, has the  general function of promoting knowledge of, and ensuring  compliance with, the Internal Regulations for Conduct for  Inditex and its Group of companies in matters relating to the  Securities Market. During the year, it met on two occasions  with regard to specific Inditex share transactions.  6.- The Ethics Committee.- During its fifth year, this  Committee, made up of the General Secretary and the  Regulations Compliance Manager, the Human Resources  Manager, and the Corporate Social Responsibility  Manager, supervised the application by Inditex Staff of the  Code of Conduct and the Responsible Practices Directive,  an instrument designed to ensure the professional,  ethical and responsible behaviour of its employees in  carrying out company activities in any part of the world. Transparency and Information  Good governance requires stakeholders to have regular,  prompt access to relevant, adequate and reliable  information, both in relation to the rules and practice of  governance and to the results achieved. To do this, and in order to provide maximum corporate  transparency, the company, in addition to including all  relevant information and communications on its corporate  website, kept the market informed as necessary throughout  2011 by sending out relevant market releases and the  activities with institutional investors.

Notes to the consolidated annual  accounts of the Inditex Group as at  31 january 2012 The consolidated annual accounts of the Inditex Group  for the year ended 31 January 2012 have been prepared  by the board of directors of the Company and will be  submitted for approval at the corresponding annual  general shareholders meeting. The directors consider  that the consolidated annual accounts will be approved  without any changes. These annual accounts have been  prepared in accordance with the International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) and their interpretations  (IFRIC) adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and  other applicable financial reporting regulations. Inditexs financial year and that of most of its subsidiaries  starts on 1 February of each year and ends on 31 January  of the following year. The twelve-month period ended 31  January 2011 will hereinafter be referred to as 2010, the  period ended 31 January 2012 as 2011, and so on. Unless otherwise stated, the amounts shown in the  consolidated annual accounts are expressed in thousands  of euros. The euro is the Companys functional and  presentation currency. The individual annual accounts of the parent company  (Inditex) for 2011 have been prepared by the board of  directors in a separate document.  The consolidated annual accounts for 2011 are expected  to be approved by the shareholders at their annual general  meeting without changes.  The consolidated annual  accounts for 2010 were approved by the shareholders at  their annual general meeting held on 19 July 2011. These consolidated annual accounts present fairly the  consolidated equity, financial position and changes in  equity of the Inditex Group as at 31 January 2012, as well  as the results of its operations and cash flows for the year  then ended. The consolidated annual accounts for 2011 have been  prepared on the basis of the accounting records of Inditex  and the remaining group companies. These consolidated annual accounts have been prepared  on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial  instruments, which are stated at fair value. The preparation of consolidated annual accounts  requires Inditex Group management to make judgments  and estimates that affect the amounts recognized  in the consolidated annual accounts. Estimates are  constantly revised and based on historical experience,  the determination of discount rates, forecast trends  in expected events and future cash flows. These  estimates essentially refer to determining the useful  lives of property, plant and equipment, measuring  the impairment of assets in stores (notes 12 and 14),  measuring goodwill impairment (note 15), determining  the recoverability of tax loss carryforwards of group  subsidiaries located abroad (note 23) and calculating  provisions related to the outcome of litigation  proceedings and other potential liabilities for the Group  (note 20). Although these estimates have been made on the  basis of the best information available on the matters  analyzed at the time of preparing these consolidated  annual accounts, it is possible that events may take  place in the future which could make it necessary  to amend, increase or decrease these estimates in  future accounting periods, which would be carried out  prospectively, recognizing the effects of the change in  the estimation of the corresponding future consolidated  annual accounts. The basis of consolidation and accounting principles  applied are explained in note 32. 6.1 Activity and description of the Group Industria de Diseo Textil, S.A. (hereinafter Inditex), which  has its registered offices at Avenida de la Diputacin s/n  Edificio Inditex, Arteixo (A Corua, Spain), is the parent  of a group of companies, the principal activity of which  consists of the distribution of fashion items, mainly  clothing, footwear, accessories and household textile  products.

Inditex is domiciled in Spain, is listed on all  four Spanish stock exchanges and, together with its  subsidiary companies, comprises the Inditex Group (the  Group).  Each formats commercial activity is carried out through  chains of stores managed directly by companies in which  Inditex holds all or the majority of the share capital, with  the exception of certain countries where, for various  reasons, the retail selling activity is performed through  franchises. Certain franchise agreements entered into by  the Group include purchase options which, if exercised,  would entitle the Group to lease the premises in which  the franchised stores operate and the assets associated  with these stores. These options may be exercised after  a certain period of time has elapsed since the signing of  the franchise agreement.  - 116 - shareholders - economic and financial report Inditexs business model is characterized by the search  for flexibility in adapting production to market demand  by controlling the supply chain throughout the different  stages of design, manufacture and distribution. This  enables it to focus both its own and suppliers production  on changes in market trends during each sales campaign. The Groups logistics system is based on constant  deliveries from the distribution centres of the various  commercial formats to stores throughout each season.  This system essentially operates through centralized  logistics centres for each concept in which inventory is  stored and distributed to stores worldwide.  At 31 January 2012 the different Group formats have  stores in 82 countries, as follows: Number of stores Company  managed Franchises Total  Spain 1,898 34 1,932 Rest of Europe 2,199 115 2,314 America 349 76 425 Rest of the World 408 448 856 Total 4,854 673 5,527 At 31 January 2011, the geographical distribution of  stores was as follows: Number of stores Company  managed Franchises Total  Spain 1,888 37 1,925 Rest of Europe 1,882 204 2,086 America 325 70 395 Rest of the World 239 399 638 Total 4,334 710 5,044 The majority of store premises are held under operating  leases. Information on the main terms of lease contracts  is provided in note 24. 6.2 Business combinations On 27 April 2011 the Group acquired 100% of the share  capital of Delta Still, Delta B Fashion, Delta S Fashion,  Delta P Fashion, Delta M Fashion, Delta O Fashion and  Moda Mond, which held the franchises for Zara, Bershka,  Stradivarius, Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti and Oysho in  Serbia and Montenegro, for euros 15,800 thousand. This  amount was paid in cash. The purpose of this acquisition is to consolidate the  Groups commercial presence in Serbia and Montenegro. Details of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are  as follows: Amount Tangible fixed assets 6,091 Cash and equivalents 5,601 Trade and other receivables 1,462 Inventories 4,482 Trade and other payables 13,819 Total net assets 3,817 The sales revenues contributed since 27 April 2011 by the  franchises acquired by the Group amount to euros 35,137  thousand, while the profit generated totals euros 3,273  thousand. Had the aforementioned franchises been consolidated  since 1 February 2011, the sales revenues and profit  contributed would have been euros 48,171 thousand and  euros 20,670 thousand, respectively. The goodwill generated on this business combination  amounts to euros 12,197 thousand and is primarily  attributable to the value of the network of stores acquired  and to the synergies expected from their integration into  the Group.

Net foreign exchange  differences are principally due to fluctuations in the  currencies with which the Group operates (see note 26)  between the time when income, expenses, acquisitions  or disposals of assets are recognized and when the  corresponding assets or liabilities are realized or settled  under applicable accounting principles.   6.8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share was calculated by dividing net  profit for the year attributable to the parent company  by the weighted average number of ordinary shares  outstanding during the year, excluding the average  number of treasury shares held by the Group (see note  22), which totaled 623,227,952 in 2011 and 623,109,136 in  2010. Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on profit  attributable to the holders of equity instruments of the  Company and a weighted average number of ordinary  shares outstanding after adjustment for the dilution  effect of all potential ordinary shares. No transactions in  the accompanying consolidated annual accounts have a  potential dilution effect on earnings per share. 6.9 Segment reporting The principal activity of the Inditex Group comprises the  retail distribution of clothing, footwear, accessories and  household textile products through various commercial  format stores aimed at different targeted sectors of the  public.

The  internal organisation of the Inditex Group, the decision- making process and the system for communicating  information to the board of directors and group  management are organised by commercial format and  geographical areas.

It does this by compiling and measuring the  main risks of damage, loss of profits and responsibilities  affecting the Group and implements prevention and  protection policies aimed at reducing the frequency and  intensity of these risks. Likewise, standard measurement criteria are established  at corporate level which enable the different exposure  risks to be quantified, measured and insured. The Group contracts insurance policies through corporate  insurance programmes to protect its assets from risk and  establishes limits, risk retention and conditions according  to the nature of such risk and the financial relevance of the  subsidiary. This structure mainly comprises worldwide  insurance programmes through which the main risks of  the Group are managed.  6. 13 Investment property Investment property mainly relates to premises and other  properties leased to third parties.

The goodwill corresponding to BCN Diseos, S.A. de  C.V. was generated upon acquisition of the holder of the  franchise rights to the Massimo Dutti format in Mexico  in 2004. In 2005 Inditex acquired the Polish company formerly  called Young Fashion Sp. Zo.o. (now Zara Polska S.p.  Zo.o), which until then held the franchise rights to Zara  in that country.  In 2006 Inditex acquired 100% of the share capital of the  Russian company formerly known as Zao Stockmann- Kranoselskaya (currently Zao Zara CIS), which until then  held the franchise rights to Zara in that country.  In 2007 Inditex acquired the companies which held  the franchise rights to the Pull&Bear and Stradivarius  formats in Russia, thus generating goodwill of euros 428  thousand and 6,719 thousand, respectively. Additions for 2011 reflect the goodwill generated on the  acquisition of companies (note 2).  Goodwill arising from the acquisition or cancellation of  franchise contracts is equivalent to the value of intangible  assets that did not comply with the requirements  established in IFRS 3 for separate recognition. These  requirements were essentially with regard to the assets  capacity to generate future cash flow.  The recoverability of goodwill is adequately guaranteed  through the profitability of the acquired companies,  whose future cash flows justify their net value at year  end (note 32.2-g). This recoverable value is calculated  based on the 2012 budget and the business plan for the  following years, which is prepared taking into account  expected performance for comparable stores and the  expansion plan associated with the units under analysis. 6.16 Financial investments Details and changes during 2011 and 2010 are as follows:  - 125 - annual report 2011 Non-current investment securities mainly correspond  to a stake in Banco Gallego. The investment in Economic Interest Groupings (EIGs)  comprises Inditexs shareholding in ten economic  interest groupings (10 at 31 January 2011), the activity  of which is the leasing of assets managed by a separate,  non-group entity which retains most of the profits and is  exposed to the risks associated with this activity. These  groupings have applied the fiscal incentives established  in prevailing Spanish legislation (see note 23), the effect  of which is shown under Income tax in the consolidated  income statement.   6.17 Other non-current assets Details and movement during 2011 and 2010 are as  follows: Guarantees Other Total Balance at 01/02/2010 151,041 19,241 170,282 Acquisitions 39,975 3,497 43,473 Disposals (6,468) (77) (6,546) Profit/(Loss) for the year - (3,341) (3,341) Transfers    278 114 393 Foreign exchange translation 8,370 795 9,165 Saldo at 31/01/2011 193,196 20,229 213,425 Guarantees Other Total Balance at 01/02/2011 193,196 20,229 213,425 Acquisitions 31,316 2,798 34,114 Acquisitions of new  companies 9 0 9 Disposals (14,089) (520) (14,609) Profit/(Loss) for the year (159) (2,541) (2,700) Transfers    (225) 217 (8) Foreign exchange  translation  10,371 338 10,709 Balance at 31/01/2012 220,420 20,521 240,941 Investment securities Investments in EIGs Loans and other  credit facilities Total Balance at 01/02/2010 8,681 5,212 1,499 15,392 Acquisitions 84 - 24 108 Disposals (3,086) (3,191) (302) (6,579) Balance at 31/01/2011 5,679 2,021 1,221 8,921 Balance at 01/02/2011 5,679 2,021 1,221 8,921 Acquisitions 100 - - 100 Disposals (68) 539 9 480 Balance at 31/01/2012 5,711 2,560 1,230 9,501  - 126 - shareholders - economic and financial report Guarantees are mainly amounts deposited with landlords  of leased commercial premises to ensure compliance with  the conditions stipulated in lease contracts (see note 24). 6.18 Trade and other payables  Details in 2011 and 2010 are as follows: 31/01/12 31/01/11 Trade payables 1,838,088 1,886,672 Personnel 178,456 145,572 Public entities 353,570 289,337 Other current payables 105,026 98,003 Total 2,475,140 2,419,583 At 31 January 2011 the Group had euros 5,285 thousand  payable to suppliers for which the maximum legal  payment period had elapsed. This period is stipulated  in the measures to combat bad debts contained in Law  15/2010 of 5 July 2010, amending Law 3/2004 of 29  December 2004.  As permitted by the second transitional provision of the  ruling issued by the Spanish Accounting and Auditing  Institute (ICAC) on 29 December 2010, the comparative  information for 2010 does not include disclosures  regarding payments made within the legal payment  period established by Law 15/2010 or regarding the  weighted average period by which payments are past- due as this is the first year of application of the new  disclosure requirements of the aforementioned law.

Interest on financial debt is negotiated by the Group on  the respective financial markets and usually consists  of a monetary market index plus a spread in line with  the solvency of the company (parent or subsidiary)  contracting the debt. Financial debt is stated in the following currencies: 31/01/2012 31/01/2011 Euro 1,149 5,788 Other European currencies 255 397 Other currencies 826 669 2,230 6,854 The maturity of group loans and borrowings at 31  January 2012 and 2011 is as follows: 31/01/2012 31/01/2011 Less than one year 686 2,682 Between one and five years 1,544 4,172 2,230 6,854 6.20 Provisions Details and movement during 2011 is as follows: Pensions and similar  obligations with personnel Contingent  liabilities Other  provisions       Total               Balance at 01/02/2011 33,130 123,480 - 156,610 Provisions recorded during the year 16,019 29,189 13,752 58,960 Acquisitions of new companies 14 101 - 115 Disposals (136) (57,708) - (57,844) Transfers (10,552) - - (10,552) Foreign exchange translation  (270) 299 - 29 Balance at 31/01/2012 38,205 95,361 13,752 147,318  - 128 - shareholders - economic and financial report Provision for pensions and other obligations with  personnel  Certain group companies have undertaken to settle  specific obligations with personnel. The Group has  a provision to cover the liability corresponding to the  estimated accrued portion of these commitments at 31  January 2012.  Provision for contingent liabilities The Group is exposed to certain contingencies because  of its international presence. The amounts shown here  correspond to current obligations from legal claims  or constructive obligations deriving from past actions  which include a probable outflow of resources that has  been reliably estimated. At the date of preparation of  these consolidated accounts, there are no litigation  proceedings whose final outcome could significantly  affect the Companys equity.  The directors of Inditex consider that the provisions  recorded in the consolidated balance sheet adequately  cover  risks  deriving  from  litigation  proceedings,  arbitration hearings and other contingencies, and do not  expect any additional liabilities to arise therefrom. Given  the nature of the risks, it is not possible to estimate when  any contingent liability may have to be settled. 6.21 Other non-current liabilities Details and movement during 2011 and 2010 are as  follows: Options with partners Lease incentives Other       Total            Balance at 01/02/2010 37,981 281,302 35,706 354,989 Acquisitions 8,839 44,788 8,829 62,456 Changes through profit or loss 5,537 (324) 0 5,213 Disposals (35,972) (996) (20,423) (57,391) Transfers (2,133) 30,458 0 28,325 Foreign exchange translation  (1,416) 2,399 0 983 Balance at 31/01/2011 12,836 357,627 24,112 394,575 Balance at 01/02/2011 12,836 357,627 24,112 394,575 Acquisitions 1,085 89,564 687 91,336 Changes through profit or loss 3,396 (21,782) 870 (17,516) Disposals 0 (780) (12,103) (12,883) Transfers (8,839) 21,461 (107) 12,515 Foreign exchange translation (1,662) 3,029 41 1,408 Balance at 31/01/2012 6,816 449,118 13,500 469,434  - 129 - annual report 2011 At 31 January 2012 and 2011 the Group has a call option  on 20% of the share capital of Zara Retail Korea, Ltd. This  shareholding belongs to Lotte Shopping Co., Ltd, which  in turn has a put option to sell its entire shareholding to  Diseo Textil, S.A.   In 2011 additions to options with  partners are due to the  liability generated by recognition of the option on Zara  Australia. Additions to options with partners recognized through  profit and loss have been included under Other net  operating income/(losses) (euros 3,396 thousand in  2011 and euros 3,604 thousand in 2010) (see note 6). The  consolidated income statement for 2010 also included  additions of euros 1,933 thousand recognized under  Financial results. 6.22 Capital and reserves Share capital At 31 January 2012 and 2011, parent company share  capital amounted to euros 93,499,560 and is represented  by 623,330,400 registered shares of euros 0.15 par value  each, subscribed and fully paid. All shares belong to a  single class and series, have the same voting and profit- sharing rights and are represented by book entries. The parent companys share premium at 31 January  2012 and 2011 amounted to euros 20,379 thousand,  while retained earnings totaled euros 2,346,845 thousand  and euros 2,177,547 thousand, respectively. The parent  companys legal reserve, amounting to euros 18,700  thousand, has been appropriated in compliance with  Article 274 of the Spanish Companies Act, which requires  that companies transfer 10% of profits for the year to  a legal reserve until this reserve reaches an amount  equal to 20% of share capital.  The legal reserve is not  distributable to shareholders and if it is used to offset  losses, in the event that no other reserves are available,  the reserve must be replenished with future profits.  At 31 January 2012 and 2011, the parent company has  appropriated to this reserve the minimum amount  required by law. At 31 January 2012 the restricted consolidated reserves  of the Group amount to euros 3,009,072 thousand (euros  2,603,833 thousand at 31 January 2011). Inditex shares are listed on the four Spanish stock  exchanges. As shares are represented by book entries  and the Company therefore does not maintain a record  of shareholders, it is not possible to accurately know  the share structure of the Company. According to public  information registered with the Spanish Stock Exchange  Commission, at 31 January 2012 the members of the  board of directors controlled, directly or indirectly,  approximately 59.36% of parent company share capital,  compared to 59.33% as at 31 January 2011 (see note  30). Gartler, S.L. held 50.010% of the shares of INDITEX  (50.010% at 31 January 2011). Dividends Dividends distributed by the parent company during  2011 and 2010 amounted to euros 997,152 thousand and  euros 747,731 thousand, respectively. These amounts  correspond to earnings of 1.60 cents per share in 2011  (1.20 cents in 2010).  The distribution of profit proposed by the board of  directors is shown in note 29. Treasury shares Through the agreements reached by the shareholders  and the board of directors at the respective meetings  held on 19 July 2011, and in accordance with Article 219 of  the Revised Spanish Companies Act and Article 33 of the  Companys bylaws, Inditex approved a restricted share- settled plan for the Chairman and CEO (hereinafter the  Plan). The Plan is a one off incentive, motivated by the  CEOs appointment as Chairman of the Company.  The Plan amounts to a total of 221,264 ordinary shares,  which prior to the date were treasury shares held by  Inditex. The shares comprise the following two groups: — 41,000 shares with an average acquisition cost  of euros 2.18 per share. — 180,264 shares with an acquisition cost of euros  2.93 per share. As a result of executing the Plan Inditex holds no treasury  shares at 31 January 2012.  The Company shares included in the Plan were awarded  on a single date, which was also the date on which the  expense was accrued for accounting purposes. The  consequent impact on the income statement, which  totaled euros 13,734 thousand, was calculated on the  basis of the average stock exchange price of Inditex  shares on the day they were awarded and was recognized  under Operating expenses. 6.23 Income tax With the exception of Industria de Diseo Textil, S.A.,  Indipunt, S.L. and Tempe, S.A, companies whose  information is incorporated into these consolidated  annual accounts file individual tax returns.  - 130 - shareholders - economic and financial report Industria de Diseo Textil, S.A. is the parent of a group  of companies that files consolidated tax returns in Spain.  The consolidated tax group is composed of Inditex, S.A.,  the parent, and Spanish subsidiaries which comply  with prevailing tax legislation for filing consolidated tax  returns. The subsidiaries that comprise this tax group are  the following:  Bershka BSK Espaa, S.A. Oysho Logstica, S.A. Bershka Diseo, S.L. Plataforma Europa, S.A. Bershka  Logstica, S.A.

Tempe, S.A. is also the parent of the tax group formed  with its subsidiaries Tempe Diseo, S.L. and Tempe  Logstica, S.A. Income tax payable in the consolidated balance sheet  corresponds to the 2011 income tax provision, net of  withholdings and payments on account made during the  period. Trade and other payables include the liability  deriving from the remaining applicable taxes. Income tax receivable in the consolidated balance sheet  essentially corresponds to amounts recoverable from the  taxation authorities. Trade and other receivables mainly  include the difference between VAT recoverable and VAT  receivable. Industria de Diseo Textil S. A. holds a 49% stake in five  economic interest groupings (EIGs), 46% in one EIG, 50%  in two EIGs and 49.5% in two EIGs. These groupings  lease assets as their activity. They requested from the  tax authorities, and were granted, tax incentives in  accordance with income tax legislation.  The aforementioned operations have given rise to positive  and negative adjustments to taxable income mentioned  above, which have been treated as permanent differences.  A euros 10,184 thousand tax credit for investments (euros  9,421 thousand in 2010) has also been applied for these  operations. In 2011 the cost of the investment has been  adjusted by euros 2,328 thousand (euros 10,068 thousand  in 2010) and a deferred tax liability reduced by euros 6,338  thousand. The effects of these adjustments are recognized  in the income tax expense account, representing, in total,  a reduction in the expense of euros 4,009 thousand (euros  7,469 thousand in 2010).  The income tax expense comprises both current and  deferred tax. Current tax is the amount of income taxes  payable in respect of the taxable profit for the year.  Deferred tax is the amount of income taxes payable or  recoverable in future years and arises from the recognition  of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The income tax expense comprises the following: 2011 2010 Current taxes 719,949 588,338 Deferred taxes (106,469) (8,033) A reconciliation of the income tax expense under the  prevailing Spanish general income tax rate to Profit  before tax and the expense recorded in the consolidated  income statement for 2011 and 2010 is as follows:  - 131 - annual report 2011 2011 2010 Consolidated accounting income  before taxes 2,559,012 2,321,585 Income tax expense at tax rate prevailing  in the country of the parent company 767,704 696,476 Net permanent differences: Individual companies (97,892) (3,374) Consolidation adjustments 38,386 26,760 Effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions (86,646) (170,640) Capitalization of prior years' losses and  credits 206 (966) Adjustment to prior years' taxes 31,431 (5,032) Other adjustments (2,862) 52,567 Adjustments to deferred tax assets and  liabilities (12,324) 0 Tax credits and deductions (24,523) (15,486) Income tax expense 613,480 580,305 Permanent differences mainly correspond to non- deductible expenses, the allocation of taxable income  to EIGs and the portion attributable to taxable income  related to a contribution of rights to use certain assets to  a subsidiary and the exemption of income from permanent  establishments abroad. Temporary differences are the difference between the  carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base.  The consolidated balance sheet at 31 January 2012 reflects  deferred tax assets and liabilities at that date. Details of Deferred tax assets and Deferred tax  liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance  sheet are as follows: Deferred tax assets: 2011 2010 Provisions 50,656 52,723 Amortisation 65,114 36,442 Lease incentives 19,107 15,276 Subsidiary valuation adjustments 41,019 12,706 Tax losses 48,432 48,481 Intragroup transactions 81,264 71,888 Other 50,780 61,834 Total 356,372 299,350 Deferred tax liabilities: 2011 2010 Leasing operations 1,970 2,305 Intragroup transactions 35,094 31,220 Amortisation 43,624 42,995 Subsidiary valuation  adjustments 46,392 61,169 Reinvestment of profits 3,957 4,127 Other 51,494 30,832 Total 182,531 172,648 Movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2011  and 2010 is as follows: Deferred tax  assets Deferred tax  liabilities Balance at 01/02/2011 299,350 172,648 Charge/credit to income  statement (60,004) (22,159) Charge/credit to reserves 2,982 32,042 Balance at 31/01/2012 356,372 182,531 These balances have been determined based on tax rates  which, according to enacted fiscal legislation, will be in  force during the years in which the balances are expected  to reverse and which, in certain cases, differ from the tax  rates prevailing in the current year. Certain companies forming part of the consolidated group  have reserves which could be taxable if distributed. The  accompanying consolidated financial statements include  the tax effect of those cases in which a firm decision has  been taken to distribute reserves. As permitted by the prevailing tax legislation in each  country, group companies have applied tax credits  amounting to euros 24,523 thousand (euros 15,486  thousand at 31 January 2011). These credits and  deductions mainly relate to investments and, to a lesser  extent, to other credits. At 31 January 2012, the Group has tax losses of euros  186,140 thousand (euros 158,206 thousand at 31 January  2011) which may be offset against future profits, the  majority of which may be utilized indefinitely. Deferred  tax assets in respect of tax losses are only recognized   - 132 - shareholders - economic and financial report when there is evidence that future taxable profits will be  available against which the asset can be utilized. The tax inspections of the consolidated Spanish tax group  were concluded during the year. These inspections have  had no impact on the Groups financial statements, nor  have they brought to light any significant additional tax  liabilities. Certain foreign subsidiaries are also undergoing  inspection, including those domiciled in the United  Kingdom, United States, Greece, Canada and France.  The Group does not expect that significant additional  liabilities will arise as a result of these inspections or  those that could be carried out in the future in relation to  periods that have not yet expired. Years open to inspection by the tax authorities for all main  applicable taxes vary depending on the tax legislation  in each country. The directors do not expect that any  significant additional liabilities affecting group equity or  results would arise in the event of inspection. 6.24 Operating leases Most of the commercial premises from which the Group  carries out its retail distribution activities are leased  from third parties. These rental contracts are classified  as operating leases since, irrespective of the lease term  and the amounts paid or due to the owners of the leased  premises, there is no transfer of risks and rewards  inherent to ownership.  Due to the presence of the Group in different countries,  the variety of legislation governing lease contracts, the  diverse nature and economic status of the owners and  other factors, there is a broad range of clauses regulating  lease contracts. In many cases the lease contracts simply establish  a fixed rental payment, normally monthly, adjusted  for inflation based on a price index. In other cases the  amounts payable to the lessor are a percentage of the  sales obtained by the Group in the leased premises.   These variable lease payments or contingent rent may  have minimum guaranteed amounts or certain rules of  calculation attached. In some countries lease contracts  are periodically indexed to market rates, which on  occasion entails an increase in rent, but rent is not reduced  when market rates fall.  Occasionally, staggered rental  payments are agreed, which means cash outflows can be  reduced during the initial years of the use of commercial  premises, although the expense is recognized on a  straight-line basis (see note 32.2-p).  Free rental periods  are also frequently established in order to avoid having  to pay rent when premises are being refurbished and  prepared for opening.  Rental contracts also sometimes require lessees to pay  certain amounts to the lessor, which, from an economic  perspective, could be considered advance rental payments,  or to the previous tenants so that they waive certain rights  or transfer them to the Group (transfer rights or different  types of indemnities). These amounts are recognized  as non-current assets (see note 14) and are generally  amortised over the term of the lease contract. On certain occasions, shopping centre developers or  the proprietors of leased premises make contributions  towards the establishment of the Groups business in  their premises. These contributions are treated as lease  incentives (see note 21) and are taken to income over the  lease term. A wide variety of situations also apply to the duration of  lease contracts, which generally have an initial term of  between 15 and 25 years.  However, legislation in certain  countries or the situations in which lease contracts  are typically used means the duration of contacts is  sometimes shorter. In some countries, legislation or the  lease contracts themselves protect the right of the lessee  to terminate the contract providing sufficient advance  notice (e.g. three months) is given. In other cases,  however, the Group is obliged to comply with the full term  of the contract, or at least a significant part thereof. Some  contracts combine these undertakings with termination  clauses that may only be exercised at certain times over  the term of the contract (e.g. every five years or at the end  of the tenth year).  Details of operating lease expenses are as follows:  2011 2010 Minimum installments 1,179,864 1,143,503 Contingent installments 218,868 128,573 1,398,732 1,272,076 Sub-leasing income 5,301 4,292 Future minimum payments under non-cancelable  operating leases are as follows: Lease payments 2011 Less than one year One to five years Over five years 854,274 1,288,930 679,401  - 133 - annual report 2011 Lease payments 2010 Less than one year One to five years Over five years 813,592 1,222,219 661,797 6.25 Finance leases The Group has contracted finance leases mainly  for commercial premises and logistics centres. The  corresponding leased assets are recorded under  property, plant and equipment in the consolidated  balance sheet (see note 12), while the related debt is  recognized as a financial liability (see note 19). The  carrying amount of items acquired under lease financing  and the future amounts payable until the leases expire  are as follows:  31/01/2012 31/01/2011 Cost of the asset 36,515 37,273 Accumulated depreciation (13,077) (12,242) 23,438 25,031 Minimum payments  31/01/2012 31/01/2011 Less than one year 255 2,391 One to five years 781 884 1,036 3,275 6.26 Risk management and financial  instruments FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES The Groups activities are exposed to various financial  risks: market risk (including exchange rate risk), credit  risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk related to cash  flows. The Groups risk management policy centers on  the uncertainty of financial markets and attempts to  minimize the potential adverse effects on the Groups  profitability through the use of certain financial  instruments as described below. This note provides information on the Groups exposure  to each of the aforementioned risks, the Groups  objectives, policies and processes for managing risk, the  methods used to measure these risks and any changes  from the previous year. Currency risk The Group operates in an international environment and,  accordingly, is exposed to currency risk, particularly  relating to the US Dollar and, to a lesser extent, the  Mexican Peso, the Russian Ruble, Chinese Renminbi,  Japanese Yen and the UK Pound Sterling. Currency  risk arises on future commercial transactions, assets  and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies, and net  investments in foreign businesses. The Group has various investments in foreign businesses,  the net assets of which are exposed to currency risk  which is managed in line with group management  policies. During 2011, had the value of the euro increased by 10%  compared to the US Dollar and, as a result, compared  to the rest of the foreign currencies linked to the US  Dollar, all other things being equal, consolidated profit  after income tax would have been approximately euros  68,599 thousand higher (euros 73,639 thousand in 2010),  primarily because of the translation of subsidiaries  financial statements expressed in currencies other than  the euro, and the impact on the portion of merchandise  purchases in US Dollars not covered by exchange rate  hedges. Credit risk The Group is not exposed to significant concentrations  of credit risk, as policies are in place to cover sales to  franchises and retail sales comprise the vast majority  of revenue. Collections are primarily made in cash or  through credit card payments. The Group also limits its exposure to credit risk by  investing solely in products that have high liquidity and  credit ratings. Provision is made for the impairment of trade receivables  when objective evidence exists that the Group will  be unable to recover all the outstanding amounts in  accordance with the original contractual conditions  of the receivables. This provision is calculated as the  difference between the carrying amount and the present  value of future estimated cash flows discounted at the  effective interest rate and is recognized in the income  statement.  Net reversals during the year in respect of  value adjustments to the balances recorded under this  caption amount to euros 19,005 thousand (euros 5,043   - 134 - shareholders - economic and financial report thousand in 2010) and correspond to doubtful trade  receivables. At 31 January 2012 and 2011 no significant outstanding  balances exist. Furthermore, based on available  historical data, the Group does not consider it necessary  to make value adjustments to receivables which are not  past due. The fair value of receivables is equal to their  carrying amount. The main financial assets of the Group are shown under  Financial Instruments: other information. Liquidity risk The Group is not exposed to significant liquidity risk,  as it maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents to  meet the outflows of normal operations. In the event  the Group requires financing, either in euros or in other  currencies, it reverts to loans, credit facilities or other  types of financial instruments (see note 19). Details of financial liabilities are disclosed in note 19,  along with their expected maturities.  Interest rate risk Interest rate fluctuations affect the fair value of assets  and liabilities which accrue a fixed rate of interest, as  well as future cash flows from assets and liabilities  indexed to a variable interest rate. Group exposure to  this risk is not significant for the reasons mentioned  above. The Group does not have any financial assets or  liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or interest- rate financial derivatives. Given the Groups investment  policy, any changes in interest rates at year end would  not significantly affect consolidated profits. Capital management The Groups capital management objectives are to  safeguard the Groups ability to continue operating as a  going concern so that it can continue to generate returns  for shareholders, benefit other interested parties, and  maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost  of capital. The Group manages its capital structure and makes  adjustments thereto in response to changes in  economic conditions. No significant changes to capital  management have been made during the year. Neither the Company nor Inditex group subsidiaries are  subject to strict capital management criteria. Financial instruments Merchandise and goods for resale are partly acquired  from foreign suppliers in US Dollars. In accordance with  prevailing currency risk policies, group management  contracts derivatives, mainly forward contracts, to hedge  cash flow fluctuations related with exchange rates.  Certain group subsidiaries are granted internal financing  denominated in currencies other than the euro. In  accordance with prevailing currency risk policies,  derivatives are contracted, mainly forward contracts  and swaps, to hedge cash flow fluctuations related with  exchange rates and interest rates.  Moreover, and as described in note 32.2.n, the Group  applies hedge accounting to mitigate the volatility effect  that contracting hedge instruments prior to recording the  associated transactions would have on the consolidated  income statement.  The expiry dates of hedging instruments have been  negotiated to coincide with the expiry dates of the  hedged items. In 2011, there were no highly probable  transactions to which hedge accounting was applied  which did not occur, nor were any significant amounts  taken to the income statement due to the ineffectiveness  of these hedges. At 31 January 2012 and 2011, the Group had outstanding  derivatives, basically comprising forward purchase  commitments in US Dollars and forward sale  commitments in Mexican Pesos, as reflected in Other  financial assets and Other financial liabilities. Details of forward purchases in US Dollars are as  follows:  Currency Sale/purchase EUR/USD Fair value (EURO) 31/01/12 50,684 31/01/11 (34,256) Nominal value (USD) 31/01/12 1,832,556 31/01/11 1,582,171 Average term of remaining  months 31/01/12 5.45 31/01/11 6.39 The nominal value of the Groups Mexican Peso derivatives  totals Mexican Pesos 51,797 thousand at 31 January 2012  (Mexican Pesos 1,855,765 thousand at 31 January 2011).  The Group no longer contracts hedges of this type.  - 135 - annual report 2011 The fair value of forward currency contracts has been  calculated using measurement techniques based on the  spot exchange rate and interest rate curves (level 2).  Approximately 60% of cash flows associated with hedges  in US Dollars are expected to be generated during the six  months subsequent to year end, while the remaining 40%  is expected to be generated between six months to a year.  It is also likely that the impact on consolidated profit and  loss will arise during these periods. Financial instruments: further information The main financial assets held by the Group, other  than cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial  instruments, comprise loans and receivables related to  the Groups principal activity and guarantees in relation to  the lease of commercial premises, which are shown under  other non-current assets. The main financial assets of the  Group are as follows: 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents 3,466,752 3,433,452 Trade receivables 106,003 89,884 Sales to franchises 110,061 112,218 Other current receivables 53,025 47,672 Guarantees 220,420 193,196 Total 3,956,262 3,876,422 The financial liabilities of the Group mainly comprise  debts and payables on commercial transactions. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured  at amortised cost does not differ substantially from their  carrying amount, taking into account that in the majority  of cases collection or payment is made in the short term.  In 2011, no significant financial asset impairment has  been recognized. 6.27 Employee benefits DEFINED BENEFIT OR CONTRIBUTION PLAN OBLIGATIONS In general, the Group has no defined benefit or  contribution plan obligations with its employees.  However, in line with prevailing labour legislation or  customary practice in certain countries, the Group  assumes certain commitments related with the payment  of specific amounts for accidents, illness, retirement,  etc., to which employees sometimes contribute. The  associated risk is partially or fully externalized through  insurance policies.  Furthermore, in some countries employees receive a  share of the profits generated by group companies. The  liabilities associated with these items are recognized  under Trade and other payables and Other non- current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.  The impact of these obligations on the consolidated  income statement and the consolidated balance sheet  is not significant. Long-term incentive plan In 2010 Inditexs board of directors authorized a long- term incentive plan for members of the management  team and other personnel from Inditex and its group  of companies. By complying with the terms of the plan,  each beneficiary is entitled to receive an incentive up to  a designated maximum.  The plan started on 1 February 2010 and ends on 31  January 2013. Incentives are divided into an initial  payment for the period ended 31 January 2012 and a  final payment for the period ending 31 January 2013.  For entitlement to the initial and final payments,  employees are required to fulfill the specific conditions  of the plan and to remain in the employment of Inditex or  any other Inditex Group company from 1 February 2010  until the end of the two periods stated. Exceptions are  made where contracts are terminated early (e.g. death,  retirement, permanent disability or unfair dismissal),  in which cases any designated incentives to which the  employees are entitled will be paid pro rata based on  the period they remained in employment after the plan  started compared to the full period of the plan or, in the  case of initial payments, the duration of this first period.  The liability for long-term incentives is recognized  under Provisions (non-current portion) and Payables  (current portion) in the consolidated balance sheet and  under Operating expenses in the consolidated income  statement. The impact of these obligations on the  consolidated income statement and the consolidated  balance sheet is not significant.  6.28 Interest in joint ventures  Inditex has a 50% stake in the group formed by the parent  Tempe, S.A. and its subsidiaries Tempe Mxico, S.A. de  C.V., Tempe Brasil, S.A., Tempe Logstica, S.A.,Tempe  Diseo, S.L., Tempe Trading and Inditex Asia, Ltd.

At the  meeting held on 14 June 2011 Inditexs board of directors  agreed to contract a benefits plan for the Chairman/CEO,  as part of his remuneration for carrying out his senior  management duties. The Plan is a defined contribution  plan, consisting of a group life insurance policy contracted  by Inditex with a prestigious insurance company operating  in the Spanish market. The plan contributions are payable  by Inditex and will be settled in single annual installments  each September. These annual contributions are  equivalent to 50% of the fixed base salary approved by  Inditex for the Chairman and CEO for each year. Inditexs  contribution to the Plan during 2011 amounts to euros  1,500 thousand.   6.31 External auditors Details of fees and expenses accrued by KPMG  International (main auditor) and associated firms in  relation to services rendered to consolidated companies  are as follows:  - 139 - annual report 2011 The figures in the above tables include the total fees for  services rendered in 2011 and 2010, irrespective of the  date of invoice. In addition to the audit of the Inditex Group annual  accounts, audit services rendered by KPMG also include  certain audit work related with the external audit. Non-audit services, mainly relating to corporate  social responsibility, include inspection of suppliers  workshops and factories and other services rendered  to certain foreign group subsidiaries. According to information received from the auditors,  fees received from the Inditex Group by KPMG  International or associated firms do not exceed 0.037%  of total revenue. 6.32 Selected accounting policies 6.32.1) BaSIS oF CoNSoLIDatIoN i) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the parent  company. Control exists when the parent company has  the power, directly or indirectly, to govern financial  and operating policies. Subsidiaries are consolidated  by aggregating the total amount of assets, liabilities,  income, expenses and cash flows, after carrying out  the adjustments and eliminations relating to intragroup  operations. The results of subsidiaries acquired during  the year are included in the consolidated annual accounts  from the date that control commences.  Net identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent  liabilities assumed as part of a business combination are  stated at fair value at the date of acquisition, providing  this has taken place after 1 January 2004, the date of  transition to EU-IFRS.  For business combinations subsequent to that date,  any consideration given plus the value assigned to  non-controlling interests that is in excess of the net  assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized  as goodwill. Any shortfall determined between the  consideration given, the value assigned to non- controlling interests and identifiable net assets acquired  is recognized in profit and loss.  Acquisitions of shares in businesses subsequent to  gaining control and partial disposals that do not result  in a loss of control are recognized as equity transactions  with shareholders.  Acquisitions of entities prior to this date were recognized  in accordance with applicable accounting principles in  Spain once all necessary corrections and adjustments  at the transition date were taken into account. In  accordance with EU-IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but  systematically tested for impairment.  Non-controlling interests in the consolidated statement  of changes in equity are presented separately from the  consolidated equity attributable to parent company  shareholders. These are investments held in group  companies prior to the transition to EU-IFRS and  therefore the value of the equity interests is equivalent  to the share in the carrying amount of the assets and  liabilities of the investees.  The results and each component of other comprehensive  income are allocated to equity attributable to shareholders  of the parent and to non-controlling interests in proportion  to their investment, although this implies a balance  receivable from non-controlling interests. Agreements  entered into between the Group and non-controlling  interests are recognized as a separate transaction. Non-controlling interests in the equity and results of  subsidiaries are presented under Equity attributable to  non-controlling interests and Profit attributable to non- controlling interests, respectively. Details of subsidiaries  and jointly-controlled entities are provided in Appendix I. ii) Joint ventures  Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities  the Group has joint control, established by contractual  agreement. The consolidated annual accounts include, in  each individual caption of the balance sheet and income  statement, the Groups proportionate share in these  entities assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash  flows from the date that joint control commences until  the date that joint control ceases. iii) Harmonization of criteria Each of the entities included in the consolidated group  prepares its annual accounts and other accounting  records in accordance with accounting policies and  legislation applicable in the country of origin. When these  accounting criteria and policies are different to those  adopted by Inditex in the preparation of its consolidated  annual accounts, they have been adjusted in order  to present the consolidated annual accounts using  homogeneous accounting principles. iv) Intragroup eliminations Intragroup balances and transactions, and any unrealized  gains or losses arising from transactions with third  parties, are eliminated in the consolidation process. In  the case of jointly controlled entities, balances, revenues  and expenses between intragroup companies, and any  unrealized gains or losses arising from transactions with  third parties, are eliminated in the consolidation process  to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.  - 140 - shareholders - economic and financial report v) Translation of foreign currency operations The Group has applied the exemption relating to  accumulated translation differences from IFRS 1 First- time Adoption of International Financial Reporting  Standards and, therefore, any translation differences  recognized in the consolidated annual accounts  generated prior to 1 January 2004 are recorded under  reserves. Since that date, the financial statements of  entities with a functional currency other than the euro  are translated as follows — Assets and liabilities are translated to euro  at foreign exchange rates prevailing at the balance  sheet date. — Items that comprise the equity of these entities  are translated to euro at historical exchange rates (or, for  accumulated results, at the average exchange rate for  the year in which they were generated). — Income and expenses are translated into euros  at the exchange rate prevailing on the date on which they  were recognized, while average exchange rates are used  in those cases in which the application of this criterion  does not generate significant differences. Differences arising from the application of these  exchange rates are included in consolidated equity under  Translation differences. Exchange differences deriving from trade balances  payable and receivable and financing operations between  group companies, with foreseeable settlement, are  recognized in the income statement for the year. vi) Financial statements in hyperinflationary countries The financial statements of foreign operations in countries  considered to have hyperinflationary economies have  been adjusted prior to translation to euro to account for  the effect of changes in prices. vii) Entities with a closing date different to that of the  Group Entities with a closing date different to that of the  consolidated accounts have been consolidated with the  financial statements at their closing date (31 December  2011; see Appendix I). Significant operations carried out  between the closing date of these subsidiaries and that  of the consolidated accounts are subject to temporal  harmonization. viii) Changes to the consolidated Group The following entities were incorporated or acquired  by the Group and consolidated for the first time during  the year: Zara Taiwan, B.V. Massimo Dutti Puerto Rico, INC Zara Taiwan, B.V. TW Branch KG Massimo Dutti  Deutschland, B.V. & CO. Zara Vittorio 11 Italia S.R.L. Massimo Dutti Serbia,  D.O.O. Belgrade Zara BH, D.O.O.

The companies called Oysho Deutschland, Gmbh, ITX  E-Commerce and Inditex Asia LTD at 31 January 2011  changed their names to BSKE Gmbh, ITX Fashion Retail  LTD and Tempe Trading Asia Limited, respectively,  during the year. Kiddys Class Portugal Confecoes Lda.  was merged into Zara Portugal Confecoes Lda. The incorporations to the consolidated group referred to  above have not had a material impact on the consolidated  annual accounts for 2011. 6.32.2) aCCouNtINg pRINCIpLeS New standards and interpretations have been published  at the date of preparing the annual accounts which will  be effective in the coming years and which have not  been early adopted by the Group. Taking into account the  activity carried out by the companies that form part of the   - 141 - annual report 2011 Group, the directors of the Company do not consider that  the application of these standards will have a significant  effect on the Groups financial statements.  a) Foreign currency translation Foreign currency transactions are translated to euro using  the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to  euro at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at that date.  Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are  recognized in the income statement as financial results. Cash flows from transactions in foreign currency  are translated into euro in the consolidated cash  flow statement at the exchange rate prevailing at the  transaction date. The effect of variations in exchange  rates on cash and cash equivalents expressed in foreign  currencies is presented separately in the consolidated  cash flow statement under Effect of exchange rate  fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents. b) Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost,  including any additional costs incurred until the asset  enters into operation, less accumulated depreciation and  any impairment losses or depreciation.  Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the  estimated useful lives of the assets.  The estimated useful lives are as follows: Asset description Useful life Buildings 25 to 50 years Leasehold improvements, machinery and  furniture 7 - 13 years Other property, plant and equipment 4 - 13 years The Group reassesses residual values, useful lives  and depreciation methods at the end of each financial  year. Modifications to initially established criteria are  recognized as changes in estimates.  After initial recognition of an asset, only costs that generate  future economic benefits and which can be classified as  probable and be reliably estimated are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as they are  incurred. c) Rights over leased property Rights over leased assets mainly comprise the cost of lease  transfer rights, access premiums or tenancy right waivers  paid to the former tenants of commercial premises. Rights over leased assets are recognized at cost of  acquisition. After initial recognition, they are stated at  cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment  losses and are amortised over the term of the lease  contract, except when, for legal reasons, the rights do  not lose value, in which case they are determined to  be intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and are  therefore systematically tested for impairment. d) Other intangible assets — Industrial property: Patents and similar rights  are stated at cost of acquisition or usufruct, or at the  cost of registering the items developed by the Group, and  are amortised on a straight-line basis over a maximum  period of ten years.  — Software is stated at cost and amortised on a  straight-line basis over a five-year period. — Industrial designs: These items are reflected  at their cost of production, which includes the cost of  samples, personnel costs and other directly or indirectly  attributable costs, and are amortised on a straight-line  basis over an estimated useful life of two years.  The Group reviews the residual value, useful lives and  means of amortisation of intangible assets at the end  of each accounting period. Modifications to initially  established criteria are recognized, where applicable, as  changes in estimates. e) Financial investments Financial investments which represent less than 20% of  share capital are stated at fair value. f) Investment property Investment properties are assets held to generate rental  income, capital appreciation or both, and are stated at  cost of acquisition less accumulated depreciation and  any impairment losses or depreciation. Depreciation is  calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of  the corresponding assets. Details of the market value of investment properties are  shown in note 13. g) Impairment The Group systematically tests for impairment of  consolidated assets which are not considered financial  assets, inventories and deferred tax assets in order to  determine whether the carrying amount exceeds the  recoverable value (impairment).  In order to do this, the Group  has developed a general, systematic procedure for carrying  out these impairment tests based on the monitoring of  certain events or circumstances such as the performance of  the business, operating decisions regarding the continuity of  a particular location, or other circumstances which indicate  that the value of an asset may not be recovered in full.  - 142 - shareholders - economic and financial report The recoverable amount of goodwill or intangible assets  with indefinite useful lives is estimated at the closing  date, and thereafter at least once per year. Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of assets is the higher of fair  value less selling costs and value in use. Value in use takes  into account expected future cash flows for the period in  which these assets are expected to generate revenues,  forecast variations in the amount or distribution of the  cash flows, the time value of money, the risk premium  attached to the risk of uncertainty attached to the asset,  and other factors which a market participant would  consider in valuing the cash flows from the asset. The discount rate applied is usually a pre-tax  measurement based on the risk-free rate for the 10- year bonds (or similar instruments, if no 10-year bonds  have been issued) issued by the governments of the  corresponding countries, adjusted by a risk premium  to reflect the increase in the risk of the investment per  country and the systematic risk of the Group. Recoverable amount is determined for each individual  asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows  that are largely independent of those from other assets  or groups of assets. For assets that do not generate  cash inflows individually, the recoverable amount is  determined for the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which  the asset belongs. Based on actual management of operations, the Group  has defined each of the commercial premises in which it  carries out its activities (stores) as basic cash-generating  units, although these basic units can be aggregated to  concept-country level, or even to all the companies located  in the same country. Group assets which are not clearly  assignable under this scheme (for example industrial or  logistical assets) are treated separately within the context  of this general policy according to their specific nature. Reversals of impairment Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not  reversed in subsequent years. For assets other than  goodwill, impairment losses are reversed if there has  been a change in the estimates used to determine the  recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that  an assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying  amount that would have been determined, net of  depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had  been recognized. The reversal of an impairment loss in a cash-generating  unit is distributed among its assets, except for goodwill,  which is distributed in accordance with its carrying  amount and taking into account the limitation set out in  the previous paragraph. Impairment losses are debited to depreciation and  amortisation in the consolidated income statement.  Reversals of impairment losses on assets other than  goodwill are credited to this account once internal or  external sources of information have been analyzed and  it can be concluded that the impairment indicators which  determined the recognition of value adjustments no  longer exist or have been partially mitigated. h) Trade and other receivables  Trade receivables are recognized at fair value. After  initial recognition, they are stated at amortised cost in  accordance with the effective interest rate method, less  any provision for impairment. Provision is made for impairment of trade receivables  when there is objective evidence that the Group will not  be able to collect the entire amount owed by the debtor in  accordance with the terms of the debt. This provision is  calculated as the difference between the carrying amount  and the present value of future estimated cash flows  discounted at the original interest rate and is recognized  in the income statement.  i) Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net  realizable value. Cost comprises all costs of acquisition, transformation  and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to  their present location and condition. Transformation costs comprise the costs directly related  to the units produced and a systematically calculated  portion of indirect, variable and fixed costs incurred  during the transformation process.  Cost is calculated on a FIFO basis and includes the  cost of materials consumed, labour and manufacturing  expenses. The cost of inventories is adjusted when cost exceeds net  realizable value. Net realizable value is considered as the  following: — Raw materials and other supplies: replacement  cost. However, materials are not written down below cost  if the finished products in which they will be incorporated  are expected to be sold at or above cost;  — Goods for resale: estimated selling price in the  normal course of business; — Work in progress: the estimated selling price  for the corresponding finished products, less estimated  costs of completion. j) Cash and cash equivalents  - 143 - annual report 2011 Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and  demand deposits in financial institutions. They also  include other short-term, highly liquid investments that  are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and  which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes  in value. Investments which mature in less than three  months from the acquisition date are also included.  In the statement of cash flows, bank overdrafts which are  repayable on demand and form an integral part of the  Groups cash management are included as a component  of cash and cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts are  recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as financial  liabilities from bank borrowings. The Group classifies cash flows relating to interest and  dividends paid and received as investing and financing  activities, respectively. k) Employee benefits Commitments acquired with group personnel to be  settled in the long term are estimated based on their  accrual through the application, where appropriate, of  actuarial assumptions. The Group has created a provision  to cover the actuarial liability of the estimated portion  accrued at 31 January 2012. Personnel expenses accrued during the year are based  on the best estimate of how far the conditions of payment  have been met and the period that has elapsed since the  plan started.  Personnel expenses accrued by the beneficiaries of the  plan referred to in note 27 to the consolidated annual  accounts are recognized with a credit to liability accounts  during the period in which incentives are accrued. l) Provisions Provisions are recognized in the balance sheet when: — the Group has a present legal or constructive  obligation as result of a past event; — it is probable that an outflow of economic  benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and — the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are based on the best information available at  the date of preparation of the annual accounts and are  revised at each balance sheet date. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources will be  required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.  The provision is reversed against the consolidated income  statement item where the corresponding expense was  recognized. m) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities, including trade and other payables,  are initially recognized at fair value less any transaction  costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the  financial liability. After initial recognition, the Groups  financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using  the effective interest method. n) Derivatives and hedging operations Financial instruments acquired to hedge forecast  transactions in foreign currencies are initially recognized  at fair value plus any transaction costs directly attributable  to acquiring the instrument. Foreign exchange rate hedges relating to forecast  transactions are treated as cash flow hedges, and  therefore any gains or losses derived from measuring  the instrument at fair value which correspond to the  effective portion of the hedge are recognized in income  and expenses recognized in equity. The ineffective portion  is taken to financial income or expense as appropriate.  Amounts recognized in equity are taken to income when  the transaction takes place with a debit or credit to the  account in which it was recognized. Profits or losses  recognized in equity are also reclassified to finance  income or expenses when the foreseen transaction is not  expected to proceed. o) Revenue recognition The sale of goods is recognized when the significant risks  and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred. Sales  to  franchises  are  recognized  when  the  aforementioned conditions are met and when revenue  can be reliably determined and collection is considered  probable. The Group sells certain assets with the right for the  buyers to return the goods. In these cases, the sale of the  goods is recognized when the above conditions are met  and it is possible to reliably estimate future returns based  on experience and other relevant factors. Estimated  returns are recognized against revenue and with a credit  to the provision for sales returns. The estimated cost of  returned goods is recognized as inventories, net of the  effect of any reduction in value. Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over  the term of the lease. Revenue from royalties is recognized using the accrual  principle based on the substance of the contracts,  providing collection is considered probable and the  amount can be reliably estimated. p) Leases Lease contracts in which the significant risks and rewards  inherent to ownership of the asset are substantially   - 144 - shareholders - economic and financial report transferred to third parties are classified as finance  leases, and are otherwise recorded as operating leases.  Assets acquired through a finance lease are recognized  as non-current assets at the lower of the present value of  the future lease payment and the fair value of the leased  asset, while the corresponding debt with the lessor is  recognized as a liability. Lease payments are apportioned  between the reduction of the outstanding liability and the  finance charge, which is recorded as a financial expense  during the year. In the case of operating leases, non-contingent or fixed  rent payments are charged to the income statement on a  straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Contingent  rent is recognized in the period in which payment is  probable, as are variable rent increases linked to the  consumer price index. Incentives received from shopping centre developers or  owners of commercial premises are recognized as non- current liabilities and booked as a reduction in rental  expense under Other operating expenses on a straight- line basis over the term of the respective lease contracts.  q) Finance income and expenses Finance income and expenses are recognized on an  accrual basis using the effective interest method.  Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive  payment is established. r) Income taxes The income tax expense for the year comprises current  tax and deferred tax. Income tax comprises current and  deferred tax and is recognized in the income statement  and included in the determination of net profit or loss for  the year, except to the extent that it relates to a transaction  which has been recognized in the same or different years,  in which case it is recognized in equity, or to a business  combination. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable  income for the year, using tax rates enacted or  substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any  adjustment to tax payable or recoverable in respect of  previous years. Deferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet  method, which provides for temporary differences  between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used  for tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities comprise  income tax amounts payable in the future on account  of taxable temporary differences while deferred tax  assets are amounts recoverable due to the existence of  deductible temporary differences, tax loss carryforwards  or deductions pending application. The Group recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities  derived from temporary differences, except those  relating to the initial recognition of an asset or liability  in a transaction which is not a business combination and  which did not affect either accounting or taxable profit  (losses), or in the case of deferred taxes, where temporary  differences are related to the initial recognition of goodwill.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also recognized  for temporary differences relating to investments in  subsidiaries, except when the parent company can control  their reversal and the temporary differences will probably  not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the  tax rates that are expected to apply to the years when the  asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax  rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantially  enacted by the balance sheet date and reflecting the tax  consequences that would follow from the manner in  which the Group expects to recover or settle the carrying  amount of its assets or liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it  is probable that future taxable profits will be available  against which the asset can be utilized. Deferred tax  assets, whether recognized or not, are reviewed at each  balance sheet date.  The Group only offsets current tax assets and liabilities if  it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized  amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to  realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on the  consolidated balance sheet under non-current assets or  liabilities, irrespective of the expected date of realization  or settlement. s) Current and non-current assets and liabilities The Group classifies assets and liabilities as current  and non-current. Assets and liabilities are classified as  current when they are expected to be realized or settled  within twelve months of the balance sheet date, and are  otherwise classified as non-current.  Assets and liabilities are not netted unless there are  specific requirements to the contrary or a standard or  interpretation so permits. t) Treasury shares Treasury shares acquired by the Group have been  presented separately at cost as a reduction in equity in  the consolidated balance sheet, and no gains or losses  have been recorded as a result of transactions carried out  with treasury shares. Costs incurred in treasury share transactions are  recorded as a reduction in equity, after consideration of  any tax effect.  - 145 - annual report 2011 6.33 Environment Costs incurred in environmental activities are recognized  under other operating expenses in the year in which they  are incurred. Non-current property, plant and equipment acquired  by the Group to minimize the environmental impact of  its activity and protect and improve the environment,  including the reduction and elimination of future  pollution from the Groups activities are recognized as  assets, applying the measurement, presentation and  disclosure criteria described in note 32.2-b.  - 146 - shareholders - economic and financial report Appendix I: Structure of the Inditex Group Company Effective %  ownership Location Consolidation  Method Year End Concept Activity Subsidiaries Industria de Diseo Textil, S.A.

ANNUAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT The corporate governance report is available at www. inditex.com and was published in the section on Price  Sensitive Information of the CNMV (Spanish National  Securities Market Commission) website on 21 March 2012.  - 166 - Annual  Corporate  Governance  Report  - 167 - annual report 2011 IIn this Annual Corporate Governance Report, the  Board of Directors of INDUSTRIA DE DISEO TEXTIL, S.A.  (INDITEX, S.A.), (hereinafter, Inditex or the Company  has included all the relevant information corresponding  to fiscal year 2011 which commenced on 1 February  2011 and closed on 31 January 2012, excepting those  cases in which other dates of reference are specifically  mentioned. In Spain, Act 26/2003 of 17 July (hereinafter,  the Transparency Act), which amended the [Spanish]  Stock Exchange Act and the Revised Text of the [Spanish]  Corporation Act with the purpose of reinforcing the  transparency of listed companies, developed the series  of reflections on the principles and practices that should  govern the corporate governance of listed companies  that were contained in the Report by the Olivencia  Commission and, subsequently, in the Report of the  Special Commission for the Promotion of Transparency  and Security in Financial Markets and Listed Companies  (hereinafter, the Aldama Report), giving regulatory  support to the conclusions and recommendations  contained therein as regards the promotion of  transparency. Finally, on 22 May 2006, the Board of  the Comisin Nacional del Mercado de Valores (Spanish  Stock Exchange Commission, hereinafter the CNMV),  resolved to approve as a single document addressing  the recommendations on corporate governance, the  Unified Code of Good Corporate Governance prepared  by the Special Work Group set up further to a resolution  of the Spanish Government with the goal of assisting  the CNMV with the harmonisation and update of the  recommendations included in the Olivencia and Aldama  Reports.  The contents and structure of this Report adjust to the  model laid down by Circular 4/2007 dated 27 December  of the CNMV, whereby the model of the annual corporate  governance report of listed companies is amended, in  order to adjust its contents to the recommendations  of the Unified Good Governance Code, and to the new  requirements set out in Act 2/2011, of 4 March, on  Sustainable Economy which adds on its fifth Additional  Provision a new chapter VI to Part IV of Act 24/1988, of  28 July, on the Securities Market which governs the  additional information to be provided on the model of  annual corporate governance report currently in force. This Annual Corporate Governance Report is subject  to publication as a relevant fact and is available on our  corporate web site: www.inditex.com. The rules governing the corporate governance of Inditex  are established in its Articles of Association, Board of  Directors Regulations and Regulations of the General  Meeting of Shareholders, in its Internal Regulations of  Conduct Regarding Transactions in Securities, the Code  of Conduct of the Inditex Group, the Internal Guidelines for  Responsible Practices of the Inditexs Group Personnel  and the Regulations of the Social Advisory Board, as it is  explained in more detail below: Articles of Association  These were approved by the General Meeting of  Shareholders in July 2000. The General Meeting held  in April 2001 introduced an amendment consisting of  a reduction in the number of shares required to attend  the General Meeting, while the one held in July 2003  resolved new amendments, mostly due to the new  duties of transparency, information and protection  of the shareholder, which were introduced by Law  44/2002, of 22 November, on Measures for the Reform  of the Financial System (hereinafter, the Financial  Law) and by the recommendations and conclusions  regarding corporate governance, and specifically those  included in the Aldama Report. Then, the AGM adopted  several amendments regarding the full adaptation to the  Transparency Law and the inclusion of recommendations  on  corporate  governance,  thoroughly  reviewed  throughout the Annual Corporate Governance Report for  fiscal year 2004, underscoring the following ones: (i) the  requirement to hold at least 50 shares in the Company  to be eligible to attend Annual General Meetings was  suppressed; (ii) the possibility for shareholders to grant  proxy and to issue votes by mail or electronic means  was included in the regulations of the Company; (iii)  some rules were laid down for those cases where a  shareholders proxy is in conflict of interest; (iv) the  composition of the Audit and Control Committee was  reformed, to be comprised of independent directors  exclusively; (v) a new article regarding the Nomination  and Remuneration Committee, that must also be entirely  comprised of independent directors, was introduced and  (vi) a new article on the web page of the Company was  introduced. Subsequent amendments were supported by  the necessary adjustment of the Articles of Association to  the amendments introduced by Act 3/2009, of 3 April, on  structural amendments of companies and by the intent  of extending the maximum number of members sitting  on the Supervision and Control Committees of the Board  of Directors (the Audit and Control Committee and the  Nomination and Remuneration Committee) to better  meet the requirements of the Company and to mirror  the composition of the Board of Directors, further to  the resolution passed by the AGM held on 13 July 2010  regarding the appointment of two new independent  directors. Finally, the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders  held on 19 July 2011 resolved the adjustment of the  Articles of Association to the new revised text of the  Act on Capital Companies, approved by Real Decreto  Legislativo 1/2010 of 2 July. The amendment consisted  of replacing any references to the Spanish Corporation  Act or any other express reference to any given statute,  with a generic reference to the Law or the applicable  regulations, for the purposes of preventing that any  successive regulatory change might entail the relevant  amendment to the Articles of Association. Likewise,   - 168 - shareholders - annual corporate governance report certain amendments were introduced regarding the form  and contents of the notice calling the Annual General  Meeting of Shareholders, in order to adjust the duties of  the Audit and Control Committee to the new wording of  18th Additional provision of the Act on Securities Market  and the contents of the web page regarding information  to the shareholders. Board of Directors Regulations These were approved by the Board of Directors in July  2000. Their purpose is to determine the principles of  operation of the Board, the basic rules for its organisation  and operation and the rules governing the conduct of its  members and they include, among other matters, rules  relating to the appointment and removal of directors,  their rights and duties and the relations of the Board with  the shareholders, with the markets and with the external  auditors, all this with the aim of achieving the highest  possible degree of efficiency. The Board of Directors  Regulations were already subject to a major reform, as  resolved by the administration body on 20 March 2003, in  order to adapt them to the new obligations introduced by  the Financial Law, and to the recommendations contained  in the Aldama Report. Said reform, however, and for time  reasons, did not take into account all the mandates of  the Transparency Law, which was published after same  resolution.

PROCESS  USED  TO  ESTABLISH  THE  REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF  DIRECTORS AND THE CLAUSES IN THE ARTICLES OF  ASSOCIATION RELATING THERETO  The General Meeting of Shareholders is the body  responsible for approving the system and the amount of  the remuneration of the directors. Article 33 of the Articles of Association currently in force  provides the following: 1.- The remuneration of the directors shall consist  of a fixed annual remuneration for each director the  amount of which shall be decided by the General Meeting  of Shareholders for each fiscal year or be valid for those  fiscal years that the Meeting establishes. In the same  manner, the General Meeting of Shareholders may assign  per diems for attendance of the meetings of the Board of  Directors or of its Delegate or Consultative Committees  and set the amount thereof.  2.- Additionally, systems of remuneration may  be established that are referenced to the market value  of the shares or which entail the giving of shares or  option rights over shares, destined for the directors. The  application of said systems of remuneration must be  agreed by the General Meeting of Shareholders, which  shall determine the value of the shares that it takes as a  reference, the number of shares to be given, the exercise  price of the option rights, the period of duration of this  remuneration system and the other conditions that it  considers appropriate. Likewise, and after having met the requirements  laid down by the Law, similar remuneration systems may  be established for the personnel, whether management  personnel or not, of the Company and of the companies in  its Group. 3.- The remuneration foreseen in this article  shall be compatible with and independent of the  salaries, remunerations, indemnifications, pensions or  compensations of any kind, generally or extraordinarily  established for those members of the Board of Directors  who perform executive duties, whatever their relationship  with the Company, whether a labour (common or special  senior management relationship), mercantile or service  relationship, relationships that shall be compatible with  the status of member of the Board of Directors.  4.- The Company may take out public liability  insurance for its Directors.

Likewise, the Board shall ensure that the  remuneration of the non-executive directors is such that  it offers incentives to dedication by the directors, while not  creating an obstacle as regards their independence.  3.-  A report on the remuneration policy shall  be approved every year by the Board, on the proposal   - 182 - shareholders - annual corporate governance report of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and  it shall cover at least the issues of fixed and variable  remuneration, as well as the remaining relevant terms  of the employment agreements of those who discharge  senior management duties as executive directors The  report shall focus on the remuneration policy approved by  the Board for the year in course, and, where appropriate,  on the one expected for years to come, especially pointing  out the most significant changes of said policy as regards  the one for the previous year. 4.- The report referred in item 3 above will be published  on the corporate web page and shall be made available to  all shareholders upon holding the Annual General Meeting,  but any issue which might entail the disclosure of sensitive  business information shall be eliminated thereof. The General Meeting held on 19 July 2011 resolved to  amend in part the remuneration of the directors set by the  AGM held on 18 July 2006 and 15 July 2008, with indefinite  validity until a later General Meeting should resolve  otherwise, and effective as of 1 February 2011.

AUTHORISED BODIES, PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW AND  CRITERIA TO BE USED IN EACH OF THE PROCEDURES The system for the selection, appointment and re- election of members of the Board of Directors of  Inditex constitutes a formal and transparent procedure,  expressly regulated in the Articles of Association and  the Board of Directors Regulations. The directors shall be appointed by the General Meeting,  and shall hold their office during the period established  to this purpose by the Articles of Association, which at  present is of five years.  The directors may be re-elected indefinitely, for periods  of equal or less duration, by the General Meeting,  which may likewise agree the removal of any of these at   any time. The Board of Directors itself may provisionally cover  the vacancies that arise on said Board, designating  from among the shareholders the persons who will  have to fill the vacancies until the first General Meeting  thereafter. The proposals for the nomination of directors that  the Board of Directors submits to be considered by  the General Meeting, and the nomination decisions  that said body adopts in virtue of those powers to co- opt that are legally attributed to it, must be preceded  by the relevant report from the Nomination and  Remuneration Committee, and regarding independent  directors, by the relevant proposal of the Nomination  and Remuneration Committee. Where the Board departs from the Nomination and  Remuneration Committees suggestions, it must state  the reasons for its actions and place its reasons on   the record. The Board of Directors and the Nomination and  Remuneration Committee, within the scope of their  competences, shall endeavour for the choice of  candidates to fall on persons of well-known ability,  competence and experience, and must maximize their  rigour in relation to those persons called to cover the  positions of independent directors. The Board of Directors may not propose or appoint  to fill an independent directors position any persons  who hold the office of director simultaneously in more  than four listed companies other than the Company. In  case the vacancy which needs to be filled in is that of  an independent director, the Board may not propose or  appoint any persons who do not satisfy the criteria of  independence established in section 1(c) of Article 7 of  the Board of Directors Regulations. The proposals for re-election of directors that the Board  of Directors shall submit to the General Meeting will  have to be subject to a formal process of preparation,  which shall include, necessarily, a report issued by the  Nomination and Remuneration Committee in which  the quality of work and the dedication to office of the  proposed directors during their previous mandate shall  be assessed, and regarding independent directors, the  relevant proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee. In this respect, the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee  has,  amongst  others,  the  following  responsibilities: a) To prepare and check the criteria that must be  followed for the composition of the Board of Directors in  addition to selecting the candidates; b) To advise on the proposals for nominations of  directors, and regarding independent directors, to make  such proposals so that they are approved by the Board  of Directors prior to their nomination by the General  Meeting of Shareholders or, where appropriate, by the  Board of Directors by the co-optation procedure;  - 184 - shareholders - annual corporate governance report c) To advise on the nomination of the internal  offices of (Chairman, Deputy Chairman or Chairmen,  CEO, Secretary and Deputy Secretary) of the Board of  Directors; d) To propose to the Board the members that  must form part of each of the Committees; Requests for information addressed to the Nomination  and Remuneration Committee shall be made by the  Board of Directors or its Chairman. Likewise, the  Committee must consider the suggestions presented  by the Chairman, the members of the Board, the  management or the shareholders of the Company. Additionally, the Board of Directors shall explain to  the Annual General Meeting in charge of appointing or  ratifying the appointment of directors the nature thereof,  and said nature shall be confirmed or, where appropriate,  reviewed in the Annual Corporate Governance Report,  after verification by the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee. As regards the assessment and removal of directors, the  Nomination and Remuneration Committee is expressly  entrusted with the following functions: a) To advise on the proposal, where appropriate, of  the early dismissal of an independent director. b) To annually advise the Board on the evaluation  of the performance of the chief executive of the Company. B.1.20. CASES UNDER WHICH THE RESIGNATION OF  DIRECTORS IS MANDATORY The Board of Directors Regulations, in Article 24,  establishes a provision with respect to the obligation  of the directors to resign in cases that could negatively  affect the working of the Board or the credit and  reputation of Inditex. The directors must place their office at the disposal of  the Board of Directors and, if this latter should consider  it advisable, tender their resignation in the following  cases: a) When they reach a certain age, under the terms  detailed in section B.1.25. b) When they cease to hold the executive positions  to which their appointment as director was associated. c) When they are involved in any of the cases  of incompatibility or prohibition foreseen in the Law,  the Articles of Association or in the Board of Directors  Regulations. In particular, the independent directors shall  place their office at the disposal of the Board of Directors  and shall tender, when appropriate, their resignation  in the event that they fall under any of the cases of  incompatibility or prohibitions provided by Article 7.1. (c)  of those Regulations or in the event that they suddenly  come to hold the post of director in more than four listed  companies other than the Company. d) When they are seriously admonished by the  Audit and Control Committee for having breached their  duties as directors. e) When their remaining on the Board might have  an impact on the reputation or name of the Company  or otherwise jeopardise the interest of the Company or  when the reasons for their appointment cease to exist. Likewise, proprietary directors must resign when the  shareholders they represent dispose of their ownership  interest in its entirety or reduce it up to a limit which  requires the reduction of the number of proprietary  directors.

B.1.22  REQUIREMENT OF ENHANCED MAJORITIES,  OTHER THAN THE LEGAL MAJORITIES, FOR ANY  TYPE OF DECISION. RESOLUTIONS ON THE BOARD  OF DIRECTORS. MINIMUM QUORUM OF ATTENDANCE  AND THE TYPE OF MAJORITIES REQUIRED TO PASS  THE RESOLUTIONS Article 28 of the Articles of Association of the Company  provides: 1.- The Board shall meet whenever required by the  interests of the Company. Meetings shall be convened by the  Chairman or acting Chairman, on his own initiative or at the  request of at least one-third of its members. 2.- Board meetings shall be validly held when  attended either in person or by proxy by half plus one of the  members in office. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Board shall be  understood to be validly constituted without the need for  notice if all its members are present in person or by proxy  and they unanimously agree to the holding of a meeting.  The Board may also pass resolutions in writing without  needing to hold a meeting, in accordance with the  provisions of the applicable laws and regulations Likewise,  the meetings of the Board shall be held via telephone  multiconference, videoconference or via any other similar  system that allows one or several directors to attend the  meeting through such system. To this end, the notice of the  meeting of the Board of Directors shall state the location  where the meeting is physically to be held, to which the  Secretary of the Board must go. It shall also state that it is  possible to attend said meeting via telephone conference  call, videoconference or via an equivalent system, and it  must indicate and have available the appropriate technical  devices required for this purpose, in order to permit direct  and simultaneous communication among the members  attending the meeting. The Secretary of the Board of  Directors shall include in the minutes of the meetings of  the Board of Directors held by such means, in addition to  the directors physically attending or, where appropriate,  represented by another director, those directors attending  the meeting via telephone multiconference system,  videoconference or via a similar system. 3.- Any director can appoint in writing another  director as proxy, each meeting requiring a special proxy,  notifying the Chairman of the same in writing. 4.- For resolutions to be passed, an absolute majority  of votes in favour by the directors attending the meeting shall  be required. In the case of an equality of votes, the Chairman  shall have a casting vote. The foregoing is understood  without prejudice to the provisions of Article 30.2 of these  Articles of Association.  5.- The Boards debates and resolutions shall be  entered in a Minutes Book, each one of which shall be  signed by the Chairman and the Secretary or by those who  acted for them at the meeting to which the minutes refer.  Copies and certificates of the Minutes shall be authorized  and issued by the Secretary of the Board with the approval  of the Chairman or by those who substituted them. 6.- The Board shall have to decide which of its  members shall make effective its own resolutions as well as  those the General Meeting of Shareholders, when the latter  has not expressed who shall execute them. Failing such a  decision by the Board, the making effective of resolutions  shall be the duty of the Chairman, or the acting Chairman at  that time, according to the certification of the Secretary of  the Board. 7.- The Secretary and, where appropriate, the Deputy  Secretary, even when they are not directors, shall be  empowered to convert the Companys resolutions into public  documents. The reference in Article 28.4 of the Articles of Association  to Article 30.2 constitutes the only case, in addition to  that provided in Article 3.4 of the Board of Directors  Regulations, of enhanced majority for the passing of  resolutions by the Board of Directors. The aforementioned Article 30.2 of the Articles of  Association provides that it shall be necessary that two- thirds of the members of the Board vote in favour in  order to permanently delegate any power of the Board  of Directors to the Executive Committee or to the CEO, if  such post has been appointed, and for the appointment of  the directors who have to fill such positions. However, this  enhanced majority is required pursuant to the provisions  of Article 249.3 of the Act on Capital Companies (former  Article 141.2 of the Spanish Corporation Act), and  therefore it does not constitute a higher quorum than the  one statutorily required. As for Article 3.4 of the Board of Directors Regulations, it  requires the resolution to be passed by a majority of two- thirds of the directors present for the modification of said   - 186 - shareholders - annual corporate governance report Regulations, which actually means an enhanced majority  not statutorily required For its part, Article 17 of the Board of Directors  Regulations provides: 1.

Notice of ordinary meetings shall be carried  out by letter, fax, telegram or electronic mail, and shall  be authorized by the signature of the Chairman or that  of the Secretary or the Deputy Secretary by order of the  Chairman. The notice shall be issued at least three days  in advance. The notice of the meeting shall always include the  agenda of the meeting and shall be accompanied by the duly  summarised and prepared relevant information. 3. The Chairman of the Board of Directors may  call extraordinary meetings of the Board when in his  opinion the circumstances so justify it, without the period  of advance notice and the other requirements indicated in  the previous section applying in such cases. Furthermore,  the Board shall be considered validly constituted without  the need for notice if, all its members being present or  represented, these unanimously agree to the meeting  taking place.  4. The Board may equally pass resolutions in writing  without the need for a meeting, in accordance with the  provisions of the Spanish Corporation Law. Furthermore,  the Board may hold a meeting via videoconference or  conference call, in order that one or more directors may  attend the meeting through the aforementioned system.  For this purpose, the notice for the meeting of the Board  shall state not only where the meeting is physically to be  held, where the Secretary of the Board must go to, but  also the possibility that the meeting may be attended via  conference call, videoconference or equivalent system,  and it must indicate and have available the appropriate  technical devices required for this purpose, which in any  case must permit direct and simultaneous communication  among the members attending the meeting. The Secretary  of the Board shall record in the minutes of the meetings  held by these means not only the members of the Board  physically present or, where appropriate, represented  by another director, but also the members attending the  meeting via multiconference call, videoconference or  similar system. 5. The Board shall draw up an annual calendar of its  ordinary meetings. B.1.23. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT  FROM THOSE RELATING TO THE DIRECTORS IN ORDER  TO BE APPOINTED CHAIRMAN there are no specific requirements, different from  those relating to the directors, in order to be appointed  Chairman.  B.1.24. CASTING VOTE OF THE CHAIRMAN  The Chairman of the Board of Directors has a casting  vote in the event of equality of votes between the directors  attending the meeting. This is understood without  prejudice to the provisions of Article 30.2 of the Articles of  Association and of Article 3.4 of the Board of Directors  Regulations, referred to in section B.1.22 above. B.1.25. AGE LIMITS FOR THE DIRECTORS Article 24.2 of the Board of Directors Regulations states  that the directors must place their office at the disposal  of the Board of Directors and, if this should deem it  appropriate, tender the relevant resignation:  a) When they reach the age of 68. However, the  directors who hold the office of Chief Executive Officer  or Managing Director shall place their office at the  disposal of the Board of Directors upon reaching the age  of 65, being able to continue as ordinary members of the  Board of Directors until the aforementioned age of 68. As  an exception, the foregoing rules shall not apply in the  case of the founding Chairman of the Company, Amancio  Ortega Gaona.  B.1.26.  LIMITED  TERM  OF  OFFICE  FOR  THE  INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS Neither the Articles of Association nor the Board of  Directors Regulations establish a limited term of office  for the independent directors.   B.1.27.PROCEDURES  ESTABLISHED  BY  THE  NOMINATION  AND  REMUNERATION  COMMITTEE  WHICH ENSURE THAT RECRUITMENT PROCESSES  ARE FREE FROM  ANY IMPLIED BIAS HINDERING  THE SELECTION OF FEMALE DIRECTORS AND WHICH  ALLOW FOR THE FREE SEARCH FOR WOMEN Pursuant to the provisions of Article 15.2 (k) of the Board  of Directors Regulations, the Committee shall ensure  when filling up any new vacancies and when appointing  new Directors that the recruitment process does conform  to the prohibition of any manner of discrimination.   - 187 - annual report 2011 B.1.28.

In line with this provision, Article 19.1 of the Board of  Directors Regulations states that the Board meeting will  be validly held when it is attended by at least half plus  one of its members (or the whole number of directors  immediately above half, should the Board be comprised  of an odd number), whether in person or by proxy, stating  further that the directors shall do their best to attend the  Board meetings and, when they cannot do so in person,  they shall grant a proxy to another member of the Board  giving instructions as to its use and communicating the  same to the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

B.1.32. MECHANISMS ESTABLISHED BY THE BOARD  OF DIRECTORS TO PREVENT THE INDIVIDUAL AND  CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS BEING PRESENTED TO  THE GENERAL MEETING WITH QUALIFICATIONS IN THE  AUDITORS REPORT The Audit and Control Committee, made up entirely of  independent, non-executive directors, has meetings,  without the presence of the management of the  Company, with the auditors of the individual and  consolidated annual accounts in order to review the  Companys annual accounts and certain periodic  financial information that the Board must provide to  the markets and their supervisory Boards, overseeing  compliance with the legal requirements and correct  application of generally accepted accounting principles  in the drawing up thereof. In such meetings, any  disagreement or difference of opinion existing between  the management of the Company and the external  auditors is put forward, so that the Board of Directors  can take the necessary steps so that the audit reports  are issued without qualifications. Furthermore, previously to the drafting of the annual or  quarterly accounting statements, the management of the  Company also holds a meeting with the Audit and Control  Committee and is subjected by the latter to suitable  questions as to the application of accounting principles,  estimations made in the preparations of the financial  statements, etc., matters which are subject to discussion  with the external auditors. In this respect, Article 43.4 of the Board of Directors  Regulations provides that: The Board of Directors shall endeavour to definitively  prepare the accounts in such a manner that they do  not give rise to qualifications on the part of the auditor.  Nonetheless, when the Board considers that it must  maintain its opinion, it shall publicly explain the content  and scope of the discrepancy. B.1.33.

B.1.35.MECHANISMS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPANY  TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE AUDITOR,  THE FINANCIAL ANALYSTS, INVESTMENT BANKS AND  CREDIT RATING AGENCIES   Article 43 of the Board of Directors Regulations,  under the heading Relations with the auditors states in  paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 as follows: 1. The relations of the Board with the external  auditors of the Company shall be channelled through the  Audit and Control Committee. 2. The Audit and Control Committee shall abstain  from proposing to the Board of Directors, and the latter  shall abstain from putting forward to the General Meeting  of Shareholders, the appointment as auditor of the  Company of any auditing firm which would be incompatible  in accordance with auditing legislation as well as those  audit firms where the fees that the Company expects to  pay them for all services in all areas are greater than five  percent of the audit firms total revenues during the last  fiscal year.  3. The Board of Directors shall publicly disclose the  whole of the fees that have been paid by the Company to the  audit firm for services other than auditing.   The mechanisms established to preserve the  independence of the external auditor are the following: 	 It	 is	 incumbent	 on	 the	 Audit	 and	 Control	 Committee, made up exclusively of independent  directors, to propose to the Board of Directors, in order  to be studied by the General Meeting of Shareholders,  the appointment of the auditors. Furthermore, to  propose to the Board of Directors the terms of their  contracts, the scope of their professional mandate and,  where appropriate, the rescission or non—renewal of  their appointment; 	 Among	 the	 functions	 of	 the	 aforementioned	 Committee is also that of liaising with the external  auditors in order to receive information on those  matters that could jeopardise their independence and  on any other matter related to the carrying out of the  accounts auditing process, as well as on those other  communications envisaged by auditing legislation and  auditing standards. 	 The	Committee	shall	issue	a	report	every	year,	 prior to the issue of the auditors report, expressing an  opinion on the independence of external auditors, and  addressing in all events the rendering by the external  auditor of any manner of additional services other than  those covered in the audit agreement. 	 Likewise,	 the	 Audit	 and	 Control	 Committee	 monitors the conditions and the enforcement of the  contracts entered into with the external auditors of the  Company to carry out assignments or tasks other than  those covered by the audit contract. 	 The	external	auditors	consult	periodically	with	 said Committee, as is explained in point B.1.32 above  without the management of the Company being present,  in order to review the annual accounts of the Company  that the Board of Directors must provide to the markets  and its supervisory boards.   	 The	Company	reports	in	its	consolidated	annual	 report on those fees paid to its external auditors for  each item that is other than the auditing of the financial  statements. As regards the mechanisms established to guarantee  the independence of the financial analysts, the  Company releases information to the market following  the principles included in the Internal Regulations of  Conduct, especially relating to the obligation that the  information must be accurate, clear, quantified and  complete, avoiding subjective assessments that lead or  could lead to confusion or deceit. The Company has not contracted services from Investment  Banks or Credit Rating Agencies during fiscal year 2011.

The decision to engage external experts must be  notified to the Company Chairman and can be open to veto  by the Board of Directors if it proves that: a) it is not necessary for the proper performance of  the duties entrusted to the non-executive directors; or b) the cost is not reasonable in view of the  importance of the problem and of the assets and income  of the Company; or c) the technical assistance obtained may be  adequately  dispensed  by  in-house  experts  and  technicians, d) the confidentiality of the information to be  provided to the expert may be jeopardised.

Companies of the Group listed in Spain Only one Company of the Group is listed in Spain. D. Systems for control of risks D.1. Risk policy of the Company and/ or of its Group. Risks covered by the  system. Justification for the adjusting of  those systems to fit the profile of each  type of risk Risks management in the Inditex Group is a process  driven by the Board of Directors and the Senior  Management, incumbent on each and every single  member of the Organisation, which aims at providing  a reasonable safety in the achievement of the targets  established by the Group, ensuring the shareholders,  other stakeholders and the market in general, an  appropriate level of guarantee. In this context, the risks management in the Group  starts with the identification and assessment of those  factors that may affect negatively the fulfilment of the  business objectives, and this translates into a risks  map including the main risks  grouped in different  categories, together with an assessment thereof in  accordance with their potential impact, the likelihood  of their occurring and the level of preparation of the  Group to face up to them. The risk map is subject  to review regularly in order to keep it updated by  including the amendments regarding the evolution of  the Group and of the environment where it operates.  Risks management process also covers the taking  of a certain answer versus such factors, and the  organisation of the required controls measures for  such answer to be effective.  Below are the main corporate areas that specialise in  the risks management process in different fields: - Risks Management - Code Compliance Office - Financial Management - Planning and Management Control - Corporate Social Responsibility - Occupational Hazards - Environment - IT Safety  - 199 - annual report 2011 Additionally, certain specific Committees have been set in  respect of the follow-up of the major risks: - Expansion Committee - Logistics Committee - Committee of Ethics - Business Monitoring Committee Among the policies developed and implemented by the  above-mentioned areas regarding the management of  the different risks, the following should be pointed out: - Investments Policy - Payment Management Policy - Foreign Exchange Risk Management Policy - Powers of Attorney Policy - Code of Conduct for external Manufacturers     and Workshops - Health and  Safety of the Product Policy - Occupational Hazards Policy - Environmental Risk Management Policy - IT Safety Policy The process of risks management is subject to the  review of the Board of Directors, through the Audit and  Control Committee, to which Internal Audit reports  directly regarding internal control review and through  the Social Board regarding risks associated with  corporate social responsibility.  Additionally, these risks are considered upon preparing  the Business Plan, etc., as part of the ERM system of  the Group. 1. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT These are risks stemming from external factors,  connected with the activity of the Group. This category encompasses the risks regarding the  difficulty in adjusting to the environment or market  in which the Company operates, whether as regards  procurement processes or distribution and sale of goods  processes. This is inherent in the fashion retail business  and consists in the eventual incapacity of the Group to  follow and offer a response to the evolutions of its target  market or to adjust to the new situations in procurement  countries. With this respect, demographic and social  and economic changes in procurement or distribution  countries, the new ways of communication that arise,  and changes in consumption habits, or the consumption  fall in certain markets are, inter alia, factors which  may have an impact on the effective achievement of the  business goals of the Group. In order to reduce the exposure to risk in this area, the Group  carries out a feasibility research for each new market,  business line or store, considering pessimistic scenarios,  and subsequently monitors whether the expected figures  are met or not. Moreover, the business model of the  Group is not only based upon the management of new  openings, but also on improvements in the efficiency  and effectiveness of the markets, business lines and  stores already existing, so that the growth achieved via  expansion and diversification, be complemented by the  organic growth of the current business. In line with the foregoing, the expansion policy, the  multi-brand format of the Group and the use of new  technologies as an option for communicating and  selling to our customers, represent a way to diversify  this risk, which downplays the global exposure to this  risk of the market.  2. REGULATIONS Those are risks regarding the enforcement of the various  laws and regulations to which the Group is exposed in  the different countries where it is present. In order to provide a better management of the risks  included in this category, they have been classified in  accordance with their nature, in: risks regarding the  trade and consumption, industrial and intellectual  property, tax, custom, labour regulations and others.  In order to reduce the exposure to risk in this area and  secure the appropriate enforcement of the prevailing  local legislation in force, the corporate Legal, Tax,  Industrial Property and Human Resources Departments  work in co-ordination with the various people responsible  for each country or geographic zone and with the legal  external advisors in same. In Section D.4 hereunder,  the legislation that usually affects the Group in those  countries where it operates, is identified. The Internal Audit Department conducts regulatory  compliance audits on a regular basis with teams of  independent professionals specialising in certain  regulations which apply to business. Additionally,  the  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  Department regularly carries out social audits together  with teams of independent professionals, with a great  command of the language as well as of the local labour  and environmental legislation, to ensure the appropriate  respect for both the labour requirements covered by  the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Treaties and   - 200 - shareholders - annual corporate governance report for the Human Rights covered in the major Treaties that  govern this subject. 3. REPUTATION Those are the risks which have a direct impact on the way  the Group is perceived by its stakeholders (customers,  employees, shareholders and suppliers) and by the  society in general. These risks arise out of a potential improper management  of the aspects regarding the social responsibility and  sustainability, the responsibility on account of the  composition of products, as well as of the corporate  image of the Group. The Group has developed a Social Audit Programme,  based on the external and independent verification of the  degree of implantation and compliance with the Code of  Conduct for External Workshops and Manufacturers  in order to minimize the potential risks of harming the  image due to improper behaviours by third parties. Said  programme specifies the review procedures which  secure the gathering of information and evidences  on the minimum working conditions that all external  manufacturers and workshops must comply with.  Additional information on this Programme is provided in  the CSR with suppliers section of the Annual Report. In such sizable and visible organisations as those of the  Group, some conflicts could arise out of an inappropriate  relationship with third parties alien to the operative of  the Group (CNVM, communication media, Investors,  public authorities, etc.) The Group, through its Division of Communication and  Institutional Relations, responsible for the centralised  management of the communications with third parties,  sets out the procedures and protocols required to  minimize this risk. Likewise, given their relevance, the  General Counsel s Office and the Capital Markets  Department are charged with managing specifically the  relationship with the CNMV and the latter is also charged  with dealing with the investors.  Moreover, the large experience gained by the Group,  given its long international career, allows it to minimize  the risk attached to the difficulty in adapting its products  and operative to the different social and cultural realities,  uses and special features of specific markets, by setting  up the right policies which allow it to identify and as  the case may be, implement the required measures.  Additionally, the Group controls and verifies the level  of compliance with its health and safety of the products  standards (Safe to Wear and Clear to Wear), as part  of its production process. 4. HUMAN RESOURCES The main risks in the human resources area are those  arising out of the difficulty in properly identifying and  managing talent, which could lead to an inappropriate  positioning, qualifications and flexibility of the human  resources, an inappropriate labour environment, high  turnover or a potential dependence on key personnel. To minimize said risk, the Human Resources  Department  carries  out  continuous  recruitment  and hiring processes of new personnel. It has also  developed a regular training programme for its staff  and has implemented specific systems: - to combine quality in the performance of their  duties by the employees and the satisfaction they may  obtain at their workplace;  - to facilitate the exchange of jobs among those  employees wishing to broad their experience in the  different areas of the Organisation. On the other hand, the work system implemented  within the Organisation favours the transfer of  knowledge between the relevant employees in the  different areas, thus minimizing the risk linked  to depending excessively on the knowledge of key  personnel. Additionally, the use of career development,  training and compensation policies seek to retain key  employees.  To ensure the appropriate labour environment, the  Human Resources Department is governed by a series  of acting rules which are thoroughly reviewed in the  Social and Environmental Performance Report. On the other hand, a growing demand has arisen  lately within the labour market, linked to the social  responsibility of companies, which has become a key  factor upon selecting a Company for the job of choice.  Therefore, such issues as equal opportunities or labour  and work-family balance are inter alia, factors that the  Company takes into account, with policies designed for  such purposes. With this respect, the Inditex Group has implemented  the Equal Opportunities Plan, with measures that seek  to meet different goals, such as, inter alia: fostering  the commitment and effective implementation of the  equal opportunities principle between female and  male employees, contributing to reduce inequality and  imbalance, preventing labour discrimination, fostering  the corporate commitment towards a better life quality,  ensuring a healthy work environment and providing  actions to promote family and work balance.  - 201 - annual report 2011 5. OPERATIONS The main operational risks the Group has to face up  to arise out of a potential difficulty in recognising  and taking in the ongoing changes in fashion trends,  manufacturing, supplying and putting on the market  new models meeting customers expectation.  The Group reduces the exposure to this risk through a  manufacturing and procurement system that ensures  a reasonable flexibility to answer to the unforeseen  changes in the demand by our customers. Stores  are permanently in touch with the designer team,  through the Product Management Department, and  this allows perceiving the changes of taste of the  customers. Meanwhile, the vertical integration of the  transactions allows cutting the manufacturing and  delivery terms as well as to reduce the stock volume,  while the reaction capacity that allows to introduce  new products throughout the season, is kept. Given the relevance that an efficient logistics  management has on the appearance of such risks, the  Group conducts a review of all the factors which may  have a negative impact on the target of achieving the  maximum efficiency of the logistics management, to  actively monitor such factors under the supervision  of the Logistics Committee. The risk arising out of the interruption of the  transaction is linked with the likely occurrence of  extraordinary events beyond the control of the Group  (natural disasters, fires, strikes of haulers or suppliers,  discontinuance in the supply of power or fuel, etc.,) that  might affect significantly the normal operative. Given the operative of the Group, the main risks  included in this category are to be found at the  logistics centres and in external operators charged  with transporting the goods. The distribution of  apparel, footwear, accessories and home ware for  all the formats is based upon 12 logistics centres  spread throughout the territory of Spain. The use  of such logistics centres is optimized on account of  the size of each format: thus, Zara currently has four  main centres, which favours the implementation of  contingency plans in case of any potential accidents  or stoppage of the distribution activities. Additionally, the Group takes active measures to  reduce risk exposure, by keeping high levels of safety  and protection in all its distribution centres, together  with insurance policies covering both the potential  property damage incurred by the facilities and stock,  as well as any loss of profit which might arise out of  any loss.  In order to ensure the growth of the Group and enhance  the flexibility of its business model, the Logistics  Expansion Plan assesses the need and envisages,  where appropriate, investing in new distribution  centres or in the extension of the existing ones, so as  to minimize the risk linked to the logistics planning  and sizing. Additionally, investments are carried out  towards the improvement and automation within the  existing centres so as to increase their capacity and  efficiency.  To minimize the risks attached to the quality of finished  product, the Group resorts to different monitoring  systems based upon defined standards (Safe to  Wear and Clear to Wear) whose implementation is  mandatory within the production line, for all finished  products, footwear and accessories.  To reduce exposure to the risk arising out of an  improper customer satisfaction and service, the Group  applies standard store service procedures, training  and monitoring programmes for store managers and  assistants, and communication channels available  for customers in order to ensure the quality of the  sale and post sale service. Likewise, as a result  of the introduction of a new sale channel through  the online sale, certain mechanisms to follow-up  the degree of satisfaction of customers regarding  their online purchase have been set up. With this  respect, Marketing and Internet Departments of the  two formats which currently offer online sale have  prioritized the design of their websites, taking into  account such premises, while, at the same time,  making a large team of professionals available  to support the queries, concerns or requests of  the customers regarding their online purchase  experience. The Group reduces the risk linked to  the real estate management, regarding the search  and selection of business premises, through the  monitoring of local markets where it operates and  through the evaluation and supervision of new  openings by the Expansion Committee.    6. FINANCIAL The activities of the Group are subject to various  financial risks. Included in this category are risks  regarding the improper management of exchange  rates, cash management and sundry, such as credit or  interest rates risks.   The Group operates globally and as a result of  using currencies other than the euro in its business  transactions, in recognised assets and liabilities  and net investment in ventures outside the European  Monetary Union, the Group faces an exchange rate risk  which must be covered in a sufficient and systematic   - 202 - shareholders - annual corporate governance report manner by seeking to minimize the economic losses  and the volatility of financial statements. To achieve this, the Group companies are governed by  the corporate Exchange Rate Risk Management Policy.  The Group manages each currencys net position by  using external forward foreign currency contracts  or other financial instruments which minimize the  exposure of the Group to such risk. Thus, the purchase  of goods and stock takes place in part through orders  placed to foreign suppliers in US dollars. Pursuant to  the current Exchange Rate Risk Management Policy, in  force, the Group deals in derivatives, mainly in forward  contracts, to cover the variations of the cash flow linked  to the exchange rate.  The Group has various investments in foreign  businesses, the net assets of which are exposed to  exchange rate risk. The foreign exchange risk over  the net assets of transactions abroad is managed  pursuant to the guidelines and policies set out by the  Management of the Group.   The Group is not exposed to significant concentrations  of credit risk, as policies are in place to cover sales to  franchises and retail sales comprise the vast majority  of revenue. Collections are primarily made in cash or  through credit card payments. Likewise, the Group  also limits its exposure to credit risk by investing  solely in products that have high liquidity and credit  ratings.  The Group is not exposed to significant liquidity and  interest rate risk, as it maintains sufficient cash and cash  equivalents to meet the outflows of normal operations.  On the other hand, the cash created is subject to the  counterparty risk which is managed pursuant to the  corporate Investment Policy which seeks to ensure the  safety and integrity of the capital invested, optimising  the profitability and ensuring the required cash to face  up to the operative business needs.  In case of specific needs for funding, whether in Euros  or in other currencies, the Group may resort to loan  agreements, or any other financial instrument. Interest rate fluctuations affect the fair value of  assets and liabilities which accrue a fixed rate of  interest, as well as future cash flows from assets  and liabilities indexed to a variable interest rate. The  Group does not have any financial assets or liabilities  at fair value through profit or loss or interest-rate  financial derivatives. Nor are there any interest  rate derivatives. Consequently, any changes in  interest rates at year end will not significantly affect  consolidated profits. Although in relative terms none of those risks are critical  for the Organisation, all of them are systematically  managed by the Financial Division. 7. INFORMATION FOR THE DECISION MAKING The risks hereunder included are those linked to the  appropriate information at all levels: transactional  and operative, financing-accounting, management,  budgeting and control. These are not significant risks in relative terms, although  the various departments of the Group and especially  the Planning and Management Control Department  and the Financial Administration Department, which  report to the Financial Division, are directly responsible  for producing and supervising the quality of such  information. Moreover, in order to reduce exposure  to this kind of risks, the Group regularly reviews the  management information disclosed to the relevant  officials and invests in IT, follow-up and budgeting  systems, among others.  With regard to the risks associated with financial  reporting, the Group has set up an Internal Control  System on Financial Reporting (SCIIF, Spanish  acronym) aimed at achieving an ongoing follow-up  and assessment of the main risks associated, which  permits ensuring reasonably the reliability of the  public financial information of the Group. Section 7 of  the schedule to this report Additional information to  the current Model of Annual Corporate Governance  Report pursuant to Sec. 61 bis of Act24/1988 of 28th  July, on Securities Market (LMV, Spanish acronym)  (as amended by the Fifth Final Provision of Act 2/2011  of 4th March, on Sustainable Economy), provides  additional information on this issue.  In addition, the consolidated Annual Accounts and  those of each and every relevant Company are subject  to review by the independent auditors who are also in  charge of carrying out certain audit works regarding  the financial information. Likewise, as regards the  most significant companies of the Group, independent  auditors are requested to issue recommendations on  internal control. 8. TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS The risks hereunder covered are those linked to the  technical infrastructure and the efficient management  of information and of the computing and robotic  networks. The risks connected with the physical and  logistical safety of the systems are also included. To reduce exposure to this type of risks, the Systems  Department permanently monitors the streamlining  and coherence of the systems, directed at minimizing   - 203 - annual report 2011 the number of software packages, maximising training  of all users involved in handling these and guaranteeing  the security and stability required for the continuous  development of the activities of the Group. Moreover, there are contingency systems in the event  of computer stoppage, with double equipment and  data storage in a different location to the main Centre,  which would reduce the consequences of a breakdown  or stoppage. 9. GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT This category includes the risk of not having the  appropriate management of the Group which might  entail a breach of the Corporate Governance and  transparency standards.   At the present time, transparency and good governance  obligations for listed companies are duly governed by  the recommendations of several institutions and by a  specific legal framework (Financial Act, Transparency  Act, Order ECO/3722/2003 and Circular 1/2004 of  CNMV.) Lack of information or wrong information on  sensitive issues, such as transactions with related  parties or the remuneration of officials would harm  the good image or the reputation of the Group, being  therefore those issues subject to the control of the  Audit and Control Committee and of the Nomination  and Remuneration Committee, exclusively comprised  of independent directors.   There are also Internal Regulations of Conduct  regarding Transactions in Securities and a body  designated as the Code Compliance Supervisory Board  which, according to section 10.2.2 of said Regulations,  is charged with observing and enforcing the rules of  conduct of the Securities Markets and the rules of  the IRC itself (Internal Regulations of Conduct), its  procedures and further additional regulations, whether  present or future. D.2. Materialization during the fiscal  year of the various types of risks  affecting the Company and/or its Group The risks described in section D.1 are inherent in the  business model and the activity of the Group; therefore  they are always present somehow, throughout each  financial year. However, none of them has had any  significant impact on the Organization during last fiscal  year, as control systems anticipated to meet such risks  have been duly operative. D.3. Committee or governing bodies  responsible for establishing and  supervising the mechanisms of control The main governing bodies responsible for controlling  risks are the Board of Directors, the Audit and Control  Committee and the Steering Committee.  1.- the Board of Directors The Board of Directors is responsible for identifying the  main risks of the Group and for organising the appropriate  internal control and information systems. 2.- the audit and Control Committee The Audit and Control Committee assists the Board  of Directors in its supervision and control duties by  reviewing the internal control systems. The duties of  the Audit and Control Committee are provided under  the Articles of Association and the Board of Directors  Regulations.  The Board of Directors Regulations provide that it  is incumbent on the Audit and Control Committee,  exclusively comprised of Independent Directors of  the Group, to supervise the process of the financial  information and of the internal control systems of the  Group, to check the appropriate type and integrity of said  systems, to supervise the duties of the Internal Audit  Department of the Company and its Group, approving  the budget of the Department and the internal audit  plan and supervising the material and human resources  thereof, whether internal or external. The Internal Audit Department is directly linked to the  Board of Directors, to which it reports, through the  Audit and Control Committee, thus ensuring the full  independence of its acts.  In accordance with the Internal Audit Charter of the  Group, the mission of the Internal Audit function is  that of contributing to the good running of the Group,  by assuring an independent supervision of the internal  control system, and by providing recommendations to the  Group that help reduce to reasonable levels the potential  impact of the risks that hinder the accomplishment of  the objectives of the Organisation. Likewise, according to the Charter, the goals of the  Internal Audit function are to promote the existence  of appropriate internal control and risk management  systems, the homogeneous and efficient application of  internal control system policies and procedures which  make up such internal control system and to serve as  communication channel between the Organisation and  the Audit and Control Committee, in relation to those  matters that are responsibility of Internal Audit.  - 204 - shareholders - annual corporate governance report 3.- the Steering Committee The  Steering  Committee  is  charged  with  the   co-ordination of the business and corporate areas, and  takes active part in identifying, assessing, defining and  implementing hedging policies, establishing specific  measures to help mitigate the impact of risks in the  achievement of the goals of the Group. D.4. Processes of compliance with the  various regulations that affect the  Company and/or its Group Among the external risks that affect the Group,  a specific category described as Regulation has been  included, which has been described under section D.1  above. Within this category, it has been thought fit to  classify the risks in four groups, depending on the kind  of regulation to which they refer and on the potential  impact they have on the Group. This classification shall  be used to detail the legislation that affects the Group  in its operation. 	 Consumer	 and	 trade	 legislation:	 linked	 with	 commercial law, and regulations which govern those  commercial issues which apply to retail: (business  hours, end of season sales, etc.,) and any other  regulations regarding consumers and users. Included  in this group are such issues as: licence for store  opening, business hours; end of season sales period  and advertisement terms related thereto; conditions  that must be met by the products being sold in stores,  especially in relation to the labels and packaging, and  generally, all aspects that affect retail sales. 	 Tax	legislation,	relating	to	the	taxes	that	are	 charged on the Groups activities and profits. 	 Customs	 legislation,	 referring	 to	 cross- borders movements of merchandise. 	 Labour	 legislation,	 which	 regulates	 the	 relations with its workers  as regards wages, working  hours, labour calendar, health and safety, etc.,  	 Other	 legislation,	 including	 common	 legislation for any listed Company and specific  legislation relating to the activity performed by the  Group: 	 Accounting	 legislation,	 relating	 to	 the	 accounting principles and standards.  	 Securities	 market	 legislation,	 which	 affects	 all listed companies. 	 Intellectual	and	industrial	property	legislation,	 relating to rights over designs and trademarks.  	 General	 civil	 and	 mercantile	 legislation,	 relating to Company law and civil and commercial  contracts.   	 Competition	 law,	 which	 specifically	 affects	 the relations with other competitors in the market.  	 Real	 Estate	 legislation	 which	 fundamentally	 affects urban regulations, commercial properties and  namely, the leases of business premises where the  stores of the Group are located.  	 Legislation	 governing	 the	 personal	 data	 protection,  regarding  the  custody  of  personal  information that is confidential.  	 Environmental	 legislation,	 regarding	 the	 proper treatment of waste, spillage, etc., In order to reduce exposure to the risk of non- compliance with the different legislation to which the  Group is subject, the corporate Legal, Tax, Industrial  Property,  Labour and Internal Audit Departments carry  out the task of co-ordination with the various members  of management of each geographical area and external  legal advisors of each country.  - 205 - annual report 2011 E. General Meeting   of Shareholders  The General Meeting of Shareholders duly  convened and constituted in accordance with all legal  formalities and those of the Articles of Association and  its own Regulations, is the supreme and sovereign body  of expression of the will of the Company. Its resolutions  are binding on all its shareholders, including those  absent or dissenting shareholders, without prejudice to  any remedies they may have at law.  In accordance with the provisions of the Articles  of Association, the General Meeting is authorized to pass  all kinds of resolutions concerning the Company and, in  particular, and subject to any other powers vested by the  applicable regulations, it is granted with the following  exclusive powers: (a) To resolve on the individual annual accounts of  the Company and, where appropriate, on the consolidated  accounts of the Company and its Group, as well as on the  distribution of the  income or loss.

(i) To grant the Board of Directors the powers it  may deem fit to deal with unforeseen issues. (j) To approve those transactions which might  entail an effective amendment of the corporate purpose  and those whose effect may be equivalent to the  liquidation of the Company. The Board of Directors shall convene the Annual General  Meeting necessarily once a year; within the first six  months of the closing of each financial year in order to;  at least, review the Companys management, to approve,  where appropriate, the accounts of the previous year and  to decide upon the distribution of income or loss.  The Extraordinary General Meeting shall meet when  the Board of Directors so resolves or when a number  of shareholders which represent at least five percent of  the share capital so request, expressing in the request  the matters to be discussed. In this latter case, the  General Meeting of Shareholders must be convened  to meet within the deadline provided in the applicable  regulations. The agenda of the meeting will necessarily  include the matters that were the subject of the request.  In the resolutions to call the General Meeting, the Board  of Directors shall require the presence of a Public Notary  to take the minutes of the General Meeting. Both the Annual and the Extraordinary General  Meetings must be convened by the Board of Directors  through notice published in the Official Gazette of the  Companies Register and on the web site of the Company,  at least one month in advance of the day appointed for  the meeting or the greatest period that is required by  law, where appropriate, due to the resolutions submitted  for deliberation. The notice must state the name of the  Company, the day, time and place of the meeting, as well  as the date on which, if appropriate, the General Meeting  shall be held on second call, and there must be at least  a 24-hour period between one call and the other. The  notice shall likewise state, clearly and precisely, all the  matters to be discussed therein. No later than the date of publication, or in any event  the business day that immediately follows, the notice of  the meeting shall be sent by the Company to the CNMV,  and to the Governing Organisations of the Securities  Markets where the Companys shares are listed for its  insertion in the relevant Listing Bulletins. The text of the  notice shall also be accessible through the Companys  web page.

Quorum required for the holding of the  General Meeting of Shareholders established  in the Articles of Association . Differences  with the minimum requirements set out in  the [Spanish] Corporation Act (SCA) Quorum % different   from that established   as a general rule in   Art. 102 of the SCA Quorum % different  from that established  in Art. 103 of the SCA  for special cases  covered therein Quorum required   on 1st call 50% of the subscribed  voting stock Quorum required   on 2nd call Both Article 21.1 of the Articles of Association and Article  15 of the Regulations of the General Meeting provide that  the General Meeting will be validly held on first call where  shareholders who are present or represented by proxy  represent at least fifty percent of the subscribed share  capital with the right to vote. At second call, generally,  the General Meeting shall be validly held regardless of  the capital attending the same. However, if the Meeting is  called to decide on an increase or a reduction in the share  capital, the issue of debentures, the transformation of the  Company, the merger for the creation of a new Company  or via the taking-over of the Company by another entity,  its spin-off in whole or in part, the global assignment of  assets and liabilities, the substitution of the Company  purpose as well as any other modification whatsoever of  the Articles of Association, shall require, at second call,  the attendance of twenty-five percent of the subscribed  share capital with the right to vote.  Therefore, the only difference between said rules and  the provisions of the SCA (currently, Act on Capital  Companies), both in general and for special cases,  consists of the quorum necessary for the holding of the  General Meeting at first call in accordance with Art.  102 of the SCA (current Article 193 of the Act on Capital  Companies, with the same wording), that the Articles of  Association and the Regulations of the General Meeting  of the Company have made equal to the quorum for  valid meetings on first call in accordance with Article  103 of the SCA (current article 194 of the Act on Capital  Companies, with the same wording)(shareholders who  are present or represented by proxy represent at least  fifty percent of the subscribed share capital with the  right to vote). This enhanced quorum may not be deemed  to be a restriction on the control by the Company, since it  is only applicable to first calls. This is expressly permitted by Article 193 of the Act on  Capital Companies itself, where, after laying down that the  General Meeting of Shareholders shall be validly held on  first call when the shareholders present or represented  by proxy possess, at least, twenty-five per cent of the  subscribed voting share capital, it goes on to provide that  the Articles of Association can establish a higher quorum. E.2. Differences with the rules provided by the  [Spanish] Corporation Act for the passing of  corporate resolutions There are no differences with the Spanish Corporation  Act for the passing of corporate resolutions. E.3.  Rights of the shareholders in relation  to general meetings that are different from  those established in the SCA Within the rights for the shareholders recognised by Article  48 of the SCA (current Article 93 of the Act on Capital  Companies, with the same wording), the following can be  listed in relation to the General Meetings: the right to attend  and to vote in the general meetings and to challenge the  resolutions of the Company, and the right of information. These rights are developed in Article 179 and subsequent  articles and in Part XIV (Listed Corporations) of the  Act on Capital Companies, former Articles 104 (Right  to attend the meeting), 105 (Limitations on the right to  attend and vote), 106 (Proxies), 108 (Representation  by a relative), 112 (Right to information) and 115 and  following (relating to the challenging of resolutions) of  the Spanish Corporations Act. The rights of the shareholders of Inditex in relation to  the general meetings are scrupulously respected by the  Company, in the terms established in the legislation in  force, in the Articles of Association and the Regulations  of the General Meeting of Shareholders. Right to information of the shareholders The Investor Relations Department and the Shareholders  Office at Inditex are at the disposal of the shareholders  to provide all the information on the General Meeting  that they may need. Prior to the General Meeting, those  shareholders who so request are sent a copy of the  Annual Report and the relevant documentation relating  to the items on the agenda. Moreover, the Company deals, as far as is possible,  with the requests for information that are made by the  shareholders in relation to the items on the agenda of  the General Meeting, both before the General Meeting  and during the meeting itself through the question   - 207 - annual report 2011 and answer session, which all shareholders attending  the meeting can participate in if they wish and whose  participation is always answered. Section E.4 hereof deals with the regulation of the  right of information of shareholders covered by the  Regulations of the General Meeting. With regard to the  information made available to shareholders from notice  of the Meeting, these two issues below are established  in addition to the provisions of the SCA (at present, the  Act on Capital Companies, with the same wording): a) The full text of all the proposed resolutions that  the Board of Directors submits to the AGM for debate and  approval regarding the various items of the agenda; and  b) The following information regarding directors  whose ratification or appointment is proposed: a)  professional profile and biography; ii) other Boards of  Directors where they sit, whether in listed companies  or otherwise (except for Boards of property holding  companies of the director in question or of his/her next  of kin); iii) the category to which they belong, and in case  of proprietary directors, stating the shareholders they  represent or with whom they have links; iv) date of their  first appointment and, as the case may be, of any further  appointments to sit on the Board of Directors, and v) the  shares in the Company and stock options they hold.  attendance of general Meetings.

As it has been explained  in section B.1.14 hereof, wherein the system to  determine remuneration of directors is described, the  Company does not resort to the use of a generic and  undetermined system to fix the remuneration of the  Board of Directors consisting of a reference to the  Board having a share in the profits of the Company.  Conversely, it is provided in Article 33.1 of the Articles  of Association that the remuneration of the Directors  shall consist of a fixed annual remuneration for each  director, the amount of which shall be decided by the  General Meeting of Shareholders for each fiscal year or be  valid for those fiscal years that the Meeting establishes;  in accordance with such provision, it was resolved by  the Annual General Meeting held on 15 July 2006 – as  amended by the AGM held on 18 July 2008 and by the  AGM held on 19 July 2011 - to fix, for an indefinite term,  the remuneration of the directors of the Company on  account of the performance of their duties as Board  members, as it is explained below under item 41. 41.  the  annual  Report  list  the  individual  compensation of directors during the fiscal year,  including: a) a breakdown of the compensation of each  director, to include where appropriate: i) Attendance per diem or other fixed compensation  received as a director;  ii) The additional compensation received as  chairman or member of a Board committee;  iii) Any compensation received under profit- sharing or bonus schemes, and the reason for the  accrual thereof;  iv) Contributions on the directors behalf  to defined-contribution pension plans; or any  increase in the directors vested rights, in the case  of contributions to defined-benefit plans;  v) Any severance package agreed or paid;  vi) Any compensation received as a director of  other companies in the Group;  vii) Compensation for the performance of senior  management duties by executive directors;  viii) Any item of compensation other than those  listed above, of whatever nature and provenance  within the Group, especially when it is deemed to be  a related-party transaction or when the omission  thereof detracts from a true and fair view of the  total compensation receive. b) a breakdown of any delivery to directors  of shares, share options or any other instrument  indexed to the price of the shares, specifying: i)  Number of shares or options awarded during  the year, and the terms and conditions for the  exercise thereof;  ii) Number of options exercised during the year,  specifying the number of shares involved and the  exercise price;  iii) Number of options outstanding at the end  of the year, specifying their price, date and other  requirements for exercise;  iv) Any change during the year in the terms for  the exercise of previously-awarded options.  c) Information on the relationship, in such  past fiscal year, between the compensation received   - 221 - annual report 2011 by executive directors and the profits or other  measures of performance of the Company.

Pursuant to such authority, CNMV  published on 26 October 2011 a Circular bill amending   - 229 - annual report 2011 the form of ACGR, in order to include the manner in  which each company should provide the description of  the main features of its SCIIF. With this respect, and further to the benchmark provided  in the above referred GTCI document, the Inditex Group  has drafted this report. 7.1 CONTROL ENVIRONMENT Specific mechanisms put in place by the different  companies belonging to the Inditex Group (hereinafter,  the Group) to keep an internal control environment  that help create full, reliable and appropriate financial  information, thus preventing the potential existence of  irregularities and the channels to detect cure them. 7.1.1.

Employees receive documentation which  they later use as another information tool. Among  the courses taught to staff members from the  financial area, the following schemes may be  pointed out: General Accounting Plan in Spain,  Internal Control Systems on Financial Information  (SCIIF), VAT, Consolidation and Accounting Refresher. A specific portal of the DGF is available on the  intranet to all employees with the material from the  above mentioned courses. This portal is also used  to report domestic and international news within the  financial, accounting and auditing scope. The foregoing  and the subscriptions to specialized financial magazines  make up a technical library available to the members of  the departments comprising the DGF. Likewise, employees associated with the control  and supervision of SCIIF areas and namely those  belonging to the different departments of DGF and  Internal Audit attend on a regular basis training courses  regarding specific issues, connected with the areas  under their remit. On the other hand, considering the international  size of the Group, face to face language courses are  provided on a daily basis focusing on teaching globally  standard economic, financial and business terms. Meanwhile, members involved in SCIIF, especially  the econmic and financial function and the internal  audit function are regularly updated about regulatory  changes from different sources.  7.2. RISKS ASSESSMENT IN FINANCIAL REPORTING Degree of implementation and systematization of the  process whereby the Group is able to identify sources  and risks of any mistake or irregularity in financial  reporting. 7.2.1. Main features of the risk identification  process Within the Group, the system to identify internal  control risks regarding financial information is a  dynamic and ever-changing process, which shows  from time to time such risks which have an impact on  the drafting of financial information and the controls  which help reduce them. This process has been documented in the  Procedure for Risks Management in respect of  Financial Information en prepared by the DGF and  Internal Audit.  - Such process covers the entire goals of  financial information.  	 Existence	 and	 occurrence:	 transactions,	 facts and sundry events shown on the financial  information actually exist and have been timely  recorded. 	 Integrity:	 the	 information	 shows	 the	 entire	 transactions, facts and sundry events regarding  which the organization is an affected party. 	 Assessment:	 the	 transactions,	 facts	 and	 sundry events are registered and assessed pursuant  to the applicable laws and regulations.  - 234 - shareholders - annual corporate governance report 	 Submission,	 breakdown	 and	 comparison:	 the transactions, facts and sundry events are  classified, submitted and disclosed in the financial  information pursuant to the applicable laws and  regulations. 	 Rights	 and	 obligations:	 the	 financial	 information shows as at a relevant date, the rights  and obligations through the relevant assets and  liabilities, under the prevailing laws and regulations  in force.  As a result of such process, a scoping matrix  of risks regarding financial information (Scoping  Matrix of SCIIF). This scoping matrix allows the  identification of risks and the prioritization of  operational processes which have an impact on  financial information, by means of comparing  financial  statements  with  operational  cycles  associated with them.  Further to the identification of potential risks,  they are assessed based upon the business  expertise and understanding of the management,  taking into account: - Quantitative factors  (materiality) and; - Qualitative factors, such as transactions  standardizing and automatizing, changes versus the  previous year, complexity of accounting estimate  and likelihood of occurrence. - process  to  identify  the  consolidation  perimeter  The Group relies on a Corporate Master of  Companies wherein all the companies which are part  of the Inditex Group are included. Recorded in such master are, on the one hand,  general information about companies, such as their  Company name, accounting closing date, currency,  etc., and on the other, legal information such as the date  of incorporation, share capital, list of shareholders,  stakes, and other relevant data. Such matter is managed and updated in  accordance with the Procedure for the Incorporation  and Financing of Companies. In accordance with International Standards on  Financial Reporting and other applicable rules, and  pursuant to the information provided by said matter,  the DGF determines on a quarterly basis the whole  of the companies which make up the Consolidation  Perimeter and the consolidation methods which  apply to each of the companies included in the above  referred perimeter.  - effects  of  other  types  of  risks   (operational, technological, financial, legal, reputational,  environmental, etc.,) The process for the assessment of financial  information risks includes, in addition to the above  referred quantitative and qualitative factors, the main  risks identified through the general risk map of the  Inditex Group.  Meanwhile, potential risks identified through  the Scoping Matrix are added to the Risks Map of  the Group.  Such Map is regularly updated with the  assistance of all the involved areas of the organisation.  Thus, the Group is acquainted with the impact that  the remaining risks of an operational, technological,  legal or environmental type might have on financial  statements. - governing body of the Company charged  with monitoring the process Finally, the whole process is monitored and  approved on a yearly basis by the Audit and Control  Committee. 7.3. CONTROL ACTIVITIES Main features of specific controls implemented by the  Group to reduce the risks of mistake or malpractice  regarding the financial information. 7.3.1. Flows of activity and control (including  those regarding risk of fraud) of the different types  of transactions  For the purposes of achieving an internal  control environment suitable for the creation of full,  reliable and timely financial information, the DGF and  all other areas associated to SCIIF have proceeded  to standardize and document mandatory procedures  which describe activities and controls for the main  administrative processes with an impact on financial  information.  Such procedures set out the guidelines that  members of the DGF shall follow upon drafting the  financial information of the Group. Additionally, they  include manual and automatic controls which allow  giving an appropriate answer to risks associated with  the achievement of the goals regarding reliability  and integrity of the financial information so as to  prevent, detect, reduce and correct the risk of any  potential mistakes way in advance. Each control  activity is incumbent on the relevant manager and is  systematically exerted with the required frequency. Additionally, procedures are represented in  flow charts and control activities through scoping  risks matrixes. Dissemination of procedures, flow   - 235 - annual report 2011 charts and matrixes to staff members involved in  the drafting of the financial information is carried  out through the financial portal of the Group available  on the intranet, where they may be accessed by any  team member. Such financial portal represents an  additional work tool.  Each procedure is allocated to a manager  charged with reviewing and updating it. Said updates  are duly reviewed and authorized by the head of the  area prior to their dissemination via the financial  portal.  The following procedures should be underscored  in accordance with their relevance, considering the  business nature:  - Accounts payable procedure The different stages of the accounts payable  procedure are addressed, including: 	 Scoping	matrix	of	risks	and	controls:	 description  of  potential  risks  identified  through the accounts payable procedure and  setting of controls to reduce or remove the  identified risks.  	 Flow	chart	describing	the	procedure. 	 Segregation	 of	 functions	 policy	 regarding this matter. - Cash procedure It describes each stage of the cash procedure  (loading of bank details, recording of bank  transactions, bank reconciliation and payments).  Likewise, a relevant scoping matrix of risks and  controls and the relevant segregation of functions  policy are covered therein. - Stores sales procedure Regulation of control over stock is covered in  different procedures spanning from the purchase  of goods from external suppliers to the final sale at  the store, including all the interim flow charts and  the valuation of stock.  Each control to be exerted by those responsible  for stock is defined in such procedures, for the  purposes of ensuring reliability of the position and  valuation of stock. - Tangible Fixed Assets Procedure These regulations aim at the appropriate  recording in the financial statements of each  Company of the Group of every new entry and every  deregistration for tangible fixed assets.  Such procedure covers both general issues, such  as accounting regulations, general criteria for the  entry and deregistration of fixed assets and specific  issues such as the processing of fixed assets at  stores, especially underscoring the accounting  treatment of refurbished stores.   The Group reviews regularly the average useful  life of fixed assets at stores. Likewise, procedures governing accounting  closing are shown below: - Accounting Closings Procedure This procedure thoroughly governs the different  tasks involved in accounting closing of each heading  of the financial statements of the Group companies  (net sales, cost of sales, operating expenses, taxes,  fixed assets, cash, customers, stock, accounts  receivable, etc,. Likewise, managers responsible  for each of the above listed headings are identified  and the deadlines for the submission of information  are provided. - Accounting Closing Procedure at Central  Purchase Units Such procedure covers the accounting closing  tasks which apply to Central Purchase Units,  mainly regarding the following issues: procurement  (finished  product,  commodities,  workshops),  accrual, stock (finished product, commodities, other  procurement), etc. - Accounting  Closing  Procedure  regarding  Consolidated Financial Statements It governs the operation of each stage of the  accounting closing procedure regarding consolidated  financial statements, from receipt of individual  financial statements to the drafting of the consolidated  financial statements and annual report.  On the other hand, the procedure to review  relevant opinions, estimates, assessments and  projections is addressed within the documentation  for each of the relevant procedures. However,  the Procedure for the Accounting Closing of  Consolidated Financial Statements specifically  provides a section regarding Provisions, Opinions  and Estimates which covers the main consolidated  provisions, opinions and estimates, as well as the  review and approval thereof by the DGF. The DGF relies on another control tool, which  complements the various documented procedures.  Such tool consists of a number of indicators  (KPIS, key performance indicators) which aim  at evaluating the quality of financial information   - 236 - shareholders - annual corporate governance report reported by the relevant managers of the Group  companies. Such tool is available to the different  units which create information. KPIS are regularly  reviewed by members of the various departments  comprising the DGF, with the proposal, where  appropriate, of corrective measures and specific  action plans and the follow-up thereof.  Likewise, the DGF carries out analytical reviews  of financial statements of the main companies of the  Group on a quarterly basis. 7.3.2  Internal  control  policies  and  procedures for It systems supporting the key process  of the Company regarding the drafting and publication  of financial information The internal control framework of IT systems of  the Group has been defined based upon a catalogue of  IT processes (hereinafter, IT) which covers the whole  activity associated with each system. Thus, the internal  control framework covers all the risks associated with  each and every process.  The Computer Security area of the Group, which  reports to the IT Division, aims at ensuring security of  all computer processes by:  - Setting and disseminating regulations to ensure  security. In this respect, the Policy for Information  Security (PSI, Spanish acronym) was approved in  September 2011. - Carrying out reviews aimed at verifying  enforcement of such regulations. The PSI serves as a benchmark which provides  guidelines to be followed by the staff of the Inditex  Group, for the purposes of ensuring computer  security within all business processes; therefore,  they also support the SCIIF. Guidelines provided in  the Security Policy address the following issues: 	 Assets	classification	and	control 	 Security	versus	human	deeds 	 Physical	security	and	security	of	the	 environment 	 Accesses	control 	 Systems,	Communications	and	Transactions	 Management 	 Systems	Development	and	Update 	 Business	Continuity	Management 	 Management	of	Information	Security	Incidences 	 Regulatory	and	Legal	Compliance Additionally,  regarding  the  design  and  implementation of applications, the Group has  defined a methodological framework with different  requirements aimed at ensuring that the solution  implemented  actually  meets  the  functions  demanded by users and so that the quality level  meets the security standards set out. Finally,  the  Group  relies  on  contingency  mechanisms and procedures, both technical and  operational, which have been defined to ensure  recovery of IT systems in case of irregularities. 7.3.3  Internal  control  policies  and  procedures to oversee activities outsourced to  third parties. appraisal, calculation or assessment  activities commissioned from independent experts  As a general rule, the Inditex Group does not  have any process with a relevant impact on financial  information outsources to any third party. The general  policy of the Group lies in not outsourcing any activity  which might have any material impact on its financial  statements.  Namely, during FY2011, the main activities  entrusted to third parties regarding the drafting of  financial statements, involved real estate appraisals  and valuation of intangible assets  Such services are engaged by the managers  of the relevant areas, ensuring the technical and  legal qualifications and capacity of the individuals or  companies hired. 7.4.

The	 Corporate	 Planning	 and	 Control	 Department carries out a monthly review of  results of each subsidiary of the Group and also a  quarterly review of the evolution and consistency  of the consolidated financial information and  the management information, which shall be  subsequently submitted to the DGF.  	 The	 DGF	 is	 charged	 with	 overseeing	 and	 approving the reported financial information.  	 Internal	 Audit	 carries	 out	 certain	 limited	 procedures of analytical review of consolidated  financial information for the first and third quarter  of the fiscal year, and it reports the findings of  such review to the Audit and Control Committee. 	 In	addition	to	auditing	the	consolidated	and	 individual annual accounts, External Auditors  also carry out a limited review of the half-yearly  consolidated financial information and reports  the findings of such assignment to the Audit and  Control Committee.  Prior to stating the annual accounts and  approving the half-yearly financial statements, the  DGF and the External Auditors meet for the purposes  of reviewing and assessing financial information  before its submission to the Board of Directors. The Audit and Control Committee sends this  information to the Board of Director upon which falls  the approval thereof, for its subsequent submission  to the market.  7.4.2  Specific unit in charge of defining  and  updating  accounting  policies  (accounting  policies area or Department) and of settling doubts  or conflicts arising from the construction thereof,  which is in regular communication with the teams  in charge of operations within the organisation Accounting policies are centralized and their  application for the whole Group falls on the DGF.

For  the  purposes  of  reporting  financial  information, the subsidiaries of the Group rely on a  specific application whereby their individual financial  statements are captured and which allow them to  reconcile transactions and inter-group balances.  Such financial statements reported by the subsidiaries  are the basis of the consolidation process carried out  by the Consolidation and Reporting area.  Financial information reported to the CNMV is  drafted based upon consolidated financial statements,  and based upon certain supplementary information  reported by the subsidiaries, required to prepare the  annual/half-year report. Contemporaneously, certain  specific controls are exerted to confirm integrity of  such information. 7.5. MONITORING OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM Information which helps understand how SCIIF is  overseen, in order to prevent and settle any defect in  its design and operation. 7.5.1  Internal audit function charged,  inter alia, with supporting the audit committee in  the monitoring of the internal system, including  SCIIF The Group has an independent Internal Audit  Department whose mission and goals are provided in  its Charter and Regulations.

To discharge such duties, Internal Audit  relies on an Annual Audit Plan approved by the  Audit and Control Committee. For organisational  purposes, Internal Audit is included in the current  structure by means of a direct link to the Board of  Directors, to which it reports via the Chairman, and  to which it is functionally subordinated through the  Audit and Control Committee, which ensures a full  independence in the performance of its activities. 7.5.2  Discussion procedure whereby the  auditor, (in accordance with the provisions of the  Nta), the internal audit function and other experts  may disclose to the senior management and to the  audit Committee or the directors of the Company any  significant internal control weaknesses identified in  the course of the review of the financial statements  or any other assignment entrusted. action plan to  try and correct or reduce weaknesses observed  Internal Audit regularly reports to the Senior  Management and the Audit and Control Committee  the internal control weaknesses identified in the  reviews of SCIIF of the Group, as well as the follow-up  of the action plans set out to settle or reduce them.  Meanwhile the External Auditors regularly  meet with the DGF and Internal Audit, both to  gather information and to disclose any potential  control weaknesses which they might detect, where  appropriate, in the course of their work.  On the other hand, the Audit and Control  Committee meets with the auditors of individual  and consolidated accounts for the purposes of  reviewing the annual accounts of the Group and  certain half-yearly periodical information that the  Board of Directors must supply to the markets and  their supervisory bodies, overseeing fulfillment of  legal requirements and the appropriate application   - 239 - annual report 2011 of generally accepted accounting principles in the  drafting thereof.

Nonetheless, when the Board  considers that it must maintain its criterion, it  shall publicly explain the content and scope of the  discrepancy.  To meet the provisions laid down in the above  referred section, any discussion or different view  existing is anticipated in the meetings held between  the Audit and Control Committee and the external  auditors. Meanwhile, the external auditors report,  where appropriate, about the main improvement  measures on internal control proposed identified  as a result of their work, and the degree of  implementation of the relevant action plans set in  train by the Management to correct or reduce the  issues identified.  7.5.3  Scope of SCIIF assessment carried  out during the fiscal year, and of the procedure to  disclose the results of such assessment. action  plan providing any potential corrective measures.  Consideration of the impact of such measures on  the financial information As stated before, the process of identification  and assessing risks of the financial information is  carried out every year, and it is as the basis for the  annual planning for assessment of SCIIF works by  Internal Audit, also supplemented by requests from  the Audit and Control Committee and the Senior  Management.  Based upon the map of financial information  risks, Internal Audit drafts a pluri- annual plan for  the regular review of SCIIF of the Group which is  submitted to the Audit and Control Committee for  approval. Such pluri-annual plan envisages reviews  of SCIIF for the main processes and geographical  areas with a material impact on financial statements  of the Group. Priority reviews are set in accordance  with the risks identified. Suitability of such plan shall  be reviewed every year, further to the update of the  process to identify and assess financial information  risks.  Additionally, as stated above, Internal Audit  carries out certain limited procedures of analytical  review on consolidated financial statements for the  first and third quarter of the year on consolidated  information. Results and eventual weaknesses identified  in the course of the assignments, together with the  corrective measures proposed, are reported to  the Senior Management and the Audit and Control  Committee, as well as the follow-up of previous  assignments and the degree of implementation of  recommendations set. Included in the scope of SCIIF assessment,  based upon the above-mentioned evaluation of  financial information risks, is a review of the  effectiveness of the design and effective operation of  key transactional controls and general controls on  the main computer applications used in the drafting  of the financial information, together with a review  of the general control environment. To carry out  such work, Internal Audit resorts to several audit  techniques, mostly interviews, analytical reviews,  specific transaction control tests and substantive  tests. Such scope is complemented by the execution  and review (KRI, key risk indicators) defined by  Internal Audit on most critical risks areas, which  have been designed to detect and reduce likelihood of  risks and mistakes, including those of financial nature  and fraud. Execution of such key risk indicators is  centralized for all business units and geographical  areas, pursuant to the annual plan approved.  7.5.4 Monitoring activities about SCIIF carried  out by the audit Committee With regard to the monitoring activities about  SCIIF carried out by the Audit and Control Committee,  it is charged, inter alia, with:  - Reviewing the annual accounts of the Group  and the periodic financial information, this latter  on a quarterly basis, to be provided by the Board  of Directors to the markets and its supervisory  bodies, overseeing compliance with the legal  requirements and the appropriate application  of the generally accepted accounting standards  upon drafting such information.  - Proposing to the Board of Directors, so that  it may table it to the Annual General Meeting of  Shareholders, the appointment of auditors within  the statutory terms. Likewise, the Audit and Control  Committee proposes to the Board of Directors  the terms of the agreement to be executed with  auditors, the scope of their professional mandate  and, where appropriate, their removal or renewal,  overseeing performance of the agreement and  regularly assessing their results.  - As part of its monitoring duties regarding  the Audit Department, the Committee approves  the annual activities report of such Department,  as well as its budget and the annual audit plan.

(INDITEX, S.A.) (hereinafter, Inditex) has  been amending its rules on corporate governance in line  with the most demanding trends on the subject and in  accordance with the good governance codes and, where  appropriate, the regulations approved on this matter.  Amongst said adjustments and amendments are those  affecting the Board of Directors Regulations, out of  which those aimed at enhancing the tasks of the Audit  and Control Committee, either by extending its duties or  by allocating new ones thereto, such as that of drawing  up an annual activities report, shall be stressed. This document drawn up by the Audit and Control  Committee of Inditex, in the session held on 12 June  2012 is the ninth annual activities report prepared  in compliance with the provisions of section 14.2 (o)  currently in force of the Board of Directors Regulations  of the Company, and it describes the activities carried out  by the Audit and Control Committee through 31 January  2012, fiscal 2011 year-end.

Thus, the Additional Provision introduced on the Stock  Exchange Law by the Financial Act, according to which  those issuing companies whose shares were admitted to  trading on secondary official securities markets should  have an Audit Committee, was enforced, as were the  latest trends concerning corporate governance issues  of listed companies established by the Aldama Report,  laying with the Articles of Association the task of fixing  the number of members, the powers of the Committee  and the rules governing its operation. Subsequently, it was resolved by the Board of Directors  in its meeting held on 10 June 2004, to approve a new  Revised Text of the Board of Directors Regulations,  which would include the provisions of Act 26/2003 of 17  July, amending the Stock Exchange Act and the Revised  Text of the Spanish Corporation Act in order to foster  transparency in listed companies (the Transparency  Act) and its bylaws. With this new amendment the Audit  and Control Committee was enhanced with the inclusion  of a new duty.   Finally, the Board of Directors in its meeting held on 11  December 2007 approved a new Revised Text of the Board  of Directors Regulations in order to adjust the contents  thereof to the Recommendations of the Unified Code on  Good Governance. Further to this amendment, the duties  of the Audit and Control Committee were extended as it  assumes the Recommendations provided by said Unified  Code on this issue Regulations Section 31 of the Articles of Association currently in force,  as amended further to a resolution passed by the Annual  General Meeting of Shareholders held on 14 July 2010 in  order to increase the number of Committee members,  from five to seven, in connection with the appointment of  two new independent directors, provides as follows:  Section 31.- audit and Control Committee. 1.- An Audit and Control Committee shall be formed  within the Board of Directors made up of a minimum of three  and a maximum of seven directors who must necessarily be  independent directors.

However, a year after  the date of expiry, he may be re-elected. 3.- Without prejudice to any other tasks that it might  be assigned from time to time by the Board of Directors,  the Audit and Control Committee shall perform the following  duties: (a) To report to the General Shareholders Meeting on  those questions put forward by shareholders regarding  matters within the scope of its competence. (b)  To propose to the Board of Directors, in order to  be submitted to the General Shareholders Meeting, the  appointment of the external auditors that must review  the annual accounts.

Composition The Executive Committee of Inditex, S.A., in the meeting  held on 27 October 2000, appointed the members of the  Audit and Control Committee, resolving thus its initial  composition. Said initial composition was ahead of the provisions  subsequently included in the Stock Exchange Act,  regarding the requirements that the Committee be  formed by a majority of non-executive directors, and that  the Chairman be elected amongst said non-executive  directors. However, the amendments to the Board of Directors  Regulations that the Board resolved in its meeting of  20 March 2003 were beyond both the provisions of the  recommendations of the Aldama Report, then applicable  and of the current Unified Code – which recommends  that the Committee should be comprised of non  executive directors exclusively, and that the Chairman  thereof should be an independent director–, since the  requirement that all members of the Audit and Control  Committee should be independent directors was made an  internal regulation. This resolution entailed a necessary  change in the composition of the Committee.  To meet this requirement, the only executive director of  the Audit and Control Committee tendered his resignation  as a member thereof, and another independent director  was appointed as member of this Committee, after report  of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. On 9 June 2005, it was resolved by the Board of Directors  of the Company, after report of the Nomination and  Remuneration Committee, to extend the number of  members of the Audit and Control Committee to five. Likewise, the maximum four-year term provided in  Additional Provision Number Eighteen of the Stock  Exchange Act having expired, and pursuant to the  provisions of clauses 31 and 14 of the Articles of  Association and of the Board of Directors Regulations,  respectively, it was resolved by the Audit and Control  Committee during the meeting held on 9 December 2008,  to appoint Ms Irene R. Miller as new Chairwoman of said  body, replacing Mr Francisco Luzn Lpez, the former  Chairman thereof.  Finally, considering the foregoing, the Board of Directors  of the Company resolved during its meeting held on  13 July 2010, after report from the Nomination and  Remuneration Committee, to increase the number of  members of the Audit and Control Committee, from five  to seven, appointing independent directors, Mr Emilio  Saracho Rodrguez de Torres and Mr Nils Smedegaard  Andersen to serve on the Audit and Control Committee.

RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS In compliance with the provisions of the Board of  Directors Regulations, the Committee proposed and  issued the relevant reports, on the re-election of Directors  and on the appointment of internal offices within the  Board of Directors. With this respect, the Committee, in the meeting held on  13 June 2011, with the abstention of the interested party,  proposed the submission by the Board of Directors to the  Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, of the relevant  proposal on the re-election of Ms. Irene R. Miller, as  members of the Board of Directors. ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNING BODIES Pursuant to the Recommendations of the Unified Code  on Good Governance, and to the provisions of the Board  of Directors Regulations, the Committee reviewed in its  meeting held on 13 December 2011, the assessment of the  performance of the Board of Directors, of the Supervision  and Control Committees, and of the first executive, in  accordance with the assessment methodology previously  approved. REMUNERATION POLICY Likewise, pursuant to the Recommendations of the  Unified Code on Good Governance and to the internal  regulations of the Company, the Committee proposed to  the Board of Directors, in the meeting held on 13 June  2011, the report on the directors compensation policy for  FY2010, addressing inter alia, the fixed and the variable  remuneration of directors and any other relevant terms  of the employment agreements of those who discharge  senior management duties as executive directors. Main relationships of the  Nomination and Remuneration  Committee With the Board of Directors At the beginning of each session of the Board of Directors,  the Chairman of the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee reports on the main business transacted in  the last meeting of the Committee.  - 255 - annual report 2011 With the Chief executive officer and the Senior  Management The Committee encourages the appearance in its sessions  of the First Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  and of the senior managers and officers of the Company  to explain their view on certain issues directly linked with  the field of responsibility of the Committee and which are  recurrent.  With the Human Resources Department In order to keep the Nomination and Remuneration  Committee duly informed, the Human Resources Division  regularly informs the Committee on the changes, if any, in  the global remuneration systems, the market researches  on the pay of Senior Management, the annual pay  adjustments and the review of the adjustment guidelines  for each country, a summary of the annual adjustments  carried out and the global programmes for the detection  and development of potential in the matter of personnel,  and succession plans.   - 256 - Annex:   Sustainability  Balance Sheet - Environmental  indicators - Social   indicators  - 257 - annual report 2011 Materiality Inditex maintains a continuous dialogue with its  stakeholders in order to identify the issues that most  interest or concern them. It is constantly making analyses  to determine the issues and indicators it should report  on, based on the following principles:  1. Sustainability strategic context: The way in which the  organisation contributes to improving trends, progress,  and economic, environmental, and social conditions. 2. Materiality: Indicators and aspects reflecting the  organisation's most significant social, environmental,  and economic impacts as well as those having substantial  influence on evaluations and decisions by its stakeholders. 3. Stakeholder participation: Inditex identifies its  stakeholders in order to later be able to respond to their  reasonable expectations and interests. 4. Thoroughness: Coverage of Inditex's indicators and  definition of the information covered should be sufficient  to reflect significant social, economic and environmental  impacts, and to enable stakeholders to evaluate the  group's performance for the year. To meet this obligation Inditex carries out the following  activities in the interest of materiality: Design of a pre-evaluation methodology The content and methodology of the processes for  identifying aspects to be evaluated in materiality tests  are mainly based on the guide for preparing the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Discussion Paper from the  Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and the principles  found in AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard of  Accountabilityy. Evaluation of materiality and preparation of the materiality  matrix The Social Council, as a legitimate representative of the  opinions and concerns of Inditex stakeholders, makes  tests that evaluate the importance of specific aspects, the  probability of those aspects impacting Inditex, and their  perception of its capability of responding. A materiality  matrix is built using the results obtained from the Social  Councils evaluation. It is fashioned as a risk map, defines  the criteria to use to orient the Inditex strategy, and its  communication through the Annual Report.  In December 2011 Inditex signed on to the Integrated  Reporting Pilot Programme. The organisation is made  up different groups of entities involved in rendering  accounts in order to create a common framework of  integrated reporting. 4 5 11 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 3 4 22 23 14/21 7 28 16 19 10/13 24 20 27 25 26 1  Relevance to stakeholders Inditex Exposure 17 2 18 5/12/15 8 9 1 Code of Conduct  2 Corruption  3 Pressure groups  4 Customer Service  5 Strategy for emerging markets  6 R&D  7 Climate change  8 Green Design  9 Green Retail    10Environmental management  11 Materials used  12 Energy  13 Water  14 Spills  15 Waste  16 Emissions  17 Human Rights  18 Supply Chain integrity    19 Product safety  20 Labour practices  21 Attracting and retaining talent  22 Developing human capital  23 Labour relations  24 Occupational health and safety    25 Local community development  26 Social action investment  27 Commitment to and dialogue with stakeholders  28 Responsible advertising Materiality Matrix  - 258 - annex: sustainability balance sheet  2011 2010 Customers Number internal buyer training programmes 678 110 Number of chemical analyses >250,000 >70,000 Employees Total number of employees 109,512 100,138 - % men  20.5% 19.5% - % women 79.5% 80.5% Total sustainability team  2,023 1,128 - Internal team 62 39 - External team 1,961 1,089  Suppliers  Number of active suppliers 1,398 1,337 Number of "A" suppliers (Complies with the Code of Conduct) 573 531 Number of "B" suppliers (Breaches a non-relevant aspect of the Code of Conduct) 501 447 Number of "C" suppliers (Breaches a sensitive aspect of the Code of Conduct) 183 179 Number of "D" suppliers (Breaches a critical aspect of the Code of Conduct) 107 146 Number of PR suppliers 34 34 Number of discarded suppliers 92 127 Number of social audits 2,379 1,087 Number of initial audits  818 765 Number of monitoring audits 267 322 Number of special audits 1,294 0 Number of external audits 1,698 422 Number of internal audits 681 665 Number of joint Inditex-ITGLWF interventions 3 3 Community  Number of social investment beneficiary programmes 645,367 500,000 Social investments made (euros) 13,539,472 11,368,207 - Total community development programmes 2,701,873 1,866,936 - Total monitoring programmes 3,307,667 3,307,666 - Total university network 715,509 1,209,762 - Total sponsorship and patronage 3,514,423 4,909,665 - Total emergency programmes 2,300,000 74,178 - Employment programme 1,000,000 - Number of Social Council meetings 3 1 Shareholders  Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes score (out of 100) 85/100 76/100 FTSE4Good score 4.3/5 n.a.

Energy and climate change  The Inditex strategy for climate change involves analysis  of the implications of this phenomenon on the Inditex  business model and identifies the associated risks and  opportunities. The strategy is designed to quantify and  manage Inditex greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The  objective is to reduce GHG emission 20% by 2020.  In order to do that, we have defined four complementary  activities: — Measurement and management of the Inditex  carbon footprint, scope 1, 2, and 3. — Implementation of activities targeting GHG  emissions reduction in all 2011-2015 lines of work. — Launch activities that help compensate for GHG  emissions. — Sensitization and training. 2. Water management  This strategy will reduce and optimize use of water all  along the Inditex value chain. Specific strategy objectives: — Measurement and management of the water  footprint. — Implementation of master plans for audits and  diagnostics in offices, our own factories, the supply chain,  logistics centres and stores. — Reduce and optimize water consumption — Sensitization and training. 3. Chemical and toxin control  The objective of this strategy is to identify, control, and  improve environmental management of chemist in  textile industrial processes in our own and our suppliers  factories.  4. Natural resources and biodiversity  The objective of this strategy is to promote efficient use  of natural resources, while at the same time supporting  biodiversity protection. This also has positive influence  on other issues like climate change, water quality and  reuse, food safety, etc. It increases the use of sustainable  materials in manufacturing and sales of our products.  Environmental indicators The Inditex system of indicators shows the environmental  impact the Group has in terms of consuming natural  resources, using energy, generating waste, and generating  emissions to the atmosphere. These indicators are  expressed in line with the number of garments introduced  into the market. This reflects the efficiency of all areas  of the company (manufacturing, main office, chain  main offices, logistic centres and stores). These relative  indicators show that greenhouse gasses (GHG) have been  significantly reduced and also reflect the success seen  from integrating innovative environmental management  into all phases of the business. Greenhouse gas emissions are calculated as indicated in  Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2007,  from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC), and the WBCSD/WRI GHG Protocol (2008) for  different types of energy: — Natural gas: 0.2021 Kg CO2eq/kWh — Propane: 3.050 Kg CO2eq/kWh — Diesel: 2.686 Kg CO2eq/kWh — Electricity from the grid: 0.3497 Kg CO2eq/kWh The values used in the ratios are the following: Ratio = (absolute value of the year/number of  garments put on the market during the year) x 1000. All indicators reflect data from 1 January through   31 December, 2011 Garments introduced into the market 1,000,000,000 800,000,000 400,000,000 200,000,000 600,000,000 0 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 835,524,467 815,600,537 767,756,829 696,961,736 627,295,102  - 260 - annex: sustainability balance sheet  - environmental indicators Energy consumption  Overall energy consumption of Inditex Group facilities,  expressed in Terajoules (TJ), comes from the use of fossil  fuels (natural gas, propane, and diesel) and electricity  from the grid, this consumption includes all factories,  the central office, chain main offices, logistic centres,  and Group stores. It does not include diesel consumption  pertaining to logistics activities carried out by external  operators (scope 3).

Tri-generation plants consisting of heating and process  boilers, solar panels, and wind generators now make up  more than 50% of the energy provided at the central office  and factories. Logistics centres and transport  All the garments manufactured by Inditex are distributed  from the logistics centres. During recent years, Inditex  has increased automation for distribution operations  at the logistics centres reducing use of fossil fuels.  Consequently there has been an increase in electricity  consumed per garment introduced into the market (Wh/ garment). In order to meet the objective of on-going  reduction of greenhouse gases per garment as compared  to 2005, the 2011-15 Inditex Sustainable Environmental  Strategy includes energy efficiency initiatives for logistics  centres.  - 261 - annual report 2011 Overall consumption of natural gas (toe)1 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 10,500 9,500 10,000 9,000 8,500 8,000 8,873 9,303 9,900 9,797 8,446 Overall consumption of diesel (toe)1 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 900 600 750 450 300 150 246 321 467 738 806 Consumption of natural gas (toe)2 2008 2009 2010 2011 9,000 6,000 7,500 4,500 3,000 1,500 6,685 6,425 8,382 8,374 Consumption of diesel (toe)2 2008 2009 2010 2011 500 400 300 200 100 98 154 243 440 Natural gas consumption (toe)2 2008 2009 2010 2011 3,000 2,000 2,500 1,500 1,000 500 2,158 2,878 1,517 1,422 Diesel consumption (toe)2 2008 2009 2010 2011 300 200 250 150 100 50 149 168 224 (1) Toe: Tonne of oil equivalent = 41.868 GJ , 103 m3 of natural gas = 0.9315 toe, 1 tonne of diesel = 1.035 toe (2) Only four years of history is provided because in prior years the data was grouped and unavailable broken down by these activities.  - 262 - annex: sustainability balance sheet  - environmental indicators Stores Electricity consumption at stores is without a doubt  very important, meaning that a great deal of effort has  been made to continue improving the eco-efficient  store model. The objective is to achieve a reduction in  electricity consumption per garment of 20% before 2020.  Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the efficiency  measures applied since 2005 have made it possible to  contain consumption and reduce relative consumption  measured in watts-h per garment.

Emissions associated with the  transport of garments to stores by external logistics  operators are included here. Emissions produced by the  supply (suppliers) chain have not been accounted for.  - 264 - annex: sustainability balance sheet  - environmental indicators Next, we present the change in Inditex Group GHG  emissions produced during the last five years. All  operations under control of the Inditex Group are  included. GHG emissions associated with the supply  (suppliers) chain are not included. We calculate the GHG resulting from distribution and  logistics operations carried out by external logistics  operators based on the vehicles used to transport the  product (scope 3). Said emissions have been calculated  based on the weight of the product shipped and the  number of kilometres travelled by each mode of transport.  The following emission coefficients, as proposed by GHG  Protocol, are used: — Kg of CO2 /km  truck=0.87 — Kg of CO2 /km  plane short flight(<452Km)=2.071 — Kg. of CO2 /km  plane on medium-length flight  (between 452 and 1,600 km) = 1.4388 — Kg of CO2 /plane on long flight(>1,600Km)=0.6649 — Kg of CO2 /km ship=0.035 Finally, we include data referring to GHG emissions by  garment introduced into the market as an efficiency ratio. Other atmospheric emissions Annual change in other emissions from manufacturing  and logistics centres  This includes the central headquarters, all Inditex  factories, the head offices of chains, and logistics centres.

This initiative,  in addition to financial savings, provides an important  environmental benefit by reducing natural resource  consumption, atmospheric emissions, and the amount of  waste generated. Single use alarms that have not been replaced yet are recycled  to create appliqus and clips used in packaging footwear. In  2011 more than 400 tonnes of alarms were recycled. The difference seen in the recycling of single use alarms  in 2011 as compared to 2010 is owing to the introduction  of re-usable alarms.  - 269 - annual report 2011 Related urban waste data as a function of  no. of  garments introduced on the market (g/garment) 12 10 8 2 4 6 0 2011 0.85 8.34 9.23 1.7 1.67 0.5 0.6 2.24 2.69 2010 1.19 8.33 1.83 0.78 0.74 2009 1.18 8.14 1.07 0.52 2.74 2008 1.73 9.94 1.39 0.53 2007 2.12 Recycled alarms (kg) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2,500,000 2,000,000 1,000,000 1,500,000 500,000 428,930 1,817,500 2,215,360 2,124,780 1,343,720 Consumption and use of water  Water supply at all the centres for both processes and for  consumption comes from public and authorised supply  networks with the result that Inditex has no impact on  protected habitats.  Most water consumed in the commercial network is for  domestic use - mainly cleaning and basic consumption.  For this reason it is impossible to recycle it. In the area of  industrial activities, water is mainly needed for generating  steam and for industrial refrigeration in a closed cycle,  where recirculation systems are used.  Waste water from all of our sites is dumped into sewage  systems, with the relevant administrative authorisation  in all cases. This assumes that analysis is done  periodically to guarantee compliance with current law  and to detect possible maintenance problems. The only  incident that occurred in 2011 was an accidental spill in  the Indipunt factor sewage system in Narn (A Corua).  Considered a minor infraction by the Administration,  the fine was only 5,000 euros. The amount of waste  water is estimated to be the same as water consumed.  There are no productive processes that consume water  and the cooling systems are on a closed cycle. In order  to better use water, the Indipunt factory facilities are  implementing a waste water purifier that can purify  90% of water used.

In the case of stores, the data was obtained by sampling utility  bills for a group of stores and extrapolating the total stores from them. 3.52  - 270 - annex: sustainability balance sheet  - environmental indicators Annual generation of common dangerous  waste  Batteries (Kg) 1,500 1,250 750 1,000 250 500 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 470 755 1,383 855 1,318 Office waste (Kg) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 12,000 8,000 10,000 4,000 6,000 2,000 10,577 2,052 4,687 10,606 4,189 Oil filters (Kg) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 8,000 4,000 6,000 2,000 1,184 327 394 901 6,902 Contaminating metallic packaging (Kg) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 800 600 200 400 465 280 645 358 577 Contaminated absorbents (kg) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 500 1,000 1,820 1,829 1,527 1,984 2,618 Paint (Kg) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 500 400 200 300 100 443 245 315 196 180  - 271 - annual report 2011 Fluorescents (Kg) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 5,000 3,000 4,000 1,000 2,000 4,707 1,594 1,145 1,801 1,874 Used mineral oil (Kg) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 20,000 10,000 15,000 5,000 15,752 2,715 1,892 5,706 237 Contaminated plastic packaging (Kg) 3,000 2,000 1,000 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2,528 749 2,449 1,554 1,886 Waste allocation according to its type   and treatment  As the last step of the Waste Minimization Plan, all  waste generated by Inditex is collected and managed by  a legally authorised entity that will send the waste for  recycling (in the case of alarms or paper), for composting  or processing (wood, plastics), or it will be taken care of  in an environmentally friendly way.  With respect to the recovery of products released on the  market, it is not viable to evaluate the volume generated  nor its management on a worldwide level, given that  there is no collection system or specific management for  textile materials. The packaging materials released onto the market  (cardboard and plastic bags, labels, protective elements)  associated with the products marketed by Inditex, are  appropriately managed by authorised agents. Inditex  adheres to the available Integrated Management  Systems for Packaging and Wrapping in every country it  operates in. The commitment to these systems means  that each Inditex chain pays a not-for-profit management  agency whatever it costs to collect and manage the waste  generated by the stores. This management agency is  established with the recognition of the authorities of each  country (in Spain, Ecoembes) to ensure that the waste  generated by the stores is suitably collected, managed  and recycled.

The organisation is made  up different groups of entities involved in rendering  accounts in order to create a common framework of  integrated reporting. Transparency being the pillar of its relationship with the  society, Inditex has followed since the publication of its  first Sustainability Report back in 2002 the G3 guidelines  of Global Reporting Initiative. In addition to the main  indicators of the G3 guidelines, specific indicators for the  textile and footwear sector have been added, in whose  drafting Inditex has taken part, and they are identified  as follows:  Specific indicator for the sector    Specific comment of the indicator for the sector In order to define the most relevant contents of this  Sustainability Report, Inditex has carried out an internal  deliberation process based upon the results achieved  through the direct dialogue with its stakeholders;  the participation in venues within the industry; the  identification of sustainability challenges within he  sector, etc., Therefore, the preparation process of this  report renders it easier to meet the principles set by GRI  to define the contents thereof.  GRI further requires that the reporting organisation  would apply the following principles regarding quality of  information: - Balance: This report addresses both positive  and negative issues regarding the performance of the  organization, which allows a reasonable assessment  by its stakeholders of the general performance of the  company  - Comparability: Information disclosed in the  report has been consolidated and reported in a consistent  and comparable manner. Stakeholders are thus offered  the chance to review the evolution of the performance of  the organisation and compare it with the previous reports  or with other companies within the sector. The report also  records any significant change in the scope or calculation  methodology used. - Accuracy: Inditex considers that the information  provided shows the level of detail required to meet the  expectations of its stakeholders. - Timeliness: The report is disclosed every year  together with the publication of the legal documentation  of the Group - Clarity: The Group works continuously with  the goal of disclosing the information with clarity and  meeting the expectations of its stakeholders, by avoiding  the use of too technical terminology, by providing  explanations where it is deemed more appropriate, and  by contextualising the information provided. - Reliability: The 2011 Annual Report has been  verified by SGS, according to ISO 19011. Likewise, a range of eleven relevant indicators have been  reviewed by KPMG pursuant to ISAE 3000 Standard.  These indicators have been picked out based upon a risks  review procedure, which has enabled to identify the most  relevant issues for the stakeholders, also considering the  information available on the Report. The global compacts principles  Inditex has adhered to United Nations Global Compact. In  the GRI index of this Report, which also serves as Report  on Progress, the different parts of the document linked to  each of the Global Compact Principles are covered.  Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the  protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Principle 2: Businesses should make sure that they are  not complicit in human rights abuses.    Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of  association and the effective recognition of the right to  collective bargaining. Principle 4: Businesses should uphold the elimination of  all forms of forced and compulsory labour. Principle 5: Businesses should uphold the effective  abolition of child labour. Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of  discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary  approach to environmental challenges. Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to  promote greater environmental responsibility. Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development  and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.
