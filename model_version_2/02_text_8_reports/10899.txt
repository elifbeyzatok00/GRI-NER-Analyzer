MESSAGE FROM CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER    The ARaymond family-owned enterprise, founded in 1865, is definitely focused on the  long-term.    Sustainable development is, for our organisation settled in 23 countries, a key issue, as  far as our success is fully backed by human beings. Their level of engagement is directly  linked to the capacity of our company to generate sustainable added value and sense.    We consider the well-being of our employees as a major competitive ingredient.    A high level of innovation requests a lot a trust and belief in our enterprise.    Strong values, including the respect of life on our planet, are fully aligned with our  ambition to transmit the development of our company to future generations.    Our commitment is to contribute to the reduction of energy consumption, of CO2  emissions and of pollutions of any kind.    We want, everywhere in our enterprise, to leverage the motivation, the engagement and  the realisation of our colleagues through a better meaning and well-being.      Antoine RAYMOND  CEO         Global Compact – COP REPORT – ARAYMOND – 2010  Page 3 of 11  ACTIONS    Why running a global Carbon Footprint analysis of the ARaymond France activities?  Because it makes sense   -  From a company point of view:  o Risk management versus increasing energy prices  o Anticipate coming legal aspects: Carbon Tax  o Sense-making topic for the employees  o   -  From an environmental point of view:  o Fight against global warming means to reduce the green house gas – GHG- emissions: How to combine economic activity with a reduction of  the carbon footprint?  o Where to put our efforts? Identify the levers to activate, searching for  the maximum results    On the ARaymond Group level we have decided to use the Bilan Carbonemethod  as:  -  It is the official method used in France with funds from the government  -  This methodology is about to become the international standard for GHG  reduction  -  Its scope is very large considering the in-house activity, the incoming goods  and services, the final usage and the waste management – see picture below.         Global Compact – COP REPORT – ARAYMOND – 2010  Page 4 of 11          In 2010 the Bilan Carbone has been performed for the 4 sites of ARaymond  France.  This work has been done with the help of an external engineering office Climat  Mundi.  The decision was to perform four separate Bilan Carbone, one per site and merge  all those together in order to keep a detailed vision of the specific activities:  -  1 production site for metal parts based in Grenoble  -  1 production site for plastic injection and assembly based in Saint-Egrve  -  1 logistics and administrative centre based in the south of Grenoble  -  1 sales office based in Paris    The study roll-out follows the steps:    1. Define scope of the study  2. Data acquisition  3. Carbon footprint calculation  4. Workshops on selected topic  5. Set up action plans  6. Follow up action plans and correct if needed    By end of December 2010 we have finished step 5.          RESULTS    Here comes the ranking of the global emission sources for ARaymond France:    1. Use of the product.  2. Impact of the waste treatment  3. Material incomes  4. Energy consumption  5. Transport of goods and people                         Global Compact – COP REPORT – ARAYMOND – 2010  Page 5 of 11      Use of the product    This ranking highlighted how vulnerable the automotive activity is regarding the fuel  price increase! The Bilan Carbone enables us to simulate, for ARaymond, the  economical impact of the different oil barrel cost hypothesis.    The hypothesis made was to make a ratio of the weight of the ARaymond parts  versus the global car weight and calculate the average equivalent fuel consumption  for a global mileage/life time of a vehicule.  Huge impact, which is out of our scope but gives ideas for weight reduction.        Having a closer look at the in-house activity, gives the following ranking:       Global Compact – COP REPORT – ARAYMOND – 2010  Page 6 of 11      The precision of the data acquired enabled us to have an approach:  -  by French site (production, logistics,)  -  by category (energy, raw materials,)    These figures led us to choose 4 topics for ARaymond France specific workshops:    1) Raw materials  2) Energy  3) Freight  4) People transportation    Those workshops where organized with the relevant company experts with the help  of the engineering office. All ideas were collected through brainstorm sessions.  Afterwards, a ranking was defined and emission reduction targets were set.  Some ideas: Implement Eco-Designing of the parts developed (weight reduction,  green materials), introduce environmental aspects in the purchasing criteria to  promote green suppliers, establish an intercompany car pooling    The potential GHG reduction was calculated through the adaptation of the Bilan  Carbone tool.  - screenshot GHG reduction -     Global Compact – COP REPORT – ARAYMOND – 2010  Page 7 of 11      Our estimation shows a potential mid-term reduction (within the next 3 years, rated  to the same volume of production) of 15% of the global amount of GHG emissions  in ARaymond France.    The challenges for the year 2011 are:  -  Point 6: Follow up action plans and correct if needed, in ARaymond France  and,  -  Perform the Bilan Carbone analysis of the 2 sites from ARaymond Germany,  before spreading it through the ARaymond group.

ACTIONS    Data analysis  We highlighted in the Communication on Progress last year that our female  employees have approximately the same access to trainings and internal  promotions as male employees. However, we realised that the average salary of  women was inferior to the average salary of men.     In November 2010, a deeper study was conducted with the help of all companies of  our network to identify where this gap comes from. 3 possible causes have been  investigated:  -  In the same jobs, are men and women benefiting from comparable levels of  salary?  HR correspondents were asked to identify the jobs in which there are  various men and various women and to compare their salaries.    -  Are there as many female as male employees in every level of hierarchy?  Each HR correspondent considered 4 subgroups named top management,  middle management,  expert workers, workers (defined locally not to  introduce cultural biases),  and gave the proportion of men and women in  each of these groups.    -  On a similar level of degree and duration of professional experience, are male  and female employees on a similar level of jobs in the management scale?  On the sample of people whose highest degree is a bachelors degree or  local equivalent, the repartition between the same 4 hierarchical groups  than upper was studied.     Global Compact – COP REPORT – ARAYMOND – 2010  Page 9 of 11      RESULTS      The main conclusions are:  -  In similar jobs, it appears that the median salary of men is globally 4%  higher than the salary of women. Even though we will keep on paying  attention to this slight difference, we can conclude that this is not where the  difference comes from.  -  Males are more represented in the high levels of hierarchy. Amongst the total  population  o  4% of male employees and 1,2% of female employees have reached a  job in the top management  o 8,7% of male and 4,8% of female are in middle management  o 48,2% of male and 38,5% of female are senior / expert workers  o 39,1% of male and 55,5% of female are workers and employees at the  lowest level in the management scale  -  The data using the criteria of length of experience was not relevant enough.  -  Amongst the population who graduated from a bachelor's degree, a median  of :  o 25% of the total population are in middle management and top  management  o 39% of men are in middle management and top management  o 8% of women are in middle management and top management       The main difference explaining that womens salaries are in general lower than  mens salaries comes from the fact that women are mainly present in the lower  levels of hierarchy.      Actions taken in 2010    These results have been presented to all HR correspondents in November 2010, and  discussed. They are very aware of the issues of gender equity, diversity and non  discrimination, and that they should be promoting it locally.    Within the ARaymond Network, there are many examples of promotions of  women. In the US, there are three recent examples of promotions of women to a  highest position: from worker to supervisor, supervisor to manager, based upon  competencies. The growth of A. Raymond China allows promotions to leading /  managing positions to their employees. A. Raymond Brazil works on its hierarchical  structure through competencies first, also to make sure they are blind on gender  when they implement training and development plans.             Global Compact – COP REPORT – ARAYMOND – 2010  Page 10 of 11    We tend to involve more and more the local HR professionals in the selection  process for recruitments and promotions: they guarantee that recruitments and  promotions are blind on gender. Also, the systematic internal posting of job  vacancies within the whole ARaymond Network is being developed, to allow any  employee to feel free to apply.    Women themselves sometimes report that they would prefer not to have higher  responsibilities because they fear it might not be easy to balance with their personal  and family life. Consequently, there is also a tendency to develop more  flexibility in the time schedule, including for management positions: A. Raymond  Tecniacero in Spain.    Some of the ARaymond companies have developed complete plans to work  on gender equity. A. Raymond SARL in France has planned to work on specific  actions:  1) Act on external causes of inequality and change mentalities.   Attract more young girls in our industrial jobs by welcoming them for  periods of training or visits    2) Fight stereotypes.   Increasing people awareness about gender dimension   Promoting the advantages of diversity    3) Develop better harmony between lifetimes   Planning professional interviews before and after parental leaves   Proposing more flexible timetables    4) Increase diversity in our recruitments   Ensuring possibility for part-time workers to work full-time   Opening recruitment sources towards women networks   Increasing external partners' awareness about advantages of diversity and  among our engagements towards professional equality    5) Encourage women's integration in industry   Proposing a code of conduct which avoids sexist remarks and behaviours   Increasing the quality of working conditions with our ergonomist and the  Health department    6) Ensure equal opportunities of career for men and women   Making sure that people who come back from parental leave receive the  general salary increases   Making professional interviews after parental leaves   Creating links between the different activities that enable professional  mobility, thanks to training and HR planning             Global Compact – COP REPORT – ARAYMOND – 2010  Page 11 of 11        Results of the Global Employee Opinion Survey    In December 2010, the first Global Employee Opinion survey was conducted within  the ARaymond Network. All the data was processed by experts of these kinds of  surveys.    The results help us analyse the topics related to Gender Equity. Some questions are  directly linked to the issues that can cause the difference between men and women  as mentioned above.    It is interesting to study two items which were part of this Global Survey:  my work schedule allows sufficient flexibility to meet my personal / family needs  I believe I have the opportunity for personal development and growth in my  company    On both, the statistical analysis done shows no significant difference between the  responses of men and the responses of women globally.       The ARaymond Network will continue the efforts to reinforce the awareness of all  employees on the topic of Gender Equity, and would like to encourage women to  feel free to target higher positions. We have to keep in mind that it will remain their  own decision to show their interest for such evolutions.
