Submitted to United Nations Global Compact  January 17, 2011                2          BDP INTERNATIONAL, INC.  2010 Communication on Progress      I.  EXECUTIVE STATEMENT  I am proud to present BDPs first Communication on Progress (COP) report.  BDP is  committed to good corporate citizenship in the global community.  This report reinforces  our commitment to ensuring the UN Global Compact and its principles are part of BDPs  strategy, culture, and day-to-day operations.  One of BDP's most valuable assets is its  integrity.  Protecting this asset is the job of everyone in BDP.  To that end, we also expect  that those with whom we do business (including our agents, consultants, suppliers and  customers) will also adhere to our guiding principles, and the principles of the UN Global  Compact.   As a new member of the UN Global Compact, we will continue to  communicate and advance these principles within our own organization and sphere of  influence.    Sincerely,    Richard J. Bolte, Jr.  President & CEO    II.  BACKGROUND    BDP International, Inc. (BDP), founded in 1966, is one of the leading privately held  freight logistics/transportation management firms based in the United States.  It operates  freight logistics centers in more than 20 cities throughout North America and a network  of subsidiaries, joint ventures and strategic partnerships in 122 countries.  The company  serves more than 4,000 customers worldwide.     BDP provides a range of services, including ocean, air and ground transportation; lead  logistics process analysis, design and management; export freight forwarding; import  customs  clearance  and  regulatory  compliance;  project  logistics;  warehousing/consolidation/distribution; and web-based shipping transaction/tracking  management systems.       3      III.  ANTI-CORRUPTION  BDP is committed to full compliance with both the letter and spirit of the laws and  regulations in all countries in which it operates.  It is of the utmost importance to BDP to  conduct its business with integrity in accordance with the BDP Code of Conduct and  applicable laws and regulations.        A. PRINCIPLE 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms,  including extortion and bribery.    i. Policy: BDP operates under a global Code of Business Conduct and  Ethics. The Code applies to every officer, director and employee of BDP.  We also expect that those with whom we do business (including our  agents, consultants, suppliers and customers) will also adhere to the Code.    The Code prohibits bribery in any form including extortion, facilitating  payments, kickbacks, political contributions, and the offer or receipt of  gifts, hospitality or entertainment. The Code also ensures that BDP  maintain complete and accurate financial records and make annual  antibribery training available for all principals, key employees involved in  sales, marketing, and procurement.    ii. Appointment of FCPA Compliance Officer: In 2010, BDP appointed an  FCPA Compliance Office who is responsible for the management and  implementation of the FCPA Compliance Program.  This includes the  establishment, development and maintenance of the compliance program  and the communication of these standards to all current and prospective  business partners and employees.  The FCPA Compliance Officer will  also be responsible for periodic reporting on the effectiveness of the  program through the implementation of a monitoring and auditing system  to detect criminal conduct.    iii. Training: BDPs Legal Team is in the process of a global FCPA (Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act) training initiative. The training consists of a  webinar accompanied by a detailed PowerPoint presentation on the anti- bribery provisions of the Act and BDPs compliance program. Employees  are then tested on their knowledge of the FCPA compliance, and must  score at least an 80% to pass the training.  Certifications are then sent to  employees for their signature that states that they have completed the     4    training, and will adhere to BDPs compliance program.  All original  certifications are kept in our legal files.    Our goal is to have all principals, key employees involved in sales,  marketing, and procurement certified in FCPA compliance by the 2nd  quarter of 2011.    iv. Hotline: In conjunction with the company-wide issuance of the BDP Code  of Conduct and Anti-Bribery Policies, BDP has implemented a telephone  hotline to be used in the event that someone becomes aware of any facts  surrounding a transaction that might be suspicious and give rise to a  violation of our Code of Conduct.  Calls can be made anonymously and  directly to BDP Management. The hotline number is posted in the policies  as well as the BDP website.      v. Due Diligence: Included in BDPs Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  is a section on Due Diligence in Selecting International Consultants,  Intermediaries and Joint Venture Partners. This section provides  executives and employees with information on identifying proper business  partners, required disclosures and the final approval process.     vi. Contract Provisions: The Code also holds a section detailing contract  provisions  and  certification  requirements  for  our  consultants,  intermediaries and joint venture partners. The provisions require that all  parties involved are fully compliant with both the Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act (FCPA) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD) Convention along with all other laws and  companys compliance procedures. They also list out accounting and  financial provisions, reporting requirements, disclosure information and  termination information for non-compliance.    The certification terms require each consultant, intermediary and joint  venture partner periodically certify that he or she:   Understands the FCPA (and OECD Convention)   Has not violated or caused the company to violate the FCPA  (and/or OECD Convention) since the date of the prior periodic  certification   Does not know or have reason to believe that any other person  retained by the company has violated the FCPA (and/or OECD     5    Convention), or caused the company to violate them since the date  of the prior certification   Will immediately advise a named official of the company if the  certifying person should learn of or have reason to believe there  has been any violation of the FCPA (and/or OECD Convention) in  connection with the companys business    IV.  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION  BDP recognizes that the world's natural resources are limited and fragile. BDP considers  environmental protection to be consistent with its overall goals and values and an  important consideration in its total activities. This commitment to environmental  protection is reflected in our policies, programs and practices for conducting operations  in an environmentally, as well as economically responsible manner.    A. PRINCIPLE 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to  environmental challenges.    i. Policy: In 2010, BDP established a Corporate Environmental Policy  which outlines the responsibilities of all BDP employees and procedures  to be followed by all BDP offices worldwide.      ii. BDP Go Green Program: In conjunction with an initiative to support the  growth of our next generation of leaders within BDP, the Go Green BDP  program was formed in 2010 by employees who are looking to make BDP  more environmentally friendly.  The Go Green BDP program was  designed to motivate employees to recognize and take responsibility for  their environmental impact in the workplace.  This team works together to  create programs and initiatives that will help employees be more  environmentally conscious, in the areas of energy conservation, paper  reduction, recycling, reusable glassware and utensils, and transit.  Currently, we are pleased to report the following achievements:     Developed and launched an Environmental Awareness Plan in all  of our US offices   Secured an e-signed commitment from 324 US employees to  recognize and participate in our energy conservation program   Eliminated paper waste by 2-3% as a result of paper recycling,  double sided printing, electronic billing  and increased utilization  of DMS     6     Decreased paper cup usage by 50% in each office   Provided all US employees with public transit and bike commuter  information for their respective city/state    B. PRINCIPLE 8:  Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater  environmental responsibility.    i. Memberships and Responsible Care Partnership: As a logistics service  provider, BDP is committed to managing its supply chain effectively to  promote increased sustainability. BDP is an active member of the  American Chemical Council (ACC) and the Chemical Distribution  Institute (CDI), a European-based global source for data, information and  advice specific to marine transportation and storage of chemical products.  In 2008, BDP became a member of the American Chemistry Councils  Responsible Care Partnership Program, which is the chemical industry's  global voluntary initiative under which companies, through their national  associations, work together to continuously improve their health, safety  and environmental performance, and communicate with stakeholders  about their products and processes in the manufacture and supply of safe  and affordable goods that bring real benefits to society.  As a Partner in  the American Chemistry Councils Responsible Care initiative, BDP  pledges to operate our business according to the following guiding  principles:     To lead our companies in ethical ways that increasingly benefit  society, the economy and the environment;   To design and develop products that can be manufactured,  transported, used and disposed of or recycled safely;   To work with customers, carriers, suppliers, distributors and  contractors to foster the safe and secure use, transport and  disposal of chemicals and provide hazard and risk information  that can be accessed and applied in their operations and  products;   To design and operate our facilities in a safe, secure and  environmentally sound manner;   To instill a culture throughout all levels of our organizations to  continually identify, reduce and manage process safety risks;     7     To promote pollution prevention, minimization of waste and  conservation of energy and other critical resources at every  stage of the life cycle of our products;   To cooperate with governments at all levels and organizations  in the development of effective and efficient safety, health,  environmental and security laws regulations and standards;   To support education and research on the health, safety,  environmental effects and security of our products and  processes;   To communicate product, service, and process risks to our  stakeholders and listen to and consider their perspectives;   To make continual progress towards our goal of no accidents,  injuries or harm to human health and the environment from our  products and operations and openly report our health, safety,  environmental and security performance;   To seek continual improvement in our integrated Responsible  Care Management System to address environmental, health,  safety and security performance; and   To promote Responsible Care by encouraging and assisting  others to adhere to these guiding principles.    ii. Responsible Supply Chain: Collaborating with both the ACC and CDI,  BDP helped align and apply the two organizations management system  standards to its global headquarters to assess existing protocols and  identify opportunities for improvement. The audit covered a wide range of  policies with specific performance goals, including use of qualified  contractors and vendors throughout the supply chain; risk analysis of  business processes for priority-setting; and an organizational structure that  provides for top-down ownership of the safe, secure movement of  hazardous materials.    iii. REACH: BDP is also active in promoting compliance with REACH  (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) which is the  European Unions single regulatory system for chemical management. As  an Only Representative, BDP is qualified to aid its customers, clients and  suppliers. In this role BDP can:      Evaluate risks and exposure associated with REACH;     8     Maintain all communications and negotiations with ECHA and  all relevant Member State governmental bodies;   Identify and communicate with all importers, distributors and  downstream users;   Prepare and submit the technical registration dossier;   Make the filings, register the chemicals, and pay all attendant  fees;   Coordinate data exchange and testing strategies with SIEF  group and Consortium members;   Create and submit safety data sheets and chemical safety  reports; and   Audit and train internally as well as our customer base where  needed;   Prepare notification of substances of very high concern;   Address classification and labeling; and   Perform any other obligations resulting from authorizations or  restrictions.    C. PRINCIPLE 9: Businesses should encourage the diffusion and development of  environmentally friendly technologies.    i. Electronic  Document  Management:  The  newly  implemented  application, Document Management System (DMS), is an important  initiative within BDP to become entirely paperless.  DMS allows systems  users to schedule documents to be delivered by email, FTP, or fax.  Many  documents that once were printed on a daily basis can now be  automatically sent and seen by customers in a virtual folder.      ii. Paperless Marketing Communications: In addition to the execution of  our DMS application, all of our marketing communications are now being  transmitted electronically.  Our customers can register to receive weekly  newsletters and business updates via email, rather than in paper form.  Our  electronic marketing newsletters and our new paperless document  application, DMS, enables BDP to move in the right direction in becoming  a more environmentally conscious company.
