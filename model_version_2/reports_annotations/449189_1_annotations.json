This  message was written in an extremely difficult year for everyone, as we are still  experiencing an unprecedented pandemic crisis that has permanently changed  our daily lives.  The well-being of our customers and people has always been our first priority.  NBG adjusted quickly, leading change during the pandemic, emphasizing  cooperation, planning and enhancing digital transformation. We have invoked  our business continuity plans to help ensure the safety and well-being of our  staff, as well as our capability to support our customers and maintain our  business operations.  Our swift actions - targeted at responding to this stress test that the majority of  companies had to endure - will be presented in more detail in our 2020  Sustainability Report, however it is worth mentioning that we managed to  introduce many functional changes for both employees and customers.  Indicatively, it should be mentioned that we provided employees with remote  access to our systems, which proved pivotal in safeguarding the health and  safety not only of our people, but also society in general. At the same time we  significantly accelerated our digital strategy and offered digital products and  services addressing the needs of our customer base, while in parallel minimising  cyber risk. The ability to act promptly and effectively during early 2020 sprung from our  successful change during the previous year. NBG achieved a major turnaround in  2019, led by a dynamic and committed new management team. Indeed, 2019 was  the first full year of implementation of the Transformation Program, whose  ambitious goals are to address the legacy issues of the bank, as well as the  challenges faced by the banking sector overall. Our goal is to have a clean  balance sheet and become a modern and profitable bank by 2022 and the Greek  Bank of First Choice.  Today, the Banks commitment to its long-term strategic planning - based on  respect for human and labor rights, the protection of the environment,  transparency and effective governance throughout its operations - is more vital  than ever for the achievement of a robust balance sheet and the creation of long- term value leading the way to a sustainable future for all. For our people, we aim to score high in the fields of providing equal  opportunities, a safe and attractive working environment, while we protect  working relationships within an environment of mutual trust and constructive  cooperation. NBG recognizes the significance of its people as a key factor for  evolution and business success. We make sure to provide training and  development opportunities to our people, but also to ensure that equal  opportunities and diversity are protected. Almost half of our total headcount are  women while 28% are in Top Management positions and we are proud of this  gender-balanced workforce.    For our customers, we need to be responsible for maintaining and improving our  performance in all fields. This translates to a dual target for the Bank: on the one  hand keeping abreast of technological developments, accelerating digital offering,  enhancing competitiveness and using innovation in promoting products and  services; and on the other hand performing these tasks in the most environmentally,  and socially responsible way.  For society, we continued for yet another year to undertake a multitude of actions  with a view of contributing substantially to boosting economic growth and social  development, while conserving the Greek heritage through our Cultural Foundation  and our Historical Archive. Moreover, we invested in efforts to enhance health,  education, sport and social welfare services, thereby improving the quality of life for  the public as a whole.  For the environment, we focused on investment initiatives presenting innovation  and strong know-how, as well as on financing research programs for technologies  that contribute to the countrys efforts to improve its environmental footprint. We  increased remarkably our financial support to the Renewable Energy Resources  sector and regular management of urban and industrial waste, which contribute to a  reduction in CO2 emissions.  Furthermore, we aimed to increase NBGs energy  efficiency and to decrease its energy consumption, thus reducing its environmental  footprint.   The NBG Group, with its unique tradition, reputation, pioneering role and significant  contribution to the economic and social transformation of Greece, and above all  with the solid and long-standing trust of its shareholders, customers, and  employees, serves and will continue to serve in the future as a pillar of stability and  confidence of the Greek economy and society, always aiming to contribute to a  more sustainable development. Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability  are integral parts of our philosophy, and we will be constantly taking new initiatives  in the context of fully integrating CSR principles and ESG criteria and risks into our  activities.   In conclusion, I have no doubt that in this extremely difficult period, NBG will live up  to its history and play a critical role in supporting the economy and society in these  challenging times.

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK Basic Principles and Group Risk  Management Governance Framework  Group Risk management at NBG has a  structured and tiered approach, based on  a number of governance bodies, internal  policies and procedures, and controls  framework.  Risk management and control plays a  fundamental role in the overall strategy  of the Group, aiming on one hand at  the substantial risk management for  the Organization, and on the other at  the harmonization with the legal and  regulatory requirements.  The Group has clearly defined the risk  profile and the risk appetite framework  and has designed the strategy and the  policy for their management. The Board of Directors bears ultimate  accountability for NBGs risk position.  It signs off the risk strategy and risk  appetite, and monitors the effectiveness  of risk governance and management  advised by its two specialized  committees: the Board Risk Committee  (BRC) and the Board Audit Committee.

Detailed description of the responsibilities,  composition and operation of the Committee is  available on the Banks website www.nbg.gr/en,  section: Group / Corporate Governance / Board  of Directors / Committees. Three lines of defense Model The Groups risk management is based on  the internationally established principle of  the three lines of defense:  First line  The risk-taking Units (e.g. credit Units, Treasury) are responsible for assessing and minimizing risks related to them for a given level of expected return by establishing and applying internal rules and controls to the on- going business. Second line   The Group Risk Management Function oversees, monitors, reviews and quantifies the risks, provides all the necessary tools, methodologies, coordination and support to the risk taking Units, contributes to the measurement of the risk-adjusted performance of the said Units, participates in the credit approval process of the Group for the corporate and retail portfolios, as well as of the Group subsidiaries, conducts an independent assessment of the credit risk undertaken with veto power, and proposes appropriate ways to mitigate risks, supported by the subsidiaries Risk Management Units as well as by other specialized Units of the Bank.

The said product offers to those entitled to financial support for agricultural activity a  boost in liquidity at favorable terms,  so as to be able to cover their  operational needs.   In addition, NBG continued its Contract Farming financing program granting to more than 1,300 farmers/ livestock breeders loans amounting to  7.84 million. The program finances farmers and livestock breeders who cooperate with selected agricultural product trading and processing companies for the production of products that are bought by the latter on the basis of sales agreements between both parties. As a result, the production and trading cycle of the buyers and farmers is upgraded, and both sides enjoy significant benefits (reduction of production costs, better planning of inventories). Actions supporting agri-food financial  sector in 2019 NBG supports the agri-food sector, which  has the potential to become a powerful  pillar of transformation for the Greek  economy towards extroversion, innovation  and creativity while systematically trying  to create an ecosystem in the field of agri- food, mainly through:  the development of synergies and networking (Growth in Agri-food initiative, collaboration agreement with the UK-based Guild of Fine Food);  the creation of a favorable business environment for innovative efforts and businesses; and  the development of appropriate skillsets and training in the Food and Beverages sector, aiming at invigorating businesses human resources potential and enabling new farmers to enter the sector.

This  target was accomplished beyond any  expectations, as NBGs annual turnover  increased by 16.5% compared to that  of last year. This has also contributed  to an increase in NBGs market share.  This excellent result reflects the  commencement of business relationships  with new business customers, and to the  expansion of such business relationships  with existing customers.

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT Customer service network  As on 31.12.2019, the NBG branch network  included 389 branches and 26 transaction  offices with a broad geographical spread,  running approximately 22% of the total  number of banking-sector units in Greece. NBGs physical presence in the 13  prefectures indicated as economically  weakest in the country stood at 28%  (HBA, HEBIC archive) on 31.12.2019, with  31 banking units versus 35 the previous  year. This reduction by 11.4% derives from  unit mergers in the prefectures of Samos,  Thesprotia, Zakynthos and Kilkis.  NBG maintains a presence in frontier  regions and on small islands with a  population of less than 5,000 people,  and is the only bank present on certain  islands (e.g. Megisti, Oinousses, Alonnisos,  Skyros, Skopelos and Antiparos). In  these sparsely populated regions, as at  31.12.2019, NBGs network included 16  units vs. 18 as of 31.12.2018. The reduction  by 11% derives from two-unit mergers on  the islands of Kea and Samothraki. The merger of the aforementioned units  is aligned with the broader transformation  plan of the Bank, part of which involves  the rationalization of the branches  network.  In addition, the Bank has set up 57 off-site  ATMs in sparsely populated and remote  areas, as on 31.12.2019 (representing 7.21%  of its available total of 791 off-site s). During the course of 2019, the Bank also  applied preferential pricing (zero charges)  on transactions carried out via the ATM  network of other banks, in delivering  service to customers/ residents of the  small islands of Kasos, Kythnos, Astypalaia  and Paxi, where NBG has no presence, by  assuming the DIAS charges itself. Since  November 2019 such preferential pricing  expanded further to 25 small islands/  remote areas, where the Bank has no  branch presence. The Bank considers as non-privileged  population groups, population groups  residing in low-populated remote areas.  NBG off-site ATMs operate in 57 areas.

Standing by its commitment to  play a key role in the economic and  social development of the country,  NBG understands the significance of  environmental protection for the society  and its economic development.  Through the Environmental Management  System which it implements, the Bank  has incorporated to its business activity,  actions and procedures aiming at:  reducing its environmental footprint  protecting biodiversity  enhancing its staff and customer environmental awareness This responsible approach is an essential  and indispensable part of the Banks  Corporate Social Responsibility and  actively contributes to the realization of  wider environmental goals as these are  stipulated through the Paris Agreement  on climate change and the UN Sustainable  Development Goals. NBGs commitment towards an  environmentally responsible conduct  is formulated both in the Banks  Environmental Policy Statement,  implemented in its business operations, as  well as in the NBG Groups Code of Ethics. Carbon Disclosure Project In its environmental policy context, NBG,  published, for the 13th consecutive  year, information about its strategy  regarding global warming and data  on its water consumption and CO2  emissions through the Independent,  Not-for-Profit Organization CARBON  DISCLOSURE PROJECT, which holds the  largest database of primary corporate  climate change information. Aiming  at the constant improvement of its  environmental performance, NBG was  assessed and classified during 2019 with  the Level C Awareness (on a scale  ranging from D- to A+), improving thus  its performance in relation to 2018. Level  C includes businesses that have proven  recognition of the impact of climate  change on their operation, as well as  their own operations impact on the  environment. Environmental procurement criteria Besides its other CSR actions, NBG  seeks to act responsibly in the sphere  of procurement, with a view to reducing  its own environmental footprint and  exercising indirect pressure on its  suppliers to improve their own CSR level. Accordingly, it strives to promote best  practices within its sphere of influence,  including its suppliers and associates. To do this, NBG evaluates its suppliers in  terms of environmental criteria, including:  Technical specifications of the products (i.e. low energy consumption).  Compliance with legal requirements concerning environmental issues (e.g. avoiding the use of harmful chemicals).  Participation in alternative management and recycling systems for obsolete equipment. Since 2013, the Bank has included  corporate responsibility terms in all  invitations for tenders and procurement  contracts, as stated in the relevant EU  directives regarding environmental  protection.  Indicatively, to minimize the impact of its  electrical and electronic equipment on the  environment, the Bank applies a number  of environmental criteria, classified as  either mandatory or optional:  Mandatory criteria include the suppliers declaration that the equipment in question meets legal provisions regarding recycling / alternative waste management.  Optional criteria include an environmental management certificate issued by the manufacturer or any other document proving the measures taken by the manufacturer or supplier. WWFs global Earth Hour campaign The Bank participated for the 11th year  in WWFs global Earth Hour campaign,  by switching off the electric power for  an hour in 5 of its central premises, as a  symbolic gesture, in order to encourage  its personnel and customers towards  supporting this significant initiative. GRI 308 GRI 414 GRI 307 90  PROFILE GOVERNANCE MARKET EMPLOYEE ENVIRONMENT SOCIETY APPENDIX NBG pays particular attention to risks that  may arise as a result of climate change. According to the recommendations of  the Financial Stability Board (Final Report  - Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures),  it is more important than ever that  businesses lead in understanding and  responding to these risks (deriving  from climate change)—and seizing  the opportunities—to build a stronger,  more resilient, and sustainable global  economy1.  Climate change entails significant risks  for both banks and their customers,  due to stricter legislation regarding the  management of greenhouse gases,  increased insurance premiums and  negative public opinion regarding  polluting industries, and natural disasters. Risks arising from climate change include  the following: 1  (TCFD (2017), Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosures-Final Report, https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report-11052018.pdf,).  Natural risks  Transition risks  Risks due to non-compliance with the applicable legal and regulatory framework Nevertheless, while the risks arising from  climate change are evident, a number  of significant growth opportunities are  emerging, which NBG intends to exploit. For example, the development of an  economy that produces fewer pollutants  on both the national and international  level will generate competitive advantages  for organizations that have already taken  precautionary measures to this end,  and at the same time new markets and  innovative products designed to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions will comprise  a new area of business activity. During  2020, NBG will establish a Green Bond  Framework so as to be able to attract  clients interested in environmentally  friendly investments. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM In line with our commitment to environmentally responsible operations, since 2004  we have developed and implemented an Environmental Management System, in  conformity with the requirements of the international standard ISO 14001. The Bank  aims to obtain the relevant certificate of compliance during 2021. After analyzing the  potential environmental impact of its operations, NBG has defined five key principles  for its Action Program. CLIMATE CHANGE: THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES Deployment  of an  environmental  risk assessment  policy in  investment  and credit  processes Rationalization  of work-related  travel and  commuting Effective  management of  paper and solid  waste Deployment   of  environmental  standards in  purchasing Conservation  of natural  resources and  energy GRI 307 91  Responsibility for the NVIRONMENT 2019 ENERGY MANAGEMENT Effective energy management and reduction in energy consumption are significant  components of our actions that form part of our CSR strategy. To this end, the following  actions were taken during 2019:  Actions Energy saving  (kWh/year) CO2    emissions  reduction  (kg CO2/year) Energy upgrades in 11 of the Bank's elevators 16,827 16,641 Replacement of lamps by corresponding LED  ones in 14 of the Banks administration buildings 420,320 415,696 Replacement of floodlights by respective LED  elements 297,128 293,860 Completion of the energy upgrading works, at  the Bank's IT building in Gerakas 3,000,000 2,967,000 Centrally controlled shutdown of PCs after 19:00  or 22:00, depending on the needs of each Unit (in  effect since 2011) 772,200 763,705 Total energy saving & CO2 emissions reduction 4,506,475 4,456,902 he Banks total energy consumption for 2019 was 237,523 GJ.

Specifically:  In 2019, the electricity consumption measured in 694 of the Banks administration buildings and branches and at 791 off-site ATMs, was 52,800 MWh (190,079 GJ). Of this overall consumption it is estimated that the percentage of energy deriving from RES amounts to circa 30.75%, as stated by the providers in respect of the total fuel mix.  In addition, in 2019, consumption of:  Natural gas (742,481 m3) totaled 8,539 MWh (30,739 GJ).

In particular, during 2019, 4,536 routes were made, transporting a total number of ~500  employees on a daily basis. Measures taken for the reduction of  staff commuting in 2019  Distance training courses (e-learning) offered to staff increased to 74 in 2019. Equally, the participations number exceeded 23,300 in 2019.  During 2019, the Bank offered webinars for 2 different thematic areas in 19 sessions. The participants were trained while having real time interaction with the trainer without having to leave their post, contributing thus in a reduced environmental impact.  In the context of decentralization of the training process, a lot of training sessions were carried out in various cities around Greece wherever premises are suitable for hosting such seminars. In particular, 147 training events were carried out in Thessaloniki, Kavala, Komotini, Trikala, Volos, Larisa, Ioannina, Amfissa, Patras, Nafplio, Argostoli, Zakinthos, Kerkira, Mitilini, Rhodes, Samos, Syros, Iraklio (Crete) and Chios.  As part of the Banks External Seminars Program, 31 Distance Learning seminars were held with 205 participants in Greece and abroad corresponding to 3,880 man-hours, thus contributing to the reduction of travel and generation of significant benefits for the environment and the Banks scale economies.  To reduce staff travel needs, the Banks HR Selection Subdivision  combined interviews with training on  the same day and at the same time  as the scheduled in-house training  courses attended by employees.   Also, interviews for the Banks and Groups Units were carried out via Skype and video conference.  In order to limit executive travel, the Bank has installed 38 video conference systems in some of its Units in Greece and in subsidiary companies overseas. Reducing indirect emissions  The provision of services by the Bank  is directly linked to travel and transport  needs of customers who visit its Branches.  The Bank has enabled the reduction  of such travel by reducing the need  for frequent visits by customers to  its branches and ATMs, as well as the  distances that need to be covered. In terms of the Banks role in reducing  unnecessary travel, it was made possible  by increasing the number of transactions  available through the internet and mobile  banking services. During 2019 transactions  through internet banking increased by  9.2% compared to the year before, while  transactions through mobile banking rose  by 56.1%. In 2019, the number of users  registered with NBG alternative channels  (internet and mobile banking) was  approximately 2.38 million, corresponding  to an increase of 19.5%, while active users  increased by 24.6%.  GRI 305 94  PROFILE GOVERNANCE MARKET EMPLOYEE ENVIRONMENT SOCIETY APPENDIX For more details, please refer to the  section Responsibility for the Market and  the Banks website NBG - Home Page. Ozone layer During 2019, the replacement of 90% of air  conditioning units running on Freon R22  by new ones that run on environmentally  friendly refrigerants was completed. Moreover, as required by law, all fire- fighting systems using Halon have been  replaced with new environmentally  friendly materials.  By means of these actions the Bank aims  at running systems containing chemical  substances that pose the lowest possible  pollution threat for the environment. Water management NBG fully recognizes the importance of  water efficiency, as this is an extremely  important natural resource, which will  gradually be under pressure as a result of  the impact of climate change in Greece  and abroad.  The Banks water supply comes from the  public water supply network. Because  of the nature of the Banks activities, the  water is mainly used in rest room facilities  and for cleaning work areas, while the  use of water-cooled air-conditioning  systems is limited. As a result, the Banks  actions focused mainly on preventing and  avoiding leakages by regularly maintaining  its piping network. 59,257 89,420 106,002 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 120,000 2017 2018* 2019 Water consumption (m3) Management of solid waste   As a financial institution, the Bank uses  materials which mainly concern office  equipment and consumables. The main  categories of the Banks office supplies  are: writing materials, light bulbs, UPS,  batteries, office consumables (including  toner and ink cartridges for printers),  paper, computers and other electrical and  electronic devices. Supply, management and recycling  of paper NBGs daily activities, produce mainly  paper as a solid waste. Since 2011,  the Banks correspondence (internal  and to third parties) is fully managed  by the Internal Electronic Document  Management System, resulting in a  significant reduction in printing and paper  consumption. During 2019, the Electronic  Document Management System (SHDA)  was further upgraded resulting in 675,400  documents being exchanged, thus saving  almost 1,688,500 pages of printouts.  Furthermore, the use of the e-signature  application also contributed towards  limiting paper consumption (circa 1.8  million print-outs per month). Aiming at environmental protection,  the Bank launched its i-bank statements  service, whereby its customers receive  electronic statements regarding their  savings accounts, credit cards, investment  products and mortgage or consumer  loans, through their e-banking account,  omitting in this way the need for  printed statements. More than 1,000,000  statements have already been converted  from printed to electronic format.  Moreover, NBGs i-bank delivery channels  are being continuously enriched with new  services and more transactions, enabling  customers to carry out transactions 24/7  from home or by using their mobile phone.  To meet all its needs for paper (A4, A3,  and special printing), in 2019 the Bank  purchased recyclable paper which carries  the EU Ecolabel logo for responsible  sourcing: FSC (Forest Stewardship  Council) or PEFC (Programme for the  Endorsement of Forest Certification).  This paper is also bleached using  environmentally friendly methods (ECF,  PCF, TCF) and not using chlorine, which  is particularly harmful. The total weight of  recyclable paper (size A3 and A4) supplies  amounted to 480,079 kg.

This  program leads to the reduction of  printouts and, as a consequence,  the reduction of paper and toner  consumption. The number of the  systems current users amounts to circa  8,200 individuals. In 2019, the toners  supplied through the MPS system totaled  11,353 pieces, while 4,583 pieces were  recycled through the 3,727 MPS units. It  is anticipated that the future benefit for  the Bank will be a 25-35% reduction in  printing costs. In order to minimize the environmental  impact of toner and other equipment  (computer and other furniture and  appliances), the Bank proceeds to  recycle them or donate them, in order  to reuse them. In 2019, more than 4.5  thousand toners were reconstructed or  recycled and 427 devices and furniture  were donated in order to be reused, thus  contributing to the circular economy. 9,371 8,609 4,583 2,872 516 427 0 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 9,000 10,000 2017 2018 2019 Recycling of toners (pieces) Upcycling of equipment (computers, furniture and appliances) Toner recycling and upcycling of equipment (pieces)* * Toners recycled through the MPS system are also included 97  Responsibility for the NVIRONMENT 2019 Principle of Prevention In its financing decision-making process,  NBG takes into account the principle of  proactive prevention both in its business  planning and in developing new products.  The Banks business as a financial  institution does not inherently  generate increased likelihood of direct  environmental risk (such as in the case  of a heavy industry). Nevertheless, NBG  undertakes proactive measures adopting  the key principles of the applicable legal  and regulatory framework.  Responsible financing -  Environmental risk evaluation and  management  NBG uses the Risk Advisor Model included  in the Risk Analyst system developed by  Moodys Analytics to assess the credit  ratings of most enterprises  (large and medium-sized) included in its  corporate loan book. Alongside various  other criteria, the said model includes  industry risk, with three score levels (high,  moderate and low-risk) regarding the  environmental impact and risks associated  with the industry sector. The assessment is  carried out at least every 12 months (in  certain cases more frequently, i.e. every  4-6 months), including -amongst other  things- visits by Relationship Managers to  the companies premises. In addition, the Bank places special empha- sis on approvals of loans that serve to sup- port business activities that will enhance  employment and protect the environment.  Failure on the borrowers or the guarantors  part to comply with the environmental and  sanitary legislation may lead to termination  of the loan contract by the Bank. Polluting  businesses that do not take any protective  measures are deemed undesirable on the  basis of the Banks credit policy. The Bank supports business activities that  boost the overall environmental potential  of Greece, such as:  Production of green, traditional and organic products.  Infrastructures (local government organizations etc.).  Investment in environmental protection, clean technology, certification of environmental management systems, saving energy and natural resources.  Participation in joint funding packages for environmental programs for the enhancement of entrepreneurship.  Research and Development (R&D) of environmental products and practices. The Bank does not undertake the funding  of activities banned by EU regulations.  Indicatively: trade in protected wild fauna,  production and trade of radioactive  materials and chemicals that have been  banned by international protocols,  transportation and release of genetically  modified products into the natural  environment, etc. NBG channels funding into a variety  of business activities, taking into  consideration assessments and studies  by relevant authorities, as well as by  independent bodies specializing in  the evaluation and supervision of  environmental risk.  Note that in the case of funding  handled by the Banks Sector for  Structured Finance & Syndicated  Loans, environmental risks are assessed  ad hoc by specialized technical and  environmental advisors who act on the  account of the lending banks. These  advisors carry out relevant reviews on  projects to be financed and certify that  the project in question complies with  the requirements of environmental  legislation and that relevant permits are  obtained. Such specialized technical  and environmental advisors have been  employed for most of the 48 projects  included in the Project Finance Divisions  portfolio, while compliance and the  obtaining of relevant environmental  permits are among the prerequisites for  the loan disbursement.  nclusion of environmental and social  terms in funding contracts To receive financing for works and  investments, the firm or owner of the  works or investments has to provide the  Bank with documentation confirming  authorization by the competent  authorities, which includes a study of  the environmental and social impact  of the project (e.g., in the case of  financing of Renewable Energy Sources,  Infrastructure projects, National Highways,  Subway networks etc.). Compliance  with environmental specifications is a  precondition for the disbursement of  the loans. In syndicated loan contracts,  the Bank specifies in the terms that the  Issuer and any Guarantors must observe  environmental and health legislation,  while its breach constitutes grounds for  Event of Default. Following disbursement,  any impact of the financed works on the  environment is covered by insurance  policies. FS8 GRI 307 98  PROFILE GOVERNANCE MARKET EMPLOYEE ENVIRONMENT SOCIETY APPENDIX Protecting biodiversity For the Bank, responsibility for the  environment and the implementation  of an Environmental Policy are  cornerstones of good corporate conduct  and encourage businesses to pursue  Sustainable Development and combat  climate change. To this end, NBG implements a policy  for the analysis and assessment of  environmental risks involved in investment  and credit processes and is committed  to fully complying with the relevant  environmental legislation, turning down  applications for financing investments in  protected areas. Moreover, in line with  its traditional awareness of social and  environmental responsibility issues, NBG  donates funds for the protection and best  management of some of the countrys  most important nature reserves. PROMOTING GREEN BANKING NBG is fully aware of its customers  increasing interest in services and  products that contribute to environmental  protection. Accordingly, the Bank aspires  to finance environmentally friendly  projects. Renewable energy sources (RES) One of the Banks strategic targets for  2019 was to increase financing of RES,  a sector with high growth potential.  NBG focused on investment initiatives  presenting innovation and strong know- how, and on financing research programs  for technologies that contribute to  the countrys efforts to improve its  environmental footprint. Accordingly, it  has set up a special team that handles  investment applications for funding of  RES projects and provides advice to  potential project finance investors as well  as to SMEs. Loans for investment in RES  and regular management of urban and  industrial waste contribute to a reduction  in CO2 emissions.  In 2019, wind and  photovoltaic parks as well as hydroelectric  and other projects were financed.

The ongoing effort to enhance the  quality and age of the financed vessels  constitutes a part of the broader strategy  of the Shipping Division. Regarding the  age structure of the portfolio, it is noted  that on the 31.12.2019 ships aged up to 5  years accounted for 20% of the portfolio,  while ships aged up to 10 years accounted  for 60% of the total portfolio. In general, as regards bulk carriers, the  Bank seeks to foster modernization  of the fleet, and accordingly tends to  finance young vessels that are energy  saving and more efficient. Further,  special emphasis is placed on tankers,  due to the nature of their cargo, so that  financing is granted only to tankers that  are not only young (ships aged up to 5  years served as collateral for 30% of the  tankers portfolio) but also comply with  the latest requirements on the prevention  of pollution, in line with the applicable  International Conventions and Regulations  on environmental protection, while the  relevant loan agreements stipulate that  non-compliance with the environmental  regulations by the vessel owner may lead  to termination of the loan agreement by  the Bank. Resolving environmental complaints The Bank always makes every possible  effort to comply with the relevant  regulations or the applicable legislation.  Following a complaint / referral, the Bank  took all appropriate measures to clean  buildings and repair any damages. During  2019, 4 complaints regarding the Banks  environmental impact were filed via official  grievance mechanisms and were settled  within the year. The said complaints  concerned the following issues: Branches  alarms, condition of the Branches external  walls, heating/ventilation inside the  Branches. In 2019, no fines were imposed  on the Bank regarding the environment.

Through this donation, the National Bank  offered a well-designed and constructed  wing, equipping it with the standard  incorporated equipment that is necessary  to ensure its operation. Evaluation of the project through  SROI methodology  In the context of the completion of the  project, the Bank, in collaboration with a  third independent body, carried out the  evaluation of the NBG sponsorship to the  General Hospital Evaggelismos using the  Social Return on Investment methodology  (SROI). The SROI methodology was applied  to estimate the value of the changes  experienced by the relevant Stakeholders  who participated in the evaluation  process. The study showed that important  changes were experienced by all relevant  Stakeholders. In particular: the waiting  time on surgeries for the patients was  decreased, the doctors and nurses  working conditions were improved,  the Hospital is operating with state-of- the-art infrastructure and thus is able  to accommodate and provide services  to all cases. At the same time, some  socioeconomic issues were highlighted  and described in the study such as:  the reduction of hospital infections,  the increased nursing staff and the  environmental protection. In order to  estimate the exact socioeconomic value  generated, the SROI methodology  considers a number of variables affecting  the outcomes such as deadweight,  drop off, attribution, displacement and  duration. According to the analysis of the  outcomes, the donation displays a social  performance indicator equal to 5.35:1,  which means that for each  1 donated by  the NBG to the Evaggelismos General  Hospital,  5.35 were generated in social  value. Economy - Innovation support Recognizing that science, research and  innovation are the drivers of economic  growth and prosperity, and that our  era in particular is the starting point  of transformational innovations and  new challenges, the Bank supports  programs and initiatives that promote  innovation, technological development  and entrepreneurship.

NBG Historical Archive (NBG-HA) During the year 2019 NBG Historical  Archive successfully achieved its goals,  which include the collection, proper  safekeeping, appropriate processing and  promotion of the Banks vast archive  collection. The success of achieving these  objectives is reflected in the results of the  individual actions of the Unit: Archival Activities New acquisitions have taken place from  the Banks Branch Network and from  donations. The category Archives of third  parties held in NBG HA has enriched with  items, in digital form, from the Hellenic  Parliaments Greek Independence Archive  in view of the upcoming bicentenary  celebrations in 2021 of the Greek War of  Independence. Processing archive material Classifications:  148 files with material of the Business & Finance Study service of the Industrial Credit Division.  Additional new material in the archive of Ioannis M. Isigonis, one of the pioneer engineers of the Technical Services Division.  Operational documents of the Historical Archive Unit, covering the period 1977 to 1989, in view of its inclusion in the Electronic System of Historical and Archival Information.  473 photographic items of the NBG collections derived from Banks divisions or and in relation with NBG branch buildings. An index of exchangeable properties has  been compiled: For the archive index of exchangeable  properties that will minimize search time,  15,825 references were entered from 14  different series. Pilot catalogue design The aim of this program was to gather, in  one archival unit, all the available material,  which concerns the interventions that  have taken place from 1845 until today in  the key historic building on Aiolou Street,  the Head Branch of National Bank.  The historical and symbolic significance  of this building is enormous, not only  because it houses the headquarters of  NBG, the oldest bank in Greece, but  also because it is the first branch of the  111  Responsibility for the SOCIETY 2019 Bank in a privately owned property. The  conclusions of this pilot project will allow  us to weigh the parameters regarding the  generalization of such an application to  the entire Technical Services file, and to  estimate the cost/benefit that will result  from the improvement of accessibility. Conservation Laboratory The Conservation Laboratory dealt with  the maintenance of two archive series,  contributed to the preparation of the  material and the setting up of all the  exhibition events and also provided for  the proper observance of the conditions  that must prevail both in the exhibition  spaces of the permanent exhibitions,  as well as in the storage spaces of the  archive material.  Events Night of Museums The Banks Historical Archive participated  in the International Museum Day, whose  theme this year was Museums as cultural  hubs: The future of tradition. The annual  participation in this international event is  an opportunity for the Archive to confirm  and expand its outward orientation and to  broadly promote the Banks contribution  to science and culture.  In 2019 our co-organizers were the  KETHEA PAREMVASI therapeutic  program, and the collector and the man  of culture Harry Tzalas.  The patients of the PAREMVASI and the  parent program participated with the  following actions:  Photography exhibition  xhibition of a series of posters that went through the history of the Community, made by patients of the Program  Visual installation  Musical instrument construction workshop  Screening of short films  Musical event, a collaboration of the PAREMVASI band Kroustodia with members of Encardia. Exhibitions The age of multimedia  In the spirit of this years International  Museum Day theme, Museums as cultural  hubs: The future of tradition, the Archive  ran an exhibition reviving elements of  NBGs cultural tradition, whose carefully  preserved documents can serve as an  ongoing source from which new uses  can draw material. In particular, for more  than twenty years, the Bank using the  innovative promotion system Multimedia  Show, ran a pioneering communication  project, which made NBG known  inside and outside Greece, projecting  Greek themes of historical, tourist and  various other interests, which were  created in collaboration with celebrated  contemporary artists.  This material, consisting of various  machines, thousands of photographs,  texts and music from the roughly forty  programs that were created, are available  today, recorded and classified, in the  Historical Archive and constitute an  important historical, artistic and technical  holding contributing to preserving the  multifaceted history of the Bank and not  only.  Exploring and discovering ancient  Alexandria  With thirty-one original engravings  covering a period from the 15th through  to the 19th century, starting in 1472, from  the collection of collector Harry Tzalas,  an exhibition was organized that guided  the visitor through the visible remains of  the city founded by Alexander the Great  in 332 BC, and which went on to become  the capital of culture and science. The  exhibition was enriched by tours and  lectures, and lasted one month. Bicentennial Initiative 1821-2021  The Historical Archive is participating in  the Working Group for the preparation  of the 140 events, in Greece and abroad,  celebrating the 200th anniversary of the  1821 Revolution. 1821, before and after The Historical Archive is participating in  the preparation of the 2021 exhibition  which will cover the period from 1770 to  1870, and is co-organized by the Bank  of Greece, the National Bank of Greece,  Alpha Bank and the Benaki Museum. Publications NBG Historical Archive 42 years of  contribution to scientific research After a brief description of the efforts  to establish a Historical Archive Unit in  the Bank from 1938 to 1977, an account  is given of the stages that followed the  process of creating an archive unit that  would be aimed at the outside academic  world besides the internal needs of the  Bank with the main purpose to collect  and preserve documents relating to  the oldest banking organization of the  country, and to promote this heritage  by any appropriate means, especially by  creating the conditions that will make  112 112  PROFILE GOVERNANCE MARKET EMPLOYEE ENVIRONMENT SOCIETY APPENDIX the wealth of the Banks archive and  collections accessible, in a friendly way, to  the academic researcher and interested  members of the public.  The short historical overview is  supplemented with the first results of a  research study conducted by the Archive  for the period 1984–2019.  The results of this research focus on  the number of people who approached  the Archive for research purposes, the  purpose of their research, and the stage  their research had reached by September  2019. The age of Multimedia In the Preface of the 45-page booklet  that functions both as a catalogue of  the exhibition and as a more detailed  presentation of the work of the  Multimedia Shows, we read: For its time, this is a pioneering and  technologically innovative show, based  on alternating images using one or  more projectors, which are electronically  programmed so that the images are  displayed at specific moments, in  combination with other images and  accompanied by music and spoken  commentary. The book presents the establishment  of the Multimedia service, the first  multimedia shows, the production process  of the multimedia shows, their reception  by the public in Greece and abroad,  as well as the legacy left to us by their  cultural wealth. Exploring and discovering ancient  Alexandria through engravings and maps  of the 15th - 19th century Catalogue of the exhibition that presents  all the images of the original exhibits,  along with their description and a  foreword by the owner of the engravings.  Educational Programs In 2019, 2,552 students from 74 schools  attended the educational programs  carried out by the Historical Archive for all  levels of education.  Conferences The Historical Archive prepared the  reception for the annual meeting of the  European Association for Banking and  Financial History (EABH), which was to  be hosted by NBG in 2020. This event,  however, was postponed to 2021 due to  Covid-19. Assisting researchers During 2019, 316 researchers visited our  Unit and received assistance in their  work.  This years researchers consulted 40  out of the 86 archive series in the NBG  HA Electronic System of Historical and  Archive Information. Besides, forty researchers consulted  the Archives specialized library in  addition to their archival consultation,  or even independently of it. Finally, nineteen researchers consulted  third-party archives in the Banks  possession. Eight researchers consulted third-party  archives held by NBG HA. 113  2019 FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS REPORT Introduction NBG Sustainability Report aims at  providing reliable data with a view to  supporting and constantly promoting an  open and ongoing dialogue between the  Bank and its stakeholders. The NBG Sustainability Report is  published on an annual basis. The Bank  published its first Social Report in 1996.  The Banks first Sustainability Report  prepared in accordance with international  standards, was published in 2008 and  covered data and information for the  period 2005 - 2007. This Report is the 13th  edition and covers the period 1/1/2019 -  31/12/2019. The previous Reports are available on  www.nbg.gr (Corporate Social Responsibility / Annual  CSR Reports). Scope The Sustainability Report 2019 covers all  NBG business activities in Greece. The  activities of NBG subsidiaries, institutions,  suppliers and further activities of joint  ventures, in general, are not included  in this Report. The financial data in the  Report concern the Banks domestic  activities as well as these of NBG branches  in Egypt and the United Kingdom.  Compared to Sustainability Reports of  previous years, in this Report there are  no substantial changes of the scope and  methodology for evaluating data. Also,  there were no significant changes in the  Organizations structure, size and supply  chain. The NBG Sustainability Report  concerns any economic, environmental  and social impacts of the Bank, while  there are no specific restrictions or  exceptions. As the Report does not  include the various subsidiary companies  of NBG, potential acquisitions, sales  or other corporate changes, ability to  compare data from year to year should  not be materially affected. Sources of information The information contained in this Report  derives from records of processes  and most of it is available in printed or  electronic format. In case of arithmetic  calculations, the formula or calculation  method are stated, while the economic  data are also available in the Banks  Annual Financial Statements, which have  been signed by Senior Management,  and audited accordingly. The Bank has  chosen to publish numeric data on its  economic, social and environmental  performance on a three-year basis, aiming  at comparing the development of each  indicator as well as the overall depiction  of its performance. Any restatements  of data are noted, while the reasons  for such restatements are specified at  the respective points. In addition, with  regard to energy data, the Report uses  measurements in KWh, MWh and joules,  as proposed by the GRI standards, both  because these are the measurements  used by the Bank and because these  are considered to be the most familiar  to readers. The content of the Report  is determined by the type of activity of  the Bank, as a financial institution, the  Reporting Principles for Defining Quality  and Guidelines for Defining Content  of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI- Standards). The Report was prepared  in accordance with the GRI-Standards:  Core option. According to the above,  NBG deems important any information  reflecting economic, environmental and  social impact or influencing the decisions  of stakeholders.  This is how the key themes included in  the Sustainability Report arose, focusing  on Corporate Governance, Economic  and Social impact of NBG, as well as  communication with the stakeholders.  NBG hopes that the Sustainability Report  contributes to effective communication  with the various stakeholder groups and  covers various aspects of key issues.  The key stakeholders expected to use the  Report are listed in the Section /  Corporate Profile / Stakeholders. Applying the 1000APS Standard NBG, for one more year, implemented  the 1000 Accountability Principles  Standard (APS) 2008 with a view to  enhancing stakeholders awareness and  response to Sustainability issues. The basic principles of this standard are  the following: Core Principle of Stakeholder  Inclusiveness: Within the framework  of this principle, NBG has established  procedures and dialogue mechanisms  with the main stakeholder groups in  order to learn more about them, to  get information about their needs and  expectations as well as the way they are  related to the Bank, aiming at generating  their responsible and strategic response.  Principle of Materiality: On the basis  of appropriate Sustainability criteria,  the Bank has developed an evaluation  procedure for stakeholder issues in order  to determine any significant issues that  concern them. This report is based on the  analysis findings of the procedure that  was carried out in 2018. 114  Principle of Responsivenes: The Banks  responds to its stakeholders expectations  by implementing policies, targets, action  plans etc. on the basis of the evaluation of  stakeholders issues. A brief presentation of the dialogue  methods with NBG stakeholders is  presented in the tables on pages 16-23  and 115 including the communication type  and frequency, as well as any issues that  arose and NBG actions. Ensuring data accuracy NBG acknowledges the additional value  of the external review of the Sustainability  Report, since it leads to enhanced quality  and reliability for stakeholders. For this  reason, the Bank assigned its review to  an external independent organization.  The Bank will try to make the most of  the results and comments following the  external review, always with a view to  enhancing the quality of its Sustainability  Reports. The Review prepared by the  external review organization is presented  on pages 127-131. The selection of the  independent organization was subject to  NBGs Purchasing Policy. Methodology NBGs CSR Report for 2019 has been  prepared in accordance with the GRI  Standards: Core option. A special  team, comprised of staff from all units  involved, has been set up to prepare the  Sustainability Report of NBG. The teams  main responsibility is to collect any data  required regarding NBGs Corporate  Social Responsibility. The NBG GROUP Corporate Governance  and Corporate Social Responsibility  Division is responsible for coordinating,  designing and editing NBGs Sustainability  Report. Interested parties have the opportunity to  communicate their opinion to the Bank,  submit suggestions for improvements,  and ask for clarification regarding any of  the NBG Groups CSR activities, at the  following address: NBG GROUP Corporate Governance and  Corporate Social Responsibility Division Aiolou 93, 105 51 Athens FAO: Mrs. Ioanna Sapountzi tel.: +30 210-3343106   Fax: +30 210-3341818 E-mail: csr@nbg.gr ACCOUNTABILITY PRINCIPLES STANDARD AA1000 PRINCIPLE APPLIED METHOD SECTION IMPLEMENTATION LEVEL Stakeholder Inclusivity Identification of Stakeholders and  dialogue regarding awareness of the  significant issues Stakeholders and  NBG's Commitment  and Response Fully met Materiality Identification and assessment of any  material issues that concern NBG and  the Stakeholders Materiality Analysis Fully met Responsiveness Responding to material issues NBGs Commitment  and Response Fully met 115  2019 GRI content index GRI Standard Disclosure Page and/ or URL \"External  Assurance\" ISO  26000:2010  CLAUSES GRI Standards  -

GR-105 51, Athens  Greece  Dear Sirs,  We hereby submit our report regarding the results of the work performed, as described in the  engagement letter dated on February 28, 2020, regarding the limited assurance of the 2019  Sustainability Report for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was prepared by National Bank of  Greece (hereinafter Bank).   The work performed was conducted under the International Standard on Assurance Engagements  ISAE 3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial  Information.  Management Responsibilities  The Management of the Bank is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of information  included in the 2019 Sustainability Report, its preparation in accordance with the GRI Standards  Core option and adherence to the principles of AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard 2008  (AA1000APS).  Our Responsibility  Our responsibility is to conduct our work, as this is described in the section Scope of work, report our  findings and express a limited assurance conclusion. The work performed and the potential findings  relate to specific performance indicators, included in the annual Sustainability Report (as these are  described in the section Scope of work), the provision of limited assurance in accordance with the  Assurance Standard AA1000AS 2008, as well as the General Standard Disclosures provided for by  the in accordance Core option of the GRI Standards. The work performed relates to the  Sustainability Report, prepared for the year 2019.  Scope of work  The Bank engaged us to:   Provide limited assurance on the preparation of the Sustainability Report in accordance with all General Disclosures prescribed by the Core option of the GRI Standards. 127  2019 2 of 5   Provide limited assurance (Type 1) in accordance with the AA1000 Assurance Standard 2008 (AA1000AS) on the adherence to the principles of the AA1000APS namely, inclusivity (identification and communication with stakeholders), materiality (evaluation of material issues) and responsiveness (response to stakeholder issues).  Provide limited assurance on the accuracy and completeness of the following quantitative indicators, linked to the Banks material issues and presented in the Sustainability report: 1. Direct economic value generated and distributed. 2. Energy consumption within the organization. 3. Total number and rates of new employee hires and employee turnover by age group, gender and location. 4. Average hours of training per year per employee by gender, and by employee category. 5. Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men by employee category, by significant locations of operation. 6. Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews by gender, and by employee category. 7. Percentage of workers representation in formal joint management–worker health and safety committees that monitor and advise on health and safety programs in the workplace 8. Results of surveys measuring customer satisfaction. 9. Non- compliance with laws and regulations in the social and economic area. 10. Access points in low-populated or economically disadvantaged areas by type. 11. Number of new users and transactions via the internet and mobile banking digital channels. In order to form our conclusions, we performed the following:  i. Interviewed and met with Departmental Managers and information owners in order to understand key governance structures, systems, processes, controls and their level of understanding of the information included in the Sustainability Report. ii. Identified existing internal processes related to application of financial, environmental and social policies and reviewed their level of compliance, where applicable. iii. Reviewed and tested, on a sample basis, the processes relating to collection, aggregation, validation and reporting of information included in the Sustainability Report. iv. Applied audit procedures, on a sample basis, in order to collect and review audit evidence. Inherent Limitations   The work performed does not provide absolute assurance that all material weaknesses related to the  accuracy and completeness of data and relevant disclosures, as these are included in the  128  3 of 5  Sustainability Report, will be identified. A material weakness exists when the design of the internal  controls is not adequate and thus, does not mitigate the risk of material deficiencies occurring without  being detected in a timely manner. All issues brought to our attention during the audit work performed  were accordingly communicated to Banks Management. Relevant points resulting from our work were  discussed with Management and subsequently their written responses were obtained.  Our Independence  During our work we remained independent of the Bank, in accordance with the International Ethics  Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) that has been transposed into Greek Law, as well as  the ethical requirements of L. 4449/2017 and EU Regulation 537/2014, and more specifically we  complied with the provisions of article 5 of the Regulation regarding non audit services.  Limited Assurance Conclusion  Based on the procedures we performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe  that the indicators included in the Sustainability Report, as these are described in the section Scope  of work are materially misstated.  Moreover, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Report  does not adhere to the principles of AA1000APS as well as that all the General and Specific  Disclosures dot not meet the requirements prescribed by the GRI Standards, in accordance Core  option.  For more details regarding our observations related to AA1000APS standard, also refer to Appendix.  129  Restrictions in Use  This Limited Assurance report, prepared as part of our work performed, is intended for the use of the  Management of National Bank of Greece and covers only the indicated reporting period as well as the  abovementioned scope of work.  Athens, 23/12/2020  Andreas Riris  Partner / Director  PricewaterhouseCoopers SA,   268  Kifissias Avenue, 15232 Halandri, Greece  130  2019 APPENDIX  In order for the Bank to improve the management and reporting process on Sustainability issues in the  future, as per the requirements of AA1000APS, we recommend the following:  Inclusivity:  The Bank engages with its stakeholders on a regular basis through the responsible departments and  dedicated communication channels, and thoroughly analyses the key issues and expectations that  arise. The process of stakeholder engagement informs the issues analysed in the Sustainability report  and supports their validity. Specifically for the purposes of the materiality analysis, the Bank has  recently launched a process of engaging stakeholders through electronic questionnaires. We  recommend the extension of the engagement process to a wider range of stakeholders as well as  conducting it at least once for each sustainability reporting period.   Materiality:  The Bank evaluates and classifies material issues, based on their significance, through an established  materiality analysis process. The issues assessed are informed from the Banks strategy, international  frameworks on sustainable development and stakeholder concerns and expectations identified  through the stakeholder engagement process. We recommend conducting the materiality analysis  process with a higher frequency, preferably in the beginning of each Sustainability reporting period, in  order to ensure the relevance and validity of the reported issues.  Responsiveness:  The Bank aims to respond to the main issues and expectations of its stakeholders through a  structured action plan and target setting mechanism.
