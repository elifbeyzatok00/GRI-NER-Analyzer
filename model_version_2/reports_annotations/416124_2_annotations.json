Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report About this report 2 About this report Givaudan views sustainability as the natural path to success and a  secure long-term future. Therefore sustainability is a key strategy  for our business, enabling the Company to drive responsible  growth and create new opportunities for shared success.  As part of our journey towards greater sustainability Givaudan  is moving towards an integrated reporting strategy. The details  of our progress will increasingly be included in the Annual  Report, thus demonstrating how non-nancial capitals  contribute to our growth and development.  This year we have included more of the GRI content in the  Annual Report, which was published in January. For example all  of the information relating to employees can be found in that  report. So to understand the full picture of our sustainability  activities it is necessary to read both the Annual Report and  the Sustainability Report.  The GRI Content Index and the GRI reference icons used  throughout the reports show where the content to each  disclosure can be found. Additionally, references to the United  Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicate  Givaudans contribution to these goals.  The 2017 Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance  with the GRI Standards: Core option; it covers the sustainability  activity of Givaudans wholly-owned companies from January  to December 2017. Givaudan reports on sustainability once a  year; the previous report was published in March 2017. In 2017  we nalised our new materiality matrix, which now reects   the trends, business issues and challenges facing us today. We  have identied 22 material aspects that are detailed in this  report. The GRI Materiality Disclosures Service veried that   the Disclosures 102-40 to 102-49 were correctly located both   in the GRI Content Index (pp. 67) and in the text of the report.

We consider   a raw material of natural origin to be responsibly  sourced when there are no gaps in the evaluation   of its supply chain against our Responsible Sourcing  Policy. Or, where gaps have been identied,  appropriate improvement plans are in plan. The  policy, which was published in 2016 and was a rst  in our industry, sets out a series of requirements  and standards to be met by all suppliers in the areas  of health and safety, social, environmental and  business integrity.  We help suppliers to achieve compliance by working  in partnership with them through our Responsible  Sourcing Programme. This is a huge undertaking as  Givaudan sources more than 10,000 raw materials  from all over the world. What makes the 2020  target all the more ambitious is the supply chains  comprise thousands of people and businesses. Given  the magnitude of the task, our approach is to work  hand-in-hand with our suppliers in a process of  continuous improvement until we reach our goal.  Innovative focus on naturals  and well-being We have continued to innovate and craft new  technologies that ofer alternative sources of key  natural raw materials. We continue to develop our  SunThesis citrus ingredients collection, a range of  natural citrus oil replacers, which give citrus avour  from non-citrus sources. The technology enables   us to meet our customers needs while relieving  some of the pressure on increasingly scarce citrus  resources.  Fragrance innovation is focused on inspiring a   sense of well-being by associating smells and  positive mood states. For example, we used our  extensive knowledge of the efects of fragrance   on the brain to develop and launch a technology   to help people sleep more soundly.  DreamScentz works on the link between  fragrances, positive states of mind and the notion of  a proper nights sleep. The technology ofers new  opportunities for our customers who are interested  in expanding their product portfolio to include  fragrance solutions that enhance the sleeping  experience for consumers around the world. Our highlights in 2017  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Our highlights in 2017 4 Top award for climate  change leadership Givaudans leadership on climate change action   was recognised in 2017 by CDP, the non-prot global  environmental disclosure programme. We were  awarded the top score of A for reducing GHG  emissions and earned an A – for outstanding water  stewardship. Overall, Givaudan is among the 120  global companies participating in CDPs climate  change programme to be recognised for leading  climate action.  Our emission reduction activities span projects   in three categories: low-carbon energy; energy  efciency; and transportation. We also engage   with our suppliers to help them achieve best  practice in environmental stewardship. Meanwhile,  to ensure our continued progress on climate   action and secure sustainable, long-term growth,  Givaudan announced a set of ambitious targets   for GHG reduction.  We have committed to reduce absolute Scope 1 and  Scope 2 GHG emissions by 30% between 2015 and  2030. In addition we will reduce Scope 3 emissions  by 20% over the same period.  Healthy living programme  wins Green Team award Throughout Givaudan our employees are driving   our sustainability mission by nding new ways of  improving the environmental and social performance  of their local sites. They are known as Green Teams,  and each year the Company awards the best  projects.  In 2017, the judges received entries from all over the  world, covering a wide variety of initiatives. Among  the winners was the Dubai Green Team, which put  together a programme of events to boost employee  health, happiness and well-being – an important  element of our Company values.  The year-long schedule included a wide range of  activities that focused on wellness, nutrition and  tness, including sports days, yoga classes,  marathon running, cycling and even zumba dance  classes. Participants also got involved in fund- raising events and team-building activities. A key  objective of the project was to drive employee  engagement and develop strength and mutual  support within the workforce.  The project lit the spark for a new culture of healthy  living and a renewed drive for success.  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report 5 Leadership statement Leadership statement  As a responsible company,  Givaudan understands that it   has a role to play in leading   our industry towards greater  sustainability.  We also believe that sustainability is the natural path to a  secure and long-term future for our business; it lies at the   heart of our vision and contributes directly to our corporate  2020 strategy of Responsible growth. Shared success. Responsible growth. Shared success Sustainability ofers exciting opportunities to add value to our  business - value that we can share with our customers. By  further building sustainable practices into the way we source  materials, develop products and reduce our environmental  footprint, Givaudan will be better able to meet our customers  needs. We also want to look forward, to anticipate those needs  in the changing global picture. Our aim is to transform the  challenge of sustainability into new possibilities for our  business and our customers.  Our commitment to a more sustainable future springs equally  from a belief that corporations must ofer the world leadership  in acting to safeguard the planet. The future depends on  companies who are prepared to put sustainability at the  forefront of their strategies. This is what being a responsible  and sustainable company means at Givaudan: we want to  secure our business, while making a positive impact on the  environment and society as a whole. The road to sustainability We began our journey towards sustainability in 2009 and since  then we have made rapid progress and reached major milestones  across the full lifecycle of our business. Today, it is fair to say that  we have established a solid foundation in sustainability practice.  Now we are ready to embark on the next phase.  Among the many challenges we will all face in the coming years   is the increasing scarcity of the worlds natural resources.   Our business relies on the secure supply of more than 10,000   raw materials, of which more than half originate from natural  sources. So the efcient and responsible use of resources is  essential, as is the assessment and careful management of our  impact on the environment. Our aim is to delight people around the world with unique  sensory experiences that they can feel good about. We do this   by making sure our products are sourced and produced in a way  that respects people and the environment. Therefore, in  preparation for the future and given the scale of the challenge,  Givaudan has decided to increase its eforts and strengthen its  approach to sustainability. A Sense of Tomorrow A Sense of Tomorrow is our new and strengthened approach   to sustainability, which extends our vision to 2030 and beyond;  it builds a picture of what good looks like for Givaudan and   for our customers and the planet at large. A Sense of Tomorrow  was developed with our key stakeholders and is aligned with  the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, making  Givaudan part of a global coalition working to ensure a   better future. The new approach focuses our eforts in three areas: Sourcing  for Shared Value to drive the adoption of sustainable practices  throughout our supply chains; Innovating Responsibly to create  products that contribute to sustainability, and Acting for Our  Environment to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute   to corporate climate action. In preparation for the next stage of our sustainability journey,  we have set ambitious targets for responsible sourcing and  environmental performance. By reducing greenhouse gas  emissions, focusing on the latest green technologies and  working in partnership to anticipate the challenges facing   our industry, we will drive our vision forward and make the  greatest positive contribution to our shared future.  Sourcing for Shared Value Sourcing for Shared Value reinforces Givaudans contribution   to preserving the environment; stimulating the well-being of  communities from which we source; and securing resources for  the long term. By embedding social and environmental purpose   Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Leadership statement 6 Gilles Andrier, Chief Executive Ofcer Willem Mutsaerts, Head of Global Procurement and Sustainability in the way we source, we can best respond to our customers  evolving needs and the increasingly stringent demands of  consumers for more sustainable and diferentiated products. We have set a series of industry-leading targets for our  Responsible Sourcing Programme, to be achieved by 2020. The  programme is the means by which we work with our suppliers  to lead supply chain transparency in the avour and fragrance  industry. We are committed to working with suppliers with  strong business ethics who demonstrate respect for people  and the environment. Innovating Responsibly Givaudan always seeks to drive innovation that enables  pleasing consumer experiences and adds value that benets  society and the environment.  While expanding our customers access to natural ingredients  and solutions, we are using new forms of biotransformation   to develop alternative sources of natural raw materials. For  example in 2017 we launched our latest, fully bio-sourced  molecule - the soothing skin agent BisaboLife. Givaudans  Active Beauty business used an exclusive fermentation process  to create this pure, natural, biodegradable and sustainable  source of alpha-bisabolol.  In addition, novel sensory experiences are helping our  customers to promote health and well-being. For example,  DreamScentz is the innovative outcome of our research on  the science of sleep. The technology ofers new opportunities  for our customers who are interested in expanding their  product portfolio to include fragrance solutions that enhance  the sleeping experience for consumers around the world.   In avours, we address the need for healthier and more  nutritious foods by pioneering work to develop authentic   taste alternatives for ingredients such as sugar and salt. Meanwhile, we have extended our expertise in developing  more sustainable sources of natural materials through recent  acquisitions and partnership agreements. In October 2017   we announced a strategic partnership with Draco Natural  Products to develop active botanical ingredients formulated  using the principles of Chinese medicine. The naturally   derived, sustainable ingredients will form part of our skin   and hair-care portfolio. Following the acquisition of the food ingredient expert Vika,   we have embarked on a journey to provide our customers with   a broader set of natural dairy and savoury solutions; and the  on-going acquisition of Centrooras Nutrition Division ofers a  unique opportunity to strengthen our naturals sourcing platform  for Givaudans avours, fragrances and cosmetics businesses.  Centrooras comprehensive sustainability management  programme will reinforce our own eforts in this area.  Acting for Our Environment Givaudan is committed to an ambitious climate action agenda;  we are determined to play our part in the global efort to limit  the average rise in temperature to less than 2C compared to  the preindustrial level. Givaudan has set greenhouse gas (GHG)  emission targets that have been approved by the Science Based  Targets initiative, as have many of our largest customers.   This commitment to industry leadership in climate change  mitigation will help our customers to hit their own targets. We work constantly to reduce GHG emissions, water  consumption and waste. Our performance in leading climate  action was recognised again this year by CDP when it awarded  us the top score of A and an A- for water stewardship. We are  proud to be among the 120 global companies to receive the   top award.   Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report 7 Leadership statement     Disclosure 102 – 14, pages 5 – 7 A year of progress Looking back on 2017, it has clearly been an important year at  Givaudan for consolidating our progress towards sustainability  in a new and strengthened approach. Once again we have  shown through our actions how our commitment to  sustainability is rooted in our strategy of Responsible Growth.  Shared Success., which for Givaudan means generating solid  business performance and growth. By integrating our eforts in  the three key areas of Sourcing for Shared Value, Innovating  Responsibly and Acting for Our Environment, we can at once  meet our customers needs and do what is right for the  long-term future of our planet.  This makes us the partner of choice for our customers, who  wish to inspire consumers with unique avours and fragrances  and at the same time stand by their own commitments to  respect the rights of people and preserve the environment.

The approach builds on a solid eight years of sustainability  practice and strengthens our response to an ever-changing  global picture, one in which we face increasingly complex  environmental and societal challenges posed by climate  change, resource scarcity and poverty.  Concern for the future of the planet, coupled with an increase   in the means by which organisations can measure and report   on the impact of their activities, is driving the demand for  greater sustainability. Our customers and their consumers want  products that they can be sure are sourced and manufactured   in a way that respects people and the environment.  Sustainability is the natural and obvious path to a secure and  long-term future. This is true for our business as well as our  customers, society and the environment as a whole. That is  why sustainability is a key contributor to our Companys 2020  strategy of Responsible growth. Shared success. Givaudan embarked on the road to sustainability in 2009 with  a programme that extended across the full lifecycle of the  business. We have achieved many important goals in the years  since then and indeed that initial vision remains valid to this day.  But in a changing world we recognised it was time to increase  our eforts. The demand for sustainability has created many  new and exciting opportunities for our business. There is also   a pressing need for good corporate leadership in sustainability,  and action to safeguard the future of the planet. Society needs  companies that put sustainability at the forefront of their vision  and strategy.  The management of natural resources is a key example.  Givaudan relies on a secure and sustainable source of more  than 10,000 raw materials. As resources become increasingly  scarce, the world can no longer take them for granted.   So with careful management of our activities and their impact  we will be best placed to meet the needs of all those whose  lives we touch, from customers to consumers and society as a  whole. We will also be better able to anticipate those needs in  the future and inuence change.  This is the focus of A Sense of Tomorrow. The approach   extends our vision to 2030 and beyond; sets new targets for  sustainability performance; and focuses our eforts in three   key areas: Sourcing for Shared Value, Innovating Responsibly  and Acting for Our Environment.  A Sense of Tomorrow is founded on the United Nations  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which set out the  agreed priorities and aspirations for 2030 and call on  businesses to apply their creativity and innovation to solve  sustainable development challenges.  We have aligned our approach with those SDGs on which   we can make the greatest impact. This will enable us to do   our best in terms of the contribution we can make to the  advancement of sustainable development, and to our lives   and the future of the planet. Sustainability governance Sustainability is governed by the two main bodies:   The Sustainability Steering Committee (SteerCo) and the  Sustainability Leadership Team (SLT).    – The SteerCo is a strategic body which supports the Executive  Committee (EC) and SLT to meet Givaudans sustainability  goals and validate the sustainability strategy being proposed  to the EC. The SteerCo meets at least twice a year and  whenever necessary.   – The SLT is the operational body that supports the Head of  Sustainability in driving the programme and its coordination.  The SLT meets every six weeks (including the SteerCo  meetings) and on an ad-hoc basis for specic purposes.    Disclosure 102 – 18  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report 11 Our sustainability approach Sourcing for Shared Value Sourcing for Shared Value The growth in the worlds population and the consequent   pressure on natural resources poses one of the greatest long-term  challenges that humanity has ever faced. These trends are already  creating a number of immediate risks to our business, such as the  impact they have on local producer communities. Here the lack of  secure employment and the efects of population movement away  from the countryside to urban areas are felt keenly. Our approach to sourcing seeks to turn these risks into  opportunities. We are committed to sourcing raw materials in a  way that respects people and the environment. But our strategy  is also designed to bring stability to our supply chains and the  local communities in which we operate; we do this by creating  new value to be shared by all who are involved in sourcing our  raw materials. We call this approach Sourcing for Shared Value  and it is based on three practices: Responsible Sourcing, Sourcing  at Origin and Communities at Source. Responsible Sourcing Our customers increasingly seek to understand the impact of  their supply chains and request more data on the environmental  and social aspects. We source more than 10,000 raw materials  from all over the world and so managing supply chains at this  scale is a complex task. But we are committed to working with  our suppliers to achieve greater transparency in line with our  Responsible Sourcing Policy. We drive compliance with the  policy via our Responsible Sourcing Programme, working with  suppliers to help them achieve high standards in health and  safety as well as social, environmental and business integrity. As part of that programme, in 2017 we set a target to make  sure that 90% of our raw materials volume of natural origin   is responsibly sourced by 2020. We consider a raw material   to be responsibly sourced when its supply chain meets all the  requirements of the Responsible Sourcing Policy; or, where  gaps do exist, plans are in place to make improvements.   Also by 2020, we aim to see that our main direct suppliers are  fully compliant with audits that cover the requirements of the  Responsible Sourcing Policy. Sourcing at Origin Our practice of Sourcing at Origin is designed to safeguard   the vulnerable sources of natural ingredients and to secure  their supply in both quality and quantity for the long term.   We achieve this by being present in the countries where we  source and by partnering with local suppliers. We work closely  with local producers, ofering a reliable outlet for their raw  materials and supporting the local industry with technical  knowledge and training in good agricultural practices. Sourcing at Origin enables us to create new value in our supply  chains; it also gives us a clear view of their components, which  enables us to make them more efcient. We can also tell our  customers where our ingredients come from and how they have  been produced. This enhanced transparency and traceability is   a key benet of our approach. Communities at Source We believe the communities in which we source contribute to  our business. By being present in those communities, we are  better able to understand their needs and the role we can play  in improving their lives by supporting local health, education,  environmental and agricultural projects.  Sourcing for Shared Value addresses the following material  issues: biodiversity, deforestation, local community  development, product environmental and societal impact, raw  material availability, responsible sourcing and traceability.    For more information see page 37 Sourcing for Shared Value supports the following SDGs: Our targets:   – All audited suppliers are compliant by 2020.    –  90% of our raw materials volume of natural origin is responsibly sourced by 2020.   We aim to address the remaining volume by 2030.    Disclosure 102 – 15  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Our sustainability approach Innovating Responsibly 12 Innovating Responsibly Among the key trends guiding the focus of innovation at  Givaudan is the growing market for health and wellness  products; consumers themselves are increasingly aware   of nutrition-related disease such as obesity and diabetes.   In addition, climate change and resource depletion demand   a proactive response. This has prompted the rise of brands with  purpose, marketed on their social and environment-friendly  credentials. Meanwhile, the ow of regulations is also increasing  for the avour and fragrance industry, for example the laws  stemming from the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benet  Sharing, which promotes the sharing of benets that arise from  the use of natural resources.  Our goal is always to create novel sensory experiences that  enable our customers to diferentiate themselves in the market  place. But we also want to make sustainability part of every  breakthrough and add value by developing products that  benet society and the environment. This means nding more  efcient methods of production, cutting waste and unwanted  by-products and reducing the overall environmental impact.  We call this Innovating Responsibly, an approach that is  focused on the key topics of: Naturals, Health and well-being,  and Sustainable processes. Naturals Naturalness is one of the most important drivers of demand in  our market, as consumers look for products they can trust   from recognised natural sources. Yet this increasing demand for  natural ingredients has put additional pressure on the planets  resources. By investigating and developing alternative sources  of key natural raw materials we are helping to protect fragile  natural resources, while expanding our customers access to  natural ingredients and solutions.  Today our avours innovation programme is focused on natural  enabling technologies and new ingredients. We continued to  develop our SunThesis citrus ingredients collection, a range of  natural oil replacers that help to relieve the strain on scarce  citrus resources. While in our Fragrance Division we have  several Citrus Coeur qualities, part of an exclusive Citrus  Collection. Here we concentrate citrus molecules to yield  intensely powerful notes and obtain a multiplier efect at low  quantities. Also, in an industry rst, we have developed new  upcycling techniques to create fragrance notes such as Apple  Oil from natural materials. Health and well-being We work with our customers to develop and maximise the  growth of their brands. We provide novel sensory experiences  and unique solutions that help them to meet the increasing  demand for products that contribute to a healthy, active and  balanced life.  By developing solutions for food and beverage products with  less sugar, fat or salt, we enable people from all walks of life   to make healthier food choices. We have also deepened our  understanding of how odour can positively impact consumer  health and well-being. Our research led to the development  and launch in 2017 of a new fragrance technology called  DreamScentz. The system is designed to assist users in  getting a good nights sleep, which is key to remaining healthy. Sustainable processes In creating the ingredients palette of the future we have   to do all we can to limit the potential impact of our products   on the environment. Therefore, we take a broad view of the  development of sustainable processes, and look to the principles  of green chemistry and the opportunities ofered   by biotransformation and the benets of biodegradability. We are constantly exploring new ways to make avour  compounds through fermentation and other natural processes;  we also use sustainable plant materials and agricultural  techniques. Biotransformation allows us to use natural  ingredients as raw materials and harness the power of  benecial micro-organisms to produce natural avours. We take the same approach with fragrances and active  ingredients. Our palette is created with the environment in mind.  Modern biotechnology techniques enable us to produce existing  molecules or create new captives. By following green chemistry  principles we ensure ingredients are safe by design and that our  manufacturing processes make efcient use of energy and  materials, while reducing water consumption and waste.  Innovating Responsibly addresses the following material issues:  access to food, consumer health and well-being and product  environment and societal impact.      For more information see page 43 Innovating Responsibly supports the following SDGs:    Disclosure 102 – 15  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report 13 Our sustainability approach Acting for Our Environment Climate change afects everyone. Changing weather patterns,  rising sea levels and more extreme weather events are  disrupting national economies and afecting lives at great cost.  The more immediate consequences of climate change for  business are likely to include volatility on the fossil fuel markets  and in particular water shortage, a fact that increasing numbers  of companies are waking up to. A failure to properly address  water security poses a severe risk not just to the future of our  business, but beyond the global ecosystem that underpins  human prosperity and quality of life.  In 2016, the Paris Climate Agreement reiterated the need to  keep the rise in global warming to below 2C compared to  preindustrial levels; it also called on companies to demonstrate  leadership on climate actions. More recently, 15,000 scientists  signed a letter to humanity in which they warned that not  enough has been done to combat global warming. They said  that more could be achieved if the world acted as one to secure  its future. We are determined to play our part in leading our industry   in acting to safeguard the environment. To that end we have  committed to an ambitious climate action agenda across our  own operations and those of our suppliers.  Our targets for reducing GHG emissions have been approved   by the independent Science Based Targets initiative and are  aligned with the global efort to keep a temperature increase  below the 2C threshold. Our commitment helps many of our  key customers reach their own GHG reduction targets. From  procuring 100% renewable energy to encouraging zero  deforestation in our supply chains, we assess every aspect of  our energy, water and waste management for opportunities   to reduce our environmental impact.  Acting for Our Environment supports the following SDGs: Acting for Our Environment addresses the following material  issues: climate change, local community development, product  environmental and societal impact, product quality and safety,  waste management and water stewardship.

External initiatives United Nations Global Compact We have endorsed and participated in a set of external global  commitments and initiatives to promote sustainable business  practices. First among these is the United Nations Global  Compact (UNGC). The compact is a strategic policy initiative  for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations  and strategies with 10 universally accepted principles in   the areas of human rights, labour, environment and  anti-corruption.  Givaudan has been a signatory to the UNGC since February  2010; we measure our progress towards sustainability against  its principles. This report is our communication on progress  (COP) towards implementing those principles and achieving  our sustainability targets. In addition, Givaudan is also involved  in the UNGC Swiss Network, through which we participate in  conferences and share best practice with other members.     For more information:   www.unglobalcompact.org CDP We demonstrate our commitment to monitoring and reducing  our greenhouse gas emissions and safeguarding water resources  through CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project.  CDP is an international, non-prot making organisation that  uses investor and buyer power to motivate companies and  governments to disclose their impact on the environment and  take meaningful steps to address climate change, deforestation  and water security. CDP works with institutional investors with  assets of USD 100 trillion; in 2017, more than 6,300 companies  with 55% of the global market capitalisation disclosed  environmental data through CDP. This is in addition to more  than 500 cities and 100 states and regions that have also  disclosed through the platform.     For more information:   www.cdp.net We recognise there are tangible business benets to disclosure  and action, as this helps us to ensure long-term sustainability  and protability, and equips us to respond to regulatory and  policy changes, such as the Paris Agreement.  It is our aim to communicate with   our stakeholders as transparently   as possible on strategic direction,  motivation, goals, development   and progress.  Our CDP disclosure is part of that efort. In our climate change  and water submission we report annually on greenhouse gas  emissions, energy use and the risks and opportunities  associated with climate change. Since we began participating in the CDP Climate Change  programme in 2007, we have disclosed our greenhouse gas  emissions every year as well as our reduction strategy and  performance for both investor and supply chain surveys.    Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Supported initiatives and strategic memberships 16 In 2017 we were awarded an A for climate action leadership,   the third consecutive year that Givaudan has achieved the  leadership level.  Our participation in the CDP Water programme also earned us  a ranking of A-, which shows steady improvement on previous  scores of B in 2016 and B- in 2015. Our Water Stewardship  Programme to measure and reduce water usage is part of our  Responsible Care Management System, which is signed and  endorsed by the CEO. The Global Reporting Initiative We have used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines   as the basis for our Sustainability Report since 2010. The GRI   is the leading and most widely adopted global standard for  sustainability reporting. The guidelines align with other  prominent standards, including the OECD guidelines for  multinational organisations; ISO 26000; the United Nations  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing  the United Nations Protect, Respect and Remedy Framework;  the UNGCs Ten Principles and the United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals.  Givaudan decided to become an early  adopter of the new GRI Standards,  which will become mandatory for all  reports published on or after 1 July 2018.  The use of the globally accepted GRI reporting guidelines  allows for better comparability, greater transparency and  accountability.    For more information:  www.globalreporting.org Sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) Sedex is a not-for-prot membership organisation dedicated   to driving improvements in responsible and ethical business  practices in global supply chains. Givaudan engages with Sedex  both for the assessment of its production sites and for the  assessment of its suppliers.  The registration of our production sites with Sedex is an  ongoing process related to acquisitions and the opening of   new production sites. To ensure high standards at these sites,  we are committed to start the registration process soon   after an acquisition has been announced or a new facility has  been commissioned. By the end of 2017, 36 out of 40 Givaudan production sites  registered with Sedex had completed the Sedex  Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) to share information  with customers. The same 36 sites have been audited against  the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) and all   are compliant.  Those not yet audited are recent acquisitions, for which there is  a robust plan to achieve SMETA compliance. Givaudan has been  an active user of the Sedex platform since 2008 and reviews  and updates the SAQ every year. Givaudan was involved in the  development of SMETA 6.0, the latest  version, which was launched in 2017  and is now used widely among our  customers. We fully support our suppliers engagement with Sedex; today,  335 suppliers are on Sedex, with 303 SAQs completed; 201  suppliers have been audited and 65% are fully compliant.

Tis chapter sets out the  material issues that fully reect  the trends and challenges facing  us today.   20 Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report 6 key stakeholder groups   identified 22 material issues  determined and prioritised 26 GRI topics mapped 9 SDGs  covered by Givaudan  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report 21 Materiality and stakeholders Stakeholder engagement Stakeholder engagement Listening to our stakeholders is a  core element of our sustainability  management practice.  Identifying and selecting stakeholders How we identify and select our stakeholders When Givaudan set out to develop a materiality matrix in 2011,  we carried out a wide-ranging assessment of our stakeholders  to see who had the greatest impact on us and on whom we  had the most efect. We identied six key stakeholder groups  from a list of more than 200 organisations: these were  customers, suppliers, investors, public and government  agencies, local communities and employees. Givaudan has developed specic tools to support interaction  with the various stakeholder panels at both a global and local  level. We also review and evaluate the diverse stakeholder  engagement initiatives that exist across the Company and  continuously monitor their relevance in a two-stage process. First, we map each direct engagement with an external  organisation by considering its relevance to several areas: our  stakeholder groups; the key issues in our materiality matrix;  the three focus areas of our sustainability approach and to the  Sustainable Development Goals on which we have an impact.  Then we look at every current or potential external engagement  and assess it against several criteria: local or global engagement;  membership criteria and membership fees; participating  customers and suppliers; participating competitors; participant  proles; type of sessions; size of groups; impact on our  sustainability approach; risks and benets. Based on the above we decide whether to pursue a current  engagement or engage with new organisations; we then  suggest actions to be taken within the engagement for the  next three years.     Disclosure 102 – 42      Stakeholder groups engaged by Givaudan Listening to our stakeholders is a core element of our  sustainability management practice. Their feedback helps us   to understand expectations and it contributes to the setting   of our overall sustainability strategy.  We gather the views of our stakeholders by inviting them to  discuss the Companys critical issues and strategic priorities. We  create dialogue groups to understand how our business afects  stakeholders and to determine the most material impacts to   be managed. The sustainability aspects listed in the Givaudan  materiality matrix are presented to the stakeholders to allow  them to conrm which they see as the most important topics,  and which they would like to discuss or know more about.  The process gives stakeholders a genuine role in setting the  direction of our sustainability approach and prioritising the  issues in the matrix. Their points are fed back to the  Sustainability Steering Committee (our main governance body  for sustainability) and management committees to shape  strategy and improve decision-making. Ultimately, through stakeholder dialogue, we seek to identify  opportunities to improve management and our relationships,  as well as co-create projects for our mutual benet. This allows  us to focus our drive for greater sustainability in those areas  that are most important to our key stakeholders. Givaudan has many channels for stakeholder dialogue spread  across diferent departments and teams; this also includes the  information and feedback we receive during the ordinary  course of business.

Dening report content and topic boundaries  Members of the Sustainability Leadership Team and the  Sustainability Steering Committee, together with members   of functions and divisions in all regions, monitor and evaluate  emerging sustainability themes on an ongoing basis. We use  the Givaudan materiality matrix to prioritise the aspects we  understand to be of most concern to our customers and other  key stakeholders. The matrix is reviewed through discussion with key  stakeholders (see page 22). We address the Companys critical  issues and strategic priorities, look for opportunities to improve  management and relationships, and identify possible projects  to work on together.    Disclosure 102 – 46 Signicant changes from previous   reporting periods In 2017 we updated our materiality matrix, which now fully  reects the trends, business issues and challenges facing us  today. We have identied 22 material aspects that are   detailed in the following pages.  Changes due to acquisitions The acquisition of Spicetec was completed in July 2016. Our  eco-efciency and social KPIs in this report therefore include  manufacturing data for Spicetec for the full year of 2017.  The acquisitions of Activ International and Vika B.V were  completed during 2017. No Activ International and Vika B.V.  manufacturing data are included in this report. This data will   be integrated in our 2018 Sustainability Report.  As listed in the annexe of the 2017 Annual Report (pages  199-203), 41 Givaudan locations are taken into account for the  environment, health and safety performance indicators. In  scope for this report are 39 out of the 41 active production sites  as stated in the Annual Report.  Sites acquired in 2016 are not in scope for the 2017 data.  However, two main non-production sites are included in our  2017 data. We have included these sites (Argenteuil, France;  Cincinnati, USA) since the rst publication of our Sustainability  Report in 2010 because of their size and importance.

Why is the issue material? The global food system is under increasing pressure to meet   the needs of the worlds population, especially those in the  poorer regions. As a key player in the food chain, Givaudan has  the opportunity to help improve access to food and encourage  healthy diets. We can also help combat malnutrition and  related problems such as obesity and diabetes.  Boundaries Within Givaudan We address this opportunity by constantly innovating and  developing tasty avour solutions that our customers can use  to create healthy and appealing consumer food products.  Outside Givaudan Our avour solutions enable our customers to ofer great tasting  food products to consumers. For example, our new generation  of plant protein products taste delicious and can be adopted   as part of a healthier diet at an afordable price. By working   with regional players we are able to deliver avour solutions   in diferent cultures and thus help consumers of all socio- demographic backgrounds to meet their basic dietary needs. Biodiversity Denition Contributing to the preservation of biodiversity along  Givaudans value chain.  Why is the issue material? Our business relies on a supply of diverse natural resources for  the creation of our avour and fragrance products. However,  climate change and the loss of habitats pose a threat to the  biodiversity that underpins the sources of those natural  materials. For that reason it is essential for the long-term  future of our Company that we assist in the efort to preserve  biodiversity.  Boundaries Within Givaudan We abide by global rules and policies on biodiversity  protection. Outside Givaudan We help to reduce the pressure on natural resources by  securing alternative sources of key natural raw materials.  Climate change Denition Mitigating efects on climate change along Givaudans value  chain by reducing emissions and adapting our capabilities. Why is the issue material? Climate change has a direct impact on the availability of our key  natural resources because it alters ecosystems and disrupts food  production and water supplies. As such, climate change poses a  signicant risk for Givaudan, but it also presents an opportunity  to adapt our processes and act to mitigate its efects. Boundaries Within Givaudan We work to improve the eco-efciency of our manufacturing  sites, with a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We  constantly assess the risk posed by climate change and adapt  our production sites in the afected areas. Outside Givaudan  We involve our supply chain, from the raw material suppliers  to indirect materials and service providers, in an efort to  reduce their GHG emissions.    103: Management Approach  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Materiality and stakeholders Material issues 28 Consumer health and well-being Denition Developing products and services that promote the health   and well-being of people as they experience our ingredients   in everyday consumer products.  Why is the issue material? As a key player in the food chain we are in a position to inuence  the well-being of society. For example, by developing great  tasting avour solutions for foods with lower levels of sugar,   fat and salt we can encourage the uptake of healthier diets. In addition, fragrance contributes to the sense of well-being  and can be used around the world to drive consumers to  choose products with desired health benets. Boundaries Within and outside Givaudan We create great tastes and smells to evoke a sense of well- being and encourage consumers to choose healthier foods   and adopt good hygiene practices.  Deforestation Denition Identifying raw materials linked to deforestation and  collaborating with suppliers and other key partners to avoid  deforestation along Givaudans supply chain. Why is the issue material? The growth in commodity production is the main driver of  deforestation today. Deforestation contributes to climate  change; it also destroys the eco-systems and biodiversity that  underpin the sources of natural ingredients that we buy for   our avour and fragrance products.  Boundaries Outside Givaudan  We map our supply chains for deforestation, and where  necessary engage suppliers in activities to end it.  Diversity & inclusion Denition Having a balanced workforce which reects the societies in  which Givaudan operates, including eforts to eliminate all  discrimination and to ensure the opportunity for people from  all backgrounds to succeed. Why is the issue material? Givaudan operates in many diferent countries around the  world, and in order to be efective, we need to understand the  cultural diferences that we encompass. Sensitivity to diversity  and promoting inclusion is key to developing a broad range of  views within the Company. We believe equal opportunities for  everyone is important to our success. Boundaries Within Givaudan We embrace diversity throughout our organisation and recruit  to build a representative and inclusive workforce.  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report 29 Materiality and stakeholders Material issues Economic performance  Denition Operating a protable business model for the long-term  viability of the Company.

The strategy also  views economic success as inseparable from high standards   in environmental and social stewardship. Boundaries Within Givaudan  We ensure that our business is nancially sustainable from   the short to the long-term.  Outside Givaudan We support our customers own market expansion plans and  provide them with growth opportunities through the use   of our products. Meanwhile, we work in partnership with  producers and suppliers to transform the way we source;   to secure supply and create new value to be shared by all  stakeholders in our supply chains. Employee health, safety and wellness Denition Providing a safe and healthy working environment and  encouraging responsible employee behaviours.  Why is the issue material? Givaudans on-going success depends on the health and safety  of our employees and our eforts to always improve their  well-being in and outside the workplace. Boundaries Within Givaudan  We reduce the number of health and safety incidents by  improving the workplace environment, safety behaviour   and awareness. Governance and business conduct Denition Ensuring business practices are in alignment with international  standards, local laws and Givaudan standards in countries of  operation. Safeguarding the efective functioning of the  governing bodies of Givaudan. Why is the issue material? Corporate governance systems ensure that our Company is  managed in the interests of shareholders (including minority  shareholders), while complying with international laws. Boundaries Within Givaudan  We ensure our practices are aligned with international  standards and we safeguard the function of our own  governing bodies. Our management systems include checks  and balances to control risk and to oversee accountability   of management. Human rights Denition Ensuring that Givaudan respects human rights by acting   with due diligence, as dened in the UN Guiding Principles   for Business and Human Rights. Why is the issue material? Respect for human rights is an essential guide to the right way  to do business. A commitment to high ethical standards, as well  as transparency and honesty in our dealings with customers,  suppliers, employees and the communities where we operate,  enables us to grow responsibly and share our success.  Boundaries Within Givaudan  We ensure that we respect human rights by acting with due  diligence, as dened in the UN Guiding Principles for Business  and Human Rights. Outside Givaudan We ensure our suppliers adhere to the same principles.  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Materiality and stakeholders Material issues 30 Labour/management relations Denition Fostering collaborative labour relations with employees and  employee elected representatives. Why is the issue material? Good relations between management and staf are necessary  to the operation of a sustainable and viable business. Staf  should be respected, listened to and provided with adequate  working conditions. Boundaries Within Givaudan We encourage good labour and management relations and  follow commonly recognised best practices. Local community development Denition Recognising and supporting the broader development goals of  local communities where Givaudan operates in and sources from. Why is the issue material? Maintaining a good reputation in communities where we have  a manufacturing or commercial presence helps to attract the  right talent and personnel to join the Company. In areas where we source raw materials, we can help to secure  the long-term supply of those ingredients by supporting the  development of local communities. By fostering good relations  we can work together on causes that benet the community;  help to protect local ecosystems; and support livelihoods.  Sourcing is one of the most signicant areas of interest for   our stakeholders, especially our customers.

Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report 31 Materiality and stakeholders Material issues Product quality and safety Denition Ensure our products are safe and comply with all applicable  laws, regulations as well as customer requirements. Why is the issue material? The safety of our products and the safety of the consumer are  of the utmost importance. We have to provide our customers  with products and services that meet all agreed requirements  and applicable legislation, or we run the risk of extra costs and  damaging our reputation. The quality of our products is the key to our success and that of  our customers. We place their need for quality at the heart of  everything we do.  Boundaries Within and outside Givaudan We ensure our products are safe for people and the  environment when used as intended and that they comply  with all local laws as a minimum requirement. We gather  information on the origin of ingredients to support compliance  and to contribute to food safety and issue management. Raw material availability Denition Ensuring a stable supply of raw materials used in Givaudans  products. Why is the issue material? In order to operate a successful business we need to ensure  continuity of supply. However, each raw material we purchase  has a potential supply risk that we need to understand and  mitigate. This is a key activity of our procurement department. Boundaries Outside Givaudan  Our procurement teams work closely with suppliers to  monitor supply risks and ensure continuity of supply. We build  relationships with local producers around the world and work  in partnership to secure the long-term future of the crops and  natural raw materials on which we depend. Responsible sourcing Denition Fostering compliance with high standards in health, safety,  social, environmental and business integrity in the way we  source. Why is the issue material? By expanding our responsible sourcing initiatives we are able to  reduce our environmental and social impact. Our sourcing  strategy also helps to mitigate the risks inherent in our complex  supply chains.

Why is the issue material? We focus on employee development to improve skills and  productivity; to constantly adapt skills to requirements and to  ofer the best opportunities to our people. This helps to  improve retention of staf, reduce costs and increase our  revenue. It also makes Givaudan a great place to work. Boundaries Within Givaudan  There is an engaging and inspiring environment for employees  to realise their career aspirations. We foster proactive talent  development, ofer targeted technical and functional support  and work to strengthen our leadership capabilities. In addition,  we underpin the growth of a strong workforce by nurturing a  pipeline of industry experts and future leaders to develop skills  for sustained success; similarly we seek to attract local talent  and industry experts to support growth in all markets.  Traceability Denition Understanding the supply chain and tracing the provenance of  raw materials we use from their origin to the nal formulation. Why is the issue material? Our customers increasingly seek assurances on the provenance  of raw materials and their production; also that we adhere to  responsible supply chain practices. Boundaries Outside Givaudan  We work with our direct suppliers to map our supply chains.  Mapping helps us to understand how a supply chain is  organised and to collect data on the number of intermediary  suppliers involved, their role, importance and geographical  location. In this way we are able to identify any potential risk  of non-compliance with our Responsible Sourcing Policy and  to work with our suppliers on a solution. Transparency and reporting Denition Disclosing an adequate level of information and data in  alignment with recognised frameworks and in compliance with  local laws and regulations. Why is the issue material? Transparency is expected in all areas of our business, from  supply chain data to R&D information, formulas and business  processes. Increased transparency has a positive impact on our  reputation, which boosts loyalty among customers and  employees, and therefore our bottom line. Boundaries  Within and outside Givaudan  We have to be open to sharing data and information, internally  and externally. Waste management Denition Pursuing a culture of waste elimination by adequately  managing all Givaudans waste streams. Why is the issue material?

Assessing and addressing water risks at  owned operations and in our supply chain. Why is the issue material? Water is essential in our manufacturing activities as well as in  our value chain. But there is increasing competition for access  to water in areas where availability is limited due to climate  change. Therefore we need to use water efciently in order to  keep our operations running; and consumers are seeking  products that are manufactured in a water-efcient way. Boundaries Within and outside Givaudan We make efcient use of this increasingly precious natural  resource and limit the environmental impact of the way we  consume and discharge water. Womens empowerment Denition Implementing policies and programmes that are consistent  with promoting equal opportunities for all. Why is the issue material? Equal treatment of women and men is not just the right thing  to do – it is also good for business. The full participation of  women at Givaudan makes sound business sense now and in  the future. A broad concept of sustainability and corporate  responsibility that embraces womens empowerment as a key  goal will benet us all. Womens empowerment is essential to  expand economic growth and promote social development.  Boundaries Within Givaudan We implement policies and programmes that are consistent  with promoting equal opportunities for all.

We work in  partnership with local producers  and suppliers to transform the  way we source and create new  value to be shared by all. Our principles and what we expect from   our suppliers When consumers are inspired by a avour or a fragrance, they  increasingly want to know the origin of its ingredients and   how it has been produced. To help our customers answer these  questions, we seek to ensure our materials are responsibly  sourced; that the impact of their production on the  environment is minimised and that local producers and their  communities truly benet from supplying our industry. We   call this Sourcing for Shared Value, an approach that rests on  three distinct areas of sourcing practice: Responsible Sourcing,  Sourcing at Origin and supporting Communities at Source.  Sourcing for Shared Value enables us to  create new value for all of those involved  in the supply of our raw materials and  services, from the farmer to our  customers. Givaudans approach to sourcing springs from a principled  commitment to deal ethically and respect human rights  wherever we have inuence and do business. We naturally  expect the same of our suppliers and seek to work with those  who have strong business ethics and demonstrate respect for  people and the environment. Our principles stem from those encapsulated in the United  Nations Global Compact, to which Givaudan has been a  signatory since 2010. The compact is a strategic policy initiative  for businesses that wish to align their activities with universally  accepted standards in the areas of human rights, environment  and anti-corruption.  The UNGC principles include the elimination of all forms of  forced and compulsory labour and the efective abolition   of child labour. Under principles 1 – 6, we expect our suppliers  to respect human rights standards and in particular we ask  them to abide by all laws relating to the abolition of child  labour and human trafcking. In addition, under our own  Principles of Conduct, Givaudan will not employ children   or do business with any suppliers that use child labour. As per principles 7 – 9 of the UNGC, Givaudan also expects   its suppliers to support a precautionary approach to  environmental challenges; to take initiatives that promote  greater environmental responsibility; and to encourage   the development and implementation of environmentally  friendly technologies. We are also committed to the Ethical Trade Initiative Base  Code and audit supplier practices regarding child labour. These  state that there shall be no new recruitment of child labour;  companies shall develop or participate in and contribute to  policies and programmes that provide for the transition of   any child found to be performing child labour to enable her or  him to attend and remain in quality education until no longer   a child; children and young persons under 18 shall not be  employed at night or in hazardous conditions; these policies  and procedures shall conform to the provisions of the relevant  International Labour Organization (ILO) standards.      www.ethicaltrade.org/eti-base-code Furthermore, as a member of the AIM-PROGRESS  organisation, we follow the recommendations on how to  address human rights issues. Givaudan is also a member of   the Natural Resources Stewardship Circle, which is strongly  involved in defending human rights and labour standards,  particularly in remote local communities.  Sustainable performance review Sourcing for Shared Value 38 Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Finally, Givaudan complies with the California Senate Bill 657,  the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, which  requires retail and manufacturing companies to disclose the  precautions they have taken or will take to eliminate slavery  and human trafcking from their supply chains. In this context,  Givaudan acknowledges its obligations under the UK Modern  Slavery Act and will publish a corresponding statement on its  website in due course.  Our sourcing practices Sourcing for Shared Value consists of three sourcing practices:  Responsible Sourcing, Sourcing at Origin and Communities at  Source, all of which we continued to develop and expand in 2017.  Following the launch of our Responsible Sourcing Policy in   2016 and its implementation through our Responsible Sourcing  Programme, we evaluate our supply chains and drive  compliance with our standards in health and safety, social,  environment and business integrity. Through our Sourcing at  Origin initiatives we improve the long-term supply security of  strategic natural ingredients and create new value within the  local supply chains. Meanwhile, we believe that communities  from whom we source make a contribution to our business.   So we support them with a range of social and environmental  conservation projects that help to bring stability and improve  the quality of life. Responsible Sourcing Programme From principles to policy and programmes  Givaudan published its Responsible Sourcing Policy in 2016.   The policy was the rst of its kind in the avour and fragrance  industry; its general principles are in accordance with those  outlined above and they state the following: raw materials  must be traceable back to their source; our activities should  not contribute to deforestation; production, packaging and  transport must comply with legal requirements; smallholders  must be included and continuous improvement should always  be our goal.  The policy also sets out what Givaudan expects of its suppliers  in standards of health and safety; social and environmental  responsibility and business integrity. The standards and  requirements apply to everyone in our supply chains, from  rst-tier suppliers to primary producers of raw materials;  workers and employees; and intermediary suppliers and   service providers.  Under the policy, suppliers are required to keep their  workplaces safe and healthy. Accommodation must be safe   and hygienic with clean drinking water and adequate  sanitation provided. Emergency exits, appropriate safety  equipment and training must be available as well as access   to medical care. There must also be procedures to ensure  applicable requirements are identied, kept up to date and  communicated to employees. With regard to employment and labour, Givaudan and its  suppliers are required to respect the human rights of all the  people with whom we come into contact. Employment should  be freely entered into; suppliers must not use child labour or  any form of forced or bonded labour. Workers are to be treated  equally and with respect; paid fair wages; allowed freedom of  association and have access to grievance procedures. In  addition, those suppliers who are part of a raw material supply  chain must respect the land rights of local communities and  producers. The policy also states that there must be fair and  transparent benet sharing. Furthermore, the Responsible Sourcing Policy sets our clear  environmental requirements. Manufacturing sites must apply  environmental management principles; the policy calls for  conservation of environmental values at raw material source,  and the use of best agricultural and processing techniques.  Finally, our suppliers are expected to maintain the highest  degree of business integrity. They must abide by the local laws  and international standards and conventions on bribery, gifts,  entertainment and hospitality, money laundering, fraud, fair  competition, condential information and reporting. The implementation of such a comprehensive policy across a  global network of suppliers amounts to an enormous task.  Nevertheless, we view the policy as an opportunity to drive  transformation in the supply chain. Our approach is to work  hand-in-hand with the suppliers to help them achieve  compliance with the requirements. This is the purpose of  Givaudans Responsible Sourcing Programme: to implement  the policy while encouraging supplier leadership and fostering  supply chain innovation. How we drive transformation  As already mentioned, Givaudan believes the journey towards  responsible sourcing will be a process of continuous  improvement, in which we work in partnership with our  suppliers. In 2017, in an efort to drive that process forward,  Givaudan announced a set of ambitious targets for our  Responsible Sourcing Programme. Proportion of spending on local suppliers at signicant locations   of operation It is the Companys common practice to prefer sourcing from locally based  suppliers (dened as suppliers who are based in the same country as the  Givaudan facility). This is reected in the 85% by value of non-raw  material purchased locally in 2017. For raw materials, 26% by value were  sourced locally in 2017. Several of the raw materials we buy cannot be  sourced in countries other than the ones where it naturally grows.    Disclosure 204 – 1  39 Sustainable performance review Sourcing for Shared Value  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report It is our aim that by 2020 all of our main  direct suppliers should reach full  compliance with their audits; and that  90% of raw materials volume, of a  natural origin, is responsibly sourced. Our supply chains comprise thousands of people and businesses  in many diferent parts of the world. The Responsible Sourcing  Programme divides the task of implementing the policy into a  two-pronged approach: one addresses the main direct suppliers,  to audit their sites against a protocol that covers the details   of the policy; the other focuses on our raw material supply  chains of natural origin. In both cases we take a collaborative  approach to develop a shared sense of responsibility for   making improvements. Supplier Engagement The rst step is to engage suppliers by introducing them to   the Responsible Sourcing Policy. So far, 13,015 of our indirect  materials and services (IM&S) suppliers have received the  policy. They represent 96% of our total spend for 2017. Those  who acknowledged receipt of the policy represent 52% of that  total spend. In addition to our IM&S suppliers, there are 442  raw materials suppliers who have received the policy. They  represent 63% of the total 2017 spend; the acknowledgments  represent 50% of total spend. Main direct suppliers Our target is to ensure that all our main direct suppliers are  fully compliant with our Responsible Sourcing Policy by 2020.  We work with them to ensure their sites are audited against   a protocol that covers the policy requirements. This is done   via the Sedex platform, SMETA, or an equivalent protocol.  Our Procurement team works closely with suppliers to guide  them through their audit process and make sure that non- conformities are closed as soon as possible. Only at this point  do we consider an audit to be compliant.  An important benet of these audits is that they are included in  the mutual recognition agreement between AIM-PROGRESS  members. This reduces audit fatigue for suppliers by  encouraging them to share their audit reports with many  customers to avoid duplicate audits. By the end of 2017, we had made good progress towards our  goals, as the following set of indicators show. In total, 310 key  raw material suppliers are now registered with Sedex. These  suppliers represent over 70% of our raw materials spend. In  2014, we started to include our indirect materials and services  suppliers in the Sedex initiative. To date, 25 such suppliers have  joined Sedex.  We have also made good progress towards our supplier audits  target. The total number of our direct suppliers audited was  201 at the end of the year. Also in 2017, we worked to ensure  that the audited suppliers had closed all open non- conformities, to achieve a compliance rate with our  Responsible Sourcing Policy of 65%. Assessing end-to-end supply chains for raw materials of  natural origin When it comes to key raw materials of natural origin, Givaudan  goes further to create transparency by collecting information  on intermediary suppliers right back to the farmers and local  producers. In mapping each supply chain we gather data on  the number of intermediary suppliers, their role, importance  and geographical location. The analysis also enables us to  identify potential risks of non-compliance, and if conrmed we  work with the supplier to nd a solution. If necessary, we will  carry out eld visits and pursue deeper engagement through  collaborative action plans and support transformational  activities as a second step.  Percentage of new suppliers screened using social criteria  We encourage our main suppliers to register with Sedex, a data-sharing  platform to improve supply chain practices. – Total number of signicant suppliers identied: 400 – Total number of suppliers assessed to date: 303 – Total number of suppliers assessed in 2017: 5 – Percentage of suppliers assessed to date: 76% – Percentage of suppliers assessed in 2017: 1%    Disclosure 308 – 1, 414 – 1 Suppliers with signicant socials risks and preventive measures  Child labour or young workers exposed to hazardous work can be an issue  across the entire supply chain covering our own operations and our  suppliers, and 100% of our operations are assessed for risk in this area. Since 2008, Givaudan has been an active user of the Sedex platform which  incorporates human rights risks in its assessments. Since 2010, all  Givaudan manufacturing sites have been registered on Sedex and  completed Sedex self-assessment questionnaires (SAQ) to share  information with customers. Givaudan annually reviews and updates the  SAQ. To date, 36 Givaudan sites have been audited according to SMETA  standards.  Signicant suppliers are assessed for risk, and in 2017 a total of 3 key raw  material suppliers, out of 310, were registered with Sedex. These suppliers  represent over 0.3% of our spend. Also during the year, we worked to  ensure that the audited suppliers had closed all open non-conformities.   At the end of 2017, our compliance rate was of 65%.     Disclosure 407 – 1, 408 – 1, 409 – 1  Sustainable performance review Sourcing for Shared Value 40 Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report We consider a raw material of natural origin to be responsibly  sourced when there are no gaps in the evaluation of its supply  chain against the Responsible Sourcing Policy. Or, where   gaps have been identied, appropriate improvement plans   are in place. Our target is to ensure that 90% of raw materials volume of  natural origin is responsibly sourced by 2020. We have started  the assessment and carried out our rst eld visits. This work  will be expanded in the coming years to reach the 90% target.  We aim to have addressed the remaining 10% of natural supply  chains by 2030.  In support of our responsible sourcing activities, Givaudan  became a member in 2017 of The Forest Trust (TFT), a global  non-prot organisation focused on transforming supply chains  for the benet of nature and people. TFT will support Givaudan  in implementing its Responsible Sourcing Programme through  supply chain assessments and, where needed, co-designing  innovative solutions with supply chain partners that create  value for all.     Management Approach (103 – 2, 103 – 3): Topic 308, 407,  408, 409, 414, pages 37 – 40 Sourcing at Origin To secure supply and create value locally  The practice of Sourcing at Origin involves working in  partnership with producers and local suppliers to secure   the long-term supply of vulnerable natural ingredients.   By providing knowledge and the latest technical solutions,   the practice also enables producers to develop new value in  their crops and to strengthen their economic fabric for the  future. A dedicated team within our Procurement function   is responsible for implementing and managing our Sourcing   at Origin initiatives.  Te team is based mostly in countries  where we source critical natural raw  materials, working hand-in-hand with  smallholder producers and suppliers to set  up innovative upstream sourcing models. We source directly from producers through collection networks  and exclusive farming partnerships and build processing  capabilities at origin. Sourcing at Origin can also be done in  partnership with our suppliers. We operate many diferent sourcing initiatives around the  world. For example, since 2014, our patchouli oil collection  network in Indonesia has allowed us to develop a close  Success story Geranium, Egypt Givaudan has formed a partnership with Fridal, a supplier  of geranium oil in Egypt, to develop a high-quality and  long-term source of this important fragrance ingredient.  Fridal has invested in a large-scale plantation in an oasis  region in the Western Desert of Egypt, which enables us  to control quality and ensure a consistent supply. The  plantation is the product of a partnership with local  experts of Fridal. Thanks to investments in modern equipment and  renewable energy technology, the wells and pumps at  the site are run on solar power. Detailed monitoring to  limit water consumption is also carried out. As well as  being a Sourcing at Origin project, geranium oil also  comes under the scope of our Responsible Sourcing  Programme. sourcing relationship with local producers. We have a similarly  strong local presence in Madagascar where, since 2015, we  have been collecting clove leaf oil directly from hundreds   of smallholder producers. In 2016 we opened the NATEMA  transformation facility on the island, a joint venture with   our long-term local partner Henri Fraise & Fils.   Communities at Source Supporting those who produce our natural ingredients Producers of natural raw materials on which we rely make   an important contribution to our business. In return, we are  committed to support them to build stable and secure lives.  We have supported local producer communities for more   than a decade through a variety of social and environmental  projects. Depending on the challenges identied for a  particular supply chain, targeted action plans are developed in  cooperation with the producers, suppliers and/or other  organisations such as NGOs. We support projects in education,  health and nutrition as well as good practice in agriculture and  production. We also assist producing communities to safeguard  their environment and natural resources. Throughout 2017 we have continued to extend our eforts in the  areas of natural resources preservation and fair trade certication.  41 Sustainable performance review Sourcing for Shared Value  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Success stories Clove leaf oil, Madagascar Since 2011, Givaudan has collaborated with a local NGO   in Madagascar on a natural resources preservation  programme for the members of our clove leaf oil  collection network. The programme aims to reduce   the environmental impact of the distillation process by  installing more efcient equipment and encouraging the  plantation of trees for rewood. In 2017, the programme  increased the coverage to 23 village associations  (organised groups of smallholder producers). As part of  the programme, producers are paid a premium and plant  one tree for each kilogram of clove leaf oil they produce.  In 2017, producers planted over 100,000 trees. Our Communities at Source projects touch thousands of raw  material producers worldwide and we continue to develop new  initiatives in diferent supply chains. There are many examples,  such as the partnership we formed in 2012 with a farmer  cooperative and distiller of organic fair-trade vetiver oil on Haiti;  a biodiversity project with Conservation International involving  tonka bean harvesters in Venezuela, which has been running  since 2008; a rural development programme launched in 2010  for vanilla farmers in Madagascar; also in 2010, a project with  ylang ylang producers to protect the natural environment in  Mohli, Comoros; and a cooperative and research partnership to  preserve lavender and lavandin in France, which began in 2012. Our commitment is also demonstrated through the activities   of the Givaudan Foundation. The Foundation is a not-for-prot  organisation that funds projects to help build more secure   futures for communities and their environments. Many of our  Communities at Source projects are supported by the Foundation.

Working with the international NGO  Initiative Dveloppement (ID) we are installing improved  and energy efcient distillation units for smallholder  producers.  The producers are also trained in good distillation  practices to engage them in reducing their consumption  of rewood, improve their yields and health and safety.  The energy efcient units that were installed in 2017  achieved a saving of 260 tonnes of fuelwood during that  year. In 2018, these units will make it possible to save an  estimated 600 tonnes of fuelwood a year. Patchouli oil production,  Indonesia Among the projects commenced in 2017 is a new  partnership with the international NGO Swisscontact   to further promote sustainable and traceable patchouli  oil production in Indonesia.  Through a comprehensive three-year programme,  co-funded by the Givaudan Foundation, smallholder  farmers and distillers in our collection network are  supported through training in good agricultural and  distillation practices.  The producers are supported to reduce the environmental  impact of production, improve health and safety measures  as well as increase their yields. The programme will also  involve the planting of rewood trees and the installation  of energy efcient distillation units for smallholder  distillers. It will help to strengthen household nancial  management and nutritional practices through training  aimed at women involved in the patchouli supply chain.

But innovation goes beyond simply creating better solutions   for our customers. Innovating Responsibly means considering  the impact of our products and services on the environment  and taking the opportunity to lead change for the better by  adding value to benet consumers and society. These are among the key material issues that we seek to  address throughout our supply chain in the way our products  are designed, manufactured and ultimately used by the  consumer. As we develop new technologies and ways of  engaging the senses, we can create avour solutions that  enable our customers to tackle global food challenges and  improve access to food. We also seek to inuence consumer  behaviour positively by developing fragrance products that  promote health and well-being.  Our three focus areas in innovation are the development   of alternative sources of key natural raw materials; the  development of avours and fragrances that enable health   and well-being; and the application of sustainable processes,  such as green chemistry and biotransformation.  In all areas of our activity, from avours and fragrances to  active beauty products, we aim to make sustainability part   of every new breakthrough. Naturals We expand our customers access to natural ingredients and  solutions. By investigating and developing alternative sources  of key natural raw materials we contribute to the protection   of fragile natural sources.  How we meet demand for natural avours Naturalness is one of the most important drivers of demand in  our market, as consumers look for products they can trust from  recognised natural sources. For consumers, natural means as  intended by nature and the less processed or complex the  product, the more natural it is perceived to be. Yet this  increasing demand for natural ingredients is putting additional  pressure on our planets resources.  At Givaudan, we take a holistic approach to ofering our  customers natural avours in a sustainable way. As the worlds  leading supplier of avour ingredients, we have an important  role to play in ensuring that the increased demand can be   met responsibly.  Today our avour innovation programme is focused on natural  enabling technologies and new ingredients. We harness the  power of nature itself by using enhanced fermentation and  new technologies to convert raw materials into highly desirable  natural avour ingredients. We are also developing alternative  sources of key raw materials for much -  loved avours such as those of the citrus  family.   Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Sustainable performance review Innovating Responsibly 44 Citrus continues to be a dynamic and expanding consumer  trend in beverages and other products; it is extremely diverse  and can be used as a primary base, or as an accentuating  avour. Citrus is used widely in savoury, confectionery and  beverage brands. However, some of the key citrus growing areas have been hit  by Greening disease recently, which if left untreated causes the  tree to die; and in 2017, Hurricane Irma had a major impact on  the Florida crop. The reduction in yield and quality has put a lot  of pressure on the supply of citrus worldwide.  The creation of new sources of key raw materials, therefore,  plays an important part in enabling us to maintain supply to  our customers. In 2017 we continued to develop our SunThesis citrus  ingredients collection, a range of natural citrus oil replacers.   The SunThesis ingredients are citrus compounds designed to  function like original citrus oil; while they come from non-citrus  sources they provide that great citrus avour. SunThesis  products are designed to be as or more stable than the   original oils. Innovative solutions such as these enable us to meet our  customers needs while relieving some of the pressure on  increasingly scarce citrus resources.      More details and recent coverage on SunThesis can   be found here. Doing more with less to create new fragrance signatures  The aim of our Naturals group in the Fragrance Division is   to furnish its perfumers with the best palette of natural  ingredients, so that they can develop diferentiating olfactive  signatures. This is achieved by reinventing some families of  natural materials through our approach of Crafting with  Purpose.  We are developing new upcycling  techniques to create luscious scents and  concentrate molecules to yield intensely  powerful notes.  In 2017 Givaudan achieved an industry rst by making Apple Oil,  a fragrance note, directly from fruit puree, a process side  stream of juice production. The breakthrough lies in the way  we remove the water from the puree and then craft the nal  extract. Normally, notes derived from fruit are too watery to   be used in perfumery applications. Another novel technique allows us to produce more fragrance  with less material. By concentrating citrus molecules we obtain  a multiplier efect at low quantities. This approach has been  used to create several Citrus Coeur qualities, which now form  part of our exclusive Citrus Collection. While we rely on our sourcing practices for a supply of  sustainably produced raw materials, we also foster research  and development at source, working with the plants  themselves.  In our Active Beauty business, we use nature as a source of  inspiration to develop new active ingredients. Revivyl is a  recent example, which is based on the Orobanche rapum, a  unique European chlorophyll-free plant. Health and well-being We ofer novel sensory experiences, unique products and  solutions to help our customers promote consumer health   and well-being. Our avour products include authentic taste  alternatives for key ingredients such as sugar and salt; and   we have enabled new sources of protein for integrated  solutions where taste and avour play a key role in food and  beverage products. Similarly, in fragrances we have developed  our understanding of how odour and smell can be used to  positively impact health and well-being. Flavours that promote healthy choices Givaudan is pioneering work to promote health and well-being  through our avour creations. In response to customer demand  for healthier and more nutritious options we have established a  variety of programmes to develop great-tasting alternatives for  ingredients such as sugar and salt. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an  estimated 2.5 million deaths could be prevented each year if  global salt consumption was reduced to the recommended  level. Food manufacturers have responded by reducing salt   Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report 45 Sustainable performance review Innovating Responsibly levels, but fear that consumers might turn away from low-salt  products in the belief that they wont taste as satisfying as  standard products. A slow and steady approach to salt  reduction has proven popular, giving consumers taste buds  time to adjust. Our goal is to develop avours so  satisfying that less sugar or salt can  still deliver full enjoyment.  We are providing customers with solutions for healthier  products in line with salt target initiatives. TasteSolutions Salt  are avours that help customers to develop healthier new  products, or reduce sodium levels in existing branded lines.  TasteSolutions Sweetness delves deep into the science behind  sugar to analyse its unique taste, mouthfeel and aroma at a  molecular level. We work to nd alternatives that match on  every level.  TasteSolutions Mouthfeel is another avour programme  aimed at promoting healthier diets. The technology seeks to  minimise fat by replicating the satisfying mouthfeel that comes  from high levels of that ingredient.      More information on:   – Sweetness  – Mouthfeel Among the products we have commercialised in the last 18  months are Pollux, for sweet taste enhancement in beverages,  yoghurt and cereals; Akira for clean-label taste enhancement   in soups, sauces and salted snacks; and Dairy Mouthfeel  ingredients, which provide the richness and mouthfeel for  product formulations with less fat. New sources of protein At Givaudan, we are keen to play our part in addressing the  massive impact that meat production and consumption has on  the environment and on our health. So, alongside our work to  create authentic and healthier substitutes for salt and sugar,  we are also enabling vegetable proteins as an alternative  source of meat avours, and developing integrated solutions  for beverages and savoury foods.  Pound-for-pound, gallon-for-gallon, animal-sourced foods use  vastly more water and carbon to produce than plant-based  foods. Consumers are responding by making an efort to cut  down on their meat consumption. Flexitarianism is on the rise,  a trend that refers to consumers who consciously reduce the  amount of meat they eat and have meat-free days. We have dedicated considerable efort to understanding this  category and to develop tools to transform vegetable proteins  into a real meat experience. This has enabled us to build  expertise in creating consumer-preferred avours for meat  analogue products. We are elevating vegetable proteins to   the high expectation of exitarian taste and designing meat  substitute products that recreate the experience and  enjoyment of real meat. As well as new ingredients to improve  the authenticity and impact of meat avours, we have also  developed taste-masking solutions to enhance the palatability  of high-protein drinks and other products. Exploration in these areas is supported through our  involvement in a number of research programmes. For  example, the Plant Meat Matters Consortium at Wageningen  University in the Netherlands is looking for solutions that  address the taste and texture challenges of non-animal protein.  We are working with students to design the avours and smells  necessary to create enticing plant-based meat alternatives. Fragrances and active products to create a sense   of well-being Consumers are increasingly certain about which products they  prefer and expect brands to fully integrate health, beauty and  sustainability in their product oferings. When crafting fragrances, we always seek to inspire a sense of  well-being in the consumer, while for many of our customers  the promotion of health and well-being is a key strategy. In the last quarter of 2017 we created a Centre of Excellence  dedicated to this area of innovation. The group includes  platforms focused on malodour control, neurosciences and oral  care. The teams are working on the promotion of health and  well-being through the removal of negative inuences such as  malodour and using fragrance to positively inuence mood and  behaviour. We are also working on the delivery of positive  experiences in the mouth and mouth hygiene.  We are committed to leading the  sensory innovation space in well-being,  behaviour and sleep.  The lack of sleep is a public health epidemic and a growing  global concern. Consumers are continuously looking for ways  to improve the quality of their sleep and turning to new  applications such as aromatherapy and connected devices. We  used our extensive knowledge of the efects of fragrance on  brain and behaviour to develop and launch a new technology in  2017 to help people sleep more soundly. DreamScentz works  on the link between fragrance, positive states of mind and a   Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Sustainable performance review Innovating Responsibly 46 proper nights sleep. The technology ofers new opportunities  for our customers who want to expand their product portfolio  to include fragrance solutions that enhance the sleeping  experience for consumers around the world. In Active Beauty, again we develop new products always with  health and well-being in mind. As part of our commitment to  furthering our knowledge in skin health and to extend our  expertise, Givaudan Active Beauty inaugurated its Skin Expertise  Technical Centre in Pomacle, France, in 2017. The centres mission  is to accelerate cosmetic research and development projects; it  ofers high throughput screening capabilities in order to more  rapidly identify and select lead compounds with new biological  activities. The new centre will enable us to bring more value to  our customers and benets to the consumer as we develop the  active ingredients of tomorrow. Our Active Beauty Research and Development Department has  also made great progress in understanding the mechanisms of  skin renewal. By cracking the secret of this complex natural  cycle, the team has been able to develop the rst active  cosmetic ingredient to accelerate the entire skin regeneration  process. Revivyl is based on the Orobanche rapum, a unique  European chlorophyll-free plant, and has been designed to  deliver targeted biological actions from the lower to the higher  layers of the epidermis, while protecting the skin microbiome.  This innovative active ingredient meets consumer desire for a  natural way to look and feel better with younger skin. Sustainable processes We ofer our customers the ingredients palette of the future   by using green chemistry and optimising opportunities derived  from traditional and novel forms of biotransformation. In  designing innovative processes, we consider biodegradability  and promote the reuse, recycling and recovery of by-products. Making avours with plant materials and natural  processes When developing new ingredients, we always consider their  impact on the environment. With that in mind, we look for   new ways to make avour compounds via natural processes,  such as fermentation, and use sustainable plant materials.  Biotransformation is another process inspired by nature,   which allows us to use natural ingredients as raw materials   and harness the power of micro-organisms to create   natural avours. We also run a programme to identify avour ingredients   that can be derived from process side streams. Evolving the palette using green chemistry Modern biotechnology techniques enable us to produce  existing molecules or create new captives. In designing  innovative processes, we also look at how we can reuse and  recover process side streams. By following green chemistry  principles, we ensure ingredients are safe by design and that  our manufacturing processes make efcient use of energy   and materials, while reducing water consumption and waste.  Our latest sustainable molecule is the soothing skin agent  BisaboLife. The product was launched in 2017 and is fully  bio-sourced. Givaudans Active Beauty business used an  exclusive fermentation process to create this pure, natural,  biodegradable and sustainable source of alpha-bisabolol.   47 Sustainable performance review Acting for Our Environment  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Acting for Our Environment At Givaudan we are taking action  for the environment across our  operations and throughout our  value chain.  We are implementing an ambitious agenda to reduce  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve eco-efciency,  waste and resource management. We assess every aspect of  our activities and those of our suppliers to nd opportunities   to limit our environmental impact – from purchasing 100%  renewable electricity to encouraging zero deforestation. Our  targets to reduce GHG emissions are approved by the Science  Based Targets initiative and are aligned with the global efort  to limit climate change to 2C of warming.  This chapter details the great progress we have made in  addressing the issues of climate change, waste management  and water stewardship; it also describes our eforts to take  account of the environmental impact of our products and  foster local community development. Ensuring environmental stewardship Givaudan is a signatory to the International Council of Chemical  Associations Responsible Care Global Charter. As a signatory,  Givaudan commits to drive continuous improvement   and achieve excellence in environmental, health and safety  performance. That commitment is formalised in our EHS policy, a  set of principles embraced by the highest level of our leadership.  In accordance with the charter, our Responsible Care  Management System (RCMS) provides a solid framework for  implementing our policies on a day-to-day basis. Included in  the RCMS is our environmental management system. The  target setting, documentation of improvement initiatives and  regular performance reporting by individual sites fulls the  requirements and principles of the ISO 14001 Environmental  Management System. For local market related reasons some   of our sites have had their environmental management system  certied against the ISO 14001 standard. To date, six of our  manufacturing locations are concerned: Cimanggis, Daman,  Pedro Escobedo, Sant Celoni, Vernier and Volketswil. In addition to a set of strong principles and standards, we have  built a management team of experts including members of the  Environment Centre of Expertise, the Environmental Health  and Safety (EHS) eld organisation, operations, supply chain  and procurement functions. Its role is to develop our global  roadmap and support and encourage the business to meet our  environmental targets. Through a collaborative approach, the team seeks to establish  processes to engage with the leadership of the business  functions and drive progress on the material aspects of climate  change, water stewardship, waste management, transparency  and reporting, and product environmental and societal impact.  The mission is to translate targets and commitments into  optimal plans, and identify future opportunities to improve  environmental performance.  Targets Progress 2017 - 30% absolute Scope 1 + 2 emissions between 2015 and 2030 - 8.1% 1 - 20% absolute Scope 3 emissions between 2015 and 2030 + 13.6% 1 100% renewable electricity by 2025 57.8% - 15% water per tonne of product by 2020 (use of municipal and groundwater, baseline 2009) - 19.4% 1 - 4% waste per tonne of product, year on year average (baseline 2015)2 - 4.5% p.a. on average (- 9.0% since baseline 2015) 1 Compared to baseline year.  2 Incinerated and landlled waste. 2 1    Disclosure 305 – 5  3 4 5  Sustainable performance review Acting for Our Environment 48 Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report To that end, Givaudan has developed a set of drivers to ensure  success in delivering against its targets. All our production sites  have developed their site eco-efciency plan (SEEP), setting  individual eco-efciency targets to be achieved over a period   of two to three years.  This work is supported by our Green Teams, which are cross- functional groups of volunteer employees in each site who  identify additional eco-efciency projects or seek to improve  existing ones on a continuous basis. The most successful Green  Team project is recognised with an eco-efciency Green Team  award as part of a programme run by the Executive  Committee.  Energy saving workshops have also had an impact on site  performance and efciency. In 2017 we conducted ve  workshops across both divisions and identied potential for  average energy savings of 5 to 10% per site.  Success story Consolidating shipments of  raw materials to cut CO2  emissions We are reducing CO2 emissions and making cost savings  in our regions by consolidating road shipments of  imported raw materials from sea and airports to our  manufacturing sites.  After analysing the transport arrangements in North  America and EMEA regions, we have made savings in  costs and emissions by consolidating deliveries to our  Malvinas plant in Argentina. We realised that rather than  organise deliveries by supplier, we could create hubs in  other regions and achieve better and more efcient lling  of containers.  From September 2016 to August 2017 the number of  domestic shipments in Argentina has reduced by 344,  which produced a fall in CO2 emissions of 205 tonnes in  the same period.  Having successfully introduced the changes in the NOAM  and EMEA regions, we are soon to do the same in the  APAC region. How to read our performance indicators Baseline recalculation In order to enable a meaningful comparison of  environmental performance over time, Givaudan has  established a standard process, based on the GHG  Protocol, to recalculate its baseline indicators in case of  structural changes such as acquisitions, and changes in  calculation methodology and inventory boundaries.  In this report the baseline recalculation applies only to  GHG emission numbers as these are the only absolute  targets published by the Company. To consider the  impact of 2015 and 2016 acquisitions we recalculated the  gures up to the 2015 baseline.  This is the only way to compare performance on a  like-for-like basis over time. The process includes  denitions of recalculation triggers and the process of  reporting the information. Thanks to this guidance,  Givaudan is able to track its environmental performance  in a transparent manner and with condence that the  data are accurate despite the changes related to the  business growth. Baseline years In this report we use two baseline years to show our  performance indicators, 2009 and 2015. The CO , energy,  waste and targets were set against a 2009 baseline,  which we met in 2015. This led to the publication of  strengthened targets, against a 2015 baseline. For water  the 2009 baseline year is still valid. For production  volumes, both 2009 and 2015 are reported since the  ratios are calculated using the data of the accurate  baseline year. Meanwhile, we have introduced regular eco-efciency  performance reporting on site, regional, divisional and global  levels, and we have implemented the Green Chapter for  capital expenditure project proposals. The Green Chapter has  to include an outline of the eco-efciency aspects, a cost/ benet analysis and elements related to a price on carbon  concept of the proposed investment. Greenhouse gas emissions  Givaudan has developed a comprehensive plan for reducing its  direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.  Direct emissions (Scope 1) are those from sources that we own  or control; energy indirect emissions (Scope 2) are produced in  the generation of energy that we purchase, for example  electricity. A key element of our strategy for reducing Scope 1  and 2 emissions is the RE100 initiative to convert our entire  electricity supply to fully renewable sources by 2025. Alongside  this, we are leading signicant energy consumption reduction  projects across our operations and making improvements  through the investment and efort we put into our energy  saving workshops and the site eco-efciency plans. Overall  employee awareness also helps to deliver gains in this area.  49 Sustainable performance review Acting for Our Environment  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Success story Upgrading Company car eet  to hit EU emissions target We are setting a course to reduce the emissions of  greenhouse gases and particulate matter from our eet  of Company cars in Dortmund and Hamburg, Germany.  The project aims to replace the vehicles used by our  management team with energy-efcient cars to meet  the European Union 2020 emission target of 95g of CO2  per kilometre. A programme of monitoring has been  established and includes the measurement of fuel  consumption, implementation of compelling key  performance indicators and the setting of emissions  value limits. A modernised eet of eco-efcient cars will  not only reduce fuel costs but also limit the release of  greenhouse gases and pollutants, while supporting  Givaudans own sustainability strategy. Other indirect emissions (Scope 3) refer to those produced by  our entire value chain. In order to improve Scope 3 performance,  Givaudan is engaging with its suppliers to reduce the carbon  footprint of purchased goods and services and the associated  transport. We have also joined the CDP Supply Chain, which will  enable us and our suppliers to identify opportunities to reduce  our carbon footprint. Together we will focus on transport,  packaging and purchasing of raw materials. As an example, to  achieve sustainable transport and logistics requires good  transport planning. This in itself depends on good  communication and planning within the business and with our  customers. In this way we can do things such as arrange more  sea freight, instead of air cargo, which is cost-efective and has  less GHG emission output.  As part of our strategy, Givaudan has committed to reduce  absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 30% between 2015 and  2030. We have also set a goal to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions  by 20% over the same period. Our targets are approved by the  Science Based Targets initiative, an international partnership  between CDP, the UN Global Compact, WRI and WWF. They are  in line with the global efort to keep temperature increases  below the 2C threshold, a key goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement  on climate action. In support of those goals, Givaudan has also committed to  ensure that by 2025 all of the electricity it buys will come from  renewable sources. Progress Scope 1 + 2 During 2017, the absolute total direct and indirect GHG  emissions decreased by 15,435 tonnes (i.e. 8.1%) against the  baseline figure for 2015. 1 3 So far 57.8% of all the electricity we purchase comes from  renewable sources. In total 16 of our 41 manufacturing sites are  powered solely by electricity from renewable sources.  To monitor our performance on carbon emissions we  participated in the annual Climate Change CDP survey for  investors as well as in the Climate Change supply chain survey  at the request of a number of customers. This years  performance score was Leadership A (on a scale of A – D with A  being the highest). The scores demonstrate that we regard the  mitigation of climate change as a critical issue for our business  and that we manage our carbon emissions through rigorous  internal data management and the implementation of  improvement initiatives.

A detailed explanation on  calculation and progress per category follows. Scope 3 emissions calculation and progress In 2016 Givaudan analysed the indirect GHG emissions associated  with its global supply chain activities. The analysis excluded   the following categories: fuel and energy related activities;  packaging of nished products; upstream and downstream  transportation and distribution; waste generated in operations;  business travel and employee commuting. These categories are  calculated separately using other methodologies. The analysis is based on the procurement data for 2015 and  includes the spend on raw materials and indirect materials and  services. Analysis of the GHG impact was conducted using the  macroeconomic Escher model, using data from the external  Global Trade and Analysis Project (GTAP). Purchased goods and services Packaging of nished products: Our SAP systems allow us to retrieve global data for diferent  types of packaging. The data were combined with standard GHG  footprint information from our suppliers. The estimated 2017  footprint is 58,575 tonnes; an increase of 0.6% when compared  with the 2016 footprint. Given the growth in production volume,  this level of increase shows an improvement in our packaging  practices. We are assessing ways to reduce our footprint, for  example by reducing the weight of our containers and using  alternative packaging with more sustainable materials. Indirect materials and services (excluding packaging) and  raw materials: The 2017 GHG emission gure was calculated by using the 2015  ratio between spend and GHG emissions and extrapolating to  the 2017 spend gure. A proper recalculation is planned when  the GTAP is updated.

Both of the boilers were used simultaneously in avour  and fragrance production at the site. But having achieved  more precise control over the gas and air intake to the  burners, it is now possible to meet operational demands  with just one boiler.  The change has reduced CO2 emissions by 158.7 tonnes   and cut gas consumption by 76.7m3 in 2017, making   much more eco-efcient use of our installed steam- generation capacity.  Capital goods The 2017 GHG emission gure was calculated by using the 2015  ratio between spend and GHG emissions and extrapolating to  the 2017 spend gure. A proper recalculation is planned when  the GTAP is updated.  Fuel and energy related activities The gures cover CO2 emissions related to the exploitation,  production and transport of primary energy carriers and  electricity, which are not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2  emissions. The data are extracted from the ecoinvent database  2.2 (method: IPCC 2007). Good progress has been made due to  the increase in the supply of renewable electricity. Upstream and downstream transportation and  distribution We monitor the environmental impact of transportation (air,  ship and road) by calculating the associated GHG emissions. We  do this through a model that tracks all transport movements  through our SAP system (by mode of transport), from delivery  to receipt locations of raw materials, intercompany deliveries  and deliveries to customers. To calculate the GHG footprint,  emission factors per mode of transport are used as per the  Cec guideline of 2011. We are assessing ways to reduce our  footprint, for example through consolidation and choice of  engine type. Waste generated in operations Figures are based on the tonnage of waste generated in our  operations that is incinerated and sent to landll. To calculate  the GHG footprint, emission factors per mode of treatment   are used as per the GHG Protocol guideline.  Business travel Data on distance travelled are collected through our global and  local travel agencies. To calculate the GHG footprint, emission  factors per haul and class are used as per the 2017 Department  for Environment, Food and Rural Afairs (UK) denition.  Employee commuting The number for employee commuting is based on the  employee commuting survey results from 2015 and  extrapolated to the number of full-time employees as of   31 December 2017. A new survey will be completed in 2018.  Givaudan actively encourages its employees to reduce the   GHG emissions of their daily commute. The Company supports  a range of schemes including a bike-to-work initiative at our  Swiss sites; carpooling is facilitated through our intranet  platform and some sites provide recharge stations to support  the transition to electric cars.

Until  2016, the team achieved signicant progress, cutting  consumption by 37 and 23% respectively. That efort continued in 2017 with a focus on the dry  powder production site, which has the highest rate of  consumption of all three of our manufacturing facilities   in India. After a detailed analysis we found that longer  production runs of similar variants could reduce the  frequency of in-process cleaning, which is a major  contributor to water consumption.  In 2017, water consumption per batch fell by 20% on the  previous year to 0.72 m3; overall the amount of water  used per tonne of production fell from 1.1 m3 to 0.93 m3,   a reduction of 15.24%. Water management Givaudan is striving to be an industry leader in water  conservation and stewardship. We are committed to making  efcient use of this increasingly precious natural resource and  to limit the environmental impact of the way we consume   and discharge water.  Our actions include reducing water withdrawal, recycling  water and making use of other sources such as rainwater.  Meanwhile we are working to ensure that the wastewater  from our operations is discharged responsibly. Our strategy for monitoring and reducing water consumption  is embodied in our Water Stewardship Programme.  Water is an essential element in our manufacturing activities   as well as in our entire value chain. As a priority, in places where  water stress is expected, we carry out risk assessments to  develop water mitigation action plans; these include efciency  improvements and water reuse opportunities. The Water  Stewardship Programme is also used to guide our growth  strategy in terms of location, technology and procedure to  ensure water risks are managed and monitored.  Our target for water use is a 15% reduction per tonne of  product by 2020 (for municipal and groundwater). Progress on water Givaudan hit its 2020 intensity based water consumption target  this year with a reduction of 19.4% (per tonne of product) against  the baseline gure for 2009. Our early success is due to the  many years consistent efort to reduce consumption across our  production sites led by our Green Teams and local engineering  teams. Looking ahead, we will continue to develop the Water  Stewardship Programme and focus attention on minimising the  environmental impact of our activities. In line with our strategy, we participated in the annual CDP  Water questionnaire for the third year as well as in the water  supply chain questionnaire at the request of a number of  customers. The 2017 performance score was A-. Our score  shows the robustness of our process and our capability to  assess and manage water issues throughout our value chain.  Quality monitoring of waste water The water quality is monitored through Chemical Oxygen  Demand (COD) analysis. The resulting 2017 total quantity   of COD discharged has been measured and calculated at   608 tonnes.     Management Approach (103 – 2, 103 – 3): Topic 303 Success story Harvesting rain water and  reducing consumption Prior to 2011 our Jigani manufacturing site in India relied  on water that was purchased from a local borehole and  brought in by tanker. We used to supplement this with  water from a well on site, but in the summer months the  well would run dry. Our team solved the problem by  harvesting rainwater and draining it into the subsoil  around the well.  Today the well is able to meet all our site needs, so we   no longer rely on tanker shipments, which means a cut in  CO2 emissions. We have also implemented a number of  measures to reduce water consumption. For example,   the water from our well is treated via reverse osmosis to  make it potable. All our wastewater is recycled for  internal landscaping and we have overhauled our pipe  network to ensure zero leakage.  Overall water consumption is measured daily and we  respond accordingly to keep it under control. Since 2011  we have reduced consumption on site by 38%. Our  specic water consumption per tonne of product fell  from 0.68 kilolitres in 2016 to 0.64 kilolitres in 2017,   a 6% reduction. 4  53 Sustainable performance review Acting for Our Environment  Givaudan – 2017 Sustainability Report Waste reduction We are working hard to limit the amount of waste we produce  through a four-pronged process. First, we are reducing the  amount we create as a by-product of our processes; then we  reuse where possible and recycle in an efort to move away  from disposal in landll or by incineration. Where waste is  incinerated we recapture the energy.  Our target is to reduce incinerated and landlled waste  production per tonne of product by an average of 4% year on  year against the 2015 baseline gure.  Progress on waste During the course of 2017 the gure for the amount of waste  generated per tonne of product fell by 9.0% on 2015.  The reduction is due to efciency projects and investments  implemented by our Green Teams and local engineering teams.  The projects focused on reducing waste and recycling more  material that would otherwise be incinerated or sent to landll;  the reduction of landll is a priority. In total, Givaudan recycled  73% of all its waste in 2017; that gure rose to 79% when the  energy recovered from incineration was taken into account.

Thanks to an ambitious  waste management programme the site achieved a  reduction of 34% in the waste to landll category.  This year the team continued its eforts, identifying local  waste management partners who can guarantee  disposal with positive environmental efects. For example  a local composting centre is taking organic waste and  helping to enrich soil to grow food for children in poverty.  Meanwhile, the team worked internally to make sure that  the importance of separating waste at source is well  understood. Proper waste handling and separation is  necessary to make reuse and recycling possible.  As part of the campaign, staf were engaged in a contest  called Environmental Challenge to test their waste  management knowledge. This efort continued through  2017 with good levels of acceptance and has brought the  site closer to its 2020 goal, reducing the amount of  non-hazardous waste sent to landll by a further 29%   in that period. 5 Total water withdrawal by source 15.1% 55.5% 29.4% 2017 Total water 1 Municipal water Groundwater Surface water Water intake (m3) 2009  (restated) 2016  (restated) 2017 Municipal water 2,286,999 2,539,275 2,612,556 Groundwater 1,074,035 1,307,576 1,335,663 Total municipal and  groundwater 3,361,034 3,846,851 3,948,219 Surface water 7,432,649 5,225,273 4,925,910 Total water1 10,793,683 9,072,124 8,874,129 1 Includes sanitary, cooling and process water.

Disclosure 306 – 2 Success stories Reprocessing plastic cans   to avoid incineration The installation of a shredder and rinsing plant at our  Naarden facility in The Netherlands has enabled us to  recycle large volumes of used plastic containers. The new  equipment is helping to reduce waste and the associated  carbon emissions of sending the cans for incineration.  The cans are made of a high-value plastic; once shredded,  they are rinsed in treated efuent water from our  wastewater treatment plant; the rinse water is then  retreated on site. The shredded plastic can be used as a  high-quality raw material to improve other collected  recycled plastic. As a result, the combined saving in CO2  emissions from reduced transportation and incineration  is 155 tonnes per year.  Recycling oil by-products   to reduce waste  Citrus oil is a by-product of avour production at our   site in Pudong, China. Having considered the properties  of the oil, the site team searched for ways to reuse it and  found that citrus oil could be a useful additive in a range  of applications.  Two local manufacturers were keen to take advantage   of its ready availability. One company now uses the oil to  modify the smell of fuel oil while the other extracts the  terpene for an oil-based solvent in industrial detergent.  Since the initiative started in 2017, some 50 tonnes of oil  have been reused. The new demand for citrus oil is  continuous so the team expects to dispose all its citrus oil  without recourse to incineration and to avoid the related  energy consumption.

As a member of the NRSC, we contribute to improving  biodiversity in the areas where we source our natural raw  materials. We follow NRSC guidelines on best practice,   which dene the technical specications and processes for  reducing the environmental and societal impact on the species  that we buy.  The recommendations address soil erosion, deforestation,  over-use of species and water consumption, all of which  contribute to the preservation of precious natural resources.     For more information:   www.nrsc.fr     Management Approach (103 – 2, 103 – 3): Topic 304  Disclosure 304 – 2 A biodiverse world Biodiversity is essential to the long-term survival of life itself.   It also underpins so much of what we do at Givaudan on a daily  basis. Therefore the impact of climate change and the loss of  habitat have immediate consequences for our business.  Access and Benet-sharing (ABS) and the preservation of  biodiversity are an integral part of the way we manage risk.   In fact, if we did nothing to prevent the loss of species the cost  of raw materials would rise or at least become more volatile;  local producer communities would be among the rst to sufer  and our supply chains would be at risk of disruption. Access and Benet-sharing Our approach to addressing this issue is based on the principle  of sharing the benets of biodiversity as promoted by the  Nagoya Protocol, which we actively support. To that end we  have developed a position statement on the Convention on  Biological Diversity (CBD) and particularly on local legislation  and regulations implementing the Nagoya Protocol that can   be found on our website. Our working group on biodiversity, which handles the principle  of ABS, incorporates functions such as procurement,  regulation, legal, innovation, sustainability and marketing.  From an innovation perspective, all our programmes take into  account the principles of the Nagoya Protocol. The research  teams have initiated internal processes to record and manage  information relating to the use of genetic resources for  research. We also assess the potential impact of biodiversity  laws worldwide. Biodiversity preservation Givaudan has initiatives to preserve biodiversity in three areas.  In our supply chains, we address specic issues of biodiversity  preservation. Our Sourcing for Shared Value strategy is based  on a best practice approach, which has brought signicant  improvement. As such, biodiversity preservation is a key  component of our Responsible Sourcing Policy and asks  suppliers of raw materials to respect a set of requirements   on environmental values. We form partnerships with academia to protect important  species. For example, Givaudan has collaborated for more than  a decade with the University of California, Riverside to support  the care and preservation of a unique Citrus Variety Collection.  Today the collection is one of the most extensive, unique and  diverse in the world, encompassing more than 1,000 diferent  citrus varieties. The Company also supports The Givaudan  Citrus Variety Collection Endowed Chair with the aim of  helping to preserve citrus biodiversity for generations to come.  57 Appendix Simos soloriberis quate

Paths  have been better simulated conducting to reduce the total covered distances. 3 About 2,300 tonnes of by-product were reclassied as hazardous waste recycled in 2015 and 2016 after internal site audit conducted, 4  Following Givaudan's new integration in sustainability reporting principles, the baseline for water efciency has been recalculated excluding 130 Ml which reduce the overall  amount of water consumption by 0.6% in the same year. 5  The water discharged to external treatment facility without pre-treatment reported in 2016 in one of our manufacturing site did not include domestic water usage. A total of  14,000 m3 of water has been added to 2016 amounts after identifying this issue. 6 During the data review an error was identied in the SO2 emissions calculation which increased the total emission by 30.5 kg.
