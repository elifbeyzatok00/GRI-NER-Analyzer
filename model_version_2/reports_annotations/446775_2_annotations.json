Editorial policy   Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 2 Corporate Message Ajinomoto Group Vision  (Vision) ASV  (The Ajinomoto Group Creating Shared Value) (Value) Ajinomoto Group Way Ajinomoto Group Policies (AGP) Our mission is to contribute to the worlds food  and wellness, and to better lives for the future. What we aim to be as we pursue our mission Contribute to greater wellness for people worldwide,  unlocking the power of amino acids   to resolve the food and health issues  associated with dietary habits and aging. By 2030:  Help extend the healthy life expectancy of 1 billion  people  Reduce our environmental impact by 50%, while  improving business performance Initiatives to create both social and economic value  in order to realize our mission and vision ASV represents our unchanging commitment:  With our stakeholders and businesses, we help  resolve societys issues, leading to the creation of  economic value. Shared values among employees in pursuing our  mission and vision; basic approach and stance in  taking on our work  Create New Value  Pioneer Spirit Beliefs and behaviors to be upheld by each  Ajinomoto Group company and each of us who  works there  Social Contribution  Value People Ajinomoto Group Mission (Mission) Our raison detre, mission, and desire as a  company that we will pursue persistently Since our founding, the Ajinomoto Group has engaged consistently in initiatives to resolve social issues through  our businesses. These initiatives have contributed to the Groups growth by improving economic value through the  creation of shared value with society and with local communities. We call these initiatives ASV (The Ajinomoto Group  Creating Shared Value). ASV serves as the core of Our Philosophy, the Groups approach to achieving the mission  and vision adopted under this philosophy.   In 2020, the Ajinomoto Group renewed the Vision that defines our purpose in society and the path to achieving  it. To realize our Vision, we will continue living with society and the earth, co-creating value focused on Health and  Well-Being and Smart Eating Habits. We are committed to help extending the healthy life expectancy of 1 billion  people and reducing our environmental impact by 50% by 2030. Our Philosophy   Activity Report by Materiality Items Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality  Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 3 The Ajinomoto Group strives to foster Group-wide understanding of ASV, which serves as the core of our corporate  strategies to realize our vision over the medium to long term. In February 2020, we declared in our vision for 2030  to become a solution-providing group of companies for food and health issues. Our 2020-2025 Medium-Term  Management Plan (20-25 MTP) reflects a basic approach to focus all management resources on resolving food  and health issues. In particular, we will focus on addressing the excess intake of sodium and functional decline due  to aging. We have established solutions and targets through fiscal 2030 related to ESG issues, including climate  change, creating a resource recycling society, and realizing sustainable procurement.   With respect to ESG and sustainability management, the Group has built a management system modeled on  ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and other standards, based on the Ajinomoto Group Policies (AGP) and relevant internal  rules. We continue with operations as we ensure optimal processes.   Our Management Risk Committee, which reports directly to the Executive Committee, develops responses to  risks and opportunities that have a Group-wide impact, including climate change and social issues, and evaluates  and manages these risks cross-functionally. This committee is chaired by the executive officer in charge of the  Corporate Planning Dept. The chair summarizes committee meeting discussions and reports to the Executive  Committee and the Board of Directors at least once a year.   In April 2020, we established the Sustainability Development Dept. to strengthen our promotion structure for  sustainability. The new department formulates the policies which had been promoted by internal task forces and  develops strategies related to nutrition and the environment (climate change, recycling-oriented society, etc.) and  society (animal welfare, etc.). It also follows up on recommendations to incorporate sustainability into business  plans, compiles internal information related to ESG, and reports to the Executive Committee and the Board of  Directors.

Next, we selected and sorted materiality items, mapping the results. We re-examined the Ajinomoto Group issues and approaches in light of the SDGs which were announced in 2015. In this process,  we engaged experts in surveys and dialogues to determine the relationships between our business activities and the SDGs. We conducted an internal analysis of the relationship between the 169 targets of the SDGs and Ajinomoto Group materiality  items.   We compiled information about our macro environment and feedback/expectations from stakeholders, revising materiality  items into 11 items. In addition, we strengthened the links between opportunities, risks, and key initiatives with respect to  these materiality items. Further, we integrated materiality with Group-wide significant risks and 30 priority ESG items.   We conducted interviews with experts to confirm the adequacy of materiality. The conclusion was that the expected social  issues were included.   We also confirmed the adequacy of materiality within our Board of Directors.   We revised names and order of certain materiality items based on our 20-25 MTP (e.g., change Contribution to health  and nutritional issues to Contribution to solve food and health issues).   We added/revised Related opportunities and risks based on the latest business environment and understanding of  issues.   We confirmed the adequacy within our Board of Directors. We conducted dialogues with stakeholders on topics related to materiality items. These dialogues helped us collect  information related to stakeholder expectations and areas for improvement. Feedback received \u0007Unclear connection to business strategies. \u0007Although a matrix of importance to society/business is in place, it is difficult to respond to change, since importance  fluctuates year to year. \u0007Some items included are lower in importance. Too many items included.  Engage in specific activities based on revised materiality.  Collect feedback from stakeholders regarding revised materiality.

The Ajinomoto Group engages with diverse stakeholders in the course of conducting our business. We conduct engagement in  two-way communications with stakeholders to understand the evaluations and expectations of the Ajinomoto Group, as well as  our responsibilities to stakeholders, reflecting this feedback in our business activities. Dialogues and information sharing are conducted by persons working in departments and facilities closely connected with each  type of stakeholder. The results of this engagement are shared with senior management as needed. In response, we implement  improvement measures and disclose information through our websites, our Sustainability Data Book, and other channels.

The behavior of corporations through the COVID-19 pandemic is a critical window to the  genuine nature of their social culture. As a large employer in an essential industry, we expect  the Ajinomoto Group to show leadership through this crisis. Primarily, in the protection of  and support for the Groups own employees (and their families) during COVID-19 lockdowns  and working arrangements. Secondly, by supporting other stakeholders such as customers  and (small) suppliers. Specifically, in the way the Group uses its unique capabilities and  reach to help solve social issues exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic – where possible  in partnership with others, including governments. As the Ajinomoto Group is an innovative  company, we expect the Group to apply its technologies and products to meet emerging  health and nutrition needs resulting from COVID-related lifestyle effects, such as new home  food preparation needs, isolation of elderly populations, and more. Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders   Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Elaine Cohen  Founder and CEO Beyond Business Ltd. It would be difficult to hold anyone to commitments made while COVID-19 was yet an  unimaginable nightmare. All the more reason to commend the Ajinomoto Group for the  coincident prioritization of health as a long-range policy concern. The Group made this  strategic adjustment based upon perceived lifestyle changes because no one could have  predicted what happened months later, following the spread of the virus.   I was impressed that the update to the medium-term management plan, posted in early  fiscal 2020, included a preliminary calculation of the pandemics potential impact. Few  companies were so far-sighted, an indication of the organizations sound governance in the  presence of looming chaos.   What was unthinkable is now upon us, and the finest commercial visions and strategies  are being tested. Companies with the credentials of the Ajinomoto Group stand the best  chance of prevailing.

The elements of the 2020-2025  roadmap – to prioritize and streamline the business portfolio, improve core brands, invest  in creating an eco-system focused on food and health, and invest in people management –  support the vision to focus corporate activities around improving lifestyles through health and  food products by harnessing the power of amino acids. I look forward to the Group sharing  more developed targets by which they measure performance against the ambitious goal of  helping a billion people enhance healthier life!    To maintain credibility as a player in the health sector, the attendant target to reduce  the Groups environmental footprint by 50% while growing the business is necessary. In  the latest Medium-Term Management Plan, I was pleased to see new 2025 and 2030  targets articulated for the three materiality items, as well as a bold new 2030 commitment to  reduce climate-related economic risk by 8 to 10 billion yen. Stakeholders will expect further  elaboration on the TCFD[1] simulation, as well as corporate processes for climate-related risk  identification, assessment, and management in the next integrated report and CDP [2] report.    The transformation of management and HR will need to be accelerated due to the  emergence of the global pandemic, COVID-19. These efforts will have to extend beyond the  management ranks and down to the manufacturing workers, many of whom are contractors.  To protect workers and reduce risks of contagion, the Group must put in place new stringent  safety and cleaning procedures for facilities and workers and increase disclosure. Workers  may demand hazard pay, driving up the cost of labor.    As the global pandemic reshapes the business landscape strains and shocks in the supply  chain should be expected. While the Ajinomoto Group has a strong supply chain approach  to Assurance and Product Safety, in a world contending with the Corona virus, the need  for further transparency around these programs will be expected by consumers, investors,  employees and contractors, members of the supply chain, as well as local and international  regulators. Evidence of annual attainment of best-in-class performance towards explicit  targets will be de rigueur. As the Group works towards creating an eco-system focused  on food and health, a shift towards decentralized approaches to supply chain sustainability  should be seriously considered.

Activity Report by Materiality Items Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 9 In the Sustainability Data Book 2019, I referred to my expectation that the Ajinomoto Group  would present its long-term business vision for the future. On this occasion, I have great  confidence that the Group has set its 2030 vision and ambitious goals to address the ESG  issues in a timely manner. In particular, investments in human resources that were given as  key performance indicators, such as employee engagement (ASV as ones own initiative), is  extremely important not only to ensure sustainable growth, but also to respond swiftly and  intelligently to drastic changes in business environment and lifestyles due to the worsening  impacts of climate change and unforeseen epidemics such as COVID-19. It is my hope that  every employee will show the strength of purpose to commit as individuals and effect a big  change collectively to steadily achieve these goals.   As an industry leader, I look forward to initiatives by the Ajinomoto Group that aim to  maximize the social impact of ASV along with sustainable corporate growth and help achieve  the SDGs in collaboration with various stakeholders, while working together with the global  society as a leader of this new age. There are serious concerns that the COVID-19 global pandemic is having an impact on  corporate activities, resulting in business changes that will lead to higher risks of human rights  abuses for vulnerable people in the supply chains. Until now, the Ajinomoto Group has led  the way for Japanese companies in advancing human rights due diligence and other related  activities concerned with respect for human rights, in line with the UN Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights. Under the current circumstances, the role of the responsible  company toward employees, as well as workers and vulnerable people in the supply chains,  still remains unchanged. I believe that as the world moves forward to a post-pandemic phase,  only those companies that can act without losing sight of this essential element will be able  to continue running their businesses sustainably. I hope that the Ajinomoto Group will hold  deeper dialogues and collaborate constructively with its stakeholders, as well as continue  with initiatives based on respect for human rights, in order to demonstrate good practices  and keep on playing a leading role in Japan and abroad. Hidemi Tomita  Director Lloyds Register Japan Co.  Ltd. Takeshi Shimotaya  Executive Director The Global Alliance for  Sustainable Supply Chain Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders   Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders The COVID-19 crisis is placing new demands on businesses. In hindsight, the materiality  that they have devoted their time to create were made during ordinary times. If the current  pandemic is a turning point, rather than a time of emergency in which we will eventually return  to normal, how should we regard these material issues?   The times call for the ability to be agile and change flexibly to conceive of new initiatives  for corporate sustainability. At the same time, it is also important to continue working steadily  on efforts that might be deprioritized under emergency situations, such as those on climate  change, circular economy, and water security.   I look forward to how the Groups framework for sustainability initiatives will further evolve  so that it also supports the sustainability of the Ajinomoto Group itself.

The issues and needs  related to food and nutrition in modern society are becoming more diverse and more complex. The Group aims to maximize  our impact on nutrition through our businesses. To achieve this aim, we encourage people to eat a nutritionally balanced  diet by sharing our expertise of amino acids. In this way, we contribute to the better health and dietary habits of people all  over the world.

Dr. Kikunae Ikeda, a chemist, discovered a taste derived from traditional Japanese kombu dashi  (kelp stock) that had yet to be recognized in the world. He succeeded in extracting the amino acid  glutamate from the kombu dashi in 1908. Dr. Ikeda called this taste umami, inventing a method to  produce umami seasonings made from glutamate that impart everyday umami and delicious tastes.  Then, our founder, Saburosuke Suzuki II, received a request for commercialization from him and  launched the seasoning as AJI-NO-MOTO  in 1909.   Since that time, we have worked diligently to evaluate and unlock the power of amino acids to  discover how they can be used in different ways to improve society. Approaches that utilize the functions of amino acids About 20% of the human body is made of proteins. These proteins are made up of 20 different types  of amino acids. Amino acids form nearly 100,000 kinds of proteins through various combinations.   Some amino acids are made in the body; however, there are nine amino acids, called essential  amino acids, that can only be obtained through foods. Because amino acids provide important  functions in maintaining life, humans must ingest a sufficient amount of amino acids in balance with  other nutrients through daily diets.   Amino acids provide four functions: flavoring function, nutritional function, physiological function,  and reactivity. The Ajinomoto Group uses the functions of amino acids and technologies (including  design, exploration, manufacturing, and evaluation) to create a variety of innovations. We grow our  businesses in foods and seasonings, as well as in healthcare and electronic materials, by combining  functions of amino acids.

We focus on solving  nutritional issues through the use of amino acids, bringing innovations to the world with advanced  technologies. Our highest priorities focus on offering delicious salt reduction and optimizing protein  intake.   To achieve these priorities, we propose well-balanced nutrition without compromising on taste,  food access and the local way of life. Proposing health and nutritional value based on scientific evidence The Ajinomoto Group leverages our world-class expertise on amino acids to develop and sell products  that support comfortable lifestyles. We also offer amino acid compounds and product design solutions  for BtoB customers. By adding various amino acid functions to food, we help consumers easily ingest  these compounds to experience the health and nutritional value of amino acids. We call this series of  BtoBtoC initiatives our downstream strategy, which we pursue in Japan and overseas. Based on this strategy, we offer to our BtoB customers Amino Acid Prime Mix, a line of optimally  formulated amino acid ingredients for food and beverage products.

This 40% leucine formulation  supports efficient integration of essential amino acids in the  body for enhanced muscle mass and strength. Arginine and glutamate work to alleviate stomach  discomfort from food by promoting gastric motility. Cystine and theanine support the production of  glutathione[2], an antioxidant. Glutathione boosts ones  ability to fight pathogens by helping to activate the innate  and acquired immune systems. Histidine is used to make histamine, levels of which decline  in the brain as a result of stress and sleep deprivation.  Histidine thus alleviates fatigue and improves efficiency  in tasks requiring simple memory and decision-making.  Vitamin B6 aids histidine action.

A Double Burden of Malnutrition (combination  mixture of the problems of undernutrition and overnutrition) is possible not only in a single country  or region, but also in an individual. Improving the nutritional balance in our daily diets is important for  solving problems such as the insufficient intake of proteins and vegetables or an excess intake of  sugar, saturated fat, and salt.   In the 20-25 MTP, the Ajinomoto Group clearly states our intentions to improve the QOL of people  around the world. We also stated our aspirations to assist people in maintaining delicious and well- balanced diets by addressing nutritional issues along with our efforts to unlock the power of amino  acids. As a global food company involved intimately in daily diets, we pursue initiatives based on a  policy of nutrition without compromise, meaning no compromise in terms of taste, food access,  and local way of life. We plan to further strengthen our activities for addressing nutritional issues while  contributing to the well-being of people in the countries and regions in which we operate.  The three pillars of our approach to nutrition  Without compromising taste The Ajinomoto Group continues to develop and sell healthier products  (reduced salt, etc.), and we do so without compromising on the taste  consumers enjoy. By providing seasonings such as umami seasoning  (MSG), we help consumers cook delicious and healthier meals while  contributing to reduced salt in our customers products.  Without compromising access We recognize that, while many people in the world have various means to access nutrition (or  nourishment), some people have limited choices in terms of the products they can access due  to availability, affordability, or convenience. We believe that we are in a distinct position to make  nutritious meals more accessible for all through innovations that utilize the functions of amino acids,  products and ingredients as well as through our efforts on distribution, price, and convenience.  Without compromising the local way of life The Ajinomoto Group is a global company, but we operate in local markets where there are  established approaches to culture, traditions, and enjoying food. When expanding our businesses  globally, we adapt our operating models to respect the local customs, food preferences, resources,  ingredients, and stakeholders. Further, as communities and economies develop and change, our  emphasis on personalization becomes even more relevant.   When nutritious foods taste good, are convenient and easily accessible, and respect local  customs and flavors, we are able to promote the long-term intake of well-balanced meals by  consumers.

We will use our leading-edge bioscience and ne chemical  technology to promote reduced-salt foods that retain their deliciousness.  Delicious sugar- and fat-reduction We are focusing on developing alternative sweeteners and recipes to reduce the sugar and  saturated fat content of our products and the products of our business customers. Vegetables and fruits intake promotion We are supporting nutritionally balanced meals by promoting the consumption of vegetables and  fruits, which are sources of abundant vitamins and minerals. Our promotion activities include  printing recipes that include vegetables and fruits on our packages. Protein intake promotion from a variety of sources The Ajinomoto Group is promoting the use of sustainable and diverse protein sources that help  maintain planetary health. We are supplementing plant-based proteins with amino acids to  enhance their nutritional quality. Workplace nutrition improvement  The Ajinomoto Group considers employee health to be of utmost priority and are focused on  improving workplace nutrition and raising nutrition literacy among employees. Protein intake optimization The underprivileged and the elderly suffer from insufcient dietary protein and lack of access to  high-quality protein. The Ajinomoto Group is dedicated to improving the intake of protein through our  unique approach of providing amino acids, which make up the proteins in our body, to complement  lower-quality protein sources, as well as seasonings which enhance the avor of proteins in meals.   The Ajinomoto Group undertakes various initiatives to achieve the approach described above.

The task force has also  created a system to ensure the strategies are executed effectively. In fiscal 2019, the basic policies  formulated by this task force were incorporated into the strategies of each business department,  setting the stage for the creation of concrete results.   In April 2020, we established the Sustainability Development Dept. to continue further  strengthening of our nutrition-focused initiatives. Under the Corporate Executive Officer in charge of  sustainability, this department formulates policies and strategies related to nutrition. The department  also follows up on the activities of business departments, compiles information, and reports to the  Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. Framework Framework for Nutrition Management  \u0007\u0007Group Shared  Policy on Nutrition \u0007 P3 Ajinomoto Group approach to nutrition Contribution to Solve Food and Health Issues   Activity Report by Materiality Items The Ajinomoto Group became the first Japanese company to introduce a system for evaluating food  nutrient content – ANPS-P (The Ajinomoto Group Nutrient Profiling System for Product). This is a tool  for collecting and analyzing data on the nutrient content of our current and future products. Since April  2020, we have utilized ANPS-P for approximately 500 products from 9 of our group companies in 7  countries, including Japan. We use this system to conduct nutrition initiatives around the globe.

Despite WHO initiatives [3] warning against such risks, improvements have yet to be seen.  The Ajinomoto Group encourages salt reduction through our unique leading-edge bioscience and  fine chemical technologies (e.g., by providing deliciousness through umami). In addition to providing  products with reduced salt, we are also disseminating information on low-sodium diets and menus via  websites and social media.   Further, we share our expertise regarding methods to reduce salt while maintaining deliciousness,  and conduct activities to clarify the effects of salt reduction through joint research and collaboration  with related stakeholders. The Group plans to widely publicize our findings to accelerate social  implementation of methods to reduce salt while maintaining deliciousness.

The ANPS-P conforms to the calculation method applied by the Health Star Rating System, a  nutrient profiling system used in Australia and New Zealand. In this system, the nutritional value of  food products is rated based on the quantity of nutrients they include for which excess intake should  be avoided (calories, sugars [1], sodium, saturated fats [2]) and that are recommended but often lacking  (proteins, vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans, fiber).   We are also developing a nutrient profiling system for meals made with the Groups products.  We plan to apply the system to products that require additional ingredients other than water (such  as seasonings, soups, and some packaged food products), while also using the system to create  recipes displayed on product packaging. In addition to the above-mentioned nutrient items, we are  considering whether to establish unique indicators for deliciousness, such as umami. Delicious salt reduction  [3] Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) calls for reducing salt intake by 30%  by 2025. Specific initiative Main product   Develop salt reduction technology that utilizes  umami to retain the deliciousness and flavor of  foods   Develop and provide delicious, reduced-salt  products with our salt reduction technology  (e.g., improved taste using umami seasoning  (MSG) and formulation technology, improved  physical properties, etc., using enzyme  technologies)   Collaborate with academia and governments to  promote the efficacy of salt reduction utilizing  umami and MSG   Create a regional ecosystem in conjunction with  local governments, retailers, and the media    Provide recipes and other valuable information  to address excess salt intake  (e.g., creation of  an  salt reduction website, promotions for a low-  sodium diet using digital advertising, sales of  assorted reduced-salt products via in-house  mail order operations) Japan North America South America Salt Flavor  seasonings Soups Soups Frozen foods Frozen foods Performance Contribution to Solve Food and Health Issues   Activity Report by Materiality Items Consomm soup  stocks Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability GRI203-2  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 18  Activities to publicize and promote the effects of salt reduction using umami and MSG (Japan) In September 2019, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. and the Japanese Society of Nutrition and Dietetics held a  luncheon seminar at the 66th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Society of Nutrition and Dietetics. This  meeting featured a lecture by Hitomi Hayabuchi, a specially appointed professor from the Faculty of  Human Life and the Environment at Nara Womens University. The professor provided a commentary  on reducing salt while maintaining deliciousness, based on various survey results and food-related  data under the theme Actual Practices in Reducing Salt Using Umami.   Although the effects of delicious salt reduction using umami and MSG were demonstrated in  the 1970s, these finding failed to receive attention from medical professionals tasked with providing  patients with guidance on salt reduction. The Ajinomoto Group has supported clinical research at  multiple facilities centered on Nara Womens University. In January 2020, the results of the latest  research from Nara Womens University were published in the English-language journal, Hypertension  Research, issued by The Japanese Society for Hypertension (NPO). These results reconfirmed that the  effects of delicious salt reduction using umami and MSG could be detected in all people, regardless  of gender, age, region, and smoking history[1].   The Ajinomoto Group will continue to organize academic information on the usefulness and  safety of umami and MSG accumulated to date to verify value. We also intend to make various policy  proposals aimed at enabling society to reduce salt intake while maintaining deliciousness.  Create a regional ecosystem in conjunction with government, retailers, and the media Ajinomoto Co., Inc. has been creating local ecosystems in conjunction with local governments,  retailers, and the media to roll out a salt reduction promotional program using the umami seasoning  AJI-NO-MOTO . Since 2014, the Company has been partnering with local government and retailers  in Iwate Prefecture, which at the time had the stigma of highest salt intake per capita of any prefecture  in Japan. The program conducted in-store promotions of low-sodium menus using local ingredients  and our reduced-salt seasonings. In addition to this effort, the Company organized seminars aimed at  dieticians on the subject of salt reduction using umami seasoning. These efforts were reported on by  the media, and helped to reduce per capita salt intake in Iwate. The prefecture has also established a  Iwate Low and Proper Salt Intake Day every month to boost the regions efforts aimed at promoting  optimal salt intake.   Since 2016, Ajinomoto (Malaysia) Berhad has been proposing low-sodium menus using umami  for use in elderly care facilities. In 2020, collaborations commenced with local universities to promote  recipes for low-sodium menus and to expand the scale of its activities. Going forward, plans call for  providing these recipes and activities to four elderly care facilities housing approximately 300 residents  in total. This initiative has been reported on by local media and has helped encourage people regarding  the effects of reducing salt intake.

To address the issue of undernutrition of children common in Southeast Asian countries, we launched  the healthy powdered beverage Prottie in both Thailand and the Philippines to facilitate the intake of  nutrients such as protein and calcium. We communicate with mothers on the importance of proteins  and other factors for the growth of their children via social media and by selling our products via  e-commerce. We endeavor to achieve healthy lives for children in Southeast Asia through healthy and  delicious beverage products.   On our website for restaurant-use products in Japan, we provide information for hospitals and  nursing facilities, sharing menus that promote protein intake. \u0007\u0007Tabesapo for  eating well  to prevent  malnutrition  (Japanese only) Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability GRI203-2  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 19 Contribution to Solve Food and Health Issues   Activity Report by Materiality Items Specific initiative Main product   Develop and provide products to eliminate  insufficient protein intake   Provide recipes and other valuable information  to promote protein intake optimization Japan Asia North America South America EMEA [1] Flavor seasonings Menu-specific seasonings Meat seasonings Powdered beverage  for infants and  toddlers Medical foods Amino acid  supplements Frozen foods Amino acid  supplements Soups Frozen foods Amino acid supplements Menu-specific seasonings Flavor seasonings Medical foods [1] Europe, the Middle East and Africa Frozen foods  Soups Amino acid supplements Amino Acid Prime Mix Amino Acid Prime Mix Amino Acid Prime Mix Amino Acid Prime Mix Amino Acid Prime Mix Performance Delicious sugar and fat reduction  Issues such as obesity and diabetes are gaining attention in the global debate on health.

P13 Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability GRI203-2  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 20  Sugar reduction The Ajinomoto Group has utilized its amino acid production technologies in the use of two amino acid  sweeteners, aspartame and advantame, which are roughly 200 and between 20,000 to 40,000 times  sweeter than sugar, respectively. The selective use of high-intensity sweeteners can meet consumer  sugar-reduction needs without sacrificing the taste of sweetness, and we provide these sweetness  applications to businesses across the food and beverage industry. We also market products  developed to support sugar reduction and appropriate sugar intake. These products include Pal  Sweet, a smooth-tasting low-calorie sweetener with zero sugar, Refresco FIT, a powdered juice that  uses aspartame and is sold in Brazil, and PAL SWEET DIET for BtoB sales that enhances the taste  of food with natural sweetness. In 2020, the Group launched two varieties of Birdy canned coffee in  Thailand. These products have 50% less sugar than the conventional product. It is through products such as these and others that we support proper sugar intake.  Fat reduction The Ajinomoto Group has identified a substance that imparts a rich taste and deep flavor to cooking.  We call the function of this substance, kokumi. We are increasingly finding that kokumi serves to  compensate for the sensation of fat in foods. Utilizing this function, the Group developed and markets  Pure Select Koku Uma mayonnaise. This product has the same rich taste as regular mayonnaise (due  to a proprietary manufacturing method) and 65% fewer calories (compared to the Companys regular  mayonnaise). We have also developed and marketed a low-fat Marim creaming powder with 50%  less fat.

For example, our product packages display recipes that  encourage consumers to consume more vegetables and fruits.   In Japan, we promote the Love Vege program to encourage people to eat more vegetables in  Aichi Prefecture, which had the lowest vegetable intake among all prefectures in Japan according to  the National Health and Nutrition Survey of Japans Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. We have  engaged in various initiatives to boost vegetable intake, including recipe contests by dietician college  students, and menu development in collaboration with local cooking researchers, cafs and NPOs.  We also made proposals to supermarkets to show products more attractively in their stores. This  project has become a companywide movement and as of the end of fiscal 2019, has spread to 25  prefectures nationwide.

We recognize that these conditions increase the number of people requiring nursing care,  which is a major factor affecting healthy life expectancy. In addition, to passing on a rich global  environment to the next generation, we are undertaking initiatives to boost the intake of sustainable  and diverse proteins, while promoting the use and commercialization of proteins from various  origins. Generally speaking, plant-derived proteins often have a poor amino acid balance and a lower  nutritional value than animal-derived proteins. We are supplementing plant-based proteins with amino  acids to enhance nutritional quality while contributing to improved protein intake.   Ajinomoto Co., Inc. has acquired exclusive marketing rights in Japan for Mankai a type of high- protein [1] aquatic plant (duckweed) owned by Hinoman Ltd. of Israel. Mankai is a plant material more  easily digested and absorbed in the body than existing protein materials. This plant also offers excellent  nutritional value, including vitamins, minerals, unsaturated fatty acids such as omega-3 fatty acids, and  dietary fiber. Since this plant can be cultivated using small amounts of water, light, and nutrients in only  a short period of time, it can be produced efficiently with low levels of environmental impact. Currently,  the Company is developing new products with good nutritional balance by combining Mankai with our  processing and other technological capabilities. [1] Approx. 45% of the nutritional components of Mankai (dry powder) are proteins.

We promote well-balanced meals with the precondition that they match the dietary habits and  food preferences of each country and region. We also value a comprehensive approach to health,  such as providing nutrition that meets diverse lifestyle and the diverse value required for food, and  providing nutritious meals at schools and hospitals. The Ajinomoto Group believes that employee health is one of our most important foundations. We are  focused on improving workplace nutrition as well as employee nutrition literacy.   In June 2019, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. invited experts to provide health and nutrition lectures for  employees. These lectures introduced important points for lifestyle habits on the topic of dietary intake  for pre-seniors (50s to mid-60s) to achieve healthy life expectancy. In January 2020, the Company  began offering healthy lunches (MyHealth Lunch) at company cafeterias nationwide, providing a menu  reflecting the health issues of each business site. Our aim is to help employees improve health and  well-being through a set menu of staple foods, main dishes, side dishes and soups with balanced  vegetables, protein, and sodium content.

The Company has concentrated this knowledge into Kachimeshi for general consumers  in Japan. This program supports healthy living and conditioning by sharing health and nutrition  information as well as easy-to-prepare, delicious meal plans arranged by theme at stores of major  retailers, restaurants, and company cafeterias. We also pursue collaborations with governments, etc.,  to propose menu ideas suited to each region.   Based on the model of Kachimeshi cultivated in Japan, the Group has currently expanded  the Kachimeshi program into six countries overseas to support athletes in each country. In four of  these countries (Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore), we have also introduced our  ASEAN Victory Project to provide nutritional and dietary support to athletes and sports teams. At the  30th South East Asian Games held in November and December of 2019, many athletes and teams  receiving nutritional support performed well and won gold medals.  Support for national nutrition initiatives (the Philippines) The Philippines faces challenges of both under- and over-nutrition, resulting in underweight and  obesity. These challenges are likely due in part to a nutritional balance leaning heavily toward  carbohydrates. In response to these challenges, the Philippine government, in collaboration with the  WHO and other parties, developed the Pinggang Pinoy dietary guide to help consumers develop  healthy eating habits. Since fiscal 2018, AJINOMOTO PHILIPPINES CORPORATION (APC) has  worked with the Philippines Department of Health and other government agencies to help promote  and implement Pinggang Pinoy through APC products and services.    Specifically, APC has used the Ajinomoto Groups expertise and products in developing  delicious, healthy, easy-to-prepare, and affordable meals. APC also uses its website and social media  channels to offer these meal ideas for the everyday enjoyment and nutritional health of consumers.  Further, APC uses product packaging itself as another channel to communicate with consumers. In  developing menus, APC refers to a-MENU, the Ajinomoto Groups unique database of information  related to local daily diets and consumer attributes. APC then incorporates the results of national  standards for commonly deficient nutritional elements (such as vitamins and minerals lacking due to  insufficient consumption of vegetables and fruits) or commonly excessive nutritional elements (such  as carbohydrates and salt) compared to the actual dietary and cooking habits of consumers. APC  also sponsors educational events for housewives, offering education about the double burden of  malnutrition, conducting cooking demonstrations using recipes made from Ajinomoto Group products,  and otherwise providing tips to solve nutritional issues.    Moving forward, we will continue to leverage our strengths in striving to raise the level of  understanding related to nutrition and meals, contributing to nutritional solutions for the people of the  Philippines.

Inspired by the  Japanese seasonings, furikake, this product is designed to easily increase calcium intake by being  sprinkled on rice, which is a staple food of the Philippines. Due to a shortage of calcium intake for all  age groups in the Philippines, we aim to assist in proper calcium intake through our products.   In May 2020, we launched the nutritional supplement Multivitamin & Minerals in Japan. This  product contains 12 vitamins and nine minerals essential for maintaining daily health, and is designed  to supplement nutrients that individuals tend to lack due to an unbalanced lifestyle and diet.

At the same time, a growing number of children in urban areas are overweight and obese. To resolve  these issues, AJINOMOTO VIETNAM CO., LTD. launched the School Meal Project in 2012 to apply  ideas learned from Japans school lunch system. Working with central government ministries, including  the Ministry of Education and Training, and the Ministry of Health, the company has been carrying out  a range of activities to deploy well-balanced school meals nationwide. The project has developed and  provided school-meal menu books and food and nutrition education materials, as well as developed  and implemented menu-making software. As of March 2020, school lunch project activities have  expanded across 62 municipalities and over 4,000 elementary schools.   In Indonesia, the high percentage of children with low body weight, stunted growth and anemia  is a serious social problem. PT AJINOMOTO INDONESIA implemented a school meal project in  partnership with the Department of Nutrition at Institut Pertanian Bogor University beginning in fiscal  2018. The ten-month program provided nutritionally balanced school lunches and taught diet and  nutrition to teenage students, and has led to more balanced nutritional intakes, lifestyle changes and  the improvement of anemic conditions of the students. The company conducted this project in fiscal  2019 and will continue to do so, helping to resolve childrens health issues.  Dealing with nutritional issues in young women (Japan) In Japan, weight loss has become noticeably more common among women in their 20s and 30s.  Unhealthy weight loss has been linked to poor health, risk of obesity in future offspring, risk of diabetes  due to insufficient muscle mass and risk of falling and bone fracture in old age.   Ajinomoto Co., Inc. published the basic edition of the book Womens Self Care, in March 2020.  We distributed this book to organizations such as the Kanagawa Dietetic Association, in addition to  publishing the book online via the corporate website. This book explains the lifelong changes that the  body of a woman undergoes and suggests proper nutritional intake and exercise habits.

Takaaki Nishii, President and CEO of Ajinomoto Co., Inc., participated in a panel discussion  where he not only exchanged opinions with stakeholders, but also introduced examples of solutions  to resolve nutritional issues. These examples included the Ajinomoto Group Kachimeshi program and  activities to promote delicious salt reduction. Other examples were our Vietnam school lunch project,  as well as the mother-child nutrition improvement initiatives promoted by the Ajinomoto Foundation in  Ghana. Performance Initiatives to resolve nutritional issues  Contribution to Solve Food and Health Issues   Activity Report by Materiality Items  Dealing with nutritional issues in the elderly (Japan) Elderly people may not be able to eat adequately due to declining physical functions and loss of  appetite as they age. Less food intake causes body weight to decrease and muscular and physical  strength to deteriorate, which may then lead to lower physical activity, less appetite, and a vicious  cycle of undernourishment.  To prevent this, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. leverages its protein and amino acid nutrition expertise and  strives to publicly disseminate nutritional knowledge to people with health problems. In addition, we  continue to partner with specialists, providing information for immediate use to healthcare providers,  registered dieticians and pharmacists as guidance tools, and conducting training to foster deeper  understanding.   Our website for restaurant-use products now features a page entitled Tabesapo to eat well and  prevent malnutrition. This webpage provides suggestions on tasty and easy-to-eat meals designed  to maintain good health and reflect the physical changes unique to elderly people. We aim to support  their nutritional intake by introducing techniques that make eating easier, as well as menu suggestions  that utilize our products and cooking methods for each ingredient. \u0007 Tabesapo for  eating well  to prevent  malnutrition  (Japanese only) Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability GRI102-12 GRI203-2  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 27  Exchanging opinions at the 7th Tokyo International Conference on African Development The 7th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD7) was held in August 2019 in  Yokohama.

AIRS assesses risk based on the balance of amino acid concentrations in blood.   In September 2019, Scientific Reports Magazine published a paper that validated the inspection  performance related to cancer discovery in a multicenter prospective study [1]. This study adds a level  of evidence for cancer evaluation using AIRS and confidence among doctors.  In October 2019,  we signed an agreement related to the prevention of the three major diseases with a Japanese life  insurance company and other entities, and are working for the wider use of AIRS tied to early  detection and treatment for the three major diseases, as well as joint research in developing new  AIRS-based services. In November 2019, we signed a research and development agreement with  the Kanagawa Cancer Center related to stratification [2] marker search in connection with lung cancer  treatment. The aim of this research and development is to offer cancer patients more appropriate  treatment options, to alleviate the physical burden on cancer patients, and to reduce treatment costs.  In this project, we will be aided by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)  with the Kanagawa Cancer Center acting as the representative organization. In the future, we plan to develop services related to cognitive function decline risks, further  expanding AIRS as a preventive solutions service.

The course, available from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2024, aims to  create a new concept in nutritional studies through joint research.   With the support of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), the Hirosaki University Center  of Innovation (COI) program [2] analyzes health-related big data from the Iwaki Health Promotion Project [3]  operated by Hirosaki City in Aomori Prefecture. Many companies are also participating in this project,  aiming toward social implementation. The goal of this joint research is to establish new digital risk screening  protocols and develop assessment methods through a combination of health-related big data analysis  and the AminoIndex technology of Ajinomoto Co., Inc. We are also conducting research into extending  the healthy life expectancy through human intervention studies using low-sodium and protein-enhancing  products.   We plan to build an ecosystem for new solutions to health issues with the cooperation of local  governments and the facilities of the Hirosaki University COI. In so doing, we expect to also create concepts  for new products and services. TOPIC [1]  A research organization founded by the university and funded by private companies and other organizations.  In addition to providing researchers, facilities, and equipment, the university hosts researchers from funding  corporations and other organizations. In this way, the university and companies providing funding operate the  research organization on an equal footing. [2]  A large-scale research program supported by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology  and the JST. This program involves long-term research (up to nine years) to create a leap forward in innovation by  conducting research activities backcasting from an ideal society envisioned 10 years from now and implementing the  results in society.

We support a diverse range of lifestyles, creating spare time by providing smart cooking, which lets anyone cook  easily and encourages people to enjoy cooking, even if they are busy. With our products, we also encourage consumers  to experience the fun and joy of eating together. Further, through products with high health value, e-commerce, and other  channels, we will provide personal food products and food product experiences that offer both nutrition and peace of mind.  We will continue to respond to changing global lifestyle preferences, delivering more solutions that include the clean label  movement (clear ingredient labeling, products that use simple raw ingredients), vegan-friendly foods, and more.

We offer well-balanced, nutritional menus using local  ingredients and classic dishes. We also suggest ways to create a better mealtime settings.    Dietary habits are changing as lifestyles diversify.  We see more people eating alone and more  people eating individualized meals, even when dining with family. The busy-ness of life is leaving  people with less time to prepare and eat meals.   Meals are not only for nourishment, but also valuable opportunities for communications.  Consumers demands related to food and lifestyles are diversifying. People want more satisfaction  through cooking joyfully and well, as well as the joy of connecting with family and others through food.   The Ajinomoto Group offers a variety of values in response to these lifestyle changes and  diversifying needs. For example, we continue to expand our product lineup to meet various needs that  include seasonings for microwave meals to meet needs of time savings, soups that consider health  and nutritional needs, and seasonings rooted in local food culture. We also create opportunities to  enjoy cooking and food, suggesting different menus for various occasions. Responding to diversifying values Approach SteamMe, a seasoning in a pressure steam cook pouch  for pork char siu (Japan) Make char siu quickly using a microwave oven, saving time  and effort. DeliDawa powdered seasoning  (Nigeria) We have achieved industrial  production for the traditional  seasonings used all over West Africa,  made by fermenting and drying  beans and seeds.

Responding to diversifying values required for food  Rapid Response to Consumer Lifestyle Changes   Activity Report by Materiality Items Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 33 Developing allergy-free frozen foods The number of people suffering from food allergies is on the rise in Japan. For about 70% of people,  allergies are triggered by wheat, eggs, or milk, particularly among children (survey by Ajinomoto Frozen  Foods Co., Inc.). Frozen foods delivering deliciousness, time savings, convenience, and affordable prices  continue to grow the market by meeting the diversifying needs of consumers. The Ajinomoto Group strives  to provide delicious food items that anyone can eat with peace of mind. This is why we are developing  allergy-conscious products for our customers.   In fall 2019, we removed wheat as an ingredient in our Yawaraka Wakadori Karaage (fried chicken)  product. This product used rice flour originally; however, we faced the necessity to change the soy sauce  ingredient (major taste component) to a non-wheat type. We spent two years in product development from  conception to commercialization, longer than required for most products. In spring 2020, we introduced the  new wheat-, egg-, and milk-free Kokusan  Tori no Uma Karaage (fried chicken)  product. We are actively working to expand  our lineup of wheat-, egg-, and milk-free  products that are conscious of customer  food allergies. TOPIC The Ajinomoto Group expands our business through our own mail order and external e-commerce  site, helping consumers purchase products anytime, anywhere. We have established a system to  analyze the awareness and behavior of consumers through digital data. We provide products that  meet the trends of users on e-commerce websites in Japan and overseas.   At the same time, we have established our own distribution networks that include farms and  village areas in developing and emerging countries with weak distribution mechanisms. In this way  and more, we provide products not only through supermarkets, but also in grocery stalls within  markets. We have adopted a cash-based direct sales model for staff to sell physical goods (products),  depending on the conditions in each country or region. By communicating directly with shopkeepers  and consumers, we exchange a wealth of information and deepen our understanding of consumer  needs. In turn, this allows us to offer products more rooted in the local community.   We also establish reasonable prices and convenient product formats tailored to the lifestyle  conditions in each country or region. For example, we offer a minimum standard size of umami  seasoning AJI-NO-MOTO of 5g (10 naira=2.8 yen) in Nigeria and 8g in Egypt (1 Egyptian pound = 6.7  yen) [1].     The Ajinomoto Group strives to improve product availability and accessibility by utilizing digital  data and collecting information through direct communications. Approach GRI203-2 Product sold in Egypt [1] The exchange rate as of June 2020 was used to convert product prices into Japanese yen.

We call this series of connection  points the Kitchen Value Chain . To ensure that consumers are satisfied at each point, we develop  products with a focus on such qualities as deliciousness, ease of preparation, and the usefulness  and eco-friendliness of packaging materials, as evaluated from the standpoints of kansei engineering,  ergonomics, and human psychology.   To develop products that consumers feel delicious, we must understand what deliciousness  means from their perspective. The perception of deliciousness depends not only on the country,  region, age, gender, and food experience of the individual, but also on the eating environment. Based  on our own specialty ingredients, the Ajinomoto Group refines Deliciousness Technologies that  integrate flavor, taste, and texture. In this way, we pursue science- and digital-based solutions to  diversified needs without compromising taste.

Rapid Response to Consumer Lifestyle Changes   Activity Report by Materiality Items Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 35 The Ajinomoto Group markets products in more than 130 countries and regions. Each region  experiences deliciousness differently and has its own customs related to preparing and eating food.  Each region also has particular ways of communicating that are considered appropriate.    Communicating in accordance with the local culture is crucial to conveying the value of a  product or service. Given these differences, we have stated our commitment to practicing responsible  marketing communications in our Group Shared Policy on Marketing Communications. This policy  acknowledges that extra caution is needed in marketing communications designed for children. We  pledge to act responsibly, refraining from exploiting the inexperience or imagination of children or using  language that can mislead children.   We updated our policies in April 2020 to clarify that the Ajinomoto Group Policies are based on  the ICC Framework for Responsible Food and Beverage Marketing Communications, which are global  standards established by the International Chamber of Commerce.   Group companies in Japan publish social media guidelines on their respective websites,  disclosing the rules with which employees must comply when engaging in social media. Packaging  on food-related products display both legally required information and voluntary information unique to  the Ajinomoto Group, including lists of allergens and details of ingredients that may be unfamiliar to  customers. Incidents of non-compliance The Group was not a subject of any fiscal 2019 public announcements made by the Japan Consumer  Affairs Agency related to violations of the Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading  Representations.

As a company that creates products our customers ingest physically, quality assurance and  appropriate information disclosure are very important matters for us. We also believe in the importance of listening carefully and responding to customer requests. As we continue this  cycle of interaction, we produce products and services that help us build deeper relationships of trust with customers and  generate greater satisfaction.

To provide product safety, it is essential to  implement comprehensive quality assurance systems and proper disclosure. In addition, we listen  carefully and respond to customer needs to deliver products and services that earn the trust of  customers and ensure satisfaction. The Ajinomoto Group has our own quality assurance system, ASQUA. As of March 2020, 100 Group  companies have implemented.   The core of ASQUA is based on ISO 9001, the international quality management system  standard. We supplement this standard with other manufacturing management standards such as  the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) [1], Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) [2],  and the Groups own rules and requirements. ASQUA is composed of Group Shared Policies [3], and  associated quality assurance rules, regulations and standards, as well as other rules established by  each internal organization.   Quality standards ranging from development and raw materials procurement to sales and  customer communications. We review these standards constantly in light of internal and external  trends. In fiscal 2019, we established new Quality Audit Standards, integrating the requirements for  quality audits for each standard as described in regulation and standards of ASQUA.

The validity of data related to development, production, and the functional  features of food products is evaluated and judged objectively and fairly in quality assessment meetings  and by committees of internal experts. To ensure the proper operation of these systems, we conduct  ongoing quality audits and third-party certification audits.   In addition, global standards require systems that store and prevent the manipulation of analysis  data on manufactured pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients. We continue to  strengthen management based on these standards.  Initiatives to reduce quality-related complaints and incidents During fiscal 2019, we issued three distribution collections due to contamination (plastic pieces, etc.).   We carefully investigate each quality-related complaint and incident to identify the cause and  prevent recurrence. Details of any quality-related incident and information on preventative measures  are communicated promptly to Group companies in Japan and abroad to prevent recurrences.

We have promoted the benefits of monosodium  glutamate (MSG), the sodium salt of glutamic acid, across the world. MSG offers a variety of value.  MSG improves the flavor preference of low-salt foods, shortens cooking time, and contributes to  reducing meal costs at schools and other facilities.   At the same time, MSG has been the subject of nebulous anxieties for many years as a purported  chemical harmful to health. Labels such as additive-free, chemical-free seasoning, or No MSG,  have led to unsubstantiated rumors and misunderstandings among consumers that continue to this  day.   We see a tremendous opportunity today in how consumers around the world communicate  online, as well as in the rising global interest related to food safety, food security, and health. We are  seizing on this opportunity to leverage various media in actively sharing information to consumers  based on facts and scientifically backed evidence. Not only do we resolve misunderstandings about  safety, but we also engage in initiatives to spread information about the benefits of MSG to the  world, including MSGs role in improving flavor, reducing sodium intake, and improving nutrition for  the elderly. The Ajinomoto Group began actively conducting communication activities by launching the World  Umami Forum (WUF) in September 2018 in the United States. Conducting risk communications in Japan Ajinomoto Co., Inc. held three media conferences in April, July, and November of 2019.   In the first media conference, we hosted a discussion among external experts in food additives  on the topic, Social Issues in Food Labeling. The panelists addressed misconceptions related to  MSG and issues related to additive-free labeling on food products. The second conference included  a panel of experts on MSG safety and the reputation of MSG. The main topic of this discussion was,  How does fake news propagate? Through these first two conferences, participants learned of the  significant gap between the desire of experts to communicate the safety of MSG and the desire of  consumers for peace of mind. Participants also learned that debates of right or wrong are not likely  to convince consumers.   The third conference consisted of a lecture and panel discussion on the theme Risk  Communication for Today. Details included how to engage in communications that prevent rumor- based panics among consumer in this age of social media and the flood of disinformation.  Here,  we announced our establishment of a new opportunity for risk communication that goes beyond  organizational, market, industry, and personal perspectives, and we declared our commitment to  work with consumers to share correct information related to food and health, contributing to a healthy,  more abundant society. We sponsor forums for consumers to hold discussions and dispel the risks of  disinformation related to food and health.

Consumer preconceptions about  umami seasoning AJI-NO-MOTO  also vary widely between the north and south. In the north, 80%  of consumers have a positive attitude toward AJI-NO-MOTO . In contrast, 70% of people in the  south have negative preconceptions due to misunderstandings and biases. To dispel misconceptions  among southern consumers, the Ajinomoto Group engaged in a variety of activities. We sponsored  seminars to convey information based on scientific information, working with university professors to  communicate with doctors, nutritionists, home economics teachers, and other influential individuals.  We also joined with leaders of medical organizations as guests on live radio programs, answering the  questions of listeners. We appointed two influencers who participated in the WUF as ambassadors,  disseminating information via live streaming, cooking videos, and other social media content.   Children in Nigeria suffer from poor nutrition. At the same time, the country has the worst rate  of lifestyle-related diseases in the world, caused in part by excessive salt intake. We will continue  promoting the salt-reduction benefits of using AJI-NO-MOTO , contributing to the healthy lives of the  Nigerian people. Sharing information with stakeholders in Vietnam Subsequent to the WUF, AJINOMOTO VIETNAM CO., LTD. has been engaging in communications  tailored to individual stakeholders.   For public institutions, the company provides presentation materials that discuss the safety of  MSG and ways to reduce salt intake through MSG. These presentation materials are used in meetings  and workshops hosted by the Ministry of Health General Department of Preventive Medicine to  communicate information to healthcare workers.   For consumers, the company provided information to the press regarding WUF, encouraging  wider coverage of correct information about MSG through articles in 37 different publications.   The company is also educating employees about MSG and umami based on WUF content.

Our work with registered dieticians is one example. We sponsored a booth at the Food & Nutrition  Conference and Expo where we offered samples of plant-based meals using umami to reduce  sodium while maintaining deliciousness. Visitors learned that they could ingest less salt without any  compromises in taste. In addition to visiting culinary schools to educate students and instructors on  basic information on MSG and umami, we sponsored cooking competitions to stimulate creativity in  the use of umami in cooking. We are also striving to communicate with millennials interested in food.   These initiatives and others have raised significant interest and positive awareness of MSG in the  United States. Surveys have shown an improvement in perception regarding MSG among registered  dieticians and food-forward consumers. We will continue to appeal to the safety and sodium-reduction  benefits of MSG, suggesting MSG as a means toward delicious, satisfying meals.

TOPIC In the 1970s, the United States experienced a phenomenon called Chinese Restaurant Syndrome (CRS).  Stories spread of the mistaken assumption of a relationship between MSG in Chinese food and headaches,  palpitations, etc. CRS fanned the flames of anti-Asian sentiment at the time, becoming a socially accepted  negative attitude toward MSG. Although the controversy continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s,  experts from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on  Food Additives of the UN made public statements declaring the safety of MSG. Using facts based on  solid, scientifically verified data, these experts rejected any causal relationship between MSG and CRS.  Unfortunately, once a misunderstanding has taken hold, it is difficult to convince consumers of the truth.  Even today, many restaurants and food manufacturers use the No MSG label, indicating an ongoing  concern about the safety of MSG. In January 2020, the Ajinomoto Group launched a campaign using the hashtag, #RedefineCRS. We  produced a video promoted widely across social media featuring a famous chef, a well-known celebrity,  and a medical doctor to raise questions about the common perception of CRS, while letting people know  that MSG is a completely safe ingredient. We received feedback immediately from many people and the  campaign was covered in numerous media outlets, turning into a big movement. After looking into the  facts, authoritative dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster revised the definition of CRS, making the following  changes. 1. Added a statement that the term was outdated and, in some cases, racially offensive 2.  Added an annotation that the relationship between supposed symptoms and MSG has not been proven  in studies As with the #RedefineCRS campaign, the Ajinomoto Group will continue to dispel consumer  misunderstandings, engaging in communications across various channels to spread the message of the  value of MSG to as many people as possible.

We encourage optimal information sharing to understand, empathize,  execute, and realize ASV, helping employees embrace ASV as ones own initiative and act autonomously.  As part of these efforts, we adopted Workplace by Facebook in July 2020. Workplace by Facebook is  a social networking platform connecting our global operations in a timely, two-way manner. Currently,  approximately 9,000 Group employees use this platform to share CEO messages and individual ASV  initiatives. We plan to expand our use of this platform over time. TOPIC Promotion of ASV as ones own initiative based on engagement surveys To date, the Ajinomoto Group has quantitatively measured employee engagement through an  engagement survey, conducted once every two years. This survey helps us understand and take  action to improve issues, leveraging the PDCA cycle.   Survey results for fiscal 2019 reflected a one-point improvement in our favorable score for  Sustainable Engagement [1], achieving our 17-19 MTP target. On the other hand, responses to some  questions scored lower when compared to other food and beverage companies and other high- performing companies. This result indicated a greater need to improve ASV engagement and practice  ASV in the day-to-day operations of every organization.   Our 20-25 MTP includes a KPI for Employee Engagement (ASV as ones own initiative) [2].  Accordingly, we intend to conduct an engagement survey annually, addressing any issues uncovered  in our plans for the following fiscal year. [1] A question category correlated highly with corporate sustainable growth. Questions measure workplace productivity and  the vibrancy of our organizational culture, in addition to employee desire to contribute to goals and the intensity of employee  connection to the company.

During fiscal 2019, we expanded our web-based  third-party reporting system from three countries to 13. In addition, we actively communicate our  approach and systems related to our whistleblower policy, striving to strengthen this program. The Ajinomoto Group believes that employee growth leads to company growth and a contribution  to society. To link employee growth with company growth, we offer workplace environments,  human resource management systems, and educational programs that support self-directed career  development.

Labor agreements require the company to notify employees and their representatives  before making any major changes that impact employees (minimum prior notice requirements are  confidential and therefore not disclosed).   Labor agreements also stipulate various requirements concerning safety and health, education  and training, and medical checkups. Both management and employees work together to improve  workplace safety and health standards. Under Japanese law, each workplace must convene a monthly  safety and health committee meeting. The committee consists of roughly half managers and half staff.  The purpose of this meeting is to identify causes and solutions related to occupational accidents and  to share information on the status of employees on sick leave, changes in relevant laws, and more.

Every employee working in Japan is interviewed by an occupational physician or  medical staff at the Wellness Promotion Center at least once per year. Based on medical examination  and stress assessment results, employees receive health guidance that is respectful of their individual  values and lifestyles, while also ensuring any latent physical or mental health problems are addressed.  Guidance and advice services are also available for employees who work long hours or who are  stationed overseas.  Health status visualization A visual representation of health status is vital to implement employee self-care. Employees use the  health advice app Calomama Plus to map exercise, diet, sleep, and emotions on four axes. In addition,  we created the MyHealth personal health management website for employees to monitor medical  checkup results, work data, and lifestyle data. In fiscal 2020, we will introduce initiatives for nutritional  improvements in the workplace.  Mental Health Recovery Program Ajinomoto Co., Inc. operates an original Mental Health Recovery Program. While taking temporary  health leave and after returning to work, employees on this program receive ongoing support to assess  their personal values and sources of fulfillment, learning to enjoy work by dealing with stress. As part of  this program, employees set goals based on the state (stage) of their symptoms.

To gather  diverse talents, we value diversity in gender, age, nationality, and individual professional experiences.  We want all to know that the Ajinomoto Group is committed to do our best in encouraging diversity  and inclusion.   The challenge that lies before Ajinomoto Co., Inc. is to increase the number of women leaders and  accelerate reform in the companys corporate culture, raising the ratio of women serving as directors  and line managers to 30% by fiscal 2030. Ajinomoto Co., Inc. established the HR development committee for women, led by a director in charge  of diversity and HR, to provide concrete support behind plans for promoting and developing careers  for women. The committee conducts mentoring programs to accelerate the appointment of women  to senior positions, and workshops and colleges for younger women employees, and advances  cooperative measures among companies participating in the 30% Club [1] Japan.   Further, the Company established a D&I Promotion Team within our HR Dept. to conduct  planning and operations of cross-organizational activities that includes several other group companies.  More specifically, the team started to conduct companywide unconscious bias training, D&I training  among sales departments, and LGBT partner support system. The team also promotes in-house  and other affiliated daycares as part of building career-support environments, as well as striving to  create workplaces amenable to persons with disabilities (such as providing professional life counselors  throughout Japan).

Status of ISO 14001 certification As of March 2020, the Ajinomoto Group has acquired ISO 14001 certification at 59 of 98 eligible  factories. Even those companies not yet certified are conducting management based on the ISO  14001 approach. We have recently changed how we calculate ISO 14001 certified companies in  line with the method for calculating EMS certification ratios under the Dow Jones Sustainability Index  survey. Environmental assessments When the Ajinomoto Group launches new products and businesses, or when we change the use  of existing raw materials or production processes, we assess the potential environmental impact of  our business plans. We then take any necessary measures to minimize future risks. Environmental  assessments at Group companies are performed by relevant departments in accordance with  internal rules. The results of these assessments are reviewed from a Group-level perspective by the  environmental management departments.

As a result of appropriate corrective actions in response to administrative  guidance and other compliance, the Group experienced no violations of the Air Pollution Control Act of  Japan, effluent standards, or other environmental laws during fiscal 2019. The Group did experience  two incidents having an impact on the environment outside our worksites in Japan (one complaint  related to exhaust fan noise and one fluorocarbon leak). The Group also recorded one incident of  failure to renew a license outside Japan. We reported these immediately to authorities and investigated  their causes, taking necessary measures. Specialized education The Ajinomoto Group conducts environmental education for employees to acquire the expertise and  skills for environmentally responsible business operations.   In Japan, we provide ongoing education to the environmental officers, managers, and staff  in each organization, as well as environmental assessment training for staff in business and  research departments responsible for developing new businesses and products. We also conduct  environmental law seminars for relevant staff to stay up-to-date with the frequent revisions in  environmental regulations and to ensure compliance.

The risks involved with the advancement of climate change include the inability to procure raw materials. At the  corporate management level, we see climate change as both a risk and an opportunity as we study measures in response.  Aiming to reduce our environmental footprint throughout the lifecycle of our products, we promote energy conservation,  using energy from renewable energy sources, and participation in international initiatives, aiming to solve issues as we work  closely with entities both internal and external.

The  Ajinomoto Group will evaluate the risks and opportunities of climate change on business, and actively  disclose relevant information in four areas based on TCFD recommendations: governance, strategy,  risk management, and metrics and targets. Information disclosure in four areas based on TCFD recommendations  Governance The Management Risk Committee and Environmental Committee, organized under the Executive  Committee, review appropriate responses to the risks and opportunities related to climate change.   The Management Risk Committee identifies the risks and opportunities related to climate change  and considers the appropriate responses. The Environmental Committee develops environmental  targets and plans, monitoring performance in keeping with our environmental management system.  These details are reported to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors at least once a year.  The Executive Committee and the Board ensure these details are included in our corporate strategy.  The Board of Directors makes decisions on capital expenditures from an overall perspective, taking  into account environmental assessment results, including the impact of climate change.  Strategy Products in our business domains range from food such as seasonings, frozen foods and coffee to  healthcare. Further, our operations span the globe. Climate change may impact Group operations  in many ways. Major natural disasters may become diminished our business activities, affecting our  ability to procure raw materials and fuel. Disasters may also alter the consumption of our products.   The Group reviews production over the short, medium, and long terms, considering the physical  risks of climate change (droughts, floods, rising sea levels, changes in yield of major raw materials,  etc.) and transition risks (rising energy prices, tight supply and demand and price increases of our main  raw materials due to competition with other food sources and biofuels, etc.).   Since fiscal 2018, we have included a scenario analysis of the impacts of climate change on our  business. We also established a framework for a more quantitative assessment of risk based on the  TCFD recommendations. Based on the results of scenario analyses, we will review counterstrategies  related to physical and transition risks, such as switching to energy sources with low greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions.

Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation   Activity Report by Materiality Items Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 66  Risk Management In light of politics, economics, social conditions, climate change, and other circumstances surrounding  the Group, the Management Risk Committee determines the overall level of risks reflecting the impact  on our business and likelihood of occurrence. The committee then identifies the significant risks  Group-wide and considers strategies in response.   Climate-related risks are regarded as part of significant risks Group-wide. We evaluate the impact  of physical risks and transition risks, such as legal risks and market risks, based on published reports  and expert advice. The committees review and recommendations are reported to the Executive  Committee and the Board of Directors at least once a year.  Metrics and Targets In our medium- and long-term environmental targets, the Group aims to reduce absolute Scope 1 and  2 GHG emissions by 50% by fiscal 2030 (compared with fiscal 2018). We also aim to reduce water  usage per production volume unit by 80% (compared with fiscal 2005) over the same timeframe.   We have measured and reported our GHG emissions and water consumption since 1996. See Integrated Report 2020 for more on our roadmap for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. [1] Calculation based on International Energy Agency (IEA) data (energy unit price increase between 2040 and 2050 of 60% for  heavy oil and 30% for gas; carbon taxes in 2040 of US$140/t-CO2 in advanced economies and US$125/t-CO2 in developing  economies). [2] A system in which companies set their own internal carbon price, promoting low-carbon investment and countermeasures.  This system is used as an incentive to promote energy conservation, to identify revenue opportunities and risks, and as a  guide in investment decision-making. Following fiscal 2018, the Ajinomoto Group conducted a scenario analysis for fiscal 2019 of the  potential impact of climate change using our mainstay umami seasoning AJI-NO-MOTO . This time,  we expanded the target of our analysis from Southeast Asia in the prior year to all of our production  facilities worldwide. As a result of the analysis, we confirmed that the impact of an increase in average  temperature of 2C by the year 2100 on our main raw materials and changes in demand would be  relatively small, with no significant impact on profits. On the other hand, we found a financial risk of  between 8 billion yen and 10 billion yen due to increases of energy unit prices and increases of carbon  taxes [1] associated with the advancement of low-carbon societies.   In fiscal 2020, we plan to conduct our scenario analysis assuming a scenario in which the average  temperature rises by 4C by 2100 as well as to expand our scenario analysis to other business areas.  We are also considering internal carbon pricing [2] and other systems to reduce financial risk.

Currently,  ammonia is generally produced worldwide using the Haber-Bosch process. This is an excellent  production technology that synthesizes ammonia using only hydrogen obtained from nitrogen in  the air and natural gas. However, due to the need for high-temperature and high-pressure reaction  conditions, production is concentrated in large-scale plants and performed at enormous scale. Capital  investment related to this process is extremely costly. In addition, transport to areas of demand  scattered throughout the world requires large amounts of energy.   To solve these problems, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. is working toward practical implementation of  on-site production to produce the necessary amount of ammonia where it is needed. In 2017, the  Company, in partnership with Professor Hideo Hosono of the Tokyo Institute of Technology and  others, established Tsubame BHB Co., Ltd. Through this company, we are working toward the  practical application of an innovative ammonia production technology using electride catalyst. Electride  catalysts allow for highly efficient synthesis of ammonia, even under low-temperature and low-pressure  conditions. This means ammonia can be produced at small-scale plants, something considered  difficult to accomplish under the Haber-Bosch process.   In October 2019, we completed a pilot production facility at the Companys Kawasaki Plant,  launching operations capable of small-scale production of several tens of tons per year. Moving  forward, we intend to verify long-term durability and optimal operating conditions, preparing for  commercialization of on-site ammonia production between 2021 and 2022.

In  response, we revised the Ajinomoto Group policies for reducing fluorocarbons.   We aim to eliminate all HFCs by fiscal 2030 at factories with equipment that use fluorocarbons.  Our intent is to switch to natural refrigerants or refrigerants with low Global Warming Potential (GWP)  of less than 150 when installing new or upgrading existing equipment.   With regard to the seven Group frozen food factories in Japan, we converted 1 unit to natural  refrigerants during fiscal 2019. We plan to convert the remaining 5 units and eliminate the use of  fluorocarbons by the end of fiscal 2020.

Activity Report by Materiality Items Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 70 Feeds with poor amino acid balance lead to an oversupply of unnecessary amino acids. This  oversupply is not utilized by the animals and excreted in large quantities as nitrogen compounds.  During the waste treatment process, nitrogen compounds turn into nitrous oxide (N2O), which  increases environment impact at approximately 300 times the global warming potential of CO2.   Feed-use amino acids improve balance of feeds, reducing  excretion and reduce excreted nitrogen  compounds by approximately 30%. Amino acids thus help reduce the life-cycle CO2 (LC-CO2)  emissions of feed while also helping diminish odor caused by ammonia derived from nitrogen  compounds. Other benefits include reduced soil, surface water, and groundwater pollution.

We are committed to the effective use of any waste that is produced, aiming to recover  99% or more of any waste arising from our business activities.   The Group seeks to improve amino acid production efficiency by recovering by-products as  resources and introducing new technologies. We are also engaged in a range of efforts in food  production, including improving the precision of sales forecasts and conducting fine-tuned procurement.  In this way, we minimize wasted raw materials and the amount of packaging materials used.   In fiscal 2019, generation of hazardous waste increased compared with the previous year due  to increased utilization rate of biomass boilers aimed for the reduction of GHG emissions, which  resulted in an increase in cinders (rice husk ash). However, the amount of recycled hazardous waste  also increased, while the amount of landfilling of hazardous waste declined, due to the effective use of  cinder as fertilizer and fertilizer raw materials. To deal with the risk of carcinogenic substance emissions  that can occur when the rice husk is burned at high temperatures, we carried out work environment  measurements to confirm that environmental risks are low.

We pursue the 3Rs by minimizing the amount of  packaging material to the extent such does not interfere with original function considering how to easily  separate and sort our packaging by material for recycling. We select and develop optimal containers  and packaging, engaging in environmentally conscious design tailored to the different characteristics  and shapes of our products. Containers and packaging include everything from plastic, pouches to  trays, bottles, glass bottles, PET bottles, paper boxes, and exterior packaging (cardboard boxes). The  Group also strives to reduce the amount of food loss and waste generated by extending best-before  dates through the use of containers and packaging that better maintain product freshness. Our efforts  here include adopting single-serve packaging that leaves no food waste. The Ajinomoto Group deals in a wide range of containers and packaging for our products, including  seasonings, packaged food products, frozen foods, coffee products, fats and oils, and more. We  hold the Ajinomoto Group Food Conference and the Packaging Designers Liaison Meeting, and  other events for Group companies in Japan to share efforts and receive feedback in environmentally  conscious container and packaging design.  Reducing plastic waste In recent years, the problem of marine plastics have become a pressing global issue. The Ajinomoto  Group uses approximately 270,000 tons of packaging materials annually, of which approximately  70,000 tons is plastic. About 40% of that amount is plastic used in Japan and 60% overseas.  Substantial quantities of these materials are used in Southeast Asia, where there is increasing concern  about the effects of plastic packaging materials released into the environment.    The Ajinomoto Group has set a goal to reduce Group plastic waste to zero by fiscal 2030. To  promote this initiative more strategically, we launched a companywide project called Project Zero in  March 2020.   Under this project, we pursue two main goals: (1) reduce plastic usage and (2) develop conditions  needed for recyclability as resources. To reduce usage, we are thinning and downsizing packaging,  replacing with paper materials where possible. To develop conditions needed for recycling, we will  consider introducing mono-material plastic packaging and biodegradable plastics that are easy to  recycle as resources.  See Integrated Report 2020 for more on our roadmap for reducing plastic waste.

In October 2019, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. adopted a backless tube for use in JINO AminoCeutical Cream  (face moisturizer). This new tube reduces plastic by roughly 90% compared to the previous version.  The design prevents air from entering the tube after the cream is squeezed out, extending the quality  retention period of the product.   Ajinomoto Co., Inc. introduced ultrasonic sealing for film packaging in the six-stick trial version of  our Glyna and Amino Aile products (supplements). This technique reduces plastic use by 32%  compared to the previous version. The company received the Japan Packaging Contest 2019  Director of General, Industrial Science and Technology Policy and Environment Bureau, Ministry of  Economy, Trade and Industry Award and the WorldStar Packaging Awards 2020 WorldStar Award  for this design.  Ajinomoto AGF, Inc.   Ajinomoto AGF, Inc. launched the Blendy Stick Caf au Lait Eco Style (stick coffee) in October  2019 as the first stick coffee product in the industry to use paper for a portion of the packaging. The  company reduced plastic by roughly 20% compared to the previous version of stick product without  having to change the product expiration date. The company received the Japan Packaging Institute  Award in the 59th Japan Packaging Contest 2020 for this design.   In February 2020, Ajinomoto AGF, Inc. adopted Shelf-Ready Packaging (SRP: environmentally  conscious cardboard packaging requiring less labor) for packaging materials in our home-use PET  bottled coffee and instant coffee bag products (excluding commercial-use versions). Compared to  previous versions, time required to open boxes is reduced by roughly 10 seconds. At the same time,  the product eliminates the need for plastic tape, reducing plastic use by nearly 3.4 tons per year.   AJINOMOTO DEL PER S.A. AJINOMOTO DEL PER S.A. adopted biodegradable plastic for the package of Cup-Type Aji-no- men instant noodles launched in April, 2019.

As part of our efforts to reduce plastic waste, we participate as a founding member in CLOMA [1],  a platform for accelerating innovation by strengthening cross-industry cooperation across a wide  range of stakeholders. We are active in secretary and sub-committee chair (promotion subcommittee)  positions. In December 2019, we joined as corporate partner in Loop, a container collection and reuse  enterprise developed by TerraCycle of the U.S., a global startup in recycling. This platform has been  adopted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government as a new business model for the sustainable use of  plastics. An environmental impact verification test for 5,000 households in Tokyo is scheduled to begin  in the fall of 2020. The Ajinomoto Group plans test sales of granule seasonings and instant coffee.

We use this assessment to confirm compliance with product- specific regulations and compatibility with Group environmental targets (Table 1). In addition, Ajinomoto  Co., Inc. assesses the details of product revisions using a points-based Eco-Index for Containers and  Packaging (Table 2).   Under the Containers and Packaging Recycling Act in Japan, the recycling of containers and  packaging waste from households is consigned to the Japan Containers and Packaging Recycling  Association. In fiscal 2018, Ajinomoto Co., Inc., Ajinomoto Frozen Foods Co., Inc., and Ajinomoto  AGF, Inc. used a combined 33.6 kilo tons of containers and packaging subject recycling requirements,  down to 98.8% compared with the previous fiscal year. Based on this usage, recycling implementation  fee payments for fiscal 2020 amounted to 400.6 million yen, down to 97.2% compared with the  previous fiscal year.   While our use of plastic containers/packaging and PET bottles was almost unchanged, use of  glass bottles decreased to 94.2% compared to the previous fiscal year due to the end of sales of  bottled gift products. This resulted in lower year on year recycling implementation fee payments for  fiscal 2020 despite the higher unit price of recycling fees.

Amino acid-based surfactants reduce environmental impact due to high biodegradability. These  surfactants are also mild on the skin. Growing concern about the global environment in recent years  has resulted in a rapidly expanding market for amino acid-based surfactants. We have been expanding  our supply system to meet the global demand.   Specifically, we plan to construct a new plant for glutamic acid-derived Amisoft (liquid) in Brazil.  The new plant is slated to begin operations in 2020. Once the plant is up and running, a portion of  Amisoft (liquid) production in Japan will be transferred to Brazil. The production facilities in Japan will  be redirected to make glycine-derived Amilite (liquid). This will increase the production capacity of  Amisoft (liquid) by approximately 60% and approximately 30% for Amilite (total for all product forms).  In this way, we will strive resolve the supply shortages in amino acid-based surfactants. Since 2010, the Ajinomoto Group has labeled products with our original Aji-na Eco and Hotto-suru Eco  marks. We have adopted these marks to respond to consumer needs for environmentally conscious  products, as well as to let consumers know accurately which products are environmentally conscious.  We also strive to effectively communicate changes made to product packages that are difficult for  consumers to notice. These changes include package weight, thickness, size, and materials used.

This figure represents one-third of all the food  produced for consumption in the world. This food loss and waste occurs throughout the supply chain, from the farm to  the dinner table. Food resources are limited. At the same time, the global population is growing and demand for food is  expected to rise as well. In this context, reduction of food loss and waste is a critical issue.   The Ajinomoto Group aims to reduce food loss and waste through the product lifecycle, from the acceptance of raw  materials to customer use and disposal. We will accomplish this effort by working closely with our suppliers and consumers.

This definition excludes food ultimately used for  feed or fertilizer. Food waste turned into feed and fertilizer is not regarded as food loss and waste,  since it is returned to nature through the biocycle and leads to the reproduction of more food. The Ajinomoto Group is committed to a long-term vision to halve food loss and waste generated  throughout the entire product lifecycle by fiscal 2050 as compared to fiscal 2018. Our first target is to  reduce food loss and waste between the acceptance of raw materials and the delivery of products to  customers by 50% by fiscal 2025 (compared to fiscal 2018).   Food loss and waste in fiscal 2019 increased by 2% compared with fiscal 2016 (base year of 17- 19 MTP) and increased by 6% compared with fiscal 2018 (base year of 20-25 MTP). We are currently  conducting a detailed analysis of the underlying causes of food loss and waste as we plan initiatives to  reduce food loss and waste in the future.   Our 17-19 MTP referenced fiscal 2016 as the base year for food loss and waste reduction  measurement; however, our figures prior to fiscal 2017 were not sufficiently accurate. Therefore, our  20-25 MTP uses fiscal 2018 as our base year. The major food loss and waste categories generated by the Group are as follows: 1.  Raw materials and materials in process: Disposal due to product revisions, production item  changes, expired use-by dates, production incidents, etc. 2.  Products: Expired inventory caused by product revisions or production/sales management errors,  product returns due to erroneous shipment, goods damaged at warehouse or at the time of  delivery, disposal of sample items 3.  Loss due to standard factory operations: Waste generated by standard operations, including line  cleaning to switch products and sample inspections See Integrated Report 2020 for more on our roadmap for reducing food loss and waste.

Reduction of Food Loss and Waste   Activity Report by Materiality Items Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 80 Food loss and waste in Japan amounts to roughly 6.12 million tons annually (Ministry of Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries of Japan estimate for fiscal 2017). This level of food loss and waste is about 1.6  times the 3.9 million tons of global food aid provided (2018 United Nations World Food Programme  survey). Since 2011, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. has been collaborating with the Japanese government and all  manufacturing, distribution, and sales sectors to study changing best-before date labels to a month- year format, extending best-before dates, and optimizing delivery dates. In August 2018, the Company  and Ajinomoto AGF, Inc. extended best-before dates and switched from day-month-year to month- year labels for major home-use products.  Advantages of changing the best-before label to a month-year format across the entire supply chain  Fewer lots to manage  Minimizes storage space  Simplifies warehouse and store operations   We participated in the Japanese project for the 10x20x30 Food Loss and Waste Reduction  Initiative, proposed by the World Resources Institute of the United States in December 2019. In this  way and more, the Ajinomoto Group will continue to collaborate with government agencies and all  manufacturing, distribution and sales sectors, reducing food loss and waste throughout the supply  chain. Food loss and waste from the food service industry and retail stores are now a major concern as  dining out and home meal replacement (food purchased for home consumption) become more  commonplace.   Using enzyme technology and proprietary formulas, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. offers the food service  and home meal replacement industries in Japan a number of products to help reduce food loss and  waste at our customers. These products include Okome Fukkura Choriryo (retains the texture of freshly  cooked rice for an extend period of time), Kara-Age/Oniku Juicy Choriryo (retains the flavor of deep- fried chicken and other meat dishes even after cooling), Koku no Chikara (retains the flavor of meat  dishes, even after an extended period of time), and Knorr Beef Kaoritatsu Demiglace Sauce (use in  only the amount necessary; adjust to desired flavor intensity and thickness).

The Ajinomoto Group strives to reduce household food loss and waste by encouraging  eco-friendly eating in daily dining and food preparation. Eco-friendly eating consists of choosing  environmentally friendly products and enjoying food without wasting ingredients.  Recipes Since 2009, we have promoted Eco-Uma Recipes (eco-friendly and delicious recipes) through  websites and events, encouraging consumers to create delicious everyday meals without waste.   Eco-mark labels To help consumers quickly recognize and select eco-friendly products whenever possible, we  introduced unique eco marks (Aji-na Eco and Hotto-suru Eco marks) in 2010.  Environmental learning programs Since fiscal 2016, Ajinomoto Co., Inc., together with Kao Corporation and E-Square Inc. have been  conducting the environmental learning program, Summer Challenge: Exploring the Earths Future  through Food and Daily Living in cooperation with Kawasaki City in Kanagawa Prefecture. This  program is designed for the citys fifth graders and their parents.

This bounty includes  products from agricultural, livestock, fisheries, and other sources located around the world. We recognize that our business  activities affect the global environment and vice-versa. Sustainable procurement of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries  resources, therefore, is an extremely important issue for our businesses. We must also consider other social issues in our  supply chain, including the environment, human rights, and occupational safety. We are committed to working closely with  our suppliers in initiatives throughout our entire supply chain.

The identification process involves determining all the  raw materials used in operations, which are then analyzed by internal divisions and external experts  including NGOs. We base our assessment on an overall perspective that includes several factors  such as dependency on the materials used, availability of alternative materials, and relevance to global  environmental sustainability. We conduct an annual review of key raw materials to incorporate changes  in business, global environment, and other factors.    Recognizing that deforestation has a substantial impact on climate change, biodiversity, and  human rights issues, we seek to procure certified raw materials, ensuring partnerships with various  initiatives and establishing our own traceability systems, as well as implement audits based on the  Ajinomoto Group Palm Oil Procurement Guidelines and Paper Procurement Guidelines. The Group  added beef and soybeans to our list of key raw materials in fiscal 2019. These raw materials have been  listed as causes of deforestation by the CDP and Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), an international  industry organization counting numerous major food, consumer goods, and retail companies as  affiliated members. We plan to conduct the same type of surveys for these key materials as we do for  palm oil and paper.

Certain products use palm kernel oil, which is  harder to procure in certified form. Further, certain regions have limited supplies of certified palm oil.  Therefore, the Group defines palm oil certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) or  traceable by the Group to sustainable sources as a sustainable material. In regions where it is difficult  to procure RSPO-certified oil, we make every effort to procure palm oil that is confirmed as traceable.  In so doing, we ascertain whether production takes place in regions where environmental destruction  is a concern. In addition, we can respond quickly if human rights violations or other problems occur.   With a Group target to procure 100% sustainable palm oil by fiscal 2020, we achieved 79% in  fiscal 2019. We also achieved a rate of 25% in procuring palm oil certified by the RSPO.  The Ajinomoto Group has established Paper Procurement Guidelines which stipulate criteria that  must be met by the paper we procure. These guidelines define sustainable paper as paper that is  not derived from deforestation in areas of high conservation value and paper that is procured from  suppliers who use proper production procedures in accordance with local laws and regulations, as  well as in line with international human rights standards. Sustainable paper includes paper certified  by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC ), as well as recycled paper and paper made from FSC   Controlled Wood.   With a Group target to procure 100% sustainable paper by fiscal 2020, in fiscal 2019, sustainable  paper represented 91% of total container and packaging paper use.

We are  currently considering specific initiatives such as ensuring traceability. The Ajinomoto Group uses skipjack as an ingredient in HON-DASHI, our popular flavor seasoning  product in Japan. We are committed to conserving resources and sustainable procurement. Therefore,  we have conducted the joint skipjack tagging survey with the National Research Institute of Far Seas  Fisheries (NRIFSF) in Japan since 2009. The results of this survey have shown that skipjack catches in  the waters near Japan have fallen. However, skipjack levels near the equator appear to be stable.  It  is these equatorial skipjack that we use for the bonito flakes that serve as the raw material for HON- DASHI. A paper published in 2019 that summarized the data and results of past tagging surveys is  included in the National Tuna Fisheries Report of Japan to the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries  Commission (WCPFC) in 2020.   With regard to the sustainable procurement of shrimp, in fiscal 2018, we conducted human  rights surveys at shrimp farms and processing plants in Thailand where we procure shrimp for use as  an ingredient in frozen foods. We aim to achieve sustainable procurement by building a supply chain  management system that includes measures such as a complaint response mechanism. Coffee beans are grown in areas of the world rich in biodiversity, often by small farms. The Ajinomoto  Group has endeavored to procure coffee beans produced at farms that adhere to standards set by  the 4C certification system [1]. This system aims to improve environmental conditions at coffee farms  and better the lives of farm workers, while encouraging sustainable production and distribution.    In fiscal 2019, approximately 44% of the coffee beans we procured were from farms that adhere  to the 4C standards.    In fiscal 2020 and going forward, we plan to increase the 4C-certified procurement ratio of coffee  beans as well as adding the 4C certification logo to stick-type coffee products to notify consumers of  our efforts. Coffee cultivation experiments using high-value-added fertilizer The Ajinomoto Group has been conducting tests in different coffee-producing regions with the goal of  using high value-added fertilizers made from by-products (co-products) of the fermentation process  in producing amino acids (see P. 90). Our hope is that, eventually, this coffee will be part of a circular  economy.  Japan In 2017, Ajinomoto AGF, Inc. began working with local producer associations, governments, and  trading companies to develop a next-generation business through the Tokunoshima Coffee Production  Support Project in Tokunoshima, Kagoshima Prefecture. This project supports the expansion of coffee  bean production in one of the few coffee bean producing areas in Japan. We provide support via  production technology and soil improvement using high value-added fertilizer. Our aim is to introduce  Tokunoshima coffee bean products to the market.

Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 86  Colombia In fiscal 2019, we conducted a test using AJIFOL foliar fertilizer to enhance resistance to coffee rust  and other diseases. The results of this test, confirmed via laboratory experiments, showed enhanced  resistance to coffee rust and proof-of-concept tests are currently underway at farms.  Vietnam In addition to the test we have been conducting using our high-value added fertilizer, in fiscal 2019, we  installed irrigation facilities in the Krong Nang district of Vietnam and expanded the areas in which high- value-added fertilizer was put into use.  Brazil Having completed a two-year trial using high-value-added fertilizer, we began using this product in  regular coffee cultivation in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2020, we intend to increase the number of farms  supported by our high-value added fertilizer, making Group products that use the coffee beans  produced at these farms.  Indonesia We have provided support for farmers producing Robusta coffee beans in the form of high-value- added fertilizer in the Pagar Alam area of Sumatra. We also plan to provide this support in the  Surabaya area of Java and the Sidikalang area of Sumatra beginning in fiscal 2020. We began  providing support for Arabica producers as well. As the first stage in this program, in February 2020,  we began providing AJIFOL to contract farmers producing Rasna, a variety of Arabica, to test  productivity improvements. Fertilizer application (Indonesia) Sustainable Materials Sourcing    P93  Activity Report by Materiality Items Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 87 Supply chain management Ajinomoto Co., Inc. creates procurement policies for the entire Group. Group companies create  and implement plans and strategies based on these policies. We hold the Ajinomoto Group Global  Procurement Conference to share procurement policies and best practices within the Group. We  also use tools that allow persons within the Group to access necessary information, providing timely  communications on pertinent topics. The Ajinomoto Group states our expectations to suppliers related to sustainability in the Group Shared  Policy for Suppliers and asking our suppliers for their understanding and cooperation to ensure  human rights compliance and social responsibility in the supply chain. In May 2018, we joined Sedex,  a collaborative platform for sharing responsible sourcing data related to supply chains. Using this  platform, suppliers and buyers can disclose and view information related to business practices and  sustainability.    In fiscal 2019, we surveyed suppliers not yet members of Sedex to confirm whether the supplier  intended to join. We also conducted a survey comparable to the Sedex survey (self-assessment  questionnaire), receiving a 73% response rate from suppliers.    During fiscal 2020, we plan to use Sedex and self-assessment questionnaires to continue  evaluations and communications with suppliers in Japan and overseas. The Ajinomoto Group established a supplier hotline in June 2018. The hotline complements the hotline  available to Group executives and employees. Reporting from suppliers facilitates the early detection  and correction of Group executive and employee behaviors that are potentially in violation of the law  or the Ajinomoto Group Policies (AGP). Ultimately, the hotline will also be used to detect violations of  human rights, environmental laws, or other violations in our supply chain. The Ajinomoto Group Shared Policy on Human Rights demonstrates our commitment to evaluate the  impact of our businesses on human rights and clarify risks related to human rights.    During fiscal 2018, we conducted a human rights impact assessments on our fisheries and  chicken industry supply chain in Thailand, which is a comparatively high-risk environment. In fiscal  2019, we conducted a preliminary human rights impact assessment with respect to sugarcane and  coffee sourced in Brazil, a region close behind Thailand in terms of risk. In Japan, we conducted  follow-up on technical intern training programs for foreign nationals working among suppliers and  strengthened ties to organizations that provide workers and oversight groups.   During fiscal 2020, we plan to continue human rights impact assessments in Brazil. We also plan  to reduce risks on human rights through initiatives related to the three priority industry principles[1] on  forced or compulsory labor by the CGF, while adopting a system to monitor working environments for  foreign workers in our supply chain.

Animal-derived ingredients such as meat, eggs, and extracts are essential for the food products we  produce. In recent years, the issue of animal welfare has received greater attention. Animal welfare  refers to positive practices in raising livestock with the intent to provide a healthy lifestyle from birth  to death, reducing stress levels and fulfilling needs for exercise. However, no strict definition has ever  been established for the concept of animal welfare. The concept is understood differently by people in  different countries and regions.   Therefore, in 2018, we established the Group Shared Policy on Better Mutual Relationships  with Animals. This policy defines our approach to procurement in keeping with the concept of animal  welfare. In addition, we have set up roundtables consisting of external experts to respond flexibly  to social trends and demands. We also promote dialogue with stakeholders in this regard. We will  continue to hold dialogues with stakeholders involved in the Groups procurement of animal-derived  ingredients under our newly established Farm Animal Welfare Working Group (tentative name). We will  leverage these interactions to exchange opinions at roundtables and improve the understanding of  animal welfare by the Groups personnel in charge of procurement. Through these efforts, we aim to  build a better symbiotic relationship with all animals involved in the value chain. Roundtables on better animal welfare Roundtable meetings held since February 2020 are outlined below.   First roundtable (February 5, 2020):   The session began with an overview of the Group and explanations of how our business relates  with animals, as well as our approach and initiatives in this area to date. Meeting then shifted to an  exchange of views on the key themes to be addressed.   Second roundtable (April 8, 2020):   A panel of external members presented the latest information related to animal welfare and raised  issues in the Groups relationships with animals from an expert point of view. The experts and our  representatives engaged in an open exchange of opinions.    Third roundtable (May 13, 2020):   The Company reported on actions of the procurement department related to animal welfare, as well  as the launch of a new Farm Animal Welfare Working Group (tentative name).    In the fourth and subsequent roundtables, we will explore the changes in public awareness of  animal breeding and animal welfare, as well as the potential risks and opportunities for the Ajinomoto  Group, forming a unified approach to animal welfare.

We also launched a traceability survey of our supply  chain with 23 meat and meat extract suppliers in Japan (covering 75 kinds of raw materials). The risk  assessment for fiscal 2019 found that a combined traceability to original farming sites for fully traceable  suppliers and conditionally traceable suppliers remained at 32%. One of the reasons for this result was  that livestock breeding management guidelines have not been fully embraced in Japan. Awareness  varies widely among suppliers. We plan to continue our work in spreading awareness of these  guidelines. Ajinomoto Frozen Foods Co., Inc. is also conducting a similar survey.   Overseas, the Group tracks the status of legal developments regarding animal welfare. We will  share our policies and issues with our suppliers. Proteins, indispensable compounds for all animals, consist of approximately 20 different amino acids,  several of which cannot be synthesized internally in sufficient quantities. These amino acids can be  supplemented through animal feed.   Adding feed-use amino acids can improve the essential amino acid profile of feeds that consist  mainly of wheat and/or corn and thus are poorly balanced. The improved amino acid balance not only  increases feed efficiency and promotes growth, but also reduces environmental impact by reducing  excreted nitrogen.

We use nearly 100% of the nutritionally rich by-products (co-products)  that remain after extracting amino acids in the fermentation process as fertilizer and feed. We call this  type of recycling-based amino acid fermentation process that enriches local agriculture and contributes  to sustainable procurement a bio-cycle. Bio-cycles contribute to reliable supplies of food resources  and sustainable agriculture, which is why we are introducing these cycles in our fermentation factories  worldwide.

One example of a resource-saving fermentation technology is a technology that reduces raw  material input and energy use to enhance fermentation productivity. Another example is a technology  that employs rice husks, wood chips, and other unused locally available biomass as energy sources.  These technologies help secure food resources while reducing the use of raw materials, water, and  carbon emissions in production. Adoption of resource-saving fermentation technologies As of fiscal 2019, we have adopted raw material and energy reduction technologies at 79% of our  plants using resource-saving fermentation technologies to produce amino acids. We will continue  to develop and adopt this technology as one measure to achieve a 24% reduction in Scope 3  greenhouse gas emissions by fiscal 2030 (based on fiscal 2018 levels), a target approved in April 2020  by the Science Based Targets Initiative. Resource-saving fermentation technologies  Approach Performance   P61 GRI301-DMA Sustainable Materials Sourcing   Activity Report by Materiality Items Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 92 Contribution to sustainable agriculture Plants synthesize amino acids from absorbed nitrogen and sugars gained through photosynthesis,  then use amino acids to synthesize proteins necessary for growth. Even under poor photosynthesis  conditions caused by cloudy weather or low temperatures, plant growth can be stimulated by  supplying amino acids as fertilizer.   For more than 40 years, the Ajinomoto Group has effectively utilized the nutrient-rich co-products  of amino acid production as organic fertilizer. By fortifying these co-products with suitable amounts of  phosphoric acid and potassium, for example, we have developed fertilizers with higher added value.  Continued experiments and research have shown these amino acid-enriched fertilizers enhance root  development, plant growth, and harvest yields. High value-added fertilizers made with co-products  High value-added fertilizers used around the world  Approach Approach  Japan Ajinomoto Co., Inc. produces high-quality fertilizers, making effective use of co-product biomass  generated during the amino acid fermentation process. Cell drying technology using heat from  compost significantly reduces the amount of CO2 emitted during the course of drying co-products  created during the amino acid fermentation process. This fertilizer not only reduces environmental  impact, but also increases the amino acid content and sugar content of crops, while stabilizing quality.    We are expanding sales channels for this superior product and contributing to a revitalization of  agriculture in Kyushu area. In cooperation with value chain stakeholders, the company has created the  Kyushu Rikisaku brand for products made using this fertilizer. AEON Kyushu Co., Ltd. has launched a  project to sell products under the Kyushu Rikisaku Vegetables and Kyushu Rikisaku Fruits label. In recognition of this contribution to a sustainable value chain the project was awarded the Deputy  Chiefs Award (by the Chief Cabinet Secretary) in December 2019 in the 3rd Annual Japan SDGs  Awards.

The Mekong Delta in the south is a center of  rice production, where rice cultivation takes place two or three times a year. Continued use of non- organic fertilizers in this region has degraded soil fertility, resulting in unstable quality and yields, making  farmers difficult to make a living through rice cultivation.   In 2007, AJINOMOTO VIETNAM CO., LTD. began conducting research using a co-product called  AMI-AMI (liquid fertilizer) in small-scale test farms. Today, this co-product business in Vietnam, which  maintains soil fertility while keeping farm production costs down, is essential among local communities,  leading to sustainable agriculture.   China Many farmers working in agricultural areas other than in Chinas largest cities work part-time on very  small farmland acreage (0.1 to 0.2 ha). These farmers have found themselves in an inability to buy  high-quality fertilizers.   Agro2Agri, S.L. (Spain) is developing a single-dose packaged project in China to contribute  solutions to challenges faced by small-scale farmers. The company manufactures dedicated  packaging machines and provides technical support to farmers allowing for access to high-value- added fertilizers in a single dose at affordable prices. As a result, small farmers have achieved  improved crop productivity, conserve farmland, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and experience a  better quality of life.  Thailand In Thailand, we are seeing an evolution in the bio-cycle using co-product. Here, high-value-added  fertilizers made using co-products are sold to contract farmers. These farmers produce cabbages  purchased by the Ajinomoto Group and used as an ingredient in gyoza (Japanese-style dumplings),  creating a win-win scenario.   In this way, we ensure traceability of the cabbages we purchase and contribute to stable revenue  and agricultural revitalization for farmers. Since these cabbages grow nearly 1.4 times larger compared  with conventional fertilizers, coring work has been reduced, which improves production efficiencies in  the gyoza factory.  Brazil AJINOMOTO DO BRASIL INDSTRIA E COMRCIO DE ALIMENTOS LTDA. (ABR) mainly sells co- products such as AJIFOL to coffee and fruit plantations in Brazil. Fertilizer provided by ABR has been  used for more than 10 years. More recently, we have seen a movement among plantations toward  sustainable management, making a full-scale transition from chemical fertilizers to fertilizers from ABR.  In response to this development, ABR plans to offer wide-scale support to farms through co-products  beginning in fiscal 2020. Sustainable Materials Sourcing    P86  Activity Report by Materiality Items Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 94 Approach As the global population rises, so does the expected demand for water. Another issue is the ubiquitous presence of  fresh water around the world. The depletion of water resources not only impacts water used for production, but also the  procurement of raw materials. Drought, flooding, or poor water quality could also result in production delays.

Here, we identify the risks and opportunities  associated with each materiality item. The Management Risk Committee, an organization under  the Executive Committee, develops responses to risks and opportunities that have a groupwide  impact. The Management Risk Committee evaluates and manages important risks and opportunities  cross-functionally, including those pertaining to climate change, social issues, and technological  innovation. This framework allows us to respond to a crisis in a timely and appropriate manner.  Matters deliberated in the Management Risk Committee are reported to the Executive Committee and  the Board of Directors once per year. For highly urgent themes, the Committee organizes separate  working groups to work on formulating policies and project planning.   The Group encourages independent risk management within each organizational unit in  compliance with Group Shared Policy on Risk Management. Further, each organizational unit  performs an annual review of risk items and their degree of impact, evaluate each risk, reporting to  the Management Risk Committee annual plan regarding high-prioritized risks. The Business Conduct  Committee, which is also organized under the Executive Committee, prepares manuals and other  documents to address risks and emerging crises. Following these, each organizational unit creates  their own business continuity plan. We ascertain and inspect the status of preparations using crisis  management training and other means.

To foster an understanding of the Group Shared Policy on  Occupational Safety and Health, we created the Occupational Safety and Health Management Guide  and Standards and encourage Group companies to spread awareness of and use these guidelines.   In addition, we established the Safety & Disaster Prevention Promotion Headquarters to drive and  support measures related to occupational accidents and disaster prevention. If an accident, disaster,  or other emergency has occurred or may occur, that threatens Group occupational safety and health,  this headquarters assesses the situation, makes recommendations, and provides guidance. The  headquarters also reports to company executives and related departments. ISO 45001 adoption The Ajinomoto Group required all manufacture and R&D sites to obtain ISO 45001 certification as of  fiscal 2020.

Safety and health assessments, audits and inspections The Ajinomoto Group generally conducts the Occupational Safety and Health Assessments at the  beginning stages of new product manufacturing. This is one means to prevent occupational accidents.  In addition, we conduct internal audits at each company and business site to prevent accidents,  disasters or violations of the law. These audits are based on our occupational safety and health  management system.

Employee occupational safety and health education The Ajinomoto Group conducts occupational safety and health education tailored to employee job  descriptions and tasks. We created and published a skills map that defines the skills and knowledge  required of occupational safety and health managers at each Group companys site. The number of serious accidents during fiscal 2019 increased by five compared to fiscal 2018.  Although the number of serious accidents in the production areas of our factories decreased, we saw  an increase in accidents related to sales and other workplaces. The number of people involved in  caught-in-machinery accidents decreased year on year.   In fiscal 2020, we intend to introduce measures based on analyses of indirect routine work and  non-routine work accidents to achieve our goal of eliminating cases of individuals being caught, cut  or pinched in machines, falls, or traffic accidents that result in sequelae. We also plan to publicize  our Occupational Safety and Health Management Guide, focusing on strengthening PDCA cycle  operations. Strong Corporate Governance   Activity Report by Materiality Items Dialogue and Collaboration with Stakeholders Materiality Our Philosophy Framework for ESG and Sustainability  Ajinomoto Group Sustainability Data Book 2020 102 The Ajinomoto Group cultivates an open culture and maintains a crisis-resistant corporate structure  by building an awareness of compliance and organization-wide commitment to the Ajinomoto Group  Policies (AGP). In so doing, we create a stronger management foundation and enhance corporate  value.   Ajinomoto Co., Inc. established the Business Conduct Committee, which meets once every three  months to monitor compliance with AGP and whether the Group conducts corporate activities in line  with AGP. Major group companies also have their own business conduct committees that engage in  raising awareness of AGP and addressing issues unique to each country, region, and company. Compliance education for employees The following activities were part of our fiscal 2019 efforts to raise awareness and understanding of  AGP and our internal whistle-blowing system.  Compliance training (for Group company managers in Japan; held five times with 312 participants)   Educational posters (produced in 12 languages)  Compliance education message (flashed on-screen every time an employee starts their computer) Worksite AGP meetings Members of the Business Conduct Committee at Ajinomoto Co., Inc. hold worksite AGP meetings,  soliciting direct feedback from employees about issues concerning compliance in the workplace.  During fiscal 2019, 41 meetings were held (26 for regular employees, and 15 for part-time and  temporary employees), attended by 519 individuals. Summaries of AGP worksite meeting discussions  are provided to organizational heads, each worksite, and posted on the corporate intranet to share  with all employees. Any compliance issues raised that warrant corporate-level attention are discussed  within the Business Conduct Committee. Decisions within the committee are then incorporated into  AGP communication measures and compliance promotion activities.

The AGP also states that giving favors to public officials or  any person equivalent in Japan or in foreign countries, in the form of gifts, entertainment, money, or  other bribery in any manner is prohibited. The Group Shared Policy on Bribery Prevention includes the  following rules, which require officers and employees of Group companies to comply with this policy  and the related bribery prohibition laws of other countries and regions.  Maintain accounting books and records for all company transactions in reasonable detail  Confirm the appropriate treatment of expenses related to public officials, etc.  Monitor compliance and conduct under this policy via audits Education for employees In Japan, the Ajinomoto Group holds regular training for officers and employees involved in line  management of Group companies. This training covers proper relationships with public officials,  including public officials in foreign countries. A total of 312 people attended this training during fiscal  2019. In addition, we conduct bribery prevention training courses for officers and managers of  overseas Group companies. A total of 227 people attended this training in Brazil and Peru during fiscal  2019.   Further, we introduced e-learning training during fiscal 2019 as another means to communicate  the Group Shared Policy on Bribery Prevention. Approximately 7,300 group officers and employees  in Japan took the training, as did approximately 1,600 line management-level employees at overseas  Group companies. Basic policy The AGP requires that officers and employees fully understand and comply with laws and regulations  concerning competition in all countries and regions in which we operate. In this way, we strive  to ensure fair and transparent business transactions. The Ajinomoto Group has also established  Guidelines for Antitrust Laws (Japan), Guidelines for Antitrust Laws in the United States, and Guidelines  for Competition Laws in Europe. We ask that our business partners understand the purposes behind  the Group Shared Policy on Procurement, the Group Shared Policy for Suppliers, and other related  guidelines. We also ask business partners to refrain from behavior that hinders fair, transparent and  open competition. Education for employees In Japan, the Ajinomoto Group holds regular training on antitrust for officers and employees involved in  line management of Group companies. A total of 312 people attended this training during fiscal 2019.  In addition, we conduct antitrust law training courses for officers and managers of overseas Group  companies. A total of 227 people attended this training in Brazil and Peru during fiscal 2019.

Under this declaration, participants open their IP for a certain period of time to facilitate activities  in diagnosis, testing, treatment, hygiene management, etc., toward ending the spread of COVID-19. In the  Declaration, approximately 20 companies have declared that they will not assert any IP rights for patents,  utility models, designs or copyrights with respect to activities carried out solely for the purpose of stopping  the spread of COVID-19. The period covered by the declaration extends until the day that WHO declares the end of the spread  of COVID-19. By declaring to request no compensation or consideration for qualifying activities, the  program supports the activities of companies and organizations working to end the spread of COVID-19 by  eliminating the time and effort required to investigate issues related to IP or conduct patent searches.

This ranking is a compilation by company of the number of patents owned by a  company cited as the basis for rejection of a patent application by another company in the course of  patent examination processes during 2019. Companies having a large number of patents cited are  considered as advanced companies with extensive prior art that blocks competitors from obtaining  rights.  Education for employees The Ajinomoto Group conducts ongoing trademark seminars to provide Group employees basic  knowledge on trademarks and the rules for displaying trademarks such as AJI-NO-MOTO . These  seminars serve to enhance employee appreciation of trademarks and prevent the AJI-NO-MOTO   trademark from being used as a generic term. We also hold regular seminars to educate Group  employees on other IP-related issues.

We formulated the Group Shared Policy on Information Security and related group-wide  regulations, standards, and guidelines. Each organization within Ajinomoto Co., Inc. and Group companies have established frameworks to  respond to information security incidents or emergencies appropriately, providing reports that reach  up through the organization to the CEO. Rigorous management of personal information To manage customer data and other personal information securely, the Ajinomoto Group defines clear  rules and informs relevant individuals of said rules. In this way, we practice organizational business  management.   Ajinomoto Co., Inc. has established Personal Information Management Guidelines as a subset  of the Information Security Regulations. These guidelines specify rules and procedures for handling  personal information securely. In addition, these guidelines are based on the ISO 27001 standard for  information security management systems.   Before outsourcing operations, we perform an assessment of the relevant contractors processes  and systems to ensure information security is at the same level as our own internal systems. We have  built a system to manage the personal information of customers more strictly when collecting personal  information for campaigns, consumer surveys, etc. These rules require the selection of a personal  information manager who reports to an organizational manager. These rules also clarify the persons  responsible for or in charge of the collection, storage, and deletion of personal information, as well as  who is allowed to access or use the collected data.

Ongoing initiatives to prevent the leakage of confidential information In Japan, the Ajinomoto Group introduced a system to detect fraudulent behavior on standard-use  PCs automatically in major Group companies and we have been managing this system on a consistent  basis.    In addition, we engage an external entity to perform annual security diagnostics for Group  company websites worldwide as another ongoing measure against cyber vulnerabilities. Information security inspections Ajinomoto Co., Inc. conducts annual information security inspections at all worksites. These  inspections focus on the basic elements of proper information handling, including the management  of IT equipment, confidential information, and personal information. We also conduct annual reviews  concerning the use and management of external cloud services.
