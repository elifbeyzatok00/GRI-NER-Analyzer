The implementation of the 2014-2017 Business Plan has made it possible to create value for  all stakeholders, starting with our shareholders, with a dividend proposal of 3.4 billion euro (10 billion euro over  the duration of the Plan), by focusing on innovation, the development of new products and services and on a  commitment to excellence on behalf of our staff, while raising awareness that sustainable growth can facilitate  long-term development through a reduction of risks, both social (rising inequality and more people in vulnerable  situations) and environmental (with a particular focus on climate change). In the broader context of medium and long-term scenarios and trends, Intesa Sanpaolo has therefore renewed  its commitment to the three dimensions of sustainability (social, environmental and governance), in line with its  leading role in Corporate Social Responsibility. Concerning social aspects, Intesa Sanpaolo has confirmed its position as a real economy Bank, by disbursing  approximately 63 billion euro in new long- to medium-term loans during 2017 and approximately 200 billion  euro during the 2014-2017 period. Specific attention was paid to financial inclusion, vulnerable groups of  customers, households and businesses affected by the financial crisis or earthquakes and environmental  disasters in Italy, with the disbursement of around 4.5 billion euro in loans with a high social impact in 2017  (over 13 billion euro over the four-year period). Relations with our customers are based on dialogue, transparency, excellent quality of service and the offer of  intelligent technology, through a multi-channel platform and digitalisation and paperless policies. Intesa Sanpaolo  is also committed to offering sustainable investment products and, through Eurizon, adheres to the Principles for  Responsible Investment and manages SRI (Sustainable and Responsible Investments) funds worth around 4 billion  euro, with three SRI funds launched over the last year, compared with 400 million euro at the end of 2013 (the  start of the Plan). There has also been considerable focus on supporting local communities with a whole range of social and cultural  initiatives and activities and an overall cash contribution of approximately 50 million euro in 2017 (over 200 million  euro during the 2014-2017 period), of which over 28 million euro were earmarked for art and culture. In particular,  the Intesa Sanpaolo Charity Fund disbursed approximately 9.5 million euro in 2017 to support over 900 projects  carried out by non-profit organisations, with particular focus on the vulnerable segments of society. Specific initiatives  were devoted to children, such as the Intesa Sanpaolo Educational Programme for children in long-term hospital care,  which offers crche services in the oncology wards of certain first-rate paediatric hospitals. Intesa Sanpaolo has also  always been committed to spreading knowledge on economic and financial issues, particularly among young people,  as the promoter of various national and international initiatives in the field of financial education. As regards the environment, Intesa Sanpaolo has continued its activities to contain CO2 emissions, which fell  by around 30% over the time horizon of the Plan and to support the renewable energy and energy efficiency  sector, providing financing of around 1.3 billion euro in 2017 (over 5 billion euro during 2014-2017). It was the  first Italian bank to issue a green bond, in June 2017, worth an overall amount of 500 million euro. The focus on  environmental sustainability is also demonstrated by the development of the Circular Economy project thanks to  the partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. These results were possible thanks to the people who work for Intesa Sanpaolo; helping them to develop and  strengthening their sense of belonging represent the key leverage to achieve the Groups strategic objectives.  Specific attention has been paid to protecting employment through the reassignment of excess production  capacity of 4,500 people over the 2014-2017 period. In addition, employee share ownership schemes have  made it possible to share the value created over time and an integrated welfare system has been established for  employees and their families, with an offer of services aimed at improving their work-life balance, ranging from  crches to flexible working time, with over 8,000 employees involved at the end of 2017. Another stimulus is  represented by continuous training focused on strategic company projects, with 800,000 training days provided  in 2017 and 4.6 million over the 2014-2017 period.  7 102-14 Gian Maria Gros-Pietro Carlo Messina Intesa Sanpaolos social and environmental commitment, marked by participation in a series of international  initiatives – including the Global Compact and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, the  United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI) and the Equator Principles – has been enriched  with another step in 2017, with the adoption of the Human Rights Principles. This Corporate Social Responsibility commitment was recognised through the inclusion in a number of sustainability  indices, including the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and CDPs Climate A List 2017. Lastly, Intesa Sanpaolo is the  only Italian company to feature on the Corporate Knights ranking of the worlds 100 most sustainable companies.  These results give us confidence concerning both the future and the expectations of our stakeholders, with whom  we maintain open and attentive dialogue, and encourage us to reinforce our commitment to each and every one  of them. In the new 2018-2021 Business Plan, sound and sustainable creation and distribution of value remains a  priority, together with a high level of capitalisation and reduction in the risk profile, by concentrating on innovation  and people as enabling factors. The Plan confirms the role of Intesa Sanpaolo as a real economy Bank and seeks  to generate sustainable profitability to create value for all stakeholders, starting with our customers, to whom we  wish to offer an ever more personalised, innovative and complete service, with over 300 billion euro contributed  to the economy over the four-year period. The Group is also seeking to reinforce its leadership role in Corporate  Social Responsibility and become a point of reference for society in terms of social and cultural responsibility, while  increasing the internal commitment to inclusion. Therefore initiatives are planned to support social inclusion and  the Third sector, projects in favour of the poorest and most needy in society, further CO2 emission reduction targets,  activities for the circular economy and for the enhancement of our artistic and cultural heritage. And theres no  scarcity of initiatives for the people who work for the Group, by safeguarding employment, developing skills through  targeted initiatives and a major effort in terms of training, promoting diversity and inclusion and welfare initiatives,  starting with the work-life balance. This document, which represents our first Consolidated Non-Financial Statement, is the result of long and   well-established tradition and experience in sustainability reporting, which has been one of the Groups  hallmarks since it was first established and all the way along a continuous improvement. The Statement  informs the stakeholders of the results achieved, but look also, and it seems to us with foresight, to the future.  8 KEY page xx    Link to the pages        2017 Consolidated Non-Financial Statement [i]              Links to websites    Keyboard short cut + alt     Back  9 102-10; 102-45; 102-50; 102-51; 102-52 Methodology The 2017 Consolidated Non-Financial Statement – hereinafter also Statement – was drafted in accordance with  art. 4 of Italian Legislative Decree 254/2016, the Core option of the GRI Standards defined in 2016 by the GRI  (Global Reporting Initiative) and the Financial Services Sector Supplements. The identification and choice of  content were consistent with the Sustainability Report drafting guidelines for the banking sector – The Report to  Stakeholders: A Guide for Banks – published by ABI in collaboration with EconomEtica (Multi-University Centre for  Economic Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility). The recommendations issued by the Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in June 2017 for the voluntary dissemination of relevant communications on  risks connected with climate change were also considered. MATERIALITY AND REPORTING PRINCIPLES As required by Legislative Decree 254/2016, content was identified and chosen for this Statement in such a way  as to clearly communicate the activities of the Group, its progress, its results and the impact of its activities, also  in consideration of the GRI Standard principles of materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context and  completeness. The materiality analysis (see page 28), conducted in compliance with the GRI Standards, made it  possible to assess the topics based on their relevance in terms of their potential impact on the Banks activities, on  the community and on stakeholders. Moreover, the GRI principles were applied to define the quality of information  criteria (balance/neutrality, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity and reliability) and the reporting boundary.  Further details on the information provided in the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement are published in the  Sustainability section of the website [i]. Links to this additional information are included within the Statement, in the descriptions and in the GRI Content Index. The 2017 Consolidated Non-Financial Statement was subject to a limited audit by KPMG S.p.A.. The report  describing the steps involved and related conclusions can be found on page 183. THE REPORTING PROCESS All company departments contribute to the drafting of the 2017 Consolidated Non-Financial Statement and dialogue  activities with stakeholders through the CSR Delegates who, appointed by the various heads of Group departments and  companies, work in close contact with the CSR Sub-Department. Data collection is centralised, on the same reporting  platform responsible for control of the economic, capital and commercial performance of the Business Units. MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS The indicators illustrated in the 2017 Consolidated Non-Financial Statement were identified according to indications  of the standard used as a reference (GRI Standards), obligations deriving from Intesa Sanpaolos adoption of  international sustainability protocols, and commitment to ensuring that the process of achieving improvement  objectives is measurable. Almost all the data was collected accurately, except for certain estimates which are duly  specified. To ensure accuracy in the collection and uniformity in the interpretation of the indicators required, the  data measurement systems are supported by a technical manual which, for the quantitative indicators, formalises  their relevance, the calculation methods and the data source. The data presented refer to the 2017 financial year and, where possible, are compared to the previous two years.   Restatements concerning data published in previous years, unless specified to the contrary, were not carried out. THE REPORTING PERIOD AND BOUNDARY The Statement, which replaces the previous Sustainability Report, fully integrating its content as per Legislative  Decree 254/2016, is published on an annual basis. The 2016 Sustainability Report was published in April 2017. The reporting boundary of the Intesa Sanpaolo 2017 Consolidated Non-Financial Statement covers 90.61% of the  scope of consolidation of the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements as regards number of employees (net of  employees with non-standard contracts) and therefore makes it possible to understand the activities of the Group,  its progress, results and impacts. In particular, the Statement reporting boundary does not include the non-financial data of the Aggregate Set of  the former Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, acquired during the year. This is due to the difficulty of  acquiring all of the necessary information to guarantee consistent representation. This possibility is established by  both the Consob regulation and the Assonime Publication. Also excluded are the non-financial data of the companies of the Risanamento Group, for which the Parent  Company Intesa Sanpaolo does not carry out management and coordination activities. This edition of the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement is also available on the website [i]. The Consolidated Non-Financial Statement was drafted in accordance with current regulations, in particular with  reference to the areas established by Legislative Decree 254/2016 in the social and environmental fields that are  applicable to the Group.

The strategy over the period of the Plan was based on certain priorities in the genetic make-up of Intesa Sanpaolo,  and aimed at consolidating its reputation as a real-economy bank, supporting households and businesses, and, by  leveraging a sound balance sheet and leadership, meet a robust credit demand and responsibly manage the financial  wealth of customers. Intesa Sanpaolo continued to be a Bank with sustainable profitability, in which operating results,  productivity, risk profile, liquidity and soundness/leverage are carefully balanced. The Plan envisaged measures in the following areas:   New Growth Bank, to develop revenues through innovative growth engines, capable of identifying new  market opportunities;   Core Growth Bank, to capture the untapped revenue potential of existing business, in terms of revenue  development, reduction in operating costs, and credit and risk governance;   Capital-Light Bank, to optimise the use of capital and liquidity, de-leveraging the Banks non-core assets;   People and Investments, as key enablers to maximise the contribution of each of the three Banks to  the Groups result. The 2014-2017 period was characterised by a challenging macro-economic context. More specifically,  market rates fell to an all-time low (average annual 1-month Euribor of -0.17 in 2017) and the recovery of  GDP was slower than expected. The scenario was also influenced by the recent trends in the sector, with significant impacts on both the  operating plan and the regulatory framework. In this context, the Group successfully implemented its 2014-2017 Business Plan, distributing 10 billion  euro in accumulated cash dividends, while at the same time strengthening its net worth, supporting the  real economy and creating value for all stakeholders with around 250 billion euro. In fact, the 10 billion  euro of dividends for shareholders added to around 200 billion euro of new mid- to long-term credit for the  real economy, around 21 billion euro on spending for personal services, around 11 billion euro to suppliers  for purchases and investments, and around 10 billion euro of direct and indirect taxes in the public sector. These results were achieved by leveraging on an excellent machine that is focused on results, effectively  driven by people and supported by a cutting-edge digital platform. The numerous initiatives introduced to the operating plan, with regard both to product innovation and the  improvement of customer services and the development of the Intesa Sanpaolo people, generated significant  shared value for all stakeholders (see 2017 Annual Report - Consolidated Financial Statements, page 46 [i]). More specifically, these were the objectives for stakeholders and the progress made over the period of the Business Plan: Stakeholder Benefits 2017 results  [bn euro] Cumulative  value 2014-2017 [bn euro] Plan Objectives 2017 Cumulative value [bn euro] Shareholders Dividends 3.4 10 10 Households and  businesses New medium/long-term credit granted  to the real economy ~63 ~200 ~170 Employees Personnel expenses* 5.4 ~21 ~21 Suppliers Procurement and investments 2.6 ~11 ~10 Public sector Direct and indirect taxes* 2.4 ~10 ~10 * Excluding the contribution of certain assets and liabilities of the two former Venetian Banks. 102-14; ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 103-2; MARKET PRESENCE 103-2; INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS 103-2; COMPANY VALUE AND SOLIDITY 103-2  16 Identity and profile ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF VALUE ADDED The Group intends to use the opportunities offered by the improvement in the economy to strengthen the  central role of sustainability and social and environmental responsibility within its overall strategy. Considerable  attention – in addition to profitability targets – is given to actions aimed at further strengthening capital  adequacy and improving the risk and liquidity profiles. As a solid Bank with growing profitability, Intesa  Sanpaolo is able to make a positive contribution to the interests of its shareholders and all its stakeholders.  Through the 2014-2017 Business Plan, Intesa Sanpaolo achieved significant results that demonstrate its ability  to meet the commitments made with the markets, to protect the jobs of its employees and to support its  customers, even those experiencing potential problems, by activating internal processes and structures to  avoid the deterioration of credit fundamentals. All company departments are involved in implementing business soundness and profitability protection  policies. As part of its strategic supervisory duties, the Board of Directors identifies and approves the business  model, strategic guidelines and risk appetite, and the strategic, industrial and financial plans of the Company  and the Group and any amendments thereto. The corporate policies take into consideration the analysis  and economic debate of Italys main structural problems and of issues relating to the international economy  important to the Group. The aim is to continue being a reference Bank for the countrys real economy, with  the reciprocal benefit of long-term growth. The corporate governance model, described on page 33 ensures the protection of the Groups soundness and profitability. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE1 With the economy in continuous, albeit moderate expansion, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group closed its income  statement for 2017 with net income of 7.3 billion euro, showing major growth on the previous year. The higher  income figure included the government contribution of 3.5 billion euro for the acquisition of the Aggregated  Set of Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. Net of that contribution, net income amounted to 3.8  billion euro, a significant improvement (+22.6%), despite the considerable charges borne for the stability of  the banking industry. Impacting net income positively was also the recognition of the gain from the disposal of  Allfunds (802 million euro). Breaking down the figure on a like-for-like basis – i.e., excluding the contribution of the acquired Aggregate Set of  Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca – operating income amounted to 17.2 billion euro, up by 1.2% on 2016.  The figure was the outcome of lower net interest income (-2.5%), higher net fee and commission income (+5.5%),  lower income from the insurance business (-6.2%) and higher income from trading activities (approx. +13%). Operating costs remained essentially stable (+0.4%), as growth in personnel expenses (+1.2%) was offset by the  fall in administrative expenses (-2.4%). As a result of the above dynamics, the operating margin amounted to 8.4 billion euro, up by 2% on the previous year.  Adjustments to loans fell for the year (-12.3%), as did net provisions and net impairment losses on other assets. As concerns balance-sheet aggregates, including the assets and liabilities of the former Venetian Banks, in 2017  loans to customers rose by 411 billion euro (+3.1% on 2016 on a like-for-like basis). Direct deposits from banking  business amounted to 423 billion euro (-1,6% on a like-for-like basis) and direct deposits from insurance business  rose to 152 billion euro (+5.8% on a like-for-like basis). Indirect deposits rose to 518 billion euro (+7.3% on 2016  on a like-for-like basis), driven by the positive performance of asset management, mutual funds and insurance  products. Assets under administration also recorded growth (+7.2%) attributable to third-party securities and  products in customer portfolios and dealings with institutional customers. The macroeconomic environment and the marked volatility of financial markets call for constant control of the  factors enabling the Group to pursue sustainable profitability: high liquidity, funding capacity, low leverage,  adequate capital base and prudent asset valuations. Group liquidity remains high: as at 31 December 2017, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable  Funding Ratio (NSFR) – the two regulatory indicators adopted also as internal liquidity risk measurement metrics   reached a level well above fully phased-in requirements. At the end of year, the eligible liquidity reserves for Central  Banks – including the components relating to the Aggregate Set of Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca –  came to 171 billion euro (150 billion euro at the end of December 2016), of which 98 billion euro, net of haircut,  was unencumbered (96 billion euro at the end of December 2016). The Loan to Deposit Ratio at the end of 2017,  calculated as the ratio of loans to customers to direct deposits from banking business, stood at 97%. In terms of funding, the widespread branch network remains a stable, reliable source: 74% of direct deposits  from banking business come from retail operations (315 billion euro). Moreover, over the year, 2 billion euro in  1 Commentary refers, unless otherwise specified, to the reclassified data published in the 2017 Annual Report – Consolidated Financial Statements of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group.  Changes in  annual percentages are based on 2016 figures, restated, where necessary, to take into account changes in the scope of consolidation.

As regards the programme of Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) II, at the end of the year the  Groups participation amounted to 57 billion euro, equal to the maximum borrowing allowance (46 billion euro  at the end of December 2016), net of components relating to the Aggregate Set of Banca Popolare di Vicenza e  Veneto Banca (7 billion euro).

The calculation is  made by reclassifying consolidated income statement items recorded in the financial statements, as required  under Bank of Italy Circular n 262. The economic value generated, which in 2017 was 21 billion euro (including  government contributions to offset the impact of the acquisition of the assets of the former Venetian Banks on  capital ratios), came from net income from financial operations and the insurance business – which therefore  takes into account the impairment losses on loans and financial assets available for sale – plus the realised gains  and losses on investments in associates and companies subject to joint control, investments and discontinued  operations, and other operating income. The amount of the economic value generated expresses the value of  the wealth produced, most of which distributed among the stakeholders with which the Group interacts in  various ways on a day-to-day basis. In particular:   employees and other staff benefited from over 37% of the economic value generated, for a total of 7.8  billion euro. In addition to staff pay, the total also includes payments to the network of financial advisors;   suppliers received approximately 13% of the economic value generated, for a total of 2.7 billion euro in  payments for goods and services;   the Government, Organisations and Institutions recorded a total flow of funds of 1.9 billion euro, around  9% of the economic value generated, over 917 million euro of which referring to indirect taxes and duties,  over 727 million euro to taxes on income from continuing operations, and 290 million to levies and other  charges concerning the banking industry, consisting of ordinary and extraordinary contributions to resolution  and guarantee funds. There were also numerous social and cultural initiatives and other actions taken to  support the charity funds and issue disbursements by way of social and cultural contributions;   approximately 17% of the economic value generated was allocated to Shareholders and minority interests,  largely in terms of the proposed dividend, for a total of 3.6 billion euro. The remaining 4.9 billion euro was retained by the corporate system. The considerable size of that figure  was due to the 3.5 billion euro government contribution to offset the impact of the acquisition of certain  assets and liabilities, and certain legal relationships of Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, which  was allocated to the extraordinary reserve. The remaining 1.4 billion euro prevalently refers to deferred tax  assets and liabilities, amortisation and depreciation, and provisions for risks and charges. Self-financing is  considered an investment that other stakeholder categories make each year to maintain efficiency and allow  development of the Bank as a whole.

Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. Together, the SDGs are a call for action to end poverty, fight inequality and pursue social and economic development for  people, the planet and the prosperity of all. They focus on issues of fundamental importance for sustainable development,  such as combating climate change and building peaceful societies by 2030, by taking up the challenges of ending  poverty, supporting health and well-being and promoting quality education. The SDGs were officially launched at the  beginning of 2016, marking the start of an agenda set to unfold over the next 15 years, as countries have committed  to achieving the goals by 2030. Intesa Sanpaolo participates in the Global Compact initiative and is an active member of the community of businesses  that support the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.   22 Identity and profile The Group is aware of the close connection between some of these objectives and its own business; as such, it has  identified the most significant projects and activities that testify to its contribution to generating a positive change at  global level around seven specific goals. An analysis of the relevance of the issues was carried out assessing the development goals of the United Nations in  the context of the materiality analysis (see page 28). These are the identified goals, the main actions carried out in  2017 and the strategies for the future. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL End poverty in all its forms everywhere MATERIAL TOPICS FOR INTESA SANPAOLO Access to credit and financial inclusion Relations with the community ACTIONS IN 2017 Financial inclusion of vulnerable people (see page 69) Intesa Sanpaolo provides a range of products and services that promote financial inclusion and access to credit. Altogether, in  2017 the Group disbursed around 67 million euro in microcredit and anti-usury projects, in Italy and abroad. Contribution to the community (see page 81) Through the Charity Fund, Intesa Sanpaolo allocates a share of its distributable profits to supporting projects with  benefits for the community. The Fund Plan focuses strategically on projects that help more vulnerable groups with the aim of earmarking at  least 80% of its national contributions and at least 60% of its local donations to projects designed to help weaker  sections of society (e.g. solidarity projects, projects to combat poverty, social inclusion, training and employment  projects). In 2017 the company exceeded its goal (88% of national contributions and 69% of local donations to  projects for the most vulnerable sections of society). In 2017, the Fund for charitable, social and cultural donations of Intesa Sanpaolo has disbursed approximately  9.5 million euro in support of over 900 projects carried out by non-profit organisations. OUR OBJECTIVES Launch of a new Intesa Sanpaolo Fund for Impact, allocating to the fund by 2021 0.5% of shareholders' equity,  estimated in the order of approx. 250 million euro. This will make it possible to disburse loans of 1.2 billion euro to  sections of society that find it difficult to access credit.

OUR OBJECTIVES An increase in the use of renewable energy sources, from 76% at the end of 2012 to 81% by the end of 2022. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all MATERIAL TOPICS FOR INTESA SANPAOLO Employment protection Access to credit and financial inclusion ACTIONS IN 2017 Job protection (see page 91) Job protection is a priority issue and one of the key topics of the 2014-2017 Business Plan, with the reassignment of  the excess production capacity of 4,500 people over the period. In 2017 the Group recruited around 4,000 people  (1,244 in Italy and 2,741 abroad). Support to new businesses (see page 75) Various initiatives are dedicated to young people and micro-businesses to help them launch new enterprises  (Finanziamento Microcredito Imprenditoriale) or invest in growth projects, offering the chance to access credit even in  the absence of collateral: in 2017 over 800 loans worth 17.8 million euro were disbursed. For female-run businesses and self-employed women (Business Gemma) 420 loans worth 16.3 million euro were  granted in 2017. Finally, in 2017 over 160 start-ups were supported with training, 100 of which were presented to around 1,300 participants.  24 Identity and profile SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL Build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialization and foster innovation MATERIAL TOPICS FOR INTESA SANPAOLO Access to credit and financial inclusion ACTIONS IN 2017 Loans and services for companies investing in innovation (see page 76) For many years Intesa Sanpaolo has provided a wide range of actions to support companies investing in innovation and  research. As regards loans, Nova+ supplements the traditional creditworthiness analysis with a technical and business  assessment of the investment plans, conducted by a team of engineers specialised in the various product sectors with  the cooperation of prestigious Italian universities.

CO2 emissions rose by 3.8%,  mainly due to higher emission factors than in 2016. Climate Change Action Plan (see page 106) The new Multi-Year Environmental Sustainability Plan – the Climate Change Action Plan – was issued in 2017 with targets  for 2022 and 2037. In the new Plan, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group outlines its goals as regards reducing the CO2 emissions  connected with its activities, taking the year 2012 as its reference year. The 2022 objectives are supported by targeted actions. OUR OBJECTIVES Reduce CO2 emissions by 37% over the period 2012-2022. Promoting culture for social cohesion (see page 84) Progetto Cultura (Culture Project) of Intesa Sanpaolo aims to make the Banks immense artistic heritage more accessible to  the general public and to contribute to safeguarding Italian cultural heritage.  Promotion of the Bank's artistic heritage is implemented along various lines: study and scientific cataloguing of the works;  restoration activity; museum projects creating permanent displays of a part of the collections (Gallerie dItalia in Milan, Naples  and Vicenza); planning and organisation of temporary exhibitions; support of scholarships for training opportunities and the  search for youth in collaboration with the universities; loan of works to temporary exhibitions.

In 2017 Intesa Sanpaolo also maintained its place in the Engaged Tracking (ET) Carbon Rankings, which includes  listed companies that have stood out for their reporting and their actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As for its commitment to people, the companys focus on the theme of inclusion was once again rewarded  with the Diversity & Inclusion Award 2017 and with its listing on the EQUILEAP - Gender Equality 2017  index, which includes the 200 companies across the world, headquartered in developed countries, that have  most distinguished themselves for their commitment to gender equality. 102-46 IDENTIFICATION PRIORITISATION VALIDATION u u The sustainability report focused on significant aspects relating to the positive or negative impacts generated by the  Groups activities. These aspects result in risk scenarios that need to be aware of and manage. An understanding of  these scenarios is obtained by cross-referencing strategically-important themes for the company with those that its  stakeholders regard as key when interacting with the Group. To this end, for several years Intesa Sanpaolo has filled out  and updated its Materiality analysis according to the process indications of the GRI standard. The analysis focuses on two areas – the company and its stakeholders – and involves three phases:   identification of relevant themes for the company and for stakeholders;   prioritisation of the themes and definition of the materiality matrix;   validation of the materiality matrix. IDENTIFICATION OF MATERIAL ISSUES AND STAKEHOLDERS Intesa Sanpaolo has identified the priority issues for the company and for its stakeholders through a documentary  analysis that is periodically updated. The main documents considered are:   internal documents, including: the 2014-2017 Business Plan, the Code of Ethics, the Sustainability Reports for  the last three years, top management communications, Shareholders Meeting minutes, company policies;   external documents, including: reference standards for sustainability reports (AA1000, GRI Standards, <IR>,  SASB), national and international documents connected with sustainability issues (Agenda 2030, COP22, SDGs),  the main regulations in the sector;   sustainability reports of other Italian and international financial groups;   documents drafted by national and international institutions for the identification of general and specific  megatrends in the banking sector. In 2017 Intesa Sanpaolo reformulated its priority issues beginning with the requirements dictated by the entry  into force of Legislative Decree no. 254/2016, which made it obligatory for some categories of businesses to draft  and publish a document containing information on specific sustainability issues. This reformulation generated an  effective framework of priority issues. In order to provide clear definitions to all stakeholders, these issues were  defined (see outline on page 181) with their meaning to Intesa Sanpaolo clearly explained. Finally, they were  evaluated in terms of priority, related risks, areas of priority action and specific actions. Materiality analysis  29 2017 MATERIALITY MATRIX Relevance for stakeholders Impact on strategies 2 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 Relations with the community Integrity in corporate conduct Employee growth and  development Direct environmental impacts Green economy Employee well-being Employment protection Quality and innovation in  customer relations Access to credit and financial inclusion Responsible asset  management Company value and solidity   Company value and solidity    Integrity in corporate conduct     Community   Employees    Environment and climate change Identity and profile PRIORITISATION OF THE THEMES AND DEFINITION OF THE MATERIALITY MATRIX To assess the priority of each theme consideration was given both to the interests of the company in terms of its goals  and strategies, as reported on the Impact on strategies axis of the materiality matrix, and to those of its stakeholders as  regards their expectations and needs, reported on the Importance for stakeholders axis of the same matrix.  In both cases the issues were assessed using a scale of 1-5 where 1 indicates that the company strategies or stakeholders  have minimal interest in the issue and 5 indicates that they have maximum interest. The results of the stakeholder engagement process (see page 121). were used when defining the stakeholders 2017  axis. The results were classified on the basis of Intesa Sanpaolos issues and weighted according to their relevance  for the Bank of the stakeholder in question. The 2017 strategies axis was constructed as follows:   documentary analysis: in order to highlight issues that emerged in 2017 and their evaluation in the strategies of Intesa  Sanpaolo, the main strategic guidelines were analysed, like the 2014-2017 Business Plan and the press releases during  the year as the voice of the company management;    construction of the 2017 strategies axis: the values assigned to the axis in 2016 were reclassified according to Intesa  Sanpaolos new priority issues and updated on the basis of the results of the documentary analysis. The results of the materiality analysis are graphically represented using a Cartesian coordinate system known as the Materiality  Matrix which reports the companys interest on the vertical axis and the stakeholders interest on the horizontal axis.   This representation makes it possible to assess the significance (materiality) of each issue on the basis of its overall  position with respect to the two axes. The 2017 Intesa Sanpaolo Materiality Matrix is composed as follows. 102-46; 102-47; 102-49  30 Identity and profile MAIN CHANGES OF THE 2017 MATERIALITY MATRIX COMPARED TO 2016 The 2017 Intesa Sanpaolo Materiality Matrix presents some changes compared with that of the previous year.   The main variations are reported below:   Company value and solidity: in line with last year, it rose slightly on the stakeholder axis. For Customers and  Investors aspects such as risk management – also as regards reputation – and the management of the Banks  assets are particularly important.   Direct environmental impacts and Green economy: the coordinated reading of the scores attributed to  direct impact (slightly down) and the green economy (significantly up) does not demonstrate any discontinuity  compared with the previous year.    Access to credit and financial inclusion: this became more a priority issue for both the company and  stakeholders. For Customers, the Community and Investors, the actions to support customers in temporary  difficulty (e.g. unemployed, victims of natural disasters) were relevant; for the Community and Employees, the  promotion of microcredit initiatives was important. The score is influenced by the grouping together of the issues  of support for the business system and financial inclusion.   Relations with the community: in 2017 this was considered a material issue thanks to its increase in importance  in terms of both the impact of company strategies, due to the extraordinary operation involving the former  Venetian Banks, and its relevance for stakeholders, with important aspects including transparent and effective  communications also on the issues of corporate social responsibility.    Integrity in corporate conduct: this important issue fell slightly in relevance for stakeholders, probably because  of the perception of a decrease in sensitivity due to the increase in dedicated regulatory and operational  instruments. For the Community and for Investors aspects such as combating corruption are important; for  Employees, the promotion of professional ethics, honesty, fairness and responsibility is relevant. The issues that were not subject to significant variations were:   Responsible asset management: this issue had the same level of relevance for both the company and its  stakeholders. Customers, in particular, highlighted the importance of the range of investment products suitable  for their profile while for the Environment and Investors the application of ethics principles to the Banks  investments is important.   Employee growth and development, Employee well-being and Employment protection: people issues  remain highly relevant for the company and its stakeholders. In particular, Investors are interested in aspects  such as the training and well-being of employees. For Employees the equal treatment of diversity and welfare  policies are important.   Quality and innovation in customer relations: this issue remains relevant both for its impact on the strategies  axis and for stakeholders. Aspects such as listening and dialogue for better customer relations are important  for Employees, while Customers are focused above all on the simplification of banking and financial product  regulations with a reduction in documentation. Although relations with suppliers are not a material issue, Intesa Sanpaolo recognises their high social and  environmental value and therefore provides summary disclosures in this document and detailed information  on the website [i]. MATRIX VALIDATION All significant issues (i.e. those with a score of 3/5 or higher) for the company and/or for at least one of its  stakeholders are material and are accounted for in this document. Each one is assessed in terms of its positive and negative impact on internal and external stakeholders and the  company structures, and on the basis of potential associated business risks/opportunities. The reporting boundaries  are also declared for each issue (see page 181). The Materiality Matrix was shared with the internal company functions and with the Risks Committee, which forms  part of the Board of Directors, in order to present an organic summary of these activities to the governing bodies. ANALYSIS OF MATERIAL ISSUES IN THE WIDER CONTEXT OF SUSTAINABILITY The results obtained from the Materiality Analysis were examined in terms of their congruence with a context  analysis on general CSR issues and a sector analysis at national and international level.

Detailed information on the corporate governance system and remuneration is provided in the Report on Corporate  Governance and Ownership Structures, including references to diversity within the Board [i]. The Board of Directors is tasked with the functions of guidance and strategic supervision. The management functions  are primarily concentrated with the Managing Director and CEO, whereas the control functions are exercised by the  Management Control Committee, appointed by the Shareholders Meeting from the members of the Board and entirely  composed of independent Directors. The Board of Directors in office is composed of 19 members elected for three years by the Ordinary Shareholders'  Meeting, by way of list voting, on 27 April 2016. The election took place on the basis of lists of candidates who meet  the requirements envisaged by law and by the Articles of Association, presented by Shareholders holding at least 0.5%  of the ordinary share capital. The presence within the Board of a large majority of independent members (14 out of 19  members) and the appointment by the Board of a single Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, excluding that  other Members may hold executive positions and that the Board may delegate its duties to an executive committee,  were considered a priority. Under the governance model adopted by the Bank, the members elected by the minority are also assigned, in addition  to the chairmanship of the Management Control Committee, the chairmanship of the Committee for Transactions with  Related Parties and Associated Entities. In the performance of its duties, the Board of Directors receives support from Committees, appointed by the Board from  its members, whose organisation and operation are governed by specific Regulations approved by the Board:   Nomination Committee;   Remuneration Committee;   Risks Committee;   Committee for Transactions with Related Parties of Intesa Sanpaolo and Associated Entities of the Group. The Chairman of the Board of Directors has a non-executive role and does not carry out, not even de facto, management  functions. The Chairman of the Board of Directors oversees the work of the Board, organises and directs the activity and  performs all the tasks set by the supervisory regulations. The Managing Director is the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager and supervises the companys  management to the extent of his/her assigned powers, in compliance with the general planning and strategic  guidelines set forth by the Board of Directors. DIVERSITY OF THE MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL BODIES In line with the supervisory provisions, for the appointment and co-option of the Directors, the Board of Directors  is required to identify its optimal qualitative and quantitative composition, which must include an adequate level  of diversification of the members also in terms of age, gender, geographical origin and skills. In this regard, Intesa Sanpaolo's Articles of Association specify that the Board shall adopt the necessary measures to  ensure that each Director and the Board as a whole have an adequate level of diversification, including in terms of  experience, gender and international orientation, in addition to competence, fairness, reputation, independence  of mind, and time commitment. The Board of Directors currently in office has been appointed in compliance with the optimal qualitative and  quantitative indications established in 2016 at the time of the election of the board, by the outgoing Supervisory  Board of Intesa Sanpaolo, within a specific document published on the Banks website [i]. The document specifically states that the shareholders must ensure that the Board of Directors has the  widest gender diversity in the presence of adequate professional skills and diversification of age brackets  amongst Directors, in addition to a comprehensive level of knowledge and experience.  The indications established in terms of diversification were verified during the self-assessments, also on an annual basis. The less-represented gender must be reserved a share of at least one third of the total members (specifically  7 out of 19 members), as established by current laws in force on the matter of equal access to the  administrative and control bodies of listed companies. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 102-18; 102-23; 102-24  34 Governance and management of risks At the time of the renewal of the Board, which will take place next year, new criteria will be drawn up on the composition of  the Board and on diversity, which will also take account of the guidance contained in the new Guidelines published by the  European Banking Authority last September on the suitability requirements for members of management bodies. Intesa Sanpaolo is also responsible, as part of the direction and coordination performed as the Parent Company, for  ensuring the overall consistency of the Groups governance structure and in particular the adequacy of the governance of  the companies that make up the Group. This involves both the governance system adopted and the composition/structure  of the Corporate Bodies. Under the provisions of the articles of association, the senior officers of the subsidiaries are nominated by the Board of  Directors of the Parent Company, which operates according to uniform principles at Group level and in compliance with the  regulations and best practices applicable to each subsidiary, with the aim of ensuring an adequate qualitative and quantitative  composition of the Bodies, with specific importance given to the level of diversification, also in terms of age, gender, seniority  of service, geographical origin and international orientation. In establishing the composition of the Bodies, the most adequate and effective mix of personal and professional  profiles is sought for each subsidiary in terms of its nature, the structure of its activities and the risks assumed.   The goal is to ensure that each Body has access to a set of expertise, experiences, skills and professional abilities that  is sufficiently diversified and complementary. To this end, any indications made by the Management Body of each  subsidiary during the annual self-assessment process are taken into account. The principles regarding nomination within the subsidiaries will also be duly updated in the near future in the light of recent  developments in EU legislation and expected changes at national level. TRAINING AND UPDATING OF THE DIRECTORS The Chairman of the Board of Directors shall ensure that the Bank draws up and implements induction and  training programmes for the members of the Board. In this context, he/she organises, and promotes Board  Members' participation in initiatives aimed at providing them with an increasing degree of knowledge of the  sector of operation of the Bank and Group, company dynamics and their development, the principles of sound  risk management and the regulatory and self-regulatory environment of reference, and in formal and informal  meetings, aimed at further review of strategic matters. In 2017, a total of 12 specific induction sessions were held to allow Board Members to learn about and discuss the  various aspects of the Banks and Groups business, the applicable regulations and the duties and responsibilities  of their office. The induction sessions conducted in 2017 involved the following, in particular:   Tax issues;   Risk management;   Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process;   Reporting and accounting standards;   Remuneration and incentive policies;   Anti-money laundering. 102-27 Competences Presence in the Board   of Directors [No. Members] Banking business (strategies, assessment and risk management techniques) 16/19 Reading and interpreting the financial statements data of a financial institution 18/19 Strategic approach (scenarios, trends, peers) 17/19 Managerial, entrepreneurial and business administration 14/19 Risk management 18/19 Global dynamics of the economic and financial system 18/19 Audit and monitoring 12/19 Regulation of financial activities 16/19 Remuneration and incentive systems and tools 18/19 International experience 13/19 The table below lists the competences stated by the Directors in 2016 in their application. The Directors  elected were also subsequently engaged in continuous and in-depth education and training, as detailed in  the paragraph below with regard to 2017.  35 Governance and management of risks In addition to the above, the Board has conducted, starting from June 2017, four preparatory brainstorming meetings  to examine the main strategic areas and to deepen some guideline of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group's Business Plan. Finally, in order to promote better understanding of the reference corporate and regulatory environment and its  evolution, a collection of governance documents, regulatory references, key correspondence with the Supervisory  Authorities, accounting positions and any additional documentation conducive to the performance of their duties  is made available to Board Members and regularly updated. REMUNERATION Full information, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, is provided in the Report on Remuneration, available  on the website [i]. The Banks Articles of Association envisage that the members of the Board of Directors be entitled, in addition  to the reimbursement of expenses incurred due to their office, to a remuneration for the services rendered,  which is determined by the Shareholders Meeting in a fixed amount for the entire period of their office. The  Shareholders' Meeting also determines the additional remuneration for the office of Chairman and Deputy  Chairperson. Pursuant to the Articles of Association, the Shareholders' Meeting has the duty to determine, at  the time of the appointment of the Management Control Committee and for the entire term of office, specific  remuneration for the Board Members of said Committee, consisting of an equal amount for each Member, but  with a special addition for the Chairman. Pursuant to the Articles of Association, the Managing Director and General Manager is entitled to receive a fixed  and variable remuneration determined by the Board of Directors in line with the remuneration policies approved  by the Shareholders' Meeting. In compliance with the principle that activation of the short-term incentive system must be consistent and  compatible with the remuneration of shareholders, the Board of Directors established that the variable component  of short-term remuneration for the Managing Director and CEO, Carlo Messina, also in relation to the office of  Chief Executive Officer, has a maximum limit of twice the fixed component, including the annual pro-quota of the  long-term Incentive Plan LECOIP, and is indexed to the performance achieved in the assigned objectives. If the bonus is less than 100% of the fixed remuneration (assuming that the materiality threshold is exceeded),  50% is paid in shares and 50% in cash; on the other hand, if the bonus is higher than 100% but lower than  150% of the fixed remuneration, 55% is paid in shares and the remaining portion in cash; and lastly, if the  bonus is higher than 150% of the fixed remuneration, 60% is paid in shares and 40% in cash. The disbursement  of 60% of the bonus is deferred for 5 years. The payment of this deferred portion will be subject to verification,  each year, of the malus conditions. 102-35; MARKET PRESENCE 103-3; INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS 103-3 THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM To ensure sound and prudent management, which combines business profitability with informed risk taking and  operating conduct underpinned by fairness, in 2017 the Bank updated the Integrated Internal Control System  Regulations, also to take account of the transition to the one-tier governance system.  The internal control system has been designed to achieve constant identification, governance and control of the  risks involved in our activities and is based on three levels: III  level u Third level: consisting of internal audit controls – assigned to the Chief Audit Officer (former Internal  Auditing Department) – to identify breaches of procedures and regulations, as well as to periodically  assess the completeness, adequacy, functionality (in terms of efficiency and effectiveness) and reliability of  the organisational structure of the other components of the internal control system and the IT system at  Group level, at scheduled deadlines in relation to the nature and intensity of the risks. II  level u Second level: consisting of risk and compliance controls, whose objectives include ensuring the correct  implementation of the risk management process; observance of operating limits assigned to the various  functions; and compliance of the companys operations with regulations, including self-governance rules.  These controls are performed by the Structures of the Governance Areas of the Chief Compliance Officer,  which also reports to the Anti-Money Laundering Head Office Department, and the Chief Risk Officer,  which reports to the Internal Validation and Controls Head Office Department. The Structures (Level II  Control Functions) are separate from the operating Structures. I  level u First level: consisting of line controls, which are aimed at ensuring the proper conduct of the operations  and, where possible, are incorporated into IT procedures. These are carried out by the Operating and  business Structures themselves (Level I Functions), including through units dedicated solely to control  duties reporting to the heads of those Structures or performed as part of the back office functions.  36 Governance and management of risks SHAREHOLDER BASE Share capital subscribed and paid-in totals 8,731,984,115.92 euro, divided into 16,792,277,146 shares of a  nominal value of 0.52 euro each, of which 15,859,786,585 ordinary shares (equal to 94.45% of share capital) and  932,490,561 non-convertible savings shares (equal to 5.55% of share capital). In February 2018, Intesa Sanpaolos shareholder base was composed as follows (holders of shares exceeding 3%1): 1 Shareholders by way of asset management may have requested exemption from reporting until they exceed the threshold of 5%.

This also takes place via meetings with the  national and international financial community, in a framework of constant dialogue with the market based on  correct and timely communication. During 2017, communications with the financial community continued to focus on sustainable profitability  and the Groups solidity as a safe point of reference for stakeholders. To guarantee access to all, again in 2017  this information was made available quickly, easily and affordably through a number of channels: Internet,  conference calls via a toll-free number and the free distribution of financial statements on request. The Investor  Relations section of the website [i] offers well-organised content and thematic updates providing stakeholders  with extensive, systematic information. In order to contribute to the creation of sustainable value over time, regular and frequent meetings were held with  the financial community that consolidated long-term relations based on mutual trust. Special attention was also paid to SRI (Socially Responsible Investment) investors and analysts with dedicated  events and road-shows. INTESA SANPAOLO STOCK PERFORMANCE In 2017, the performance of Intesa Sanpaolo ordinary shares mirrored the performance of the banking sector  indices, with a fall at the start of the year, through to the end of February, followed by a rise, interrupted by  a downturn in May, through to the end of the third quarter, when the maximum was reached. The price then  declined through to the end of the year, with a rise of 14.2% recorded at the end of December compared to the  end of 2016. The price of Intesa Sanpaolo savings shares increased by 19.1% at the end of 2017 compared to the  end of 2016. The discount with respect to ordinary shares decreased to 4% at the end of 2017 from around 8%  at the end of 2016. Intesa Sanpaolo's capitalisation rose to 46.4 billion euro at the end of December 2017, from 40.6 billion euro  at the end of 2016. The Management Board will propose to the Shareholders' Meeting to allocate a unit amount of 0.20 euro on  ordinary shares and 0.21 euro on savings shares, totalling approximately 3.4 billion euro. SHAREHOLDERS MEETING For the Bank, Shareholders Meetings are one of the main opportunities for contact and dialogue with shareholders,  as well as important occasions for the disclosure of news, in accordance with the principle of non-selective disclosure  and rules on price sensitive information. At the same time, the Shareholders' Meeting represents for shareholders  an opportunity for active participation in the Banks operations and a chance to express their opinions, through the  methods and on the topics envisaged by law and by the Articles of Association. Intesa Sanpaolo has always strived to encourage the broadest possible participation in the Shareholders  Meetings and to guarantee the best quality standards for the information provided in order to realise the full  potential of the meeting. The Shareholders Meeting is called by the Board of Directors whenever it is deemed appropriate, or upon request  by Shareholders representing at least one twentieth of the share capital. The Shareholders Meeting may also be called by the Management Control Committee, where required for the  fulfilment of its duties, subject to sending notice thereof to the Chairman of the Board of Directors. In 2017, the ordinary Shareholders Meeting was held on 27 April and the Special Savings Shareholders Meeting  was held on 1 December. RIGHT TO ATTEND AND VOTE Each ordinary share confers the right to cast one vote. Savings shares, which may be in bearer form, do not confer  the right to vote in ordinary and extraordinary shareholders meetings but entitle the holder only to attend and  vote at the Special Meeting of savings shareholders.  38 Governance and management of risks The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Sub-Department provides support to Top Management in defining  sustainability strategies and policies designed to generate value for stakeholders. It reports through the Chief  Governance Officer to the Managing Director and CEO and to the Board of Directors. The CSR governance system is also based on strong involvement of the Risks Committee, which has been established  within Board of Directors, as required by the regulations, to provide specific support to the Board in relation to all CSR  matters. To this end, the CSR Sub-Department periodically meets with the Committee to agree the approach and report  on the progress of processes and activities related to sustainability. In 2017, it took part in 4 meetings with the Risks  Committee (with the Management Control Committee invited to two of those meetings) to provide information on the  2016 Sustainability Reporting, Principles on Human Rights, Climate Change Action Plan, Sustainability Indices and the  2017 Non-Financial Statement. In addition, the CSR Sub-Department reported to the Management Control Committee on the assessment of CSR and  reputational risks in the preliminary evaluation of loans and, together with the Surveillance Body pursuant to Legislative  Decree 231/2001, on the annual Report on implementation and governance of the Code of Ethics.  The model adopted in Intesa Sanpaolo's Code of Ethics is based on the self-responsibility of the company Structures.  Accordingly, in addition to implementing actions and activities based on the principles and values of the Code of Ethics,  the company Structures appoint a CSR delegate, who collaborates with the CSR Sub-Department, to identify their CSR  objectives for the management, monitoring, and periodic reporting of the projects underway and the management  of relations with their stakeholders. In addition, each Bank of the foreign network has a CSR Delegate who works in  coordination with the CSR delegate of the International Subsidiary Banks Division. In 2017, CSR promoted specific initiatives consisting of:   the issue, in December 2017, following approval by the Board of Directors, of the Principles on Human  Rights (see page 118);   the issue, in June 2017, of a 500 million euro five-year Green Bond offered to international institutional  investors (page 114);   the approval by the Managing Director and CEO, in October 2017, of the new Environmental Sustainability  Plan – Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) – which sets the goals and plans the medium-term (in 2022) and  long-term (in 2037) actions, in collaboration with the other company Structures involved (see page 106); The CEO governs sustainability performance through the Chief Governance Officer. The Corporate Social Responsibility Sub-Department has the objective of  monitoring the Groups areas of social and environmental responsibility,  including those relating to climate change, by planning, managing  and monitoring policies and tools for sustainability. In particular it is  responsible for:    Assisting top management and the Corporate Bodies in setting the CSR policies  and strategies;    Updating of the Code of Ethics and monitoring its application;    Working together with the competent Structures in overseeing the dialogue and  relations with the financial community of Socially Responsible Investors;    Collaborating with the other Group Structures to ensure that social and environmental  aspects and climate change are duly considered in the development of the business;     Producing the social and environmental sustainability reporting;    Overseeing the dialogue with stakeholders regarding the issues under its responsibility;    Defining environmental guidelines and producing multi-annual action plans with  the Structures concerned and monitoring their implementation;    Supporting training and communications on social and environmental issues. BOARD OF DIRECTORS u CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER u 47 CSR DELEGATES  in the Italy  Structures 11 CSR DELEGATES in the International  Subsidiary Banks u CHIEF GOVERNANCE OFFICER Corporate Social Responsibility The Board of Directors approves the annual Non-Financial Statement and  the updates to the Code of Ethics or the CSR guidelines, with the support  of the Risks Committee. The Risks Committee assesses and examines CSR issues, to help ensure the  best control of risks in this area. In liaison with the Corporate Social Responsibility and the Internal Audit  functions, the Management Control Committee supervises compliance with  the principles and values contained in the Code of Ethics. Governance of Corporate Social Responsibility 102-20; 102-21; 102-26; 102-31; 102-32; 102-33  39 Governance and management of risks   the experimental start-up of the provision of advisory opinions on the social, environmental and reputational risks  of business and/or company operations in sensitive sectors. The opinions, provided jointly with the Reputational  Risk Office of the Chief Risk Officer Area, include the allocation of a synthetic risk class and 32 of these opinions  were issued in 2017;    responding to 21 assessment requests from investors and analysts on ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) and  climate change issues and holding meetings with socially responsible investors and analysts (SRI), in collaboration  with Investor Relations. The Code of Ethics is the self-regulation document for the integration of social and environmental considerations  into company processes, practices and decisions. It contains voluntary commitments in the management of relations  with all the Group's internal and external stakeholders and sets out the foundations of the corporate culture and  core values. It is a constantly updated document that follows the evolution of the environment in which the Bank  operates and ensures maximum transparency and coherence in the relationship of trust with all the stakeholders. The Code's implementation and governance mechanism is based on the following cornerstones:   The principle of self-responsibility, where each structure is directly responsible and ensures adherence to the values  and principles of the Code, setting the related objectives and action plans. The Structures most affected by the  matters addressed in the Code have strengthened this approach by appointing a CSR delegate;   The commitments set out in the Code are given practical expression in the annual reporting process (Consolidated  Non-Financial Statement), which presents the management policies and methods, initiatives, indicators and  objectives for the issues relevant to the stakeholders and the business;   The analysis and subsequent certification of corporate social responsibility governance by an independent third  party in accordance with the principles and contents of ISO 26000, published annually on the website [i].   The third-party assessment conducted at the end of 2017 in Italy showed strong coverage of the CSR  issues investigated, with a clear commitment to fostering consistency in conduct with respect to the Intesa  Sanpaolo Group Code of Ethics and the necessary improvements, through the liaison work by the CSR unit. In  particular, the principles of the Code of Ethics are set out in a corporate regulatory system that enables their  application, also taking into account the results of the stakeholder engagement processes. Compared to the  previous year, in Italy progress was recorded in 7 of the 10 issues monitored, namely: Quality and innovation  in customer relations, Employment protection, Employee well-being, Access to credit and financial inclusion,  Employee growth and development, Relations with the community, and Direct environmental impacts. For the  international branches, the analysis identified continuity in the commitments made and room for improvement  in some areas. In particular, although there is sometimes an uneven approach among the various countries,  there is a structured commitment focused on several priorities (Quality and innovation in customer relations,  Employment protection, Relations with the community, and Enhancement of human resources), whereas for  some other issues the analysis identified the need to establish more structured processes (Responsible asset  management, Green economy, and Financial inclusion);   The management of reports of alleged non-compliance with the Code of Ethics: the CSR Sub-Department  receives the reports made and, after the necessary checks, responds in collaboration with the Structures  concerned ensuring that those who make the reports in good faith are protected from any form of retaliation,  discrimination or penalisation, ensuring the utmost confidentiality without prejudice to legal obligations. 101  reports of non-compliance with the Code of Ethics were received in 2017, 88 of which in Italy and 13 in the  international branches. This number was up on the previous year, reflecting both the continued significant  impact of the difficult economic conditions and the establishment of the Code of Ethics as a channel of dialogue  with the Bank. These communications come largely from customers (93) and express, in some cases (16 reports),  the expectation of responsible behaviour in credit management when customers are in situations of fragility. In  this regard, the Proactive Credit Structure reconsidered 11 reports with a positive outcome for a customer with  particular difficulties. However, in many cases, the appeal is made once the debt has been transferred to another  institution, while in others it involves requests (advances on life policies, renegotiation of the debt repayment)  that have already been granted in the past and are contractually not repeatable. Non-discrimination issues have  been constantly and carefully monitored. With regard to the issue of accessibility of branches and services (12  reports), difficulties were identified in the use of new technologies by more elderly customers. Requests were  received to maintain assistance by personnel in branches for those who have difficulties in using ATMs, or to have  preferential lanes to reduce waiting times at the counter. There is continued attention to immigrant customers,  which, with 6 reports, requires the adoption of more inclusive approaches to cultural diversity by the Bank.

With regard to internal and external communications, precise information  has been provided on the achievements in this area, together with objective data that concretely reflect the  commitments made and the objectives reached. This was made possible by the timely updating of the online  CSR section both on the intranet (12 news items published) and on the internet in the corporate website  (4 press releases). A special section, Focus Sustainability, has been created in the corporate magazine with 6  in-depth articles. A CSR section has been created in the OneDesk portal for employees of the international  subsidiary banks of the Group. Lastly, 8 interventions were carried out on the Managers School App. In terms  of training, a video was produced and published on the principles and values of the Code of Ethics (accessed  by around 1,050 managers) in the Managers School platform. In addition, a collection of 9 Training Objects  (training videos and drama series) was developed and created, which has been available on the training  platform since February 2018, initially for employees of the Banca dei Territori (about 50,000 people) and then  extended to all employees. During the year, classroom meetings were also organised with the CSR Delegates  of the Structures in Italy and of the international subsidiary Banks. Compliance with the principles and values of the Code of Ethics was monitored with the support of the  current Chief Audit Officer (former Internal Auditing Department), so that it could be reported annually to the  Management Control Committee and the Surveillance Body pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001. Audits  were conducted that also considered social and environmental responsibility aspects and implications including:   Transactions with Related Parties and associated entities;   Research and Development Special Fund financing and management of the Fund for the development of social business  (Banca Prossima);   Migrant Assistance Sistema di Protezione per Richiedenti Asilo e Rifugiati (SPRAR) (protection system for asylum  seekers and refugees) (Banca Prossima);   Money transfer operations (focus on several Regional Governance Centres: Piedmont, Valle dAosta and  Liguria; Milan and Province);   Management of purchasing procedures, centralised or for specific companies and activities, and significant  outsourced processes of important operational functions. The audits did not identify any breaches or critical issues.

It believes that  compliance with standards encourages the creation and maintenance of a competitive economic environment  and protection of customer rights, which contributes to the development of local areas and communities.  Intesa Sanpaolo seeks to be a reliable and professional partner for the regulators. It actively adheres to the  principles of the United Nations Global Compact that envisage the development of policies for combating  corruption, protecting human rights and safeguarding the environment.  A comprehensive risk assessment system is applied across all the company Structures. Adherence to the rules  and integrity of corporate conduct are also ensured through compliance activities focused on the control of  compliance risk in relation to anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing and embargo management.  The Group adheres to the principle of active cooperation in preventing these phenomena, which represent a  serious threat to the legal economy. It also monitors developments in international tax regulations guided by  the OECD and aimed at countering base erosion and profit shifting from high-tax to low-tax jurisdictions, with  the ongoing commitment to adhere to those principles. The audit work also includes constant and independent monitoring of the due conduct of the Group's  operations and processes. The supervision is also carried out through specialist regulatory areas related  to specific Structures.

It recognises the  strategic importance of the work aimed at ensuring compliance with internal and external regulations and codes of  conduct and sets high standards of compliance for all personnel, which are also included in the Code of Conduct. The Code of Ethics also establishes Intesa Sanpaolos commitment to contributing to the fight against corruption,  supporting the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) guidelines and the anti- corruption principles established by the United Nations in 2003, also by taking a zero tolerance approach. The  Group has adopted strict internal procedures over time to prevent the risk of corruption and extortion, which  are set out in specific Guidelines. MODEL FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LIABILITY PURSUANT   TO LEGISLATIVE DECREE 231/01 Legislative Decree 231/2001 establishes a system of administrative liability for Italian Companies for certain  specifically identified crimes or offences, committed in their interest or for their benefit by their senior  officers and/or employees. Intesa Sanpaolo has long had a specific Organisational, Management and Control  Model in place that defines the principles of control and conduct that must be adopted to reduce the risk of  committing crimes and offences envisaged by the Decree, including, in particular, corruption, environmental  crimes and the violation of human rights. In preparing the Model, the Bank first of all took into account all the existing regulations, procedures and  control systems already being implemented to the extent they were also suitable as measures for preventing  crimes and illegal conduct in general, including those envisaged by Legislative Decree 231/01. The Bank identified the following as specific instruments already existing and aimed at planning the  formation and implementation of company decisions and carrying out controls on business operations, also  in relation to crimes and offences to be prevented:   the corporate governance rules, adopted in compliance with the Corporate Governance Code for listed  companies and the relevant company regulations and regulatory legislation;   internal regulations and company policies;   the Group's Code of Ethics, Internal Code of Conduct and Anti-Corruption Guidelines;   internal control system;   power and delegation system. The Board of Directors delegates to the Structures the task of implementing the content of the Model  and ensuring the constant updating and implementation of internal regulations and company processes,  which are an integral part of the Model, in compliance with the principles of control and conduct defined  for each sensitive activity. The effective and concrete implementation of the Model is also guaranteed by:   the Surveillance Body, in exercising the powers of initiative and control assigned to it in relation to the  activities carried out by the individual organisational Units in sensitive areas;   the heads of the various organisational Units of the Bank (Governance Areas, Divisions, Departments and  Organisational Units) in relation to the activities at risk carried out by them. Without prejudice to the independent responsibility of each Italian-registered company of the Group  regarding the adoption and effective implementation of its own Model, Intesa Sanpaolo in performing  its function as the Parent Company issues general criteria and instructions and verifies compliance by the  company Models with those criteria and instructions. In November 2017, the Board of Directors approved the update of Intesa Sanpaolos Model, mainly  attributable to the following aspects:   changes in external regulations I) amendments to the anti-money laundering rules (Legislative Decree   90/2017 which amended Legislative Decree 231/2007); II) amendments to corporate offences, with  the revision of the offence of \"Private-to-private corruption (Article 2635 Italian Civil Code) and the  introduction of the new offence of Incitement to bribery between private parties (Article 2635-bis  Italian Civil Code); and III) the new offence of Illicit intermediation and exploitation of labor;   adoption of the Group Anti-Corruption Guidelines. Following the approval of the new Model at the Parent Company, the Italian Group companies were asked  to proceed with the completion of the updating of their Models by the first quarter of 2018. ANTI-CORRUPTION 103-2/103-3; SOCIOECONOMIC COMPLIANCE 103-2; AUDIT 103-3; INTEGRITY IN CORPORATE CONDUCT 103-2  43 Governance and management of risks In March 2017, the Board of Directors approved the Group's Anti-Corruption Guidelines, which identify the  principles and the sensitive areas and define the roles, responsibilities and macro-processes for the management  of this risk, further strengthening an internal regulatory framework which already consists of the Code of Ethics,  the Group Internal Code of Conduct and – for the Italian Group companies – the Organisational, Management  and Control Model adopted pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001. The Guidelines define the commitment to comply with the regulatory provisions aimed at combating corruption  in all its forms, where corruption means the direct or indirect offering or acceptance of money or other benefits  capable of influencing the recipient, in order to induce or reward the performance of a function/activity or its  omission. In line with international and domestic best practices, the Group does not tolerate:   any type of corruption, in any form, manner or jurisdiction it occurs, not even if activities of this kind are  permitted, tolerated or not prosecuted under the laws in force in the countries in which the Group operates;   any conduct involving the offer or acceptance of money or other benefits – directly or indirectly – with the  aim of inducing or rewarding the performance of a function/activity or its omission. Such conduct is not  tolerated even with regard to small payments aimed at speeding up, facilitating or ensuring the performance  of a routine activity or any activity that forms part of the recipient's duties (so-called facilitation payments).  Benefits that cannot be granted include, for example, gifts and services free of charge (except for those  envisaged by specific regulations on gifts, and entertainment and charitable expenses), the undue hiring  of a person, the granting of credit on terms that do not conform to the principles of sound and prudent  management and, more generally, all transactions that entail the generation of a loss for the Group and the  creation of a profit for the recipient. The responsibility for control in this area is assigned to the Anti-Money Laundering Head Office Department and  its Manager is allocated the role of Group Anti-Corruption Officer. In 2017, a check was conducted on the consistency of the specific internal regulations with the general principles  set out in the Guidelines, in order to implement the necessary alignment, in addition to a detailed analysis  of the anti-corruption controls currently in place in the individual \"highest risk areas\", in order to identify  any strengthening measures. This resulted in the updating of the rules on charity, gifts and entertainment  expenses, sale of real estate, and hiring, as well as the adaptation of the contractual clauses to be used with  third parties and the setting up of a special electronic mailbox for any reports on potential circumstances or  conduct involving corruption. The work will be completed with measures regarding purchasing procedures,  sponsorships and equity investments. During the year, the Anti-Money Laundering Head Office Department assessed 172 transactions in the highest risk  areas, including due diligence reviews or opinions on the purchase, management and sale of equity investments,  on other assets and gifts, and on relationships with suppliers and charities. Lastly, in July 2017, specific training  was provided on the strengthening of the Group's anti-corruption controls during a meeting between the  Management Control Committee, the Surveillance Body (SB) of Intesa Sanpaolo and the Boards of Statutory  Auditors/SBs of the Subsidiaries. The training session was attended by 26 members of the Boards of Statutory  Auditors and Surveillance Bodies of Group companies, together with all the members of the Management  Control Committee and the Surveillance Body of Intesa Sanpaolo. In terms of the dissemination of information and the culture in this area, the Anti-Corruption Guidelines  were sent to all members of the Board of Directors of Intesa Sanpaolo and of the Banks of the  Banca dei Territori Division as part of the process of approval by their respective Boards of Directors.   To provide the Surveillance Body with an overall picture of the planning of second-level (compliance,  anti-money laundering, administrative/financial governance) and third-level (internal audit) controls, the  Compliance department collects the respective plans from the relevant Structures on an annual basis  regarding the scheduled supervision of sensitive areas and incorporates them into the 231 Audit Plan.   On the basis of this document, the Surveillance Body assesses the adequacy of the programme of audits  on individual sensitive company activities and identifies any further actions needed to strengthen the audit  plans proposed by the individual Structures concerned. The heads of the organisational units involved in sensitive processes pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01, certify  the level of implementation of the Model, by means of an overall self-diagnosis process on the work carried out,  with a particular focus on compliance with the principles of control and conduct and the operating rules. Lastly, constant attention is paid to training initiatives and the dissemination of the compliance culture. This  included the Legislative Decree 231/01 distance training course, initiated in 2015, which had a participation  rate of 81% at Group level at the end of 2017. 205-2  44 Governance and management of risks For the employees, specific communications on the adoption of the Guidelines were published on the  company intranet in Italy through a news document and an Internal Regulation. In Italy, there were no cases of disciplinary measures related to corruption incidents. There were no significant penalties for non-compliance with laws or regulations relating to corruption or  discrimination in the workplace. COMBATING MONEY-LAUNDERING Intesa Sanpaolo pays particular attention to compliance with national and international regulations aimed  at combating money laundering and terrorist financing, which it recognises as a serious threat to the legal  economy with destabilising effects for the banking system, and it adheres to the principle of active cooperation  in preventing these phenomena. In compliance with the legislative provisions of the legislator and the sectoral supervisory authorities, and  drawing on the international standards contained in the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) Recommendations,  the Group has adopted procedures, instruments and controls designed to mitigate the risk of being involved,  even unknowingly, in acts of money laundering and terrorist financing. The Group's governance system to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism is based on  Guidelines that constitute a systematic and functional reference framework, with active collaboration by the  Group in preventing said illegal activities. Specific processes and procedures are in place in terms of obligations  of customer due diligence, reporting of suspicious transactions, recording of relations and transactions, storage  of documents, assessment and management of risk, internal control and guarantee of compliance with all of  the relevant provisions to prevent and impede the completion of transactions connected to money laundering  or financing of terrorism. The guidelines and standards established by the Parent Company are developed and  implemented within the individual operating Structures in proportion to the characteristics and complexity of  the activity carried out, and their size and organisational structure, in compliance with the requirements of local  regulations and ensuring the sharing of information at consolidated level. Procedures that provide automatic checks on the Group's register and transactions have been active for  some time now, in order to mitigate the risk of having customers included in the list of entities (black  lists) subject to restrictions or freezing of assets. The Group has also adopted a stricter approach, going  beyond the regulatory requirements, by envisaging more detailed assessments of credit and reputational  aspects to prevent its involvement, in any capacity, in transactions with counterparties or countries  under embargo, even if the transaction is among those permitted by the restrictive provisions issued by  the international authorities. In 2017, the activities planned for the consolidation of the international Anti  Money Laundering (AML) model were completed and the project work continued on the strengthening of anti- terrorist controls through the enhancement of filtering systems for detecting suspicious elements. In addition,  the project was initiated for the adaptation of AML controls to the new regulatory requirements of the AML IV  Directive (transposed by Legislative Decree 90/2017 in force since 4 July), together with a multi-year programme  for the overall review and strengthening of anti-money laundering, embargo, anti-terrorism and anti-corruption  measures at Group level (ENIF - Enabling Integrated Financial Crime Project). In 2017, Intesa Sanpaolo Life signed a settlement agreement with the Central Bank of Ireland in relation to  the allegations made during the inspections of 2015. The fine imposed, of 1 million euro, takes account of the  cooperation provided during the inspection and the implementation of the required mitigation actions. RELATIONS WITH POLITICAL PARTIES AND MOVEMENTS The internal policies establish that political parties and movements cannot be recipients of donations and  sponsorships. With regard to the financing of political parties, connected associations and individual candidates,  specific rules state that the only form of new credit concession in their favour, reserved to decision by the  Board of Directors, consists of the advance on an annual basis of the \"2x1000 contribution\" against the  transfer, to be notified in accordance with the law, of the sums due to the parties for this form of contribution.   In 2017 no financing was granted in this area. 205-2; PUBLIC POLICY 103-2; 415-1  45 Governance and management of risks COMPLIANCE WITH TAX REGULATIONS In compliance with the Code of Ethics, the Group is committed to observing principles based on values of  honesty and integrity in managing tax matters, compliance with the tax regulations applicable in the countries in  which the Group operates and maintaining a collaborative and transparent relationship with the tax authorities,  including through adherence to cooperative compliance schemes. Intesa Sanpaolo places particular attention on the evolution of tax regulations, both domestic and international,  aimed at countering base erosion and profit shifting, with the ongoing commitment to adhere to those principles.  The Group has strengthened the internal control system for tax risk, known as the Tax Control Framework, to  make it capable of covering the strategically important area of tax risk and meeting the requirements for access  to the collaborative compliance scheme introduced in Italy, in accordance with Legislative Decree 128/2015. In December 2017, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group adopted its Principles of conduct on fiscal matters, in order to  ensure compliance over time with the tax and fiscal rules of the countries where it operates and to guarantee the  financial and reputational integrity of all the Group companies. In particular, guidelines have been established to  ensure uniform management of taxation at all Group companies, based on approach of: (i) correct and timely  determination and payment of taxes due by law and performance of the related obligations, (ii) containment  of tax risk, understood as the risk of operating in violation of tax regulations or in conflict with the principles or  with the aims of the legal system in the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates, both due to outside  factors (primarily, uncertainty of the interpretation of tax laws due to ambiguity or lack of clarity) and internal  factors (incorrect and/or untimely compliance with mandatory requirements; failure to detect regulatory changes  affecting the taxation of the Group; and transactions that may be challenged by the tax authorities as abusive). The Principles are:   Corporate Responsibility – The Group, in compliance with the Corporate Responsibility principle, acts  according to the values of honesty and integrity in the management of fiscal matters, in the knowledge  that revenue from taxes is one of the main sources of contribution to the economic and social development  of the countries in which it operates;   Legality – The Group adopts conduct based on compliance with the tax regulations applicable in the countries  in which it operates and interpretations that allow it to manage tax risk responsibly, so that it can satisfy the  interests of all its stakeholders and ensure its positive reputation;   Tone at the top – The Board of Directors defines the principles of conduct in relation to Group tax matters and  ensures its application, assuming the responsibility of guiding the spread of a corporate culture based on the  values of honesty and integrity and principle of lawfulness;   Relationship – The Group maintains a collaborative and transparent relationship with the tax authorities,  which includes providing them the information needed to fully understand the circumstances underlying the  application of tax rules. To this end, Intesa Sanpaolo encourages the group companies to adhere to cooperative  tax compliance systems, which supplement the national regulations, in order to create stronger relationships  with the tax authorities. Guidelines were also approved for the management of tax risk within the system of collaborative compliance  with the Revenue Agency, which govern the criteria and processes that Intesa Sanpaolo must adopt to ensure  the adequacy and effectiveness of its Tax Control Framework. Tax risk is defined as the risk of operating  in violation of tax regulations or in conflict with the principles or purposes of the tax system in the various  jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The types of tax risk that may arise in the context of business processes have been identified by Intesa Sanpaolo as:   Tax compliance risks. These are risks of an operational nature and arise in both business processes (such as risks  of not correctly performing all the operational tasks necessary to ensure correctness – in terms of completeness,  accuracy and timely processing – of relevant data for tax purposes), and in specific tax compliance processes (from  data collection through to its processing and preparation of tax declarations/payments to the tax authorities);    Tax risks of an interpretative nature on transactions/routine operations. This type of risk relates to the uncertainty  about the actual meaning of the regulations and the classification of actual cases with respect to theoretical  circumstances and arises within the following processes: regulatory alignment, advice given to the Structures of  the Bank and interpretation choices adopted in tax compliance processes;    Tax risks of an interpretative nature on non-routine transactions. These risks arise whenever non-routine  transactions/operations are carried out, which are characterised by objective and defined uncertainty  regarding the risk of adopting incorrect interpretations or interpretations that are contrary to the principles  and aims of the tax system.  46 Governance and management of risks The supervision of compliance with tax legislation is assigned to the Tax Sub-Department, which performs the  role of Specialist Function. Based on the periodic reports and other information flows provided by the Tax Sub-Department and the other  corporate control functions and checks conducted directly, the Compliance, Governance and Controls Head Office  Department produces an independent assessment of the regulatory compliance risk in relation to tax matters and  the controls put in place for its mitigation and, when it deems necessary, it requests the Tax Sub-Department to  implement appropriate strengthening measures. During 20171 the Group, in addition to indirect taxes of 917 million euro, recorded accrued income taxes for the  year of 1,481 million euro, for the most part in Italy, where the majority of operating income was earned, as per  the table below. In compliance with the applicable regulations, Intesa Sanpaolo also publishes a country-by-country disclosure  in which the following information is provided for each country (according to the rules established by the  Bank of Italy): gross income; number of employees; profit or loss before tax; and tax on profit or loss.   The report is available at the following link [i]. Direct taxes in 2017 Italy Europe Rest of the world Tax contribution 1,059 356 66 Operating income 13,173 3,211 1,059 PROTECTION OF FREE COMPETITION The Group constantly monitors and promotes free competition and disseminates a culture of compliance with  anti-trust regulations, working to ensure that the international, European and national rules and procedures are  effectively applied and complied with. In the Group Code of Ethics, Intesa Sanpaolo declares its commitment to competing fairly in the market and  cooperating with other economic, private and public entities whenever necessary to strengthen the overall  capacity of the countries where the Group operates. The Bank is constantly committed to managing relations with  institutions and organisations, in monitoring existing regulations and in conducting attentive advocacy on any bills  that could impact the activities of the Group and of its stakeholders at the national, European and international  level, with a view to limiting legal, economic and reputational risk and developing new opportunities. Due to the growing importance of antitrust issues, the Group has long since adopted a risk control system  for antitrust compliance, under the responsibility of the International and Regulatory Affairs Department,  which reports directly to the CEO. In this regard, it has adopted an extensive antitrust compliance  program whose key features include the creation of a specific internal team aimed at supervising antitrust  compliance and the adoption of a Compliance Policy for EU Antitrust legislation. The control of this area  has been extended beyond the more traditional forms of antitrust (mergers, abuses of dominant positions  and agreements) to also include EU regulations on state aid and the recent Italian regulations in support of  Italy's competitiveness. In particular, with regard to the objective of producing training events on compliance with competition protection  regulations, online training modules were developed for the Managers School together with 5 Web TV clips  for publication on the company Intranet available to all employees in Italy. The issues addressed focused on  specific protection matters in this area, including antitrust in the USA; big data management; the powers of the  authority in the European Commission guidelines; and the prohibition of state aid. Two training sessions were  also held in the course Antitrust law in Italy - the regulation of competition in the Italian legal system, involving  about 30 people, together with a thematic in-depth session on the subject of the exchange of information and  participation in trade associations, aimed at 15 employees. In April 2017, the Italian Antitrust Authority concluded the proceedings – initiated in 2016 against the Italian  Banking Association and 11 member banks including Intesa Sanpaolo – aimed at establishing whether the  interbank agreement on the system of remuneration for the SEDA service, offered by banks to market participants  from October 2013, constituted a restrictive agreement in breach of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning  of the European Union. The Authority did not impose any fines, in view of the minor seriousness of the breach  and the regulatory and economic environment in which the conduct took place. ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR 103-2/103-3; 206-1 1 The comments refer to the reclassified figures published in the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group and include the acquired Aggregated Set of Banca Popolare  di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. For additional details or information, see the 2017 Consolidated Financial Statements of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group.  47 Governance and management of risks PRIVACY PROTECTION Intesa Sanpaolo is continually committed to implementing regulatory, organisational and technological  measures aimed at adequately responding to the needs of privacy protection. These actions reflect the  principles of the Group Code of Ethics which commit the Bank to adopting criteria of absolute transparency  in informing customers and employees about their data privacy rights and how their personal information is  processed. This commitment is set out in Company rules for the processing of personal data envisaged by the  applicable national regulations, which provide an overall framework for conduct, aimed at all staff, as well as  employees of the Bank.  The Privacy Sub-Department of the Safety and Protection Head Office Department provides supervision, for  the Parent Company and the Group Companies that have signed specific service agreements, of the privacy  regulations, ensuring the adoption of the related updates and regulatory alignment, in addition to compliance  with the provisions of the Italian Data Protection Authority. This structure also conducts prior assessments on  the compliance of new products, initiatives and services involving the processing of personal data and sends the  processing notifications to the Italian Data Protection Authority. It also represents the Company with respect  to the Authority during inspection procedures. The Privacy Sub-Department is responsible for identifying the  role performed by the Group's suppliers based on the provisions for the processing of personal data contained  in the contracts and preparing any appointments as Data Processor. It also updates and publishes the List  of Third Parties that process personal data of customers and employees. This Sub-Department manages the  responses to the Italian Data Protection Authority and the interested parties following appeals, reports or  complaints submitted to the Authority. It also processes customer requests, connected to the exercise of  the right of access to personal data in compliance with the legal provisions and the measures issued by the  Authority, and oversees training on privacy, in collaboration with the designated Structures. For the other Group Companies, the Privacy Sub-Department performs the role of guidance, coordination and  control, overseeing the correct application of the Group guidelines and regulations on privacy, and provides  support and advice for the performance of the current activities in this area. For the Group, it ensures control  of compliance risk in relation to privacy regulations, performing the role of Specialist Function envisaged  by the Group Compliance Guidelines. The structure oversees the recording required for the personal data  processing carried out by the Parent Company and by Intesa Sanpaolo Group Services and proposes the  nominations of the, internal or external, Data Processors and Persons in Charge of Data Processing to the  Data Controllers Delegate. This effort enables the mitigation of reputational and compliance risks in the processing of personal data,  also with respect to the lawfulness and fairness of the processing, the purposes of the processing and its  relevance, and the completeness and non-excessiveness of the data collected. With regard to requests received from customers regarding personal data protection, in Italy 101 reports  were received in 2017 for alleged violation of the Privacy Code and eight complaints by the Italian Data  Protection Authority against companies belonging to the Group for which the necessary responses were  provided. In 2017, the Italian Data Protection Authority issued two administrative fines for a total of 60,000  euro for breaches of the Personal Data Protection Code. No cases were recorded of Group customer data  being lost or stolen. The new European Regulation no. 679/2016 [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)], which will enter  into force on 25 May 2018, makes each data controller responsible for implementing regulatory, organisational  and technological measures to adequately respond, according to a risk-based approach, to the main new  principles introduced by the GDPR: Data Protection by design and by default, appointment of the Data  Protection Officer, Privacy Impact Assessment, and Data Breach. The project for alignment to GDPR is currently  underway, under the responsibility of the Privacy Sub-Department, and work has started on the development  of the technological and organisational measures needed to comply with the requirements of the European  Regulation in Italy and for the Group's Legal Entities located within the EU. COMPLIANCE WITH LABOR LAWS In line with the commitment set out in the Code of Ethics for the development of a working environment of  mutual trust and loyalty, enhanced by the contribution of each person, the management model in this area is  based on the national and second-level bargaining agreements (Group). Compliance with these rules, in addition  to the legal provisions, is instrumental to improving the working climate, with a view to continued growth in the  quality of relations between the Company and its personnel and customers. They are also aimed at asserting the  need for a transparent and sustainable work organisation, with clear operational responsibilities at the various  levels to continuously ensure compliance with the rules and the prevention of non-compliant behaviour, identifying  measures that ensure the effective synthesis of company objectives and worker expectations in terms of working  environment and internal relations. NON DISCRIMINATION 103-2/103-3; CUSTOMER PRIVACY 103-2; 418-1  48 Governance and management of risks 205-1; NON DISCRIMINATION 103-2/103-3; 406-1; AUDIT 103-2; EX FS9 Responsibility for management and consequently also for monitoring the effective application of the Trade Union  agreements, is assigned to the Employment Policy Sub-Department of the Human Resources Head Office Department. The protocol for Industrial Relations enables joint research and sharing between the Company and Trade  Union Organisations on solutions to improve the well-being of employees and make a positive contribution to  productivity with advanced and innovative responses in the area of pensions, assistance and services for families,  education and better work-life balance.  The aims of the actions include improving the work-life balance for the employees.  In general, the number of labor lawsuits is small: 10 cases for violations of labor law were notified in 2017  and around 40 cases were closed. In addition to appeals against dismissals for just cause following disciplinary  procedures, the types of litigation initiated include the establishment of subordinate employment relationships  in cases of contracts for the supply of IT services and compensation for damages for deskilling (also in 2017  no lawsuits for mobbing emerged). There is no evidence of cases of discrimination that have led to investigations for measures to be issued under  formal procedures or processes except for two reports of harassment: in one case a disciplinary measure was  issued (suspension from service and pay for 8 days) and in the other case investigations are still ongoing. Ongoing monitoring has also been conducted on compliance with the rules laid down by the Internal Code of  Conduct, through the investigation of potentially abnormal situations. AUDITS The planning of Audits is coordinated by a specific internal structure, which supports the Chief Audit Officer  in setting and assigning medium/short term objectives and plans to the Auditing Responsibility Centres, which  are internal Structures focused on specific sectors (e.g. head office functions, ITC, branch network, etc.).   This activity takes into account the findings from the risk analysis, the requests from the Company Management  and Control Bodies, and from Top Management, as well as the obligations arising from external regulations and  from the Supervisory Authorities. In terms of timing, the planning is divided into:   Three-year Strategic Planning: in line with the company's strategic guidelines;   Annual Operational Planning: annual audit plan, subject to approval by the Bodies;   Quarterly Operational Planning. In addition, on an annual basis and in line with the International Standards for the Professional Practice  of Internal Auditing, the Internal quality assurance and improvement plan is prepared, which is also based  on the monitoring of the operational and financial objectives assigned to the Structures and includes the  Annual Plan submitted for approval to the Company Bodies. At the international level, the audits are structured to ensure direct monitoring of Intesa Sanpaolos  international branches, in addition to guaranteeing supervision of the Head Office Structures and the  International Subsidiary Banks. For these banks, the dedicated offices of the Parent Company provide direct  auditing, together with governance of the activities carried out by local audit units. In 2017, the current Chief Audit Officer (former Internal Auditing Department) carried out audits directly or  indirectly aimed at verifying compliance with internal regulations and in relation to anti-money laundering  and embargoes and, more generally, on various areas/processes of the Bank, some of which were particularly  important because of their sensitivity in relation to 231/2001 legislation. It also verified the adequacy of  the Integrated Internal Control System in these areas. A total of 267 audits were carried out, 10 of which  directly or indirectly concerned aspects related to social and environmental policies. Implementation of the quality improvement plan for the monitoring of the overall control system continued  (Internal Audit Transformation - IAT project). In particular, in 2017 the new Risk Models were activated,  which ensure a risk-based assessment approach across the company Structures, including the recent Fraud  and behavioural irregularities model.  49 Governance and management of risks ANTI-CORRUPTION 103-2; 406-1; SOCIOECONOMIC COMPLIANCE 103-2 WHISTLEBLOWING Since 2016, a whistleblowing system has been in place, which allows employees to report actions or events  that could constitute breaches of banking regulations – from which no significant reports have emerged.  Whistleblowing, which ensures the confidentiality of the person making the report (without the risk of  retaliatory, unfair or discriminatory behaviour) encourages employees (including suppliers and consultants)  to report acts or conduct they become aware of that may constitute a breach of the regulations governing  banking activities or connected or instrumental activities. The current Chief Audit Officer (former Internal  Auditing Department) is the structure responsible for assessing these reports and in 2017 a total of 16  reports were received, of which 6 were non pertinent and 10 resulted in specific investigations. FINES AND DISPUTES As at 31 December 2017, a total of about 17,000 disputes were pending2 for a total amount of 5,917 million  euro, down on 6,682 million euro for 2016. In further detail, the most important of these are:   bankruptcy revocatory disputes (458 million euro);   disputes concerning settlements in insolvency proceedings (558 million euro);   disputes concerning investment services (409 million euro);   disputes concerning anatocism and other conditions (980 million euro);   disputes concerning banking products (230 million euro);   disputes concerning credit positions (1,418 million euro);   disputes concerning lease contracts (110 million euro);   other civil and administrative disputes (1,243 million euro). In terms of tax litigation, there were disputes pending amounting to a total of 364 million euro for the Group. With regard to compliance with environmental regulations, for damage caused to the environment as a result  of the Bank's operations and in relation to health and safety, over the last three years, no significant reports  emerged and no fines were imposed (see page 131). With regard to labor litigation, at the end of December 2017 there were no significant cases from either a  qualitative or quantitative standpoint. For information on the disputes in 2017 and a detailed description of the most significant civil and fiscal  lawsuits, see the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 439) [i]. 2 The figures include the disputes relating to the Aggregate Set Acquired.  50 Governance and management of risks Main social and environmental risks managed by the Group The Group has implemented specific processes and responsibilities to understand and manage risks in such a way as to  ensure long-term soundness, extending the benefits to its stakeholders. Below is an overview of the main social and environmental risks that are significant due to their possible impact on  company activities and the community.. Area Risk Stakeholder affected Society: quality and innovation in   customer relations Customer protection and responsible sales   Customers  Society multichannel approach   and accessibility Prevention of IT risk   Customers Society: customer health and safety Preventing and combating robberies   Customers   Employees Society: support to the production system  Environment and climate change:   green economy Management of social and environmental  risks in loans   Customers   Community   Environment Society: responsible asset management  Environment and climate change:   green economy Assessment and control of ESG risks in  the investment portfolios   Customers   Community   Environment Society: support to the production system  Environment and climate change:   green economy Transactions and loans in controversial  sectors   Customers   Community   Environment Society: quality and innovation in   customer relations  Environment and climate change Protection of business continuity in the  event of an emergency   Customers   Environment Environment and climate change Management of potential environmental  risks connected to climate change impacts   Environment   Community Employees: Labor/Management relations Management of labor dispute risks   Employees Employees: employee well-being Health and safety of employees   Employees Integrity in corporate conduct Management of compliance risks  (corruption, money laundering, tax  legislation, free competition, privacy,  labor laws)   Community Governance and management of risks Management of reputational risks   Customers   Shareholders   Employees   Suppliers   Environment MAIN SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS MANAGED BY THE GROUP REPUTATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT Considering the high awareness of business ethics and the growing interest in the valuation of intangible assets,  Intesa Sanpaolo has developed a model to actively manage its reputation with all its stakeholders with a view to  preventing and minimising potential negative effects on its image. Intesa Sanpaolos reputational risk governance model assigns the Corporate Bodies the function of strategic  supervision and to the Enterprise Risk Management Head Office Department general responsibility for governing  reputational risk processes. Each company function is involved in the process of safeguarding the corporate  image by identifying the reputational risks associated with the activities under its responsibility. Some company  102-15; 102-29; 102-33  51 Governance and management of risks MANAGEMENT OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS IN LOANS The Code of Ethics requires investment decisions and the credit policy to take into account the socio- environmental risks associated with the activities of corporate customers. This commitment is also contained in  the Rules for the environmental and energy policy. Both documents also mention the importance of adhering  to the Equator Principles covering these risks. The assessment of environmental risks also enables compliance  with the regulatory requirements set out in the Organisational, management and control model pursuant to  Legislative Decree 231/2001 on the administrative liability of entities.  From an organisational perspective, the analysis and assessment of the socio-environmental risk of financing  operations subject to the Equator Principles, is the responsibility of the Chief Lending Officer Area. For other  loans, the Structures responsible for this assessment, if requested by the business or lending Structures, are  the Corporate Social Responsibility Sub-Department for the specific socio-environmental risk and the Risk  Management function for the reputational risk aspects. The assessment of the credit rating, which includes the socio-environmental aspects, is conducted for all the  corporate customers, in accordance with the Rules of the Internal Rating System. The social and environmental aspects can also have a positive impact, leading to an improvement in the  rating. With this in mind, the new rating model has introduced additional assessment elements regarding the  qualitative aspects of the companies, such as trademarks, patents, quality and environmental certifications,  research and development, innovation and digitisation, ownership and management, and membership of  a supply chain. With particular regard to the sectors potentially most exposed to environmental risks, a specific Questionnaire for  integrating environmental risks into the credit assessment is currently being tested on a sample of customers. Lastly, in 2017, a process of issuing advisory opinions, on request from the operating Structures, on the social,  environmental and reputational risks of financing transactions and/or borrowers in sensitive sectors was  launched on an experimental basis. The opinions, provided by CSR jointly with the Reputational Risk Office of  the Chief Risk Officer Area, include the allocation of a risk class (from low to high) and 32 of these opinions  were issued in 2017. functions are also assigned specific tasks in relation to reputation protection (including Compliance, CSR,  Investor Relations, Institutional Affairs and External Communication, Internal Communication). The Group attaches great importance to non-financial risks and, as part of the main risk-taking strategies set out  in the Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), it has been defined a qualitative statement dedicated to the protection  of its reputation. The reputational risk management system is based, on one hand, on systematic and independent monitoring by  the corporate Structures with the specific duty of protecting reputation and, on the other hand, on reputational  risk management processes implemented through the Enterprise Risk Management Head Office Department. These processes are aimed at the Reputational Risk Clearing, with the objective of ex-ante identification and  assessment of potential reputational risks (ESG risks are particularly important in this regard) connected with  the most significant business transactions, the main strategic projects and the selection of Intesa Sanpaolos  suppliers/partners. By providing an advisory opinion, the clearing seeks to identify the potential risks associated  with a specific transaction and/or counterparty to enable informed risk taking, within the decision-making  processes concerned. In particular, the analysis of the reputational risks, conducted using dedicated metrics and  tools, concerns both the counterparty and the specific transaction. In addition, Reputational Risk Monitoring processes are in place to monitor the evolution over time of Intesa  Sanpaolos reputational positioning and identify the main areas of exposure, through periodic analysis of its  web reputation or observation of appropriate Key Risk Indicators. The monitoring processes are performed on  the basis of the reputational dimensions identified in the Group's approach and enable the integration of the  internal perspective (based on the Banks internal data and assessments including, for example, compliance risk  management activities and monitoring of the application of the Code of Ethics) with the external perspective  (based on analyses/surveys conducted by third parties to monitor stakeholder perception and expectations,  including aspects such as stakeholder engagement and web reputation). The mitigation of reputational risk is entrusted both to the Structures directly supervising the reputation and  corporate image, and to the Structures responsible for managing primary risks, in view of the consequential nature  of reputational risk. In addition, with regard to significant reputational risks, the Enterprise Risk Management  Head Office Department may promote the establishment of specific mitigation measures. 102-33; FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING 103-2; 407-1; CHILD LABOR 103-2; 408-1; FORCED OR COMPULSORY  LABOR 103-2; 409-1; RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE 103-2; LOCAL COMMUNITIES 103-2; 413-1; 413-2  52 Governance and management of risks The evaluation and management of the social and environmental risks plays a fundamental role for loans for  large industrial and infrastructural projects.  The Equator Principles (EP or Principles) are international Guidelines for the management of socio-environmental  risks arising from project financing, that financial institutions can adhere to on a voluntary basis. Applying  these Principles in a structured and integrated manner allows emerging risks to be identified and managed in  countries that are vulnerable from a social and environmental viewpoint and in sensitive sectors. Intesa Sanpaolo  has adhered to the EP since 2007. The Principles are based on the criteria of the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank (the  Performance Standards), which concern: assessing social and environmental impacts; protecting workers'  rights; preventing pollution and promoting energy efficiency; risks to the health and safety of communities in  the countries where activities are carried out; consulting populations concerned and protecting their rights;  safeguarding biodiversity and sustainable management of natural resources; and preserving cultural heritage.  The EP process takes specific account of the impacts from climate change. In fact, the Principles require  customers to demonstrate that, if the CO2 eq emissions of a project are expected to exceed 100,000 tonnes,  they have considered solutions with lower emissions, through alternative analysis. The Principles also require the  publication, on an annual basis, of CO2 emission levels for these projects. The Climate Change Working Group of the Equator Principles Association liaises continuously with the  International Finance Corporation on the implementation of its climate change strategy in the Performance  Standards and to share best practices in the area of climate change risk management. The EP envisage the assignment of a risk category to the projects to be financed (A indicates a high level of risk,  B medium and C low), based on variables such as the socio-environmental characteristics of the country, the  industrial sector and the characteristics of the project in question.  The scope of the Principles includes the technical form of Project Finance, from 10 million US dollars, and  business loans, if intended for the implementation of a specific project, from 100 million US dollars. THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENT ACCORDING TO THE EQUATOR PRINCIPLES An updated version of the Operating Guidelines for implementation of the Equator Principles by Intesa  Sanpaolo was issued during the year. The Guidelines are integrated into the Groups credit policies in order  to identify all loans, starting from the application stage, that come under the scope of the EP. The Guidelines  require higher-risk projects, and medium-risk projects if necessary, to be assessed by an independent advisor  who identifies the main social and environmental impacts. The results of this independent due diligence  provide suggestions and recommendations regarding the need to supplement the preliminary assessment  with in-depth studies or action plans to ensure that the project meets the requirements of international  standards. The action plans must be integrated into the contractual obligations and monitored at a frequency  based on the level of risk identified. Customers are required to submit regular reports as evidence of the implementation of the actions requested  by the Bank, which may also be verified with on-site inspections. In the event of non-compliance with the  agreed conditions, the Bank reserves the right to exercise the intervention measures for assessment on a  case-by-case basis. The assessment process also envisages engagement and consultation with local communities, to understand the  possible social impacts and identify any actions needed. The Equator Principles require an ongoing relationship  with stakeholders, from the design phase and throughout the entire project, through structured stakeholder  engagement activities and grievance mechanisms. ADOPTION OF THE EQUATOR PRINCIPLES TRAINING ON SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS IN BANCA INTESA BEOGRAD  Intesa Beograd, in partnership with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),  organised two training seminars on social and environmental risks for employees working in positions of  responsibility for the risk management activities. Around 30 people were made aware of environmental  and social issues in the light of the EBRD requirements (risk management approach, implementation of  the Equator Principles, etc.).  203-1; 407-1; 408-1; 409-1; 412-1; 412-2; 412-3; 413-1; 413-2; EX FS1; EX FS2; EX FS3; EX FS5  53 Governance and management of risks CONTROVERSIAL SECTORS Intesa Sanpaolo is aware of the importance of the correct and responsible allocation of credit, according to  criteria of social and environmental sustainability. To this end, it devotes particular attention to examining the  sustainability issues associated with sectors considered more sensitive, such as the armaments, nuclear energy,  and fossil fuel extraction sectors. Sensitive sectors are identified among those that have a significant socio-environmental risk profile and that are the  subject of awareness-raising initiatives or pressure campaigns by specialist NGOs, civil society groups and customers. In keeping with the values and principles expressed in the Code of Ethics and in the knowledge of the need  to support national and European defence, together with the allied countries in NATO, the Intesa Sanpaolo  Group will not support operations that relate to the production and trade of military goods, even if permitted  by applicable law, in countries that do not belong to the European Union and/or NATO. The company rules also  prohibit engagement in any kind of banking or lending activity related to the production of and/or trade in  controversial weapons and/or banned by international treaties and in particular: nuclear, biological and chemical  weapons; cluster and fragmentation bombs; weapons containing depleted uranium; and anti-personnel  landmines. In addition to the provisions already adopted by Intesa Sanpaolo in accordance with the provisions of  Law 185/1990, in 2017 specific rules were issued for the Groups international subsidiary banks. The operations  of the Group's Branches and International Subsidiary Banks are also subject to local regulations, when they are  stricter than the Group regulations. In 2017, the total number of transactions reported to the Ministry of Economy and Finance pursuant to Law  185/1990 in terms of loan disbursements and payments amounted to 272.3 million euro. For the International  Subsidiary Banks, the volume of transactions in the arms sector was 27.5 million euro.  In other sensitive sectors, the Corporate Social Responsibility Sub-Department, in agreement with the Reputational  Risk Office, provides the business and lending Structures with prior opinions on the social, environmental  and reputational risks. CLIMATE CHANGE: MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS AND IMPACTS The Intesa Sanpaolo Group considers the risks and opportunities arising from climate change within its overall  strategy and integrates ESG assessment into its activities. Through the monitoring of the Code of Ethics, stakeholder  engagement activities and sustainability reporting, the Group identifies and analyses the range of risks associated  with climate change and sets objectives and guidelines aimed at implementing actions designed to manage and  mitigate these risks. The potential risks, opportunities and possible impacts on stakeholders and on corporate Structures have been analysed  in the materiality matrix, both in terms of direct impacts on Group operations and properties and in terms of the green  economy. Since 2016, the materiality matrix has been agreed with the Chief Risk Officer Area with the aim of starting a  process of integration with the reputational risk assessment carried out annually. In addition, with regard to the alignment of the Environmental and Energy Management System to the most recent  UNI EN ISO 14001:2015 standard, a Background Analysis was conducted to gain a full understanding of the reference  scenario, including the specific associated risks, as well as the needs and expectations of all stakeholders involved by  SGAE. The SGAE Delegates and the managers of several corporate functions (CSR, Operational and Reputational Risk,  Rules and Credit Instruments, Investor Relations & Price-Sensitive Communication, Rating Agencies and Investor Coverage,  and Innovation) contributed to the results of the process. All the risks identified by the Background Analysis – split into six  Total Category A Category B Category C Project Finance 10 1 8 1 Business loans associated  with projects 1 1 - - PROJECTS COMPLETED IN 2017 Since 2007, a total of 326 loans subject to screening for the Equator Principles have reached financial closure, 11  of which in 2017. In 2017, the amount agreed for projects that adopted the Equator Principles assessment process, was 611.5  million euro, equal to approximately 8% of the total amount agreed for loans in the reference scope. The  reference scope covers all the Intesa Sanpaolo Structures involved in project finance covered by the scope of the  Principles, in Italy and abroad. The table below shows the number of projects that were financially closed in 2017, with breakdown by category. 201-2  54 Governance and management of risks categories (commercial, economic, operational, technological, implementational and reputational) – are managed by the  Intesa Sanpaolo Group, within the SGAE, through a continuously monitored programme of actions. A low level of risk is  considered acceptable, whereas for medium and high level risks, specific actions are defined, whose initiation time is within  one month for the high level and within six months for the medium level. Intesa Sanpaolos strategy includes actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation), together with measures for  adapting to climate change that is taking place or has already occurred. In recent years we have witnessed extreme  atmospheric events at global level that have had considerable impact on the Banks Structures and on the activities of our  corporate and retail customers.  The assessment of risks to workers' health and safety also includes the assessment of the hydrogeological risk and hydraulic  risk due to flooding and landslides. With regard to flooding, the benchmark is based on the level of danger associated with  a floodable area and depends on the probability that the area can be flooded. With regard to landslides, the benchmark is  based on the level of danger associated with an area subject to landslide events and depends on the relationship between  the probability of occurrence of the event and its extent. These assessments are set out in the Risk Assessment Document  pursuant to Legislative Decree 81/08, and enable the Intesa Sanpaolo Group to implement actions that take account of the  effects deriving from critical events linked to natural phenomena caused by climate change, allowing the management of  different potential risk scenarios, through the implementation of specific Emergency Plans, in order to mitigate and reduce  possible damage, particularly with regard to workers and third parties. Intesa Sanpaolo has also adopted an Organisational  Model for Crisis Management which defines the organisational structure responsible for managing critical events and  identifies the roles, responsibilities and decision-making powers. This ensures the participation of all the managerial and  operational levels necessary for managing emergencies and crises, including those deriving from large-scale destructive  events, i.e. at a metropolitan or wider level, that affect essential infrastructures of both the Bank and third parties, or  situations that do not necessarily have a significant impact on operations, but have a high social or local impact (e.g.  floods, etc.). In particular, the Emergency Management Operational Centre deals with the various crisis scenarios, ensuring  continuous and precise monitoring of the situation and coordinating the actions to be implemented for the local Structures  concerned, in constant collaboration with the competent head office Structures. Lastly, on an annual basis, in order to meet the requirements of the Carbon Disclosure Project, a specific analysis  is conducted of the risks and opportunities related to climate change. Specifically, the impacts, financial implications,  management methods and related costs are examined, taking into account the specific climatic characteristics of the  different geographical areas where the Group operates. The tables below show the main risks, impacts and actions resulting  from climate change considered by the Intesa Sanpaolo Group. For the full mapping, see Intesa Sanpaolos questionnaire  for the Carbon Disclosure Project [i].

It also underlines the assumption  of responsibility for prudent asset management, the commitment towards providing wider access to credit  and financial instruments for everyone, and towards the sustainable development of the business system  and support for events of a cultural and socially-beneficial nature. The 2014-2017 Business Plan continued with these commitments and was strongly geared towards offering  excellent services to the real economy by listening to the needs expressed by stakeholders, with attention to  transparency and continuity of relations established by the Group with the communities. This is performed through offering socially-responsible investments with innovative financial and insurance  products and with an active role in projects of solidarity. There is an equally significant effort towards sharing this responsibility with the supplier chain by exercising an active  control over the purchasing system also in order to properly assess the impacts on society and the environment.

These values and principles are incorporated in the essential rules of behaviour defined in the Groups Internal  Code of Conduct that commits Board members, employees and other staff to comply with them. In addition,  for specific areas of activity governing the quality of customer relations, there are governance Guidelines and  rules based upon the activation of processes that, by adopting models involving a high level of protection,  direct behaviour towards criteria of substantial good faith and fairness in the relationship. Customer health  and safety aspects are also monitored with policies that establish principles, rules of conduct and definition of  responsibilities in operational relations at the branch and also on the electronic channel. SERVICE QUALITY Intesa Sanpaolo has adopted a service model focused on business areas with an organisational structure that  ensures the monitoring of the national territory and in the foreign countries where it operates. The Divisions are  responsible for developing the best service quality levels through the various channels, in order to improve the  efficiency of the commercial products they offer to the various types of customers. Customer satisfaction and service quality are monitored and overseen by the structures that deal with customer  satisfaction and customer experience in the various business Divisions. With reference to Large Corporate Customers, in early 2017 the process of reorganisation of the Division that  oversees their business activities, was completed. This made it possible to develop in a more focused manner  its role as a global partner for balanced and sustainable growth of enterprises. This mission was implemented  with reference to highly complex customers with a multinational presence, and with a view to supporting the  internationalisation of Italian firms, through a specialised network of seven Territorial Areas and eleven Units  specialised in various industrial sectors, enabling an integrated offer of products and services. LISTENING TO RETAIL AND CORPORATE CUSTOMERS IN ITALY For the Banca dei Territori Division, the management model on this subject starts by holding dialogues with customers  right from the design stage of new products and services that suit their expectations: the feedback between the  customer and the Bank allows them to tune in with each other so as to identify and satisfy the needs over time. Attention to the customer is characterised:   by monitoring satisfaction and collecting opinions and suggestions to identify opportunities for improvement in  products and services and also in the forms of interaction with the Bank;   by an approach geared towards customer protection and satisfaction, measured by surveying the Net Promoter  Score (NPS) – the opinion that measures the propensity for recommending the Bank;   by the definition and monitoring of the KPIs for the quality provided in order to ensure customers an excellent level  of service and whose results (together with those of NPS) are published on the SEIok portal and contribute towards  the calculation of the 25% of the Variable Results Bonus of the branches and areas of the Banca dei Territori Division;   by the precise and prompt handling of complaints that discovers the causes of dissatisfaction and allows corrective  actions to be identified in order to reduce operational and reputational risks. The continuous improvement of products and services is defined by an articulated process with several steps, from  the analysis of customer needs through interviews and other methods, to the conception of new products and  services (concept testing and design thinking) and finally to the systematic surveying of customer satisfaction. Macro quality monitoring and measuring activities are preliminary to the creation of working group discussions  aimed at improving the quality of relations with the Bank. In particular, the main structured activities relate to the  SEIok programme, the dashboard that allows the monitoring of customer service quality; customer experience  surveys at the various stages of the life cycle of products and services and the listening to employees in the branch  network on the Bank's internal processes. The SEIok programme displays the monitoring results of the quality provided (approximately 30 indicators) and quality  perceived (Net Promoter Score) that determine the Branch Excellence index. The dashboard is based on four families of  indices to facilitate the identification of the areas for improvement: Operational Excellence which provides an indication  of compliance with the relevant rules on the conduct of the banking and brokerage business, management of conflicts   60 Society of interest, transparency and consumer protection regulations; Service Excellence indicating the efficiency and quality of  the service provided; Credit Excellence indicating the professionalism with which the Bank assists customers in situations  that are often difficult; the Net Promoter Score, which helps to assess to what extent the customer would recommend  the Bank to family and friends. In 2017 approximately 580,000 opinions and 190,000 comments were collected,  complying with the rule on contacting a customer no more than once every two months (if he/she does not give an  opinion) or six months (if he/she provides an opinion). The Branch Excellence Index (published in the SEIok Portal) is of significant importance also for the purposes of the  employee incentive system (see page 94) contributing towards the calculation of the 25% of the overall Variable  Results Bonus for the branch. In 2017, the results with respect to each family of indicators were as follows:   with regard to Operational Excellence, there was increased attention to the correct filing of contracts envisaged  by the regulations issued under MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) and ESMA (European Security  and Markets Authority);   as regards aspects of service Excellence, there was increased speed in providing replies to messages received via  internet banking and to calls to branches and also an increased attention to multichannel services;   in the area of Credit Excellence, some improvements were achieved for the prompt renewal of ratings and credit lines;   within the scope of NPS in branches, there was improved awareness on certain issues such as the welcome  provided in branches and assistance on the automatic channels (e.g. ATM, internet banking, App). The customer experience measuring model in customer operations resulted in 100 structured listening points where  customers were able to leave feedback on the quality of their experience. In 2017 more than 600,000 opinions and  over 150,000 comments were collected by activating new measurement channels that currently include emails,  internet banking, App or phone. Ad hoc surveys were then undertaken to respond to specific and momentary needs,  or to further investigate items raised during the ongoing surveys (8 surveys were conducted in 2017 involving 2  million customers and 125,000 completed questionnaires were collected). These results are considerable in relation  to the improvement activities performed as a result of the satisfaction/dissatisfaction comments that were collected,  as in the case of active surveys on the new internet banking site. The point of view of people who work in the branch network was enhanced in the context of the measurement  of customer experience. In 2017, 16 surveys were carried out with the involvement of 61,000 employees and  approximately 16,000 completed questionnaires were collected. The aim of the various strands of further investigation  was to analyse the different perceptions on service quality between customers and Bank workers; to measure the  direct experience of employees regarding the services they provided and to assess the suitability and usability of the  professional activity support tools available to them. NPS trends by customer type* 2017 2016 Retail 13.2 8.3 Personal 2.7 0.4 SME 20.2 17.6 * In 2015 the NPS data was not collected NET PROMOTER SCORE - NPS  It is an indicator that measures the propensity of customers to recommend a product, service or company. The NPS is based on a simple question to the customer to assess to what extent he/she would recommend  the Bank to a friend, relative or business partner (according to the interlocutor) On the basis of the opinion expressed, the respondents are divided into:    detractors: dissatisfied customers who could damage the company through negative word of mouth;   passives: satisfied but not loyal customers who may be affected by competition;    promoters: customers loyal to the company who recommend it to others. The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of  promoters. The result, however, is not expressed in percentage terms, but as an absolute number between  -100 and +100. Between the end of 2016 and throughout 2017, a number of meetings were held throughout  the country with the Sales Departments and the Area Managers where they discussed the kinds of behaviour,  identified in collaboration with the Network and with the Human Resources and Change Management  Department of the Banca dei Territori, that could improve the Net Promoter Score. The range of customers  involved was also increased thanks to the opening of the new measurement channel via internet banking.  61 Society LISTENING TO LARGE CORPORATE CUSTOMERS Customer satisfaction surveys are designed and conducted regularly on the basis of requests from the structures responsible  for products and services in order to identify the measures to be taken to improve the offer. Based on the evidence that has  emerged, the structures themselves establish their plans of actions and act in order to meet the highlighted needs. The results of the surveys are always shared with the relationship functions which, in their approach with the customers,  benefit from the information received and can act with greater awareness and attention to the customers needs. In 2017,  some new surveys were conducted which involved:   193 company representatives with a qualitative research conducted by telephone about payment card acceptance  products and services in order to understand to what extent the quality of service (processing of payment instruments)  has changed as a result of the reorganisation of activities due to the sale of Setefi to the Mercury Consortium. The  answers received amounted overall to 61%. The NPS index was 25.6 and the general satisfaction index (Customer  Satisfaction Index1) was 81.7 out of 100;   20 company representatives who all answered the quality survey via telephone on the new Liquidity Dashboard service  aimed at monitoring and managing liquidity on current accounts at Banks in the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, and at other  Banks. The survey provided a substantial contribution towards identifying the actions to be taken to improve quality of  service through the opinions of customers who took part in the initial experimental pilot phase;   273 representatives from customer companies in an online quantitative survey on the service offered by the Forex  Sales desk of Banca IMI in preparation for the introduction of a new electronic platform - the Single Dealer Platform.  The NPS index was 36.5;   773 company representatives were involved in a qualitative and quantitative survey using two contact methods  (telephone and online) about transaction banking products and services with a focus on cash management and trade  finance and with the aim of verifying the impact of the improvement actions taken and also the level of satisfaction  and areas of strength and weakness highlighted by the customers. The response rate was 27% (in particular 118 were  willing to be contacted again). The NPS index was 24.9. LISTENING TO CUSTOMERS IN THE INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARY BANKS Customer satisfaction measurement activities regarding Retail customers in the Groups International Subsidiary Banks  involved five banks (Banca Intesa Beograd in Serbia, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank in Slovenia, CIB Bank in Hungary, Privredna  Banka Zagreb in Croatia, VB Banka in Slovakia) with a specific focus on the multichannel offer and the service model, in  order to further investigate the role of consultancy in the sales process. Specific analyses were aimed at understanding the  perception of quality for certain significant credit products (mortgages and personal loans) and for the new branch model  opened in Banca Intesa Beograd. With reference to the benchmarking survey carried out between June and December 2017, approximately 8,000  interviews were conducted in the Group's main countries of operation. The survey results showed stable levels of  satisfaction with reference to the country's banking systems and also the individual banks. As for the small and medium-sized business customers, between the end of 2017 and the start of 2018 customer  satisfaction surveys were conducted in CIB Bank (Hungary), Banca Intesa Beograd (Serbia), Intesa Sanpaolo Bank  (Slovenia) and PBZ (Croatia) involving a total of about 2,200 companies. In all the projects, the support from the network  relationship managers was significant in the role of promoters of the customer listening topics. MANAGEMENT OF COMPLAINTS The Intesa Sanpaolo Group makes customers the focus of attention and is committed to develop an ongoing dialogue  with its customers in order to keep the relationship at a level of excellence. In this context fundamental importance is  attributed to complaints and other requests where customers express their dissatisfaction as their correct and prompt  assessment and handling:   can enable the Bank to overcome the reasons for dissatisfaction and safeguard the business relationship;   is a useful indicator of the service level, providing ideas for improving the offer and commercial processes and for  making some fine adjustments to the characteristics of specific products/services;   constitutes an element that contributes towards the assessment and management of operational and reputational  risks and, in particular, of non-compliance and conduct risks. The organisational, procedural and regulatory framework adopted in this regard by the Group is defined in  the Guidelines for managing complaints, disclaimers and protests to the Supervisory Authority and appeals to  alternative dispute resolution Bodies. The structure that handles complaints is obliged to ensure compliance with the maximum response times specified in the  regulations and differentiated according to the type of complaint: 30 days for those (ordinary) complaints on banking and  financial matters, 45 days for those relating to insurance products and 60 days for those relating to investment services. 1 Customer Satisfaction Index: the index was calculated using a structural equation model with latent variables, specifically the Partial Least Squares - Path modelling (in literature, known  as PLS-PM). The outputs of the model include the measurement, through a synthetic index, of the overall satisfaction level (CSI - Customer Satisfaction Index).  62 Society   Loans: they account for 51% of the total and show a decrease of 18%. This performance is due to the reduction  in applications brought by former customers of Accedo3 that, in relation to the early redemption of loans with  assignment of one-fifth of salary, are claiming the pro-rata refund of fees and/or charges paid at the time of  disbursement, and the similar contraction in disputes relating to the area of the Banca dei Territori Division,  mainly referring to the alleged usurious nature of the conditions and alleged illegitimacy of the compound  effects of interest capitalisation;   Issues on organisation, management and functionality of websites: these represented 16% of the total  and recorded an increase of 35%, mainly due to malfunctions, layout and usability of the new website,  as well as waiting times, queues in branches and, more generally, to behaviour by personnel perceived as  being inadequate. Conversely, the number of complaints decreased in relation to the failure and/or delayed  processing of requests for copies of documents;   Payment systems: they account for 13% of the total, with a slight reduction compared to the previous year.  Nearly half of the complaints relate to errors or delays in the execution of transactions, while 36% relate to fraud  – computer-fraud in particular – leading to customer disputes concerning charges against them;   Insurance products: these account for 11% of the total, up by 6%. About half of the applications recorded  by the Banca dei Territori Division refer to policies related to loans, in relation mainly to claims for refunds of  premiums for the early redemption of loans and issues associated with settling claims, while the applications  registered by the Companies are mainly related to the claims area (conduct of liquidators, settlement of  insurance benefits) and problems related to administrative aspects (customer service, timing and contents of  statements during the contractual relationship);   Current accounts, deposits and securities portfolios: they account for 6% of the total, an increase of 40%  mostly due to disputes relating to the proposal for a unilateral amendment of the contractual conditions,  sent to about 3 million customers in May 2017;   Investments: these account for 3% of the total and show a decrease of 6%. The most frequent causes of  complaints refer to the negative performance of the financial markets – which determined results not in line  with the expectations of investment, management and financial policy funds – and to errors and/or delays  in performing transactions. The data described above include 1,254 requests for clarification, made by the Supervisory Authority after  their receipt of protests lodged by customers and 3,583 claims to alternative dispute resolution Bodies.  In the course of 2017 a total of 48,498 applications were processed – also in the context of ADR procedures  for disputes – of which 14,821 have been accepted. The average processing time of complaints and response thereto concerning Italy, is on average lower than  the applicable reference regulatory provisions. Despite what is specified in the regulations, the Complaints Office has independently reduced the response time  limits to 25 days for ordinary and insurance complaints, in line with the constant objective of keeping performance  indices high when listening to customers. In October 2017, a project aimed at renewing and improving the com- plaints management model was also launched, by involving the other staff of the Complaints Office through focus  groups to identify and understand customer expectations based on their own experiences. With regard to Italy2, in 2017 53,707 complaints, appeals and protests were recorded, broken down as follows: 2 The perimeter includes the following companies: Intesa Sanpaolo, Network of Banks operating in Italy, Mediocredito Italiano, Banca5 (Banca dei Territori Division); Banca IMI (Corporate and Investment  Banking Division); Fideuram Intesa Sanpaolo Private Banking, Intesa Sanpaolo Private Banking, Sanpaolo Invest (Private Banking Division); Intesa Sanpaolo Vita, Intesa Sanpaolo Assicura, Intesa Sanpaolo Life,  Fideuram Vita (Insurance Division); Eurizon Capital SGR, Epsilon SGR, Eurizon Capital SA (Asset Management Division); Intesa Sanpaolo Provis, IMI Fondi Chiusi SGR (Capital Light Bank). 3 In February 2017 the Company was incorporated into Intesa Sanpaolo; as a result of this corporate action, Intesa Sanpaolo seamlessly replaced Accedo in all contractual income and expense  relationships and in particular in all loan agreements entered into by the latter. 50.6% Loans: 27,215 6.1% Current accounts, deposits  and securities portfolios: 3,315 3.4% Investments: 1,823 10.5% Insurance  products: 5,650 15.9% Organisational systems,  website, other: 8,457 13.5%Payment systems: 7,247  63 Society All banks registered a decrease in the number of instances received (an average of about 11%), with the exception of VB  Banka (+1%), Banca Intesa Russia (+5%) and Banca Intesa Beograd (+23%); with reference to the latter, the increase is mainly  due to malfunctions in the new management system for payment cards. The complaints, appeals and protests referring to the payment systems category represent, as in the previous year, the  primary source in numbers, with 51% of the total, and show a slight increase compared to 2016 (+2%). About half of those  applications, relating to VB Banka (Slovakia), are primarily motivated by ATM equipment malfunctions. Complaints relating to organisational and management issues and functionality of websites were particularly significant,  accounting for 20% of the total and up by 7% compared to 2016; they almost all concerned the Croatian subsidiary Privredna  Banka Zagreb and related mainly to service disruptions that customers encountered in accessing the remote banking channel. The number of applications regarding Current Accounts, Deposits and Securities Portfolios were limited (14% of the total),  whereas the proportion regarding Insurance products and Investments (2% of the total) was not significant, in line with the  related business at the individual subsidiaries. In the course of 2017 a total of 39,432 applications were processed - also in the context of ADR procedures for disputes - of  which 18,890 have been accepted. The average processing times of dossiers vary depending on the subsidiaries and are largely in line with the local laws and  regulations, where obligatory resolution deadlines exist. INNOVATION IN CUSTOMER RELATIONS An organisational structure dedicated to innovation continued to work to accelerate the Groups business  innovation capacity through the research, analysis, conception and promotion of solutions on the domestic  and international market capable of leading to new commercial opportunities and the development of the  local community and economy. The spread of a culture of innovation was also achieved with the help of a network of specialist representatives  who work in Regional Governance Centres and in some International Subsidiary Banks (Bank of Alexandria  in Egypt, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank in Slovenia, Privredna Banka Zagreb in Croatia and VB Banka in Slovakia).  In addition, in order to increase connections with the whole, across-the-board system of innovation,  certain partnerships with selected partners at a national and international level were also consolidated (e.g.  local authorities, companies, incubators, research centres and universities), which help to strengthen the  positioning of Intesa Sanpaolo in the various areas. Innovation also involved the redesigning of the main Bank processes starting with customers needs. This is  the aim of the Digital Factory, the specific structure that operated by transforming the processes designed by  the bank for the bank in a form of management prepared with the customers for the customers. The people involved in the Digital Factory come from corporate structures involved in transformation  processes and work full-time sharing not only a common objective, but also the physical space where  they work. In addition to speeding up analysis and production times, this helps to increase exchanges and  experiences and encourages the professional growth of the participants. The scope of the Digital Factory  has also been extended to the business development with the proposal of new digital products and services  in support of the Banca dei Territori, Corporate and Investment Banking and Insurance Divisions. In addition  to continuing the developments on processes started in 2016, seven new processes for the operational  network were redesigned in 2017 and five additional digitalisation processes were finally launched.   As regards the overall situation of the phenomenon abroad4 one should note that in 2017 40,426 complaints,  appeals and protests were recorded5. 4 The perimeter includes the following companies: Privredna Banka Zagreb - PBZ, VB Banka, CIB Bank, Banca Intesa Beograd - BIB, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Slovenia, Banca Intesa Russia, Bank  of Alexandria, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Romania, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Bosna i Hercegovina - BiH (International Subsidiary Banks Division); Intesa Sanpaolo Bank  Luxembourg, Foreign Branches (Corporate and Investment Banking Division); Pravex Bank (Capital Light Bank Division). 5 Compared to 2016, the figure also includes the applications recorded by Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Bosna i Hercegovina (331) and the Foreign Branches of Intesa Sanpaolo (19). 13.8% Loans: 5,559 0.9% Investments: 351 0.7% Insurance products: 285 13.6% Current accounts, deposits  and securities portfolios: 5,510 20.4% Organisational systems,  website, other: 8,269 50.6% Payment systems: 20,452  64 Society The number of operations that do not require copies printed on paper was expanded (see page 110), continuing  the path of dematerialisation of banking contracts. EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT Attention to the quality of the commercial offer also includes management change measures and new ways of  employee engagement in order to act effectively on developing customer relation procedures and spreading  the digital culture. The programme called Insieme per la Crescita 2.0 (Together for Growth) which involves approximately  38,000 network employees, aims to improve performance through greater attention to forms of behaviour,  both by increasing customer and employee satisfaction and by generating a pervasive and permanent change in  relationship management. In 2017 the programme evolved through a shared process with the employees of the  Network; the benchmark forms of behaviour in the approach with customers applied effectively in the branches  on a daily basis were also reviewed. To facilitate its adoption, they used the method of explaining the reasons  behind the proposed behaviour decisions and the reason concerning the processes of simplification.  The Insieme per la Crescita programme makes use of the work of the CRM function for the measurement  of customer satisfaction and directly measures employee satisfaction through the branch barometer (synthetic  barometer rating of 7.8, on a scale of 1 to 10, with over 247,000 questionnaires collected). The Vividigitale project aims to disseminate the digital culture among customers and staff. In this regard,  various formats were activated including 30 events organised in the branches on digital issues and meetings  on chats organised with the aim of spreading knowledge about the Banks new instruments. A total of 157  sessions were organised, 28 of which were directed at the 1,600 employees assisting in the integration of the  former Venetian Banks. Service quality also means offering customers the possibility to carry out transactions or to acquire/consult  information on a variety of channels: the 2014-2017 Business Plan emphasized the importance for Intesa  Sanpaolo of branding itself as a fully-integrated, multichannel bank. In 2017, its positioning in multichannel and digital banking was reinforced in line with market trends, with 6.9  million multichannel customers6 and 6 million Apps downloaded, assuming the position of leading digital bank in  Italy. This goal was also achieved through help from the new digital platform for Retail Customers who in 2017  were able to use the new internet banking. During the year, approximately one million My Key contracts were  activated. This new multichannel contract allows customers to automatically link up all the products and services  they own to the digital channels and to activate OkeySmart, the new OTP (One-Time Password) software that is  easier and safer than the physical password key and meets the requirements of the European directive on payment  services in the internal market (so-called PSD2 - Payments Service Directive 2). The new Intesa Sanpaolo Mobile  App has also been available since the beginning of 2017, which is used to manage daily banking needs with the  possibility of making card-less and emergency withdrawals (to have money withdrawn by a third party by sending  a simple code). In addition, in order to combat the use of cash and to make digital payments an increasing load- bearing pillar in the process of digitisation of the bank, some new mobile payment tools were introduced in Apps,  both with the use of cards and through accounts, such as PAyGO, Masterpass and JiffyPay which allow to be the  only bank to date in Italy, capable of offering its customers a single payment procedure for all their in-store and  online purchases (the same procedure was recently extended to three-dimensional online payments - 3DS). Within the international scope, the DigiCal (digital channels + physical branches) programme continued, geared  to strengthening the integration between the physical and the digital channels in order to provide Retail and Small  Business customers with a new way of accessing products and services and getting in contact with the Bank. The main results relate to the development in the CIB Bank (Hungary) of internet banking and digital ATM networks  with dematerialisation processes. In 2017, the Hungarian subsidiary had more than 140,000 online customers  (doubling the number of online customers in one year). In addition, in the market surveys that were conducted, the  CIB Bank Mobile App received the best Net Promoter Score (89.1) among the top seven Hungarian banks; 22% of  respondents use the App as their main channel for transactions with the Bank. Internet and mobile banking was  also introduced in PBZ – Privredna Banka Zagreb – Croatia also with the introduction of remote digital signatures in  contracts for the development of distance relationships. Among the customer relationship channels, branches continue to be for Intesa Sanpaolo the physical place in its  distribution network where customers can get personal support and assistance, particularly with regard to more complex  operations. The local branches are still more geared towards offering a focused, personalised and high value-added  service. There are 4,694 branches in Italy and 1,149 abroad7. Intesa Sanpaolos presence in the various regions of Italy is  significant, with market shares of at least 12% in most Italian regions. MULTICHANNEL APPROACH AND ACCESSIBILITY 6 Referring to Italy; it does not include Fideuram Intesa Sanpaolo Private Banking (about 593,000) and Banca 5 (about 27,000). 7 The data for branches in Italy and abroad include the branches arising from the acquisition of the former Venetian Banks (783 in Italy and 40 abroad).  65 FS14 Society The New Branch Layout project has produced a significant change in the place where customers are met: the  modular physical spaces put the accent on the welcome given, with areas to be shared together and the proposal  of artistic and cultural events. The new branch model, conceived in 2014 also through listening to customers,  was implemented in the following years and at the end of 2017 it was adopted in 118 branches. The experience  enjoyed by our customers in the new branches was the subject of a survey involving 233 branches and more  than 5,200 customers who appreciated the new layout as being elegant and modern. The suggested areas of  improvement concern the reception and waiting areas for which a project enhancement phase has been activated  to modify the furnishings and organisation to support the employees. The newly-conceived branches were the venues of the Sharing Ideas events for customers to share their stories,  ideas and projects and for the Bank to effectively become a Bank that takes part in the projects of households,  businesses and the local area. There were about 95 events and they managed to engage about 5,500 customers.  Inside the Milan Branch in Corso Vercelli, a Puro Gusto Autogrill store has been opened since September, a modern  coffee shop available to customers. At the end of 2017, Intesa Sanpaolo had a network of over 7,737 automatic teller machines (ATM, MTA e Self-service staff- assisted banking terminals)8 in Italy and over 2,600 ATMs abroad. During 2017, the former Veneto Banca and Popolare di  Vicenza ATMs migrated onto the platform of Intesa Sanpaolo. Customers are provided with a vast range of services from  withdrawals using all card types to account and card queries, mobile phone top-ups, payment of utility bills and taxes, the  setting up of SEPA bank transfers and the top-up of season tickets issued by the main local transport companies. The Online Branch is a remote interaction channel of the Bank in addition to the physical branches located  throughout the countries. With over 800 employees, it works through 11 operating points with online managers  and coordination staff. It also makes use of two outsourced operating points, employing a total of about 1,100  people. The Online Branch provides operational and commercial information help and relational support to  current and potential customers of all banks of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, also via chat, video chat, email and  social network channels. In their management of contacts, online managers can also conclude the sale of a new  product or service, by making the proposal through the remote offering procedures. The scope of application of  remote sales covers cards, loans, investments and protection. In order to extend access to services, Banca 5 (formerly Banca ITB) has been operational since 2017, the first online  bank in Italy to operate in the payment system sector and dedicated exclusively to a network of tobacco points of  sale. Banca 5 has about 20,700 customers which are owners of the tobacco points of sales distributed throughout  the country. During the year, it launched services for its Retail customers through the network of tobacco points  of sale by setting up 2,570 operating points which, in addition to traditional payment products, also offer support  services. The services provided are classified into three main macro areas: to individuals (postal and bank bill payment  slips, F24 tax forms, car tax, top-ups for phone cards and prepaid cards etc.), to businesses (e.g. collections by direct  debit) and owners of the non-captive points of sales (e.g. fees for current accounts and use of the terminal). PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY To allow visually impaired or blind people to withdraw cash, find out their current account balance or top-up  their mobile phone at an ATM, all the ATMs of branches in Italy are equipped with an interface featuring easy- to-read graphics making operations easier for the visually impaired, while blind people can listen to a voice guide  on approximately 5,700 machines with the use of ordinary headphones. This is a project that was developed in  cooperation with the Unione Italiana Ciechi (Italian Association for the Blind). Also as regards the International Subsidiary Banks, there is an ongoing commitment to make applications compliant  with WCAG 2.0 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) that has made them accessible to a larger number of  customers with disabilities. The monitoring over the accessibility and usability of buildings and services has led to the conclusion of the census of  5,800 operating points (consisting mainly of Retail, Personal, Business, Private and Corporate branches, detachments of  the various branch types, detached and company branches) out of a total of 6,029, verifying the usability of automated  equipment and accessibility of the various areas with the use of tactile paths for visually impaired and blind people.  On the Intesa Sanpaolo website you can find specific information on the accessibility of branches (see [i]).   In particular, there is information on the accessibility to our branches and self-service areas by wheelchair users;  one can also find out if there are accessible cashier desks with a cashier, accessible toilets, adequate space for  manoeuvring in corridors, tactile paths for the visually impaired and blind, lifts or lifting platforms or stair lifts to  connect the various floors. Intesa Sanpaolo has also been cooperating with the LIA Foundation (Libri Italiani Accessibili - Accessible Italian  Books), which has been working for years with the Associazione Italiana Editori and the Unione Italiana Ciechi  e Ipovedenti (Italian Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired), to extend the accessibility of its documents  published on the Internet and on the Intranet. 8 The ATM figures include the branches arising from the acquisition of the former Venetian Banks (659 in Italy) within the scope of the Banca dei Territori Division.  66 417-2; 417-3; EX FS15; CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY 103-2; MARKETING AND LABELLING 103-2; 417-2; 417-3; EX FS15 Society CUSTOMER PROTECTION AND RESPONSIBLE SALES TRANSPARENCY TO CUSTOMERS Intesa Sanpaolo intends to make the dissemination of information to its customers clearer and more comprehensible  in all stages of the relationship with the Bank, through simplicity of language, information transparency and alignment  of conditions within the various documents relating to the same product/service. The main offer documents, drawn  up according to requirements of clarity and understandability can be found in branches and also on the Bank's  website, under the Banking Transparency section [i], particularly with respect to Product and Service information  sheets, Specific Guides, and Information documents on the conditions offered to general customers. INVESTMENTS: ADVISORY SERVICE A system of specific rules has been introduced and is fully operational regarding the sale of banking, financial  and insurance products and services. In line with the first MiFID (issued in 2007) Intesa Sanpaolo has chosen to  offer the highest level of protection to its customers, i.e. the advisory service which provides personalised advice  allowing customers to make investment decisions that are consistent with their own financial profile; in this  sense, Recommended Portfolios are proposed resulting from a process of analysis which selects and combines  products and services offered by the Bank on the basis of their consistency with the market scenario and with  the customer risk profiles. In 2017, Intesa Sanpaolo launched a project in order to comply with the European directives and regulations with  regard to the protection of investors9, as from the beginning of 2018. Group Product Governance Guidelines  and specific Rules approved by the Board of Directors of Intesa Sanpaolo have been issued, aimed at meeting  the principles of enhanced investor protection (with formalities to be performed by intermediaries, adequate  training of staff responsible for the provision of investment services and more detailed information on costs,  charges and incentives of the products and services offered) and transparency about the trading that takes place  on the financial instrument markets. Among the projects consolidated in 2017 regarding advisory services, Valore Insieme represents a global offer  provided by the branch managers through an innovative relationship platform. It is aimed at those who are  looking for an exclusive relationship that combines innovative technology with ongoing professional support from  a dedicated relationship manager. The service covers various areas of need (Securities and Pension Assets, Real  Estate Assets, Protection and Security) connected by a transverse diagnostics section to ensure communication  and interaction between the various consultancy levels. The platform enables ongoing monitoring of the assets  and the relationship and offers personalised recommendations through new reports and an alert system that  ensures constant advisory protection over time. THE PROCESS OF COMPLIANCE CLEARING OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES New products and services marketed by Intesa Sanpaolo, as well as any changes to existing products and services,  are subject to prior verification of their compliance with the relevant legislation. Similarly, innovative projects  that launch new business or enter new markets, are assessed in advance to ensure their substantive and formal  compliance with internal and external regulations. Conformity assessments are carried out in accordance with  the principles of fairness and protection of interests of customers and also relate to the quality of the information  provided and the coherence of these services, products or transactions with the expectations of customers to  whom they are addressed. DIALOGUE WITH CONSUMER ASSOCIATIONS Intesa Sanpaolo has long been involved in open and constructive dialogue with all the nationally-recognised  Consumers Associations, listening to their requests and finalising collaboration with them on a project, technical  and operational level. In 2017, a meeting was held between the Banks Top Management and the heads of all the  Associations to establish relationship procedure, the ongoing and future plans and technical discussions on specific  categories of products/services. Work also continued throughout the year on permanent conciliation (see on the  Website Conciliation Agreement [i]) as a means of out-of-court solutions adopted and managed together with the  Consumer Associations. The conciliation procedure, which concerns products offered to retail customers (current accounts and linked  payment cards, mortgages and personal loans), is simple, free and fast, with maximum case resolution times of 60  days. Customers may decide to participate, at no cost and without compromising any other procedures they may  wish to take subsequently, in order to protect their own interests. In 2017, 17 new applications for permanent  conciliation were received. 9 Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) and Regulation 2014/600/EU (MiFIR), Regulation 2014/1286/EU (PRIIPs).  67 417-2; 416-2; MARKETING AND LABELLING 103-2; 417-2 Society ASSESSMENT BY THE ITALIAN COMPETITION AUTHORITY (AGCM) REGARDING THE OFFER   OF DIAMONDS Following an agreement with Diamond Private Investment (DPI), from October 2015 the Bank expanded its range  of products offered to customers with the offer of diamonds by introducing a solution for diversification with the  features of the so-called safe haven asset in which to allocate a marginal share of ones assets, with a long-term  investment horizon. The marketing process was based on the criteria of transparency, with safeguards that have  been progressively strengthened over time, including, inter alia, quality controls on diamonds and the fairness of  prices charged by DPI. The activity generated volumes of purchases mainly in 2016 and altogether the number of  customers who bought diamonds were about 8,000, for a total of more than 130 million euro. In 2017, the AGCM launched proceedings against companies that sell diamonds (including DPI) to assess conduct  in violation of the provisions on unfair trading. These proceedings were extended to intermediaries who worked  to highlight the services offered by those companies. At the conclusion of the assessment procedure, the AGCM  served notices of sanctions having ascertained alleged infringements of the Consumer Code in the conduct of  DPI and of the banking intermediaries to which the proceedings had been extended, on the grounds that – in  brief – they had provided a partial, deceptive and misleading representation of the characteristics of the diamond  purchases, methods of establishing prices – presented as a market price – and the performance of the diamond  market. The Authority imposed a fine of 3 million on Intesa Sanpaolo, lower than the initial determination of  3.5 million, because the Authority recognized the merit of the initiatives implemented by the Bank starting from  2016 to reinforce the safeguards of the offer process designed to ensure, in particular, the provision of correct  information to customers. Following the decision of the AGCM, the Bank paid the penalty amount and lodged an  appeal to the Lazio Regional Administrative Court to challenge the decision. In November 2017 the Bank terminated its partnership with DPI and ceased that trading, that had already been  suspended in October and initiated a process that provides for recognition to customers of the original cost  incurred for the purchase of the precious stones, and the withdrawal of the stones, in order to meet the customers  resale requirements in the event that, as a result of the illiquidity that has arisen on the market, these are not met  by DPI within a prescribed period of 30 days, as per the agreement. In January 2018, the Bank sent a notice to  customers possessing diamonds to emphasise the nature of the stones as durable goods, confirming, among other  things, its willingness to intervene directly as regards any realisation needs expressed by the customers and not  satisfied by DPI. As at 31 December 2017, the Bank had received 1,287 requests for resale of the diamonds, for a  total of 23.9 million.  68 CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY 103-2 Society CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY The cardinal principle behind the initiatives for the protection of branches and offices of the Group is the  safeguarding of the health and safety of all the people that work there or pass through. This principle is  implemented through operational rules and technological safety measures, supported by IT tools and the  dissemination of a health and safety culture. PHYSICAL SAFETY The analysis on the risks of robbery is constantly updated with the aim of improving safety systems and systematically  controlling the level of security of high risk sites. The number of robberies has been decreasing for several years and,  in particular, in 2017 only 15 events occurred in Italy: this is a very low figure and down by 28.6% compared with the  same period in the previous year. The relevant structures are working on models for the management of an emerging  risk: Cyber Physical Security, which does not solely relate to new technologies, but is based on a new approach  that moves us to rethink and redesign tools, systems and models in an integrated and more effective manner by  combining traditional aspects of physical protection in branches and the protection of operations over the web. As regards the International Subsidiary Banks, the Parent Company functions ensure guidance and support activities,  particularly in projects on the development of physical security and distribution models (e.g. extension of the new  layout model to the International Subsidiary Banks). CYBER SECURITY The Group considers the protection of information and the management of the related processes a matter of  strategic importance. IT security is governed by Guidelines for the protection of the interests and rights of customers  and employees. IT security management processes are included in the Integrated Internal Control System of the  Bank and involve structures and functions up to the highest level (such as the Board of Directors with supervision  by the Risks Committee, the Managing Director and CEO and the various Head Office Departments) with the  description and outlining of their responsibilities. The role of the Information Security Officer is defined in respect of the regulators and the supervisor ensuring the functional  coordination of the structures responsible for IT safety and business continuity of the Group Banks and companies. The IT security profile also relies on the dissemination of risk awareness, methods of prevention, importance of  processed data and the use of application procedures by all those involved (structures of the Bank, employees,  customers and suppliers). IT security tasks are carried out with a centralised management model for Italian Banks  and companies that have a high degree of integration with the Parent Company, and with a coordination and  control model for the other Group companies and the International Subsidiary Banks with common Guidelines  that are shared throughout the entire perimeter. Since the use of multichannel services is continually on the  increase, there is close attention on the prevention of fraud in the services available on the new channels. Intesa  Sanpaolo has consolidated a fraud prevention system for the Group's Italian banks and for some of its International  Subsidiary Banks that is capable of analysing in real time all the transactions carried out via Internet Banking and  identifying those that may be considered questionable so that they can be checked by a specialised unit. Constant monitoring of fraud resulted in the blocking of over 15 million euro in fraudulent transactions in 2017  for retail customers and nearly 24 million euro for corporate customers. All customers are informed about the standards of conduct for the correct and safe use of online tools. Security  monitoring along with Business Continuity solutions and Crisis Management mechanisms have confirmed the  effectiveness in managing events related to natural disasters and crisis events, allowing continuity of services and  the safeguarding and protection of employees and customers. The safeguards provided by Intesa Sanpaolo Group's CERT (Computer Emergency Readiness Team) were  consolidated in 2017. This team is an operating interface for critical events of a cyber nature regarding external  stakeholders. The Group's CERT is also operating on several fronts such as Cyber Threat Intelligence services,  internal (Banks and Group companies) and external (national CERT, CERTFin, other CERTs) information sharing  services and reports to the supervisory authorities in the event of serious IT security incidents. In terms of cyber security, the action programme has identified the lines of development in Intesa Sanpaolo's strategy  strongly focused on the challenges of the coming years: attention to the management of digital identity, the security  of third parties, the Dynamic Analysis of Risk, the areas of data protection, open banking, cloud evolution. Finally, as in previous years, the Bank continued to commit itself to obtaining and maintaining third-party  certifications for its own quality assurance, security and operational continuity activities and also for its appropriate  monitoring of the services provided (see [i]).  69 203-2; LOCAL COMMUNITIES 103-2; PRODUCT PORTFOLIO 103-2; FS7; ACCESS TO CREDIT AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION 103-2 Society Access to credit and financial inclusion COMPANY POLICIES Intesa Sanpaolo provides a range of products and services that promotes financial inclusion and access  to credit, in accordance with the Group's Code of Ethics that highlights, among the principles of  customer relations, the value of this policy as a key lever for social inclusion, enabling people to improve  their condition and to be able to exercise their rights of citizenship to the full. The Code of Ethics also  indicates the commitment of Intesa Sanpaolo in promoting economic and social development in the  country where it operates. In particular, this responsibility results in assisting companies in developing  and improving their competitiveness and in innovating and internationalising their business. The 2014-2017 Business Plan confirmed compliance with these principles by defining the goal of being  a real economy Bank for households and businesses. Credit management policies were defined in order  to develop and monitor the overall loan facilities and also to qualify the approach to customers by all  Banks and Companies of the Group. FINANCIAL INCLUSION OF VULNERABLE PEOPLE Support for vulnerable customers involves a number of projects and initiatives aimed at the fair allocation of re- sources by identifying actors within the territory with whom agreements and synergies can be developed that will  make access to credit easier for vulnerable individuals or those who would otherwise have no access to banking. In 2017, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group issued new loans for high social impact activities amounting to  over 4.5 billion euro (7.3% of the total new loans granted by the Group in 2017), helping to create  business and employment opportunities and also assisting people in difficulty through various procedures:  microfinance; anti-usury loans; products and services for associations and entities in the Third sector;  products dedicated to the most vulnerable social groups to support their financial inclusion; loans to  support populations hit by natural disasters. LOANS WITH SOCIAL IMPACT [% and thousands of euro] 1.43% Microfinance: 64,791 0.05% Anti-usury loans: 2,190 7.41% Loans to the   Third sector: 334,908 88.17% Products for vulnerable  social groups: 3,986,636 2.94% Support to people affected   by disaster events: 133,168  70 Society BANK THE UNBANKED Bank of Alexandria, with its Bank the Unbanked project has developed several products dedicated to individuals  who would have no access to banking, to improve their living and working conditions in the poorest areas of  the country. These products are structured within a single programme which includes:   micro-finance to meet different customer needs and to create small businesses. In 2017, financing was  offered to individuals with micro-activities, conducted without commercial or fiscal documentation  (informal sector), and from November onwards this was supported by loans to micro-enterprises operating  in the formal sector. At the end of 2017, almost 69,000 customers had access to these loans totalling  about 35 million euro.   micro-deposits at advantageous rates to encourage the culture of saving among disadvantaged social  groups (over 700 accounts opened for a total amount of almost 177,000 euro). The offer also includes a platform for smartphones (MA7FAZTY Mobile Wallet), which allows users to  perform normal banking transactions in a simple and secure manner. Users of the Mobile Wallet are  over 48,400 and 25.3% of these use it on an ongoing basis. MICROFINANCE AND THE FIGHT AGAINST USURY There are a number of active collaborative projects with mainly philanthropic or religious entities, for providing  credit to individuals or small companies in difficulty. Altogether, in 2017 the Group disbursed almost 67 million  euro in microcredit or anti-usury projects, in Italy and abroad. A few significant examples are described below. Since 2010 the Group has been involved in the Prestito della Speranza project, promoted by the Italian Episcopal  Conference (CEI) and the Italian Banking Association (ABI) to assist families in temporary difficulties through the  support of micro and small start-ups. In 2015 the offer was renewed exclusively with the CEI, with the aim of  disbursing 100 million euro of loans – guaranteed by a 25 million euro CEI fund entrusted to Banca Prossima  – through the diocesan Caritas network and with assistance from VoBIS-Volontari Bancari per le Iniziative nel  Sociale (an association of volunteer ex-bank employees which operates throughout Italy whose aims are strictly  based on social welfare and solidarity). Prestito della Speranza has two specific areas of focus: life choice projects  and entrepreneurship projects for young people and start-ups. The initiative is structured either as a Social Loan  (Credito Sociale) to families up to a maximum amount of 7,500 euro, disbursed in 6 bi-monthly instalments of  1,250 euro as an income top-up; or as a Business-builder loan (Credito fare impresa) to micro-enterprises which  are either new or have a low capital base, with the provision of a single disbursement loan of up to a maximum of  25,000 euro. At the end of 2017, total lending in the latest version of the Prestito della Speranza, i.e. since March  2015, was 37 million euro, of which approximately 11 million disbursed in 2017 for more than 1,400 loans. The risks inherent in this business are credit risks – previous versions of the Prestito della Speranza had produced  double-digit default rates – and operating risks; the latter are mainly related to the possibility that any non- compliance with the process for the enforcement of guarantees makes the latter more difficult to collect with  consequent difficulties for the operating manager. The exclusivity attributed to Intesa Sanpaolo, obtained in 2015,  increased the controllability and reduced the extent of these risks. The mechanism for providing a guarantee fund with Banca Prossima, by a generally philanthropic or religious  institution, associated with an agreement with Intesa Sanpaolo, for providing credit to individuals or small  companies in difficulty, has been replicated with a series of counterparties. Significant initiatives include Intesa  Sanpaolos participation as partner to Fondazione Lombarda Antiusura and Fondazione Welfare Ambrosiano. The  partnership with the Fondazione Welfare Ambrosiano – an entity financed by the Municipality of Milan, involving  also the Fondazione Lombarda Antiusura – has made it possible to disburse, since the beginning of operations in  2011, a total of about 3.5 million euro of which about 60% by Intesa Sanpaolo, especially regarding social credit.  The initiative entails support for micro-finance initiatives both of a social nature to provide income support for  families, and of a business nature, for the creation of micro and small enterprises. The catchment area is essentially  the Milan area and Intesa Sanpaolo is one of the four financial partners involved. An agreement was made with the Societ Nazionale di Mutuo Soccorso Cesare Pozzo in October 2016 through  which this institution secured a guarantee of 3 million euro, using part of its assets under administration with  Banca Prossima, and granted 40 loans to its members  for household (school or health) expenses at very favourable  terms, totalling a little less than 200 thousand euro. Lastly, there are a few other ongoing agreements for credit inclusion of disadvantaged persons or small companies;  in particular there is one again with the Fondazione Lombarda Antiusura (in collaboration with Caritas Ambrosiana  and Fondazione Cariplo), one with the Finetica Onlus and one with NEETwork for offering free training placements  provided by non-profit organisations.  71 Society NATURAL CATASTROPHES AND DISASTERS The Intesa Sanpaolo Group confirmed its concrete and tangible commitment supporting families and businesses  affected by earthquakes or environmental disasters that occurred in Italy (earthquake in Central Italy, extraordinary  weather events in the Triveneto area, earthquake in Ischia, floods in Livorno and floods in the provinces of Parma,  Reggio Emilia and Modena) providing new subsidised loans intended for the restoration of damaged properties  (houses, shops, offices, artisan workshops, companies), suspensions on existing loans, actions in the area of  protection and preferential, simplified and expedited procedures. At the end of 2017, the Intesa Group had  disbursed more than 133 million euro for more than 2,500 requests; the suspended repayments of outstanding  loans were more than 1,300. In particular, in connection with the ongoing emergency situation in areas of Central  Italy affected by the earthquakes in 2016 and 2017, a total sum of 20 million euro was allocated for the unilateral  remission of mortgages on primary residences for properties that were destroyed or are totally inaccessible, in  order to provide further help to the populations in those territories. The management of these cases involved  more than 100 branches of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group in collecting the necessary documentation and applications  for access to the benefits of the initiative, the Regional Governance Centres of the areas involved and also other  professionals needed to define and manage the risks involved, the most important of which was operational risk. SUPPORT TO HOUSEHOLDS Intesa Sanpaolo participates in the Guarantee Fund for Main Home Purchases, established by the 2014 Stability  Law to facilitate access to credit by households for the purchase of and energy efficiency improvements to their  main residence. Thanks to the Memorandum of Understanding between ABI and the Ministry of Economy and  Finance, the beneficiaries – mostly young couples, single-parent families with minor children, young people under  the age of 35 who hold an atypical employment contract and tenants of public housing owned by the Istituto  Autonomo Case Popolari (Social Housing Authority) – can get a guarantee on the principal amount of their loan  (up to 50%). In 2017, 3,200 mortgages were disbursed, totalling 350 million euro (in 2016, disbursed mortgages  numbered almost 1,200 for a value of about 161 million euro). Support for households was also reflected with the renegotiation of mortgages: more than 40,700 in 2017, and  over 3,400 suspensions (3,250 in 2016) defined as a result of system agreements and for providing support to  households affected by natural disasters. OFFER FOR YOUNG CUSTOMERS The renewed and expanded range of mortgages includes Mutuo Giovani, with new solutions that enhance  the flexibility of the product on offer to the under-35s, including atypical workers or those with contracts  providing increasing safeguards, to facilitate the purchase of their first homes covering up to 100% of the  value of the property and with a duration of up to 40 years. Mutuo Giovani allows borrowers for an initial  period of ten years to pay a lower instalment covering interest only, with the possibility of suspending  the payment of instalments or to extend or shorten the duration. Altogether nearly 2.5 billion euro was  disbursed to nearly 22,000 young people (also in 2016, more than 2.5 billion was disbursed). Young people were also given the opportunity of using the XTE Prestito con Lode, whose aim is to promote  access to study. The requirements for obtaining this loan rely solely on academic merit and regularity,  without any personal guarantees and irrespective of the family income. In 2017 the Bank continued to  develop a capillary action for the promotion of the product at major Italian universities. This action was  extended to Senior Vocational Training Organisations, operating in the public and private sectors, in order to  achieve the full potential for supporting the development of younger generations and the financial inclusion  of capable and deserving individuals. More than 7.8 million euro were granted in 2017 (596 new loans).  The range of products in XME Conto also includes a flexible current account with advantageous conditions  for the under 30s. In addition to the seven euro discount on the offer chosen by the customer, further  benefits are included such as zero commission fees on ATM withdrawals at other banks around the world,  zero commission fees for online transfers and government duty stamps up to the age of 30 years if it is a  single account. At the end of 2017, holders of the XME Conto under 30s account numbered over 238,000.  72 EX FS16 Society REMITTANCE MANAGEMENT Immigrants represent an important share of Intesa Sanpaolos customers: at the end of 2017 they numbered  1.2 million (compared to 1 million in 2016). The offer of money transfer services includes three modules that are  complementary with each other which make the range complete and competitive: GetMoney to Family, which  allows money to be sent to the main countries of origin of migrants, through partnership agreements signed with  local banks; Express to Family, which allows the transfer of money to Intesa Sanpaolo Group banks in Albania,  Egypt, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine; Money Transfer Western Union, which through its widespread agent network  allows money to be received anywhere in the world. In 2017 almost 118,000 remittances were executed amounting  to almost 57.4 million euro. In 2017, over 100,000 transfers were executed through Western Union amounting to  about 30 million euro. ACTIVITIES AIMED AT THE THIRD SECTOR The Third sector is a significant part of the Italian economy and society and Intesa Sanpaolo has long recognised  the importance of this by providing Third sector organisations and the religious world with services, mainly through  Banca Prossima. At the end of 2017, Banca Prossima had about 62,000 customers, direct and indirect deposits  of nearly 6 billion, of which 3.5 billion in direct deposits and about 1.8 billion in loans. Specific models were  developed for customers of the Third sector that take into account the fact that intangible assets of these entities  play an important and specific part in making their long-term financial exposure sustainable. These models were  integrated into a variant of the Groups rating process that better suits the characteristics of customers from the  non-profit and religious sectors, particularly with respect to the qualitative part. Lastly, ensuring support for the  entities in the Third sector, Banca Prossima set up a Fund by statute for the development of social enterprises which  is attributed every year at least 50% of the profits that remain after allocations to legal and statutory reserves and  the reconstitution of the share premium reserve, initially used to set up the Fund. As a result of this instrument,  about 1,000 entities with ratings below the minimum level required by the Group for access to credit, were given  loans with a default rate of below 10%. CROWDFUNDING PLATFORMS For Funding is the crowdfunding donation platform of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group aimed at large organisations,  non-profit associations and foundations which want to launch a fundraising campaign with the participation of  a wider donor community.  There is a limited number of fundraising initiatives on the platform and they are guaranteed through selection by  the Intesa Sanpaolo team in order to develop solely the most deserving projects and not to waste the donations  given: there is an assessment of the beneficiary organisation and also the type of projects.  Once a project is published online, donors may contribute to the fundraiser with a donation through the  website, by credit card or by online bank transfer (Pago Online, My Bank and Home Banking), or with a bank  transfer via ones own bank or through any Intesa Sanpaolo branch. Transactions are performed without any  fees borne by the donor or the beneficiary.  In addition to the digital platform, the project also involves Social Ambassadors: these are specific contact persons  at bank branches in charge of social issues and their dissemination in order to create a positive relationship  with potential donors. There are approximately 900 employees whose remit on behalf of Intesa Sanpaolo is to  generate widespread awareness of the importance of social projects. The platform was launched in September 2017 with projects for UNICEF, Fondazione Bambino Ges and  Fondazione Gruppo Ospedaliero San Donato. Subsequently, the following entities also joined: Banco Alimentare,  Comocuore Onlus and Famiglie SMA – Genitori per la Ricerca sullAtrofia Muscolare Spinale. This initiative is supported by Terzo Valore, the portal developed by Banca Prossima that enables non-profit  organisations to finance themselves by appealing to communities of supporters who grant them resources by  way of debt. Terzo Valore is characterised by a guarantee mechanism that was prepared for the lenders: Banca  Prossima provides a line of credit that can be activated if the non-profit organisation has difficulty in returning  the resources provided. Via the website [i], supporters can underwrite part of the loan at a rate of their choice  that is below a maximum level indicated by the organisation itself. In fact, about 50% of lenders lend at zero  interest. Since the beginning of operations in 2011 to the end of 2017, Terzo Valore has accepted about 100  projects submitted through the website. 95 have been completed (of which 9 in 2017), for a total of 10.75  million euro disbursed by Banca Prossima and a further 8.1 million by third parties (the total value of the projects  involved was over 20 million). In 2017, these figures amounted to 970 thousand and 820 thousand euro.  73 EX FS16 Society MUSEO DEL RISPARMIO (SAVINGS MUSEUM) The Savings Museum is a multimedia and interactive workshop set up in 2012 at the initiative of Intesa  Sanpaolo. Dedicated to families, adults and children, it aims to explain the concepts of savings and investment  in a clear and simple language. A few new financial education projects and contents were developed in 2017,  paying particular attention to the most vulnerable groups of the population, including:   the project called Arianna. Il Filo della Finanza, aimed at helping to overcome the gender gap in terms  of financial matters. Within the scope of this project a number of events were held: a conference on  Donne e denaro. Una relazione complicata, the exhibition called Quel genio di mia nonna. Dai libri  di casa al kakebo. and a research study on Le donne e la gestione del risparmio;   the Welcom-ED project, developed in collaboration with the University of Turin and the Equal Opportunities  Department of the City of Turin and aimed specifically at the segment of migrants. The initiative includes  providing educational workshops on basic concepts of financial planning and savings, to be administered  through the Centres for Adult Education (CPIA) and local associations (e.g. Gruppo Abele and Almaterra);   the LEI project, in partnership with the Compagnia di Sanpaolo, Casa Circondariale di Torino (Turin prison)  and the cooperatives working there, offering the female prisoners a training programme and internship  and encourage their gradual reintegration into society once released from prison, with special attention  on education towards conscious money management. The relationship with schools of all levels has also been consolidated with the following initiatives  reserved for students:   the project called MOney LEarning, carried out with the support of the European Investment Bank and  Fondazione Scuola della Compagnia di Sanpaolo, which involved about 1,800 primary school children  from Piedmont in an educational project on the history and evolution of coinage held at the Museum;   the Campus di Educazione Finanziaria e Imprenditoriale Fuoriclasse della Scuola organised by the  Museum for the 50 winning pupils in the National Olympics for Schools, held annually by the Italian  Ministry of Education and Research;   the third edition of the Festival called Il mio posto nel mondo (My place in the world) was dedicated  to about 600 secondary school pupils, who were able to listen to testimonies by personalities from various  professional and training fields to encourage discussions on the importance of investing in human capital. The Museum also signed up to the Alternanza Scuola Lavoro work-study project promoted by Intesa  Sanpaolo and LUISS Guido Carli – Libera Universit Internazionale degli Studi Sociali, providing a selection  of contents on issues regarding major financial crises, entrepreneurship and the role of financial institutions. Partnerships were also entered into including:   the Economic Awareness Protocol, with the Regional Education Office, INPS, Inland Revenue Agency,  Bank of Italy, Foundation for Financial Education and Savings and the Finance Committee of Turin, for the  joint implementation of economic and financial training programmes for teachers;   a Memorandum of Cooperation with the Italian Network of Adult Education (RIDAP) for the development  of financial education content for adults. Among the most significant events promoted in 2017 there is Arte del Risparmio (Art of Saving), a week of events  to celebrate the World Savings Day (31 October) that has been enhanced with the cooperation of the International  Subsidiary Banks and the Gallerie dItalia. The International Subsidiary Banks participate in this event by organising  local financial education workshops for schools in the countries where they operate. More than 7,200 pupils have  been involved in numerous initiatives led by over 200 employees acting as Ambassadors for financial education. In 2017, a number of new information materials and teaching aids were developed such as the pocket-money  guide Paghetta&CO, a brochure called LABC del Risparmiatore (The Savers ABC) prepared on the occasion  of the World Investor Week and the eBook called Le parole del Rischio (Risk Words). FINANCIAL EDUCATION Intesa Sanpaolo is committed to spreading knowledge of economic and financial issues, especially among the  younger generations and since the school year 2008-2009, together with the Osservatorio Permanente Giovani- Editori, it has promoted the project Financial culture at school: getting ready to make choices renamed Young  Factor. The project intends to encourage the spread of the economic-financial culture among young people,  providing them with useful information support tools to help them make informed choices about their future  and to foster the creation of responsible citizens. Now in its tenth year, it provides a path of financial education  for senior secondary school pupils by involving a nationally-based network of 2,800 schools, 7,600 teachers and  500,000 students mostly in the last two years of school (the figures refer to the school year 2016-2017).  74 EX FS16 Society SUPPORT TO PRODUCTION Intesa Sanpaolo offers simple, thorough solutions in line with the various business needs to manage daily operations  as well as solutions dedicated to raising the value of customer companies in the various sectors of activity. The  marketing structures develop a range of products and services for different types of customers, working with the  Planning and Management Control function in the definition of commercial plans. Worthy businesses with valid projects are also supported in times of difficulty with assistance in the creation of  innovative solutions for restructuring and revitalisation.  In 2017, by promptly identifying the early signs of tension, it was possible to bring approximately 21,000 Italian  companies back to performing-loan status (over 73,000 since 2014) from their non-performing loan positions  (loans of approximately 1.7 billion euro). In line with the 2014-2017 Business Plan, Intesa Sanpaolo continued  to support the development of the real economy and of the communities in which the Group operates. In 2017,  Intesa Sanpaolo allocated about 63 billion euro to new medium-long term loans in the real economy (around 50  billion in Italy, an increase of 2.6% compared to 2016). Of the total amount, 43 billion euro (+4.4% compared to  2016) were disbursed to households and SMEs. Supervision over the management and control of risks, according to the responsibilities of Corporate Bodies,  is entrusted to the coordinated action of the Chief Risk Officer as regards risk management and Chief Lending  Officer as regards the assumption and management of the Groups credit risk, reporting directly to the Chief  Executive Officer. These areas of centralised responsibility support the business structures and the other functions  involved in the credit process in order to make the activity of granting, managing and controlling credit as efficient  and effective as possible. For the activity of providing credit and finance, there are various forms of coordination  – with specific reference standards on powers, criteria for granting and managing loans and detailed operating  Guidelines – that allow Intesa Sanpaolo to exercise an active policy-making and support role. In particular, there  are set Group policies for granting and managing credit based on the formulation of a rating, which represents a  summarised assessment of risks. Also thanks to its long-term collaboration with Confindustria Piccola Industria, Intesa Sanpaolo has developed an  innovative rating model, validated by the ECB, which, together with the usual economic and financial assessment,  also assigns value to intangible qualitative factors, in terms of easier access to credit and more favourable financial  terms and conditions. These include trademarks, patents, quality and environmental certifications, research and  development, innovation and digitisation, development and competitive positioning projects, management of  business risk, ownership and management, as well as membership of a chain. For customers with higher risk levels  and greater difficulty in gaining access to credit, the new model has led to an increase in their ratings in 37% of cases. FINANCIAL EDUCATION TRAINING INITIATIVES WITH CONSUMERS The project Mettere in comune competenze (skills pooling), launched in 2011, aims to improve mutual knowledge  and collaboration skills to the benefit of customers and consumers. The project is divided into four activity sectors:  training of Consumer Associations middle managers; development of a training plan targeted at all Intesa Sanpaolo  employees; initiatives for the training and information of the local structures of the Associations; meetings with  Intesa Sanpaolo Group Top management and middle and junior managers of the Associations to combine skills  and proposals in the main operating areas. During 2017, after the commitments in recent years in Piedmont and  Lombardy, the project on financial education training for regional managers of Consumer Associations came to  Campania with the running of six training days involving all 20 Associations belonging to the CNCU (National  Council of Consumers and Users) with an average participation of two representatives per association.  75 Society SVILUPPO FILIERE (PRODUCTION CHAIN DEVELOPMENT) The Italian entrepreneurial network is built around a large and complex network of small and medium-sized  enterprises organised into supply chain systems, often with strong relationships at a local level. Behind the  large companies making Italian products, there are small and very small companies that precisely because of  their modest size, often have great difficulties in getting access to credit. This particular characteristic led to  the development of the Programma Sviluppo Filiere (Production Chain Development Programme), a project  aimed at helping manufacturing companies of excellence to grow, thanks to a new and innovative model of  collaboration between the Bank and the Lead Company. The Programme is based on three pillars:   Risk: by integrating industrial information into the risk assessment systems;   Credit: by building estimating logics for a Supply Chain Ceiling thanks to better understanding of the  actual financial requirements;   Commercial offer: by creating packages of products and services dedicated to covering the needs of the  actors in the Supply Chain. Created with the objective of facilitating access to credit, the initiative has enjoyed considerable development: at  the end of 2017 lead companies participating in Sviluppo Filiere exceeded a total number of 500 with potentially  15 thousand suppliers, for a turover of over 70 billion euro and a workforce of 91 thousand employees. SUPPORT TO NEW BUSINESSES Finanziamento Microcredito Imprenditoriale (business microcredit financing) is dedicated to young people  and micro-enterprises in order to help them launch a new business or invest in growth projects offering  them access to credit even without real collateral. This opportunity was made possible by a special section  of the Guarantee Fund for small and medium-sized enterprises established by the Decree of the Ministry of  Economic Development dated18 March 2015. The medium/long-term loan, with a maximum duration of  7 years and a maximum amount of 25,000 euro, is functional to the purchase of capital goods (including  raw materials) or services for the business activity (including leasing fees), to pay salaries to new employees  or working partners, to pay training courses to improve professional quality and technical and managerial  skills. Over 800 loans for a total of almost 18 million euro were disbursed in 2017. BUSINESS SUPPORT AGREEMENTS The 2015 Credit Agreement, signed on 31 March 2015 by ABI and the main trade associations and with validity  until 31 July 2018, includes initiatives for access to credit which are directed at:    Recovering companies, with the possibility for all SMEs \"with performing status\" to suspend principal payments  on their loans for a maximum of twelve months and extend the amortisation schedules of their mortgages and  due dates of short-term loans and loans for farming activities;   Developing companies, in support of the entrepreneurial projects of SMEs;    Companies and the Public Administration, for the factoring of company receivables due from the Public Administration. In 2017, payment suspensions of loan instalments continued and 582 applications were accepted (since 2015 there  has been a total of more than 4,400), for a total residual debt of 289 million euro and 26 million euro in extended  debt. From 2015 to December 2017, Intesa Sanpaolo disbursed 976 loans through the initiative for developing  companies, for a total of 372 million euro. The factoring of company receivables due from the Public Administration  allowed the provision of 93 loans for the same period amounting to 3.3 million euro. Within the framework of the Industria 4.0 National Plan, new sectoral agreements were entered into for supporting  and fostering innovation processes, investment in new technologies and the digitisation of businesses. In 2017, the  new agreement with Confindustria Piccola Industria also entered in full swing. This project called Progettare il Futuro  Accelerazione, trasformazione digitale, competitivit – (Planning the Future - Acceleration, digital transformation,  competitiveness) aims to understand and accompany companies as effectively as possible, working systematically  with the organisations which represent them. The programme enabled the allocation of 90 billion euro to four  growth levers within the Italian industrial sector: ecosystems of enterprises and business integration, finance for  growth, human capital and new businesses.  76 Society SERVICES FOR CORPORATE WELFARE By extending its offer outside the traditional perimeter of banking and insurance products, the Group provides the  Welfare Hub service, launched in October 2017, for managing corporate welfare programmes. Through access to  a digital, multi-channel and multimedia platform (via PCs, tablets and smartphones), companies can grant their  employees goods and services for the exercise of their welfare credit (a performance bonus converted into Flexible  Benefits upon request from the employee or premiums paid by the company already in that form). Welfare Hub allows  company employees to find out about opportunities offered by tax laws and make a conscious choice about opting  for the Flexible Benefits. The employees of customer companies can also access six different financial and insurance  product areas, from health to welfare, from loans to insurance policies, from loans to young people to covering risks. OFFER FOR WOMENS ENTREPRENEURSHIP The Business Gemma programme made available a long-term total of 600 million euro in credit lines for women's  enterprises and for self-employed women from 2014 to 2017. In 2017, 420 loans were disbursed for a total of 16.3  million euro. The initiative also offers the chance to freely benefit from the special segment guarantee of the SMEs  Guarantee Fund dedicated to businesses run by women and to request, during the repayment period, a suspension  of up to twelve months on the principal amount within the repayment instalments of the loan in the event of  maternity leave, serious illness (also of the spouse or children) or disabling illness of a parent, blood relative or relative  by marriage up to the third degree who lives with the applicant. Business Gemma services also include an insurance  policy that offers insurance cover and welfare services aimed at addressing the problems of balancing private and  professional life. The areas of action covered are: health, maternity, assistance, help and legal protection in times of  difficulty in the private life of the businesswoman. The new policies underwritten during 2017 were 69. With regard to the International Subsidiary Banks, Banca Intesa Beograd, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania and Privredna  Banka Zagreb continued with their initiatives dedicated to womens entrepreneurship initiated through the partnership  with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) under the Women in Business programme. The programme, which aims to support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises run by women in the Western  Balkans, has three components: subsidised loans, technical advisory services offered by EBRD for banking institution  partners and the extension of know-how for women benefiting from the initiative. Altogether in 2017, 408 new  customers benefited from this subsidised borrowing. A major contribution was provided by Banca Intesa Beograd  which in 2017 disbursed more than three million euro in subsidised loans to 368 new customers. With regard to training activities, the three Banks involved have organised various initiatives and workshops: in  the case of Privredna Banka Zagreb, in addition to activities carried out on Croatian territory, a market study was  conducted by a company of business consultants specialised in female entrepreneurship training; in addition,  employees specialised in the commercial offer to the SME segment also took part in specific training. As regards  Serbia, four workshops were organised dedicated to the topic of women's leadership which was attended by  100 women entrepreneurs. Lastly, Bank of Alexandria signed a memorandum with the National Council for Women that marked the Bank's  commitment to develop financial and non-financial services to support women's entrepreneurship, also to  encourage the use of products through simplified access processes and usable in the fringe areas. LOANS AND SERVICES FOR COMPANIES INVESTING IN INNOVATION For many years Intesa Sanpaolo has provided a wide range of actions to support companies investing in innovation and  research. As regards loans, Nova+ supplements the traditional creditworthiness analysis with a technical and business  assessment of the investment plans, conducted by a team of engineers specialised in the various product sectors with  the cooperation of prestigious Italian universities. The financed projects in 2017 numbered 34 for approximately 32  million euro. Overall, the number of projects financed in the period 2014-2017 were over 230 with a total disbursement  WOMAN VALUE COMPANY AWARD In support of gender equality and the enhancement of the role of women in the business world, Intesa San- paolo promoted a number of initiatives and sponsors some important awards. In particular, with the Marisa  Bellisario Foundation, the Women Value Company – Intesa Sanpaolo award was established in 2017.  Now in its second year for 2018, the award is dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises that have  implemented concrete and innovative policies and strategies to guarantee men and women have equal  opportunities and equal career recognition.  77 Society of about 280 million euro. In 2017 the Nova+ range was further implemented to enhance the Industria 4.0 plan as  effectively as possible by supporting business investment in line with the relevant public subsidies. Innovation is also promoted with the international acceleration programme, Intesa Sanpaolo Start-Up Initiative [i], which  selects the most promising high-tech start-ups and prepares them to face the market and introduces them to the  actors of the innovation ecosystem. The best start-ups are presented at specific events (Arena Meetings): 8 events  were held nationally in 2017 (social ventures; biotechnologies; health technologies; agri-food; transport; utilities;  industrial bio-economy; industry 4.0) and 6 Investor Arena Meetings were held internationally (Circular Economy,  Fashion and Design, Life Sciences, Circular Economy for Food in London; Hardware in Hong Kong; Fashion in New  York). Overall in 2017 more than 160 start-ups were formed, of which 100 were presented to about 1,300 guests,  investors (Fondi di Seed/VC e Angel Investors), customer companies and players in the innovation eco-system. In order to promote interaction between start-ups, tech SMEs and companies, by facilitating the meeting between  supply and demand, Intesa Sanpaolo has launched a number of partnerships and collaborations since 2015 to  provide digital platforms for business matching. Tech-Marketplace [i] promotes interaction between start-ups, tech  SMEs and businesses, helping to match the supply and demand of technological innovation with the aim of fostering  business agreements and acquisitions. With regard to businesses, it supports the exploration of technologies and new  solutions for their business challenges. At the end of 2017, the platform had over 4,600 Businesses (representing the  demand side) and over 980 profiles of start-ups and tech SMEs technology suppliers, divided into about ten different  sectors including energy, software, telecommunications, transport, agri-food and fashion.  78 EX FS1; EX FS2; ACTIVE OWNERSHIP 103-2/103-3; EX FS12; RESPONSIBLE SAVING MANAGEMENT 103-2 Society Responsible asset management COMPANY POLICIES Asset management is central to the activities of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group and takes advantage of  organisational structures in business areas that use their expertise to supervise asset management,  private banking and protection requirements with financial and insurance products and services.   The offer has been gradually expanded to meet the diversification requirements of customer portfolios  according to a needs-based approach (spending, reserves, investment and pension) and according to  the specific allocation objectives. The activity is aimed at the development of financial and insurance products and advisory services to  meet the welfare and protection needs of families also in the long term. Guidelines and Rules for the  marketing of financial products clearly explain the obligation of operators to act in a transparent, fair  and diligent way in the provision of investment services, as required by the applicable legislation. In the Group's Code of Ethics, within the framework of the principles of conduct with customers, the  attention in asset management aims to offer growing importance in the assessment of investments, to  social and environmental criteria and those relating to sound governance in order to promote balanced  and sustainable development. With this in mind, the portfolio of offers includes available funds that  apply selection criteria in compliance with the Principles for Responsible Investment, also with the aim  of activating sustainability dynamics in businesses and customer choices. Eurizon Capital has signed  up to the Italian Stewardship Principles which define the procedures for exercising administrative and  voting rights in listed companies to stimulate discussions and cooperation with listed issuers in which  the company invests on issues of social and environmental sustainability. SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENTS Eurizon Capital SGR has adopted a method for the selection of financial instruments that takes into account  environmental, social and governance factors as an integral part of the investment process, aimed at curbing risks  including reputational risks. The ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) and SRI (Sustainable and Responsible  Investments) principles are applied to all actively managed funds, whether they are benchmark or flexible ones.  The actively managed funds also include specialised ESG products which use an appropriate internal rating system  and ethical products with dedicated benchmarks, managed according to strict positive and negative criteria for the  selection of issuers. There are specific limitations on investments for critical issuers (with low sustainability rating)  and for those working in sectors that are not socially responsible (issuers in the cluster bomb and anti-personnel  landmine sectors), and, where appropriate, there are also special processes that require discussions and engagement  with those companies subject to investment on behalf of managed assets. In particular, securities involved in the  design, production, sale and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines and cluster bombs, are excluded from SGR  investment if they have these characteristics:   for products whose investment policy is characterized by the presence of a benchmark, the maximum direct  investment allowed is equal to the weight of the issuer in the benchmark;   for products whose investment policy does not provide for the presence of a benchmark, direct investment in  securities of issuing bodies belonging to the list is excluded. The offer also comprises some ethical funds, where the qualifying aspects of management include an evaluation  position exercised as regards the choices of companies where resources are invested. In 2017, Eurizon conducted 665 engagement initiatives with issuers, of which 135 (about 20%) mainly referred to  ESG issues (in 2016, engagement activities numbered 600, of which 50 concerned assessments related to social,  environmental and correct governance issues). In 2017, the SRI - Sustainable and Responsible Investing Committee (inside the SGR, it is chaired by the Managing  Director) and the Sustainability Committee (an independent body outside the SGR) of Eurizon met three times and  passed resolutions on issues of management and research. With regard to the operations of the SRI Committee, during 2017 it passed 90 resolutions on engagement actions  for companies with low sustainability rating; this resulted in the freezing of their existing current positions. When  the period of 18 months from the start of engagement comes to an end and the conditions that led to issuers  being included in the lower rating list still remain, the securities are treated with the same criteria applied to non-  79 ACTIVE OWNERSHIP 103-2/103-3; EX FS12 Society conventional weapons (including nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and are assigned the same characteristic  of having an indiscriminate destructive potential). Following the action of engagement, discussions and in-depth  examination with the senior management of the issuer, the Committee decided to rehabilitate a large company  and allowed its investment in all portfolios. As regards the operations of the Sustainability Committee, during 2017 it passed resolutions on the formation of  lists in support of the new investment process and on the method of selecting out-of-benchmark securities for the  Ethical System funds, in addition to the promotion of higher education in the field of sustainable finance. During the year, three new products were launched that accompany the four already active in 2016, i.e. the  Ethical System funds and the Eurizon Flessibile Azionario fund characterized by the inclusion of ESG factors in the  selection process of the securities in the portfolio. The new products launched in 2017 are: Eurizon Sustainable  Global Equity, Eurizon ESG Target 2022 and Eurizon Disciplina Sostenibile ESG, launched in December 2017.  The amount of assets under management in the area of Ethical Funds amounted to almost 1.1 billion euro in  2017 (1.5% of the total amount managed in funds established under Italian law). Assets under management with  sustainability criteria in other Funds amounted to almost 2.9 billion euro in 2017 (4.0% of the total). Overall the  total assets managed in Ethical Funds and with sustainability criteria amounted to almost 4 billion euro (about  5.6% of the total). In general, the performance of Ethical Funds and Managed Funds with ESG criteria has been  positive and equal or higher than the market or the reference benchmark.  In addition, Eurizon operates fourteen mandates regarding eleven customers, characterised by sustainability  criteria for 2.4 billion euro. In particular, the services provided for these mandates concern the choice of ad hoc  benchmarks, support in the engagement and corporate governance activities, the formation of exclusion lists  in the selection of investments. The significant development in the level of managed mandates derives from a  heightened sensitivity towards issues of sustainability by institutional traders who have prepared calls in which  Eurizon has performed well and won three of them (two of considerable size and with SRI characteristics). Eurizon is also involved in the dissemination of topics, approaches and best practices relating to sustainability  through public information events and also at an academic level. In 2017, Masters programmes were run at the  Luigi Bocconi University (MAGER - Master in Green Management, Energy and Corporate Social Responsibility) an  at the Milan Polytechnic (Master RIDEF 2.0 Reinventare lenergia), partly financed with Eurizon study grants. In 2017, Eurizon also became part of the Green Finance Task Force of the European Banking Federation and  contributes as joint head of the ESG business simulation within the Executive Master in Finance of the SDA Bocconi.  Fideuram Intesa Sanpaolo Private Banking is specialized in offering advisory services to meet the financial, pension  and insurance needs of Private customers and High Net Worth Individuals. In the field of socially responsible  investments, it offers the opportunity of Fonditalia Ethical Investment, a solution which integrates income objectives  with financial sustainability and social value aspects. The fund invests in the bonds of those States that stand out  for the special focus on social and environmental issues, in bonds issued by Supranational Bodies that support  developing economies and in units of funds specialised in microfinance, in fair trade funds and in equity funds  and shares which have a positive impact on a social and/or environmental level. The task of ensuring consistency  between the actual composition of the fund's portfolio and the ethical principles it aspires to is entrusted to an  Ethics Committee consisting of managers and qualified experts from different academic and professional areas.  A further element characterising the ethics behind the fund is given by its commitment to supporting scientific  research, through the placement of share units in favour of AISM and its Foundation (FISM) with the recognition  of a donation, whose amount is proportional to the fund fees.  In terms of funding, the ethical funds sector registered significant growth in managed assets (+32% from 39  million euro in 2016 to nearly 52 million euro in 2017), as a result of a growing interest from customers including  Italian customers. The return was slightly higher than that of 2016 as a result of a more significant positive impact  of the equity component. Also regarding the lines of asset management, Fideuram has developed new individual investment solutions taking  advantage of expert advice on the selection of underlying instruments that fulfil the criteria of ethics. In April  2017 a new line of asset management called Mix Sustainable was introduced, which provides for a process of  investment based on a fundamental and economic analysis and with specific assessments on sustainability so as to  aim towards goals that are compatible through financial, social and environmental results. PENSION FUND WITH DEFINED CONTRIBUTION OF THE INTESA SANPAOLO GROUP The defined contribution Pension Fund of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group adopted selection criteria consistent with the  Principles for Responsible Investment and its investment policies statutorily aspire to these principles of responsibility. In 2017, an engagement procedure initiated in 2015 by a pool of investors came to an end, mostly made up of  pension funds, called Engagement Child Labor, a continuation of the initiative which involved 101 companies  in exploring respect for the rights of children and young people on the subject of child labor.  80 Society The Insurance Division of Intesa Sanpaolo, consisting of Intesa Sanpaolo Vita S.p.A., Intesa Sanpaolo Assicura  S.p.A., Fideuram Vita S.p.A. and Intesa Sanpaolo Life D.A.C.(Designated Activity Company), has the mission of  synergically developing an insurance product mix aimed at Group customers. Being a bank means being repositories  of a relationship of trust with its customers; being an insurance company means being able to guarantee security  to families. Insurance and pension products and those relating to asset protection and management also have the  aim of responding to the needs of a more significant social impact, such as protecting more vulnerable people like  children, the disabled or those who are placed under the responsibility of a guardianship judge.  The Mi Curo dei Miei policy, for example, is dedicated to the protection of the nuclear family, in the event that  the insured dies before the other family members. It ensures a capital sum to support the family, representing a real  help at a difficult time, ensuring the beneficiaries greater stability, at least economically, in a very short time. It is  intended for young heads of families, parents of young children, for those who care not only about current needs  but want to secure the future of their loved ones. In 2017, 7,297 policies were issued.  The Penso a Te policy enables users to provide a child or a young person with a secure capital amount which they  can use on the date set by the customer who subscribes the product, which shall nevertheless be within a range  when the beneficiary is between the age of 18 and 35. Penso a Te represents a concrete gesture of affection  and a safe investment and is a perfect solution for grandparents who want to do something important for their  grandchildren, but can also appeal to parents, close relatives and friends of the family who care for the future of  a child or a young person. In 2017, 4,801 policies were issued.  Base Sicura Tutelati is a product that provides an insurance investment solution dedicated exclusively to minors  and/or wards who have a capital sum they can use and require the prior authorisation from a guardianship judge.  The policy is signed by a legal representative, who acts on behalf of the minor and/or ward by virtue of an earlier  measure issued by the guardianship judge. In 2017, 753 policies were issued.  The ISV Tu Dopo di noi policy is, on the other hand, an insurance product designed to protect a disabled  beneficiary on the death of the insured. This product is aimed at families with people with disabilities who want  to protect their loved ones by accumulating a secure capital for their future, guaranteeing the disabled person a  reliable source of income they can count on at the delicate time when their family is no longer around. The policy  allows the customer to choose whether to allocate the capital in one lump sum to the beneficiary or whether to  opt for a programmed plan involving the liquidation of the capital in six-monthly instalments for 5, 10, 15 or 20  years. In 2017, 242 policies were issued.  Lastly, the insurance solutions that protect people from the unexpected that can compromise their style of living  include the product called ProteggiConMe, a policy that protects the insured from unforeseen events that could  affect its ability to cope with the expenses normally incurred in the context of everyday life because of an injury,  disability or loss of employment. In 2017, 201 policies were issued. INSURANCE SECTOR WITH SOCIAL IMPACT  81 201-1; 203-1; RELATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY 103-2 Society Relations with the community COMPANY POLICIES The Group plays an active role in respect of the areas in which it operates on the basis of the Code of Ethics  that draws attention to the requirements and needs of the community: this commitment is expressed in  various activities, such as participating in processes aimed at achieving sustainable development goals at  the global level, supporting the growth of the non-profit sector, promoting solidarity initiatives through  donations, sponsoring important cultural and social initiatives, preserving and developing the historical,  artistic and cultural heritage of the country and of the Group so that it can also be enjoyed by the public.  Projects and activities are undertaken voluntarily and are selected by the Group in order to respond effectively  to the most important needs felt by the communities, taking into account the objectives of the major  international and national, public and private institutions that contribute to the determination of social  policies. The actions are increasingly implemented in synergy with local entities and institutions, aiming thus  to have positive social repercussions. In line with the Groups reference values, the action procedures were  carried out according to transparent and accountable methods and through processes and procedures that  aimed to avoid any possible conflicts of personal or business interests. CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMMUNITY Total contributions to the community  by type [thousands of euro] 2017 2016 2015 Cash contribution to the community 49,637 46,412 53,031 Goods and services donated to the  community --- 27 2 Contributions in terms of time 218 146 70 Operating costs 3,569 3,682 3,550 Total 53,424 50,267 56,653 In 2017, cash contributions were classified based on the reason and broken down as follows:   About 54.8% consists of investments in the community: contributions characterised by long-term plans and/or  strategic partnerships and/or of sizeable amounts. This is a growing portion compared to 2016, which represents  the most important part of the monetary donations, demonstrating the strategic nature of the Group's activities,  geared towards long-term partnerships that can guarantee real benefits and value for the territory;   37.2% consists of business initiatives (sponsorships) that contribute to social causes while at the same time  promoting Intesa Sanpaolo's brand and business;   the remaining 8.0% consists of charitable gifts, of an occasional nature and for small amounts, including  match giving initiatives (donations by the Bank during fund raising campaigns, combined with the donations of  employees or customers). The main action areas to which monetary contributions were directed in 2017 were for the support of art and  culture amounting to 28.3 million euro, social solidarity for 5.5 million euro, economic development for 4.7 million  euro and education and research for 4.7 million euro (see page 143). DONATIONS Parent Company donations are managed through the Fund for charitable, social and cultural donations provided  for by the Articles of Association of Intesa Sanpaolo and entrusted to the direct responsibility of the Chairman of  the Board of Directors who submits biennial Guidelines to the approval of the Board, which define the objectives,  strategic priorities and theme-based policies including an annual Plan for allocating resources. Regulations govern  the management of the Fund and define the precise mechanisms for the selection of the proposed entities and  projects, maintaining the principle of absolute separation of the initiatives regarding donations from the pursuit of  commercial interests. With regard to the entities, the Regulations provide for the exclusion as beneficiaries of those  organisations involved in legal disputes, in matters relating to organised crime and the failure to respect human  rights, peaceful coexistence and environmental protection. Only requests for specific projects with a clear social   82 Society IMPORTANT SOCIAL INITIATIVES FOR THE GROUP Childhood is an area of particular importance for the Group which in recent years has created some significant  inclusion projects that were initiated and managed directly by the CEOs staff. Intesa Sanpaolo's Educational Programme for children who are long-term patients With the Intesa Sanpaolo Educational Programme for children who are long-term patients, the Bank offers free crches for  children of the age group 0-3 years admitted to first-rate hospital oncology departments, aiming to help them overcome  the social and psychological isolation resulting from their illness. Cognitive and affective development is promoted  through appropriate programmes, provided by qualified educators in a setting that is as serene and fruitful as possible.   impact are assessed and the ability of the institutions to achieve the stated objectives in the project are preliminarily  analysed on the basis of their previous direct experiences or that of similar bodies in terms of size and activity (track  record). A rotation mechanism is also used to ensure the widest and most flexible use of the Fund with a maximum  limit of three consecutive years in support of the same project. In addition, initiatives that receive sponsorship  cannot simultaneously be beneficiaries of donations. An extract of the Regulations and biennial Guidelines are available on the Group's website. As regards the risks of this activity, the Group has deemed that the area of donations is one of the potential areas  that could lead to corruption. The Fund Regulations and the Groups Anti-corruption Guidelines have laid down  precise rules to be followed in order to prevent such risks, which have been incorporated into the Fund's Operating  Guidelines and into the donation application IT procedure. THE CHARITY FUND IN 2017 In 2017, the Fund for charitable, social and cultural donations of Intesa Sanpaolo has disbursed approximately  9.5 million euro in support of over 900 projects carried out by non-profit organisations. The objective of allocating a high share of resources (> 80%) for central donations supporting projects  in favour of weaker segments of the population, operating according to an increasingly more stringent  selection mechanism in relation to project and counterparty quality, has been exceeded by a considerable  amount, reaching 88%. Also as regards locally-based donations, the level of contributions benefiting  vulnerable groups was 69%, well above the target of 60%. In the 2017-2018 Guidelines for the Charity Fund approved by the Board of Directors, the privileged Areas  for intervention are the Social and Environmental areas, which have been allocated most of the available  funds (72% of the total allocated in 2017), whereas a smaller percentage is scheduled to be provided  in favour of Cultural and educational actions, Religious and charitable projects and lastly to Research.  In particular, the social and environmental projects are selected on the basis of priority themes deemed  relevant and urgent: activities in support of the earthquake victims of Central Italy and the social and  economic inclusion of migrants and immigrants. The Fund is open to actions that also support other topic  areas, such as: employment; housing deprivation; health poverty, disease prevention, support, care and  welfare of patients and their families; social inclusion (first priority level); the fight against educational  poverty and educational drop-outs, support for those with physical and intellectual disabilities; preventing  and combating violence (second level); protecting the environment and biodiversity and recreational sport,  the latter only for locally-based donations (third level). In line with the 2017-2018 Guidelines, the most significant projects supported by the Fund have included  support for earthquake victims of Central Italy and social and economic inclusion of migrants and immigrants  which have been granted a total of 2.8 million euro. In 2017, in collaboration with the International Subsidiary Banks Division, some specific initiatives were  identified in support of the communities and areas in which the Group operates. Starting with a survey of  the most urgent problems and needs of the various countries, certain local areas were selected and then  attention was focused on those institutions and projects that could meet the identified needs in those areas.  At the end of the assessment process, support was given to a project run by VIS (Volontariato Internazionale  per lo Sviluppo - International Voluntary Service for Development) on vocational training in Egypt (200,000  euro) and an action organised by CESVI (Cooperazione e Sviluppo per il sostegno alloccupazione giovanile  - Cooperation and Development for supporting Youth Employment) in particular in the tourism sector, in  Albania (106,000 euro). The collaboration aims to disseminate among the International Subsidiary Banks  new procedures for the selection and monitoring of projects, following the example of the initiatives taken  by the Parent Company. The projects were given visibility through internal communication activities.  83 Society The project also allows families to be offered real help in coping with their new organisation of life and living with the  illness. The Educational Programme provides mothers with significant support as, in most cases, they take direct care  of the child during the period of hospitalisation. The Programme has been activated:   in Turin at the Paediatric Oncohaematology Ward of the Regina Margherita Childrens Hospital in the Citt  della Salute (January);   in Naples at the Paediatric Cancer Ward of the Azienda Ospedaliera di Rilievo Nazionale Santobono Pausilipon (July);   in Monza at the Paediatric Haematology Ward of the Fondazione Monza e Brianza per il Bambino e la sua  Mamma inside the San Gerardo Hospital in Monza (October). Since the service was launched, 100% of the children of pre-school age in the partner hospitals involved in the project  have been included in the long-term patient programme with positive results: the healthcare and educational staff  have noted a considerable level of psychological and behavioural recovery in the children. Intesa Sanpaolo programme for inclusive education of children and teenagers - the Webecome platform  Intesa Sanpaolo has launched an innovative project, the Programme for inclusive education aimed at children of  primary and secondary schools to promote their inclusion and the development of positive behaviour, responding to  the need to address the critical issues emerging in terms of juvenile unease. The first test phase of the Programme  involved almost 400 pupils, 55 teachers and head teachers and about 50 parents throughout the country from the  North and South. The heart of the project is the Webecome platform that is in the process of being launched, which  addresses issues such as bullying, diversity, violence, addictions, but also food and nutrition (with great attention paid  to obesity and malnutrition), innovation and development of the individual potential. Parents are offered sets of useful information to learn more about and to fight against juvenile unease and on  developing childrens potential. QuB Programme – Quanto Basta  To counter a dramatic phenomenon such as child poverty, which concerns about 20,000 minors and 10,000 families  solely in Milan, Intesa Sanpaolo together with the Fondazione Cariplo and the partners Fondazione Vismara and  Fondazione Fiera Milano has undertaken commitments, in addition to a donation of 3 million euro over the next  three years, by placing the privileged relationship with its customers at the service of the project. So it has involved  the community, with specific tools to facilitate fundraising, such as the network of branches, ATMs, the For Funding  online platform and 900 Social Ambassadors. In addition, through the Webecome platform, a specific module on nutrition is in the process of being launched in  order to create correct child nutrition. BUSINESS INITIATIVES IN THE COMMUNITY Sponsorship initiatives were consistent with the (ethical, cultural and social) principles and values of the Group;  particular attention is paid to the selection of projects capable of conveying messages in line with the image and  reputation of the Bank and Group, with particular reference to:   the dissemination of culture through the support of cultural and musical initiatives made accessible to a wide  and differentiated public;   the support for research to promote new opportunities for economic and social development through partnerships  with leading foundations and institutions;   the promotion of sustainability as a value for businesses and a confidence factor for customers through  participation in initiatives within the scope of Corporate Social Responsibility;   the development of training opportunities for young people and for the inclusion of women in the world of work;   the creation of initiatives aimed at curbing social hardship;   the dissemination of the values of sport, mainly among young people, highlighting the importance of the  universal values represented by sporting practices, such as commitment and respect of rules.  84 Society FOOD COLLECTION INITIATIVES IN FAVOR OF NEEDS AND AGAINST FOOD WASTAGE CIB Bank was the main sponsor of the Christmas food collection project of the Hungarian Food Bank  Association (HFBA): 5,000 volunteers and 190 employees of CIB Bank collected 236 tons of non-perishable  food during the project conducted at national level in nearly 120 cities and 200 major retail outlets over  the weekend between 24 and 26 November 2017. Thanks to this collection, the HFBA was able to prepare  more than 39,000 grocery baskets and distribute them to needy people before Christmas with the help of  charitable organisations. Commitment against food wastage also characterised the participation of Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania in  the first edition of the Local Food Bank day which saw the involvement of employees and top management  approaching about 20% of total staff. The results were significant with the collection of 3.7 tons of food. PROMOTION OF CULTURE FOR SOCIAL COHESION Intesa Sanpaolo interprets its own commitment in this sector as an assumption of social responsibility, believing  that leading national banks must contribute towards economic growth and also to the cultural and civil growth  of the country. In this sense, the Banks Articles of Association entrust to the Chairman of the Board of Directors,  after consultation with the Managing Director and according to the Guidelines approved by the Board, the  planning and management of the Company and Groups cultural initiatives, with particular reference to the  enhancement of the historic, archaeological and artistic heritage; in this role, the Chairman enjoys cooperation  from the Chairman Emeritus. The Guidelines approved by the Board of Directors became effectively active in 2009 with the Progetto Cultura  (Culture Project), the Bank's strategic container for cultural activities. On the one hand, Progetto Cultura aims to encourage use by a growing number of people from the public of  its important artistic, architectural, publishing and documentary heritage, coming from the financial institutions  that have become part of the Group. On the other, it aims to contribute to safeguarding Italian cultural heritage.  Promotion of the Bank's artistic heritage is implemented along various lines: study and scientific cataloguing  of the works; restoration activity; museum projects creating permanent displays of a part of the collections  (Gallerie dItalia in Milan, Naples and Vicenza); planning and organisation of temporary exhibitions; support of  scholarships for training opportunities and the search for youth in collaboration with the universities; loan of  works to temporary exhibitions. As regards cultural activities, in accordance with the provisions of Legislative Decree 231/2001, the Intesa  Sanpaolo Groups rules for the protection of archaeological, historical and artistic heritage have been reviewed  and updated, particularly with regard to the implementation of its Guidelines governing the forms of conduct to  be adopted regarding the ordinary and extraordinary protection of the companys heritage works (in the event  of theft, loss or damage). The activities promoted in the cultural sphere are subject to constant monitoring, also through market research  conducted regularly to assess their compliance with the objectives, including those concerning reputational risk. Particular attention is given to activities that allow these assets to be enjoyed by special audiences through  numerous projects dedicated to persons who have some form of fragility (people with sensory and cognitive  disabilities, foreign communities of immigrants, people living in difficult and marginal situations) with the aim of  supporting full accessibility to cultural heritage and the enjoyment of the museum as a space for participation  and social integration. In particular, a main focus of the activities of the Gallerie is the ongoing commitment  towards eliminating physical and mental barriers that hinder the enjoyment of their collections and of art in  general, and combating social exclusion with a view to serving the community.  85 Society In 2017, a number of initiatives by the Gallerie dItalia were also devoted to disadvantaged and vulnerable  categories.

It should be highlighted that more than 84,000 visitors are children and teenagers  from local schools, all admitted for free to the Gallerie dItalia as part of their education. In recognition of its important cultural and social role, Intesa Sanpaolo received the Mecenate del XXI Secolo  award in Rome, in November 2017, as part of the Corporate Art Awards announced by the Minister of Heritage,  Culture and Tourism. The special non-category award was presented to the Chairman Emeritus of Intesa  Sanpaolo by the President of the Republic for the breadth and quality of Intesa Sanpaolos artistic initiatives,  that are unparalleled in the world. INTESA SANPAOLO FOR CULTURE Gallerie dItalia is Intesa Sanpaolos network of galleries, museums and cultural attractions in Milan, Naples  and Vicenza. Historic buildings located in the centres of the three cities have been transformed into exhibition  venues to ensure public enjoyment of its major art collections. The Gallerie di Piazza Scala in Milan are dedicated to collections from the nineteenth century belonging to  the Bank and the Fondazione Cariplo and Intesa Sanpaolos works from the twentieth century. The Gallerie  di Palazzo Zevallos Stigliano in Naples host the masterpiece of its collections, Caravaggio's painting depicting  the martyrdom of Saint Ursula, and a selection of Neapolitan works from between the seventeenth and  twentieth centuries. The Gallerie di Palazzo Leoni Montanari in Vicenza have a display of collections of Attic  and Magno-Greek ceramics, eighteenth century Venetian art and Russian icons. In addition to their permanent exhibitions of works, the Gallerie dItalia offer frequent exhibitions of works from  national and foreign museums and collections and also from the Bank's collections, with the aim of contributing  to the progress of scientific research into art and history, with a view to providing information and attracting  a wider general public. In addition to the large exhibitions, there are a number of personal exhibitions such as  LOspite Illustre (The Distinguished Guest ) – single-subject exhibitions which aim to present to the public a work  of great importance coming from prestigious Italian and foreign collections – or Il Tempo dellAntico (Ancient  Times), dedicated to Intesa Sanpaolos collection of Attic and Magno-Greek pottery. These exhibitions at the  Gallerie dItalia are enhanced by planned events, often organised in partnership with other cultural institutions:  study days, concerts, drama workshops, poetry readings. In addition to the valuable fruition of its historical and artistic heritage, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group Historical  Archive organises several activities aimed at providing access, also online, to its enormous documentary heritage  and to share its historical knowledge with the public, not only concerning the history of the Group, but also that  of the Italian economy, which is closely related to. Two reading rooms are open to the public in Milan and Rome,  with publications, meetings, original research on primary sources, lessons and workshops aimed at secondary  school pupils and university students that help to make this immense cultural heritage a community asset. Another priority guideline of Intesa Sanpaolo concerns its contribution to the preservation and enhancement  of the national heritage, which is realized through the project called Restituzioni (Restorations), one of the  Banks most significant activities launched in 1989 and now in its 18th edition. This is a proven programme  of restoration of the country's artistic and architectural heritage promoted, supported and maintained by  Intesa Sanpaolo and run in cooperation with the ministerial entities responsible for conservation – Heritage  Authorities, Regional Offices and autonomous museums – within the context of a virtuous synergy between  public and private sectors. To date, Restituzioni has allowed the recovery of over a thousand works of art. The publishing projects promoted by the Bank are also important: these aim to provide further in-depth study  into art, music, history and economy, always with a view to spreading knowledge and use of the Groups  heritage and Italys heritage, thus contributing to the sharing of that sense of belonging and identity. All the  publications were distributed for free to cultural institutions, civic and religious authorities, music colleges,  secondary schools, universities, audio and video stores, Italian cultural institutes abroad, researchers and  ministerial entities, in addition to public reading facilities and libraries. Another objective of Progetto Cultura is to facilitate links between scientific research, cultural innovation and  social needs through the project called Officina delle Idee (Workshop of Ideas), which aims to offer young  people educational and expressive opportunities through partnerships with public and private institutions  of excellence and through the funding of scholarships. With respect to this area, it is worth mentioning the  participation in the Festival della Cultura creativa sponsored by ABI and the Careers in Art project, a  programme fostering closer relations between the world of work in the areas of art, craftsmanship and the  creative economy, and high school pupils in Milan, Naples and Vicenza.  88 102-9; 205-2 Society Responsibility towards the supply chain COMPANY POLICIES Intesa Sanpaolo is aware that the quality of supplier relations and the procurement policies can create  the necessary conditions for fostering economic development focusing on the protection of the envi- ronment and the respect for human rights. To this end, in compliance with the principles of listening,  transparency, equal opportunities and fairness enshrined in the Code of Ethics, it has adopted Group  Procurement Guidelines and Purchasing Rules which supplement, across the board, the criteria of social  and environmental responsibility and define the principles which all the business functions involved in  the process must comply with. MANAGING THE SUPPLY CHAIN The Procurement Department, that is responsible for procurement as specified in the Group Procurement  Guidelines, launched a project in 2016 which led to the replacement of the supplier portal in use with a new  e-sourcing solution called Supplier Gate. This project allowed the purchasing process to be redefined based on business procedures that are increasingly  geared to ethical negotiations and competitive comparisons of technical and economic characteristics in the offers  submitted by suppliers and subcontractors.  The selection of suppliers already takes place during the process of registration to the gate by means of an assessment  that takes into account not only the economic and financial but also organisational and technical characteristics  of each supplier, and also includes analyses of their business ethics, respect for human rights, labor rights and the  environment. If the result of this assessment is positive, the suppliers are registered in the Group Suppliers Register  and can be invited to the procurement events. At the end of 2017, about 1,950 suppliers had completed the  registration procedure at the gate. In order to ensure objectivity and transparency in the subsequent phase of awarding the contract, it was decided that  it was appropriate to continue comparing a range of offers impartially, differentiating the assessment of the technical  and/or administrative part from the purely financial aspects. In this way, through a system of network negotiations, products and services that meet specific requirements for  functionality, quality, safety and respect for the environment are purchased at the best market conditions, in full  compliance with applicable laws and regulations, also taking into consideration ethical implications and social/ environmental impact assessments within the scope of relations with the entire supply chain.  The new application made it possible to optimise the performance of certain activities and to strengthen quality  assurance over the entire supply chain. QUESTIONNAIRE, REPORTING, CONTROLS With regard to the checks carried out on the suppliers, the qualification process involves suppliers, as they register,  in filling in a compulsory questionnaire in the Supplier Gate concerning issues regarding the companys social and  environmental responsibility and agreeing to upload the documentation required to certify the fulfilment of the  declared commitments that must be updated at least once a year. This procedure allows the entire supply chain to be  monitored in order to obtain a rating for each supplier that is consistent with the types of calculated risk. Furthermore,  in order to ensure an assessment of the entire supply chain, a decision was taken to ensure the functions involved in  purchasing the right to carry out direct checks and inspections, also through specific reporting procedures, in order  to plan appropriate courses of action, in the event of unsatisfactory ratings. For example, in 2017, the Real Estate  Department conducted 1,341 checks on suppliers. If assessed suppliers win a service contract, the contract terms  force them to abide by the principles contained in the Code of Ethics of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group and to submit,  upon request, all the documentation proving their obligations in social and environmental matters.

In fact, the 2014-2017 Business  Plan identified the companys employees as key to achieving its results. Their importance is reflected by the  companys complete protection of workers rights (in terms of the development of labor relations and employment  protection), its staff development activities (with particular focus on training and merit) and its creation of a modern  and integrated company welfare system. Intesa Sanpaolo has also adopted an Occupational Health and Safety  Management System which is compliant with the most advanced international standards. The solutions identified, also thanks to the numerous agreements signed with the Trade Unions, allowed not only to  protect jobs but also to introduce innovative contractual tools that are able to foster the development of an effective  company welfare system and establish a better work-life balance. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND RESULTS ACHIEVED Indicators 2017 results and   cumulative value 2014-2017 2017 objectives (or cumulative  value 2014-2017) Human resources reabsorbed in  the professional reallocation plan 4,500 cumulative figure for 2014-2017 4,500 Percentage of employees  belonging to a union In Italy 77.6%; abroad 33.1% Trade Unions representation Training days* 0.8 million 4.6 million cumulative figure 2014-2017 5 million Managerial assessments** 808 people 3,690 cumulative figure 2014-2017 Career advancement paths  for employees destined for  managerial roles Flexible Work over 8,200 employees Promote work-life balance for  greater cohesion among people,  innovation development and  service excellence Intesa Sanpaolo Employees'   Association approx. 130,000 members over 4.5 million to support free time initiatives Group health fund 188 million intermediate healthcare services over 200,000 people assisted Company pension approx. 105,000 subscribers to all Group Funds  (Defined Contribution and Benefit) approx. 10 billion of assets  Accidents inside the workplace: 257 (269 in 2016) outside the workplace: 551 (598 in 2016) % accidents for employees: 0.92% (0.98 % in 2016) Protect employee health   and safety * Includes classroom training, mentoring, distance learning and Web TV training activities. ** In Italy.  91 EMPLOYMENT 103-2; LABOR/MANAGEMENT RELATIONS 103-2; LABOR RIGHTS 103-2 Employees Employment protection JOB PROTECTION For Intesa Sanpaolo job protection is a priority issue in the context of mid- to long-term financial solidity and  one of the key topics of the 2014-2017 Business Plan. In fact, one of its goals was the reassignment of the  excess production capacity of 4,500 people over the period. This goal was achieved with the development of new  business areas, the creation of new roles, the signing of union agreements, internal recruitment processes and  large-scale training activities. Tools that preserved the complete employability of staff through the professional  reconversion of the employees involved and permitted the departure of personnel who qualified for retirement  with the consequent creation of new jobs. The development of labor policies is entrusted to a specific Human Resources department which has the task of  defining union agreements and monitoring their implementation. The Guidelines adopted as part of the 4-year  Plan are also shaping the integration process of employees of the former Venetian Banks. The various Protocols signed1 defined the methods of managing the repercussions of the reorganisation and  restructuring processes and the employment tension deriving from the operation on employees, safeguarding jobs  also through the adoption of active policies aimed at hiring new permanent staff and avoiding far more serious social  consequences. Even though the regulatory framework imposes a reduction in the workforce of around 4,000 people  and their integration in the Group necessitates a major reorganisation process, these repercussions are managed with  the emphasis on social sustainability and the importance of people. In this context, the aforementioned protocols  permit the voluntary recourse to the Solidarity Fund for income, employment and professional requalification support  for bank personnel, regulate the legal and contractual harmonisation process following the integration of staff from  the former Venetian Banks in the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, and provide for the hiring for at least 1,650 new resources  in the 2018-2021 period on permanent contracts. In this context, in 2017 the Intragroup Mobility Service consolidated its processes and examined further ways of matching  supply and demand in the domestic labor market, guaranteeing the development of expertise in new roles. In 2017 recruitment activities also took place via the Linkedin channel (+44.8% visits to the Careers page) and a  new editorial plan was created for the Facebook, Twitter and Instagram platforms with the launch of new Talent  Acquisition and Employer Branding social campaigns.  With almost 4,000 new people hired the turnover rate in 2017 was -1.01, largely unchanged compared to the  2016 figure (-1.14). 1 Protocols of 13 July, 12 October, 15 November and 21 December 2017. COMPANY POLICIES The companys approach to managing issues relating to the protection of workers rights is outlined in  the Code of Ethics, which recognises the principles established by the fundamental conventions of the  ILO (International Labor Organization) and in particular the right to freedom of association and collective  bargaining, the abolition of forced and child labor, and non-discrimination in employment. The applied collective bargaining system works on two separate and complementary levels; the first at  national level and the second at Group level (second-level contractual structure). It was recently modernised  and extended, for the majority of its content, to employees from the former Venetian Banks (Banca Popolare  di Vicenza Group and Veneto Banca Group). The labor relations model that the Group has constantly promoted together with the Trade Unions is focused  on dialogue between company members as a way of identifying the most suitable solutions for addressing and  managing the various growth, development and reorganisation phases that have distinguished the companys  affairs over the years, also regarding the implementation of the 2014-2017 Business Plan. Concrete evidence of the way in which union relations are structured and promoted at Intesa Sanpaolo can  be seen in the creation of bilateral Company/Union bodies, formed with the aim of analysing, identifying  and proposing positive actions, solutions and tools in the areas of equal opportunities, welfare, safety and  sustainable development.  92 LABOR/MANAGEMENT RELATIONS 103-3; TRAINING AND EDUCATION 103-2; DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 103-2; 407-1;  EMPLOYEE ENHANCEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT 103-2 Employees LABOR RELATIONS As well as by the industry outlook, relations with the Trade Unions are also regulated by the Labor Relations  Protocol which has made it possible to develop a specific union relations model in the Intesa Sanpaolo Group.  Dialogue and interaction with the Trade Unions regarding company projects is constant, prompt and aimed at  identifying shared solutions to the various requirements that come to the attention of the Parties. This also takes  place in accordance with the union representation in Italy (77.6% of current employees), a percentage in line with  national figures in the sector. In terms of numbers, at Intesa Sanpaolo the constant dialogue between the Company and the Trade Unions resulted  in the signing of 46 agreements in 2017 (and over 230 between 2014 and 2017) which dedicated plenty of space  to defining an integrated welfare system characterised by heavy investment and innovative initiatives in the area of  work-life balance, inclusion and non-discrimination, and sustainable development. This was also possible thanks to the activities of the Welfare, Safety and Sustainable Development Committee  set up following the Labor Relations Protocol. This bilateral body, which adequately represents both the company  and the Trade Unions, is supplemented each time by technical experts that are able to offer specific expertise on  the issues in question. In 2014-2017, in accordance with and in support of the Business Plan, the Committee  promoted a series of measures and actions that were subsequently enacted by specific union agreements.   Examples include the agreements over the introduction of Flexible Work and the Time Bank, the Protocol on inclusion  and equal opportunities, and the measures in favour of active ageing. Employee growth and development COMPANY POLICIES The enhancement of human resources and the principle of excellence based on the recognition of merit are  defined in the Group Code of Ethics and Remuneration Policies. Dedicated platforms make it possible to implement structured performance assessment processes and to  map skills and professional growth paths. Specific Guidelines define the performance assessment system  for employees in Italy and abroad, which is characterised by indicators that express the quality of working  performances and contribute to the creation of a management dashboard available to managers which is used  to accurately and specifically guide managerial actions as regards the growth and development of employees. The Group Remuneration Policies and Guidelines regulate the remuneration and incentive systems and are  inspired by the principles of merit, fairness, sustainability and proportionality based on the role covered. More  specifically, for employees that work in branches the 2014-2017 Business Plan defines rules for promoting  their professional growth as a key factor in achieving results, and training is identified as one of the priority  tools for helping them to meet their goals. In terms of diversity, the Code of Ethics promotes the specific qualities of each employee, recognising their  key contribution towards innovation and the growth of the Group. At the same time it guarantees equal  opportunities in terms of professional growth and development and access to training courses and refresher  and role assignment initiatives. In order to recognise the diversity of everyones lifestyle choices and gender  identity, specific company policies have been introduced to define the framework for the extension of company  benefits to same-sex unions.  93 404-3 Employees ASSESSMENT AND INCENTIVE SYSTEMS Performer 2.0 is the performance assessment system adopted by the Intesa Sanpaolo Group. The Performance  Systems Office of the Human Resources Head Office Department is dedicated to managing this process which,  using the feedback received from the human resources departments of the Divisions and the Group Companies,  monitors and coordinates the completion of all activities involved in each phase of the process. The activity  involves a comparison between the contribution of each employee in their role and the Companys expectations.  At the start of this process employees are asked to carry out a self-assessment, focusing on the effectiveness of  their performances throughout the year. The assessment forms contain qualitative performance indicators which  provide a concrete evaluation of working performances and are therefore easy for employees to understand.  The process concludes with an assessment by the manager and an interview with the employee aimed at sharing  this evaluation and professional development goals. Another tool used by managers when interacting with  employees is the People Portfolio Management, which precisely and specifically shapes the actions of managers  in the area of personal development issues. Performer 2.0 has been used since January 2016 throughout Italy while the international subsidiary banks use  the Global Performance System, which will be replaced in 2018 with a new tool (new Pat). In terms of employee development, the extension of the scope of application of the On Air platform continued  and it is now available to all employees in Italy. This platform seeks to motivate staff via a structured system  whereby employees state their own experiences and expertise and put their names forward for professional  growth and development processes (there were 19,346 candidates in 2017, of which 9,978 women and 9,368  men). The assessment activities involved 808 employees in 2017, 322 women and 486 men. Another way of  driving professional development is the Job Posting system, which enables all employees to apply for vacant  positions in the various Group companies; 750 applications were made in 2017. The Feedback 180 process has also continued through which the managerial performances of the heads  of departments in the Banca dei Territori Division are analysed on the basis of questionnaires filled out by  employees. The evidence collected is cross-checked against the perceptions of the managers, making it possible  to delineate a plan aimed at improving managerial actions. 456 managers took part in 2017, comprising 351  men and 105 women. The survey of the core skills in the various companies is performed using the skill inventory method, which makes  it possible to map the specific qualities of the various Group companies using co-design workshops with the  department in question. Four Skill up workshops were held in 2017 involving 68 people. The professional roles and figures and relative development paths in Banca dei Territori and Intesa Sanpaolo Group  Services are regulated by specific agreements with the Trade Unions and form part of the second-level contractual  structure. Guidelines are developed according to the specific nature of the production context/service model, on  the basis of which roles, figures, paths and relative indemnities are adapted in compliance with the indications in  the Business Plan. Personnel assigned to the roles, on the basis of the level of complexity managed, are given an  entry-level contract and assigned to a growth path in which training activities play a key role. As regards the incentive schemes, the initiatives of the 2014-2017 Business Plan aimed at motivating and involving  staff include the Employee Share Ownership that the Group implements in innovative ways: the LECOIP (Leveraged  Employee Co-Investment Plan), which makes it possible to invest the shares received with the Employee Share  ON AIR DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM  Makes it possible to:   constantly dialogue with the Company with regard to personal experiences, aspirations and motivations;   embark on a development path aimed at expanding and strengthening expertise and improving the ability  to confront change;   take advantage of new professional opportunities for old and new roles;   aid the development of the managerial skills of future managers and those already in positions of responsibility. There are two sections through which employees can express themselves:   Professional ID Card, to enrich their professional profile, mapping their specialist and professional  knowledge of their role or area and inserting other information on experiences or skills they deem to be  relevant, also acquired in different companies or outside the workplace;   I Want to Apply, through which they can freely express their desire to embark on a development path and  explore new professional opportunities in the Group.  94 Employees SERVICE QUALITY AND EMPLOYEE INCENTIVES The incentive system for employees of the Intesa Sanpaolo network is strongly connected with customer  service quality and confirms the importance of the Synthetic Performance Indicator, made up of seven  key measurable elements: profitability, expandability, credit quality, sustainable growth, service quality,  co-responsibility and multichannel approach (see page 59).  The service quality indicator (Branch Excellence Indicator, to which the Net Promoter Score also  contributes) takes on particular importance in the determination of the Synthetic Performance Indicator,  accounting for 25% of the final score. The Excellence Bonus is awarded to up to 20% of the best  branches and to up to 30% of the best-performing Areas in each Business Area on condition that the  following parameters are met:   minimum Synthetic Performance Indicator score (100);   100% of the Operational Excellence KPI target assigned;   100% of the Credit Excellence KPI target assigned. Ownership Plan in the relative certificates. All employees were given the chance to participate, from the outset,  in the value growth expected with the implementation of the Plan through the individual and voluntary co- investment in shares. 79% of eligible employees subscribed for an exchange value of around 150 million euro. Following the agreements reached in 2015 and 2016, with the aim of rewarding the contributions, made by  all employees to achieving the goals of the 2014-2017 Business Plan, as part of the second-level collective  labor agreement, a union agreement was also signed in 2017 which replaced the Company Bonus and  Incentive System with a Variable Results Bonus for personnel that work in the Professional Areas and belong  to the Middle Managers category. This mechanism involves increasing bonuses as different goals are achieved according to the relevant  company level (Group, Division etc.) and the type of result achieved in terms of specifically identified  economic and financial parameters. The Variable Results Bonus comprises three amounts:   The base bonus, designed to reward all Group employees for their collective contribution to achieving the results  outlined in the Business Plan, as well as to support those with lower salaries as part of an internal equality  criterion. Given its participatory nature, the base bonus is independent of the contractual agreement and the  professional role held or the seniority accrued;   The additional bonus that recognises the contribution made to the results of the relevant department and varies  according to role or seniority and professional category;   The excellence bonus, which rewards individual merit and the distinctive contribution made to achieving  the teams results. Confirming the importance that the issues of assistance and services for families and work-life balance have in the  Groups policies, employees have the option of requesting that all or part of their Variable Results Bonus be recognised  in the form of welfare services, e.g. contributions to education and teaching services for pre-school children, taking  advantage of the opportunities that the tax regulations in the area of the remuneration of workplace productivity  offer employees year by year. The definition of the union agreements that underlie the creation of the Variable Results Bonus is overseen by the  Employment Policies functions; the process is managed by the central and nationwide HR departments to guarantee  the fairness of the assigned objectives and the correct recognition of the identified bonuses.  95 TRAINING AND EDUCATION 103-3; 404-2 Employees TRAINING In 2017 the Training, Management Development and School of Managers structure devised and implemented  training and development actions that were accessible to all Group people anywhere and at any time, fine-tuning  innovative multichannel methods that maximise the accessibility and flexibility of learning. The training offer is based on key skills for each role/position and prioritises digital channels with quick, simple and  interactive engagement methods supporting all learning and development approaches, particularly with regard to  the acquisition of new knowledge and skills in the context of the major transformations taking place in terms of  the service model and the roles of the Group. On the whole, the training activities provided:   over 2.6 million training hours (1.1 million of classroom training and 1.5 million of distance training);   an average of 30 hours of training per person (28 in Italy and 32 abroad). In 2017 there was a reduction in classroom activities due to the launch of the training digitalisation project which  prioritises remote channels over traditional ones. This reduction in overall activities compared with the previous  year was above all due to the end of the Free 18 initiative (300,000 man/days fewer).  The focus on digital training was confirmed with the creation of a new digital training platform, Apprendo, which  offers a wide array of content in different formats and in different ways. The new digital platform provides its  content anywhere and anytime, also on non-company devices outside of working hours. A specific department supports and provides employees with guidance on the digital offer with targeted  communication campaigns for different audiences. Guidelines and editorial plans for each role transform learning  into an integrated experience. Since its launch in April the platform has supplied over 1,700 learning objects,  registering over 43,000 users for a total of 10 million accesses. The new School of Managers was launched in 2017. Outlined in the Business Plan, its role is to promote a  common identity between the Banks managers and talents with shared leadership characteristics, offering  the opportunity to supplement and update the skills that evolve over the years. It offers learning, training,  listening, meeting and dialogue content as well as a summary of each professional development plan. It also  plans personalised one-to-one development sessions, tailored as necessary, providing mentoring, external and  internal coaching and a digital trainer, in classrooms with an increasingly phigital (a cross between the physical  and the digital) feel. The School of Managers is organised in a similar way to the portal for the professional  world in which the digital component takes the form of an App which is used to provide management training  content but also updates on topics like organisational agility, digital banking, innovation, risk culture, scenario  analysis and corporate social responsibility. Launched in February, the App has registered over 4,360 users and  over 200,000 views with an average rating of 4.2 (scale from 1 to 5). The Intesa Sanpaolo digital learning project – Portal and Smartphone App to Learn Anytime, Anywhere – won the   EFMA-Accenture Distribution and Marketing Innovation Award for the Workforce Empowerment and Behaviour category Particular attention was focused on risk management with the Risk Culture programme seeking to foster a  widespread understanding and awareness of emerging risks. The training programme is structured into two parts:  issues connected with specific risk content and managerial approaches to governing risk. So far there have been initiatives aimed at the Board of Directors and Top Managers on ground-breaking themes  also with the contribution of international experts. Digital content has also been developed on the themes of  conduct risk and cyber security and made available on the Managers' School App. The Big Data Academy, an advanced training course designed to provide Group-level specialists with training in  the area of Big Data, has continued. The aim is to develop specialist skills and expertise in new roles typical of the  digital era (Data Scientist and Data Owner). There were 16 training initiatives for almost 750 participants and over  7,400 training hours were provided. Flexible Smart Learning training also began, enabling all Branch Managers, Coordinators and Managers of the Retail  and Corporate Areas (over 29,000 employees enabled) to dedicate exclusive time to their professional training  during working hours, also from home, with the support of shared branch tablets (8,000 tablets distributed for a  total of 1,615 days of training provided during working hours).  96 Employees 404-2; DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY 103-2/103-3 WORK-BASED LEARNING Z LAB is the 3-year ongoing work-based learning course that third-year secondary school pupils attend until  they are in the fifth year. The project covers all of the hours established by the Buona Scuola law (200 hours  for high schools, 400 hours for technical and professional schools). Pupils spend every single hour in the  Bank with weekly modules (10 or 15 consecutive working days). As host company, Intesa Sanpaolo provides  the students with a reference environment with interactive dynamics, experiential workshops, project-work  and digital culture so they can discover and think about the world of work. Pupils work according to  the flipped classroom method and are assisted by 70 specially trained internal collaborators who act as  tutors during the workshop activities. Meanwhile, relations with the schools are managed by 27 staff from  the Personnel departments of the 8 Regional Governance Centres who act as company tutors. All of the  topics covered are contextualised in business activities, also with visits to the head office departments and  talks with internal spokespersons. The first two years of the Z LAB project (2016/2017 and 2017/2018  academic years) have involved around 1,500 students from 70 schools, hosted by Intesa Sanpaolo in 111  workshops, which overall have provided over 29,000 man/days (203,000 hours) of work-based learning  activities. Z LAB workshops were organised in 15 different Italian cities. TALENT DEVELOPMENT Promoting talent and leadership and strengthening the motivation and sense of belonging of employees were the  goals that inspired the development of the International Talent Program, the project dedicated to internal talent  within the Group that was launched in 2017. The project revolves around 3-5 year personalised development paths with three distinctive dimensions: they are  inter-divisional, inter-functional and international. All participants in the programme are involved in specialist and management training, in the production of project- work strongly connected with the Groups various businesses, and in international training-experiential events. For the duration of the course, each Talent receives sponsorship with the direct involvement of senior  managers of the Group. The selection process took place between January and April 2017 and involved over 1,000 employees, leading  to the identification of 100 Talents, the first class of the International Talent Program. The project was officially  launched in July with a corporate event involving all of the Talents and the Groups first-level managers, as well as  Human Resources managers from the various macro-units. The first job rotations began in September and will be  fully operational by March 2018. Additional recruiting formats have also been developed for the hiring and recruitment of young talent. Make it  Real is the brand with which Intesa Sanpaolo has reached out to millennials, proposing company business game  experiences supported by internal tutors and managers. The project concluded with the hiring of the best talents. VALUE OF DIVERSITY In terms of diversity and inclusion, Intesa Sanpaolo seeks to introduce personal development and management  policies based on fairness and free of all kinds of discrimination. Inclusion and non-discrimination are values that  underpin all corporate projects and instruments aimed at improving the companys performances, cultivating internal  talent and contributing to the work-life balance of all employees. The theme is far-reaching and therefore involves  various structures both in terms of the assessment of ongoing projects and the planning of new activities. Promoting diversity is first and foremost a managerial and organisational issue with ad hoc initiatives to reward merit,  assist the work-life balance and support the return of employees after maternity/paternity leave and long absences. The company population is balanced between male and female employees (46% men and 54% women). There are  over 13,600 female managers (executives and middle managers) in the Group, representing 28.9% of all personnel  (28.0% in 2016). Women account for 39.6% of all managerial staff. Union agreements have also taken account of this issue since July 2014. The Framework Agreement on inclusion and  equal opportunities had already outlined the Banks commitment to actively involving all of the structures, each in  their own area, in promoting the many existing diversities. This commitment involves promoting measures aimed at  removing any existing obstacles and defining specific actions to help foster the culture of inclusion.  Back in 2015 Intesa Sanpaolo was presented with the Diversity & Inclusion Award Diversitalavoro for the care it  takes in managing inclusion practices for people with disabilities. This provided renewed impetus for the proposals  that were developed by the Welfare, Safety and Sustainable Development Committee in 2016. In particular, close   97 Employees DSA (LEARNING DISABILITIES) PROGRESS FOR WORK This project was launched in collaboration with the Italian Dyslexia Foundation. The goals are the recruitment,  positive integration and promotion of people with dyslexia and other learning disabilities in the working  world. The activity comprises various phases. Following the environmental analysis, with the collection of information on the business processes that  characterise the Bank, the training phase dedicated to employees in the various structures involved began.  The first step in creating a dyslexia-friendly working environment is without doubt understanding and  awareness. The meetings provide an overview on dyslexia: strengths and weaknesses, impact in the work  environment, strategies and useful tips for compensating for difficulties and enabling the real talent of  people to emerge.  The process will continue in 2018 with the definition of best practices and the release of the pocket guides,  and will finish with the final compliance audit that recognises the company official dyslexia-friendly status.  The DSA Progress for Work project is inspired by activities and practices that are already consolidated in the  English-speaking world and is the first concrete effort in Italy to support companies and dyslexic people in  the interests of both. attention was focused on the management of age diversity and the problems that the lengthening of our working  lives may create in terms of professional development and integrated welfare policies. In 2017 Intesa Sanpaolo once again received the Diversity & Inclusion Award, which is given to companies that  promote job placement policies for disadvantaged persons that focus on promoting their talent and skills. On the basis of the analyses, investigations and proposals formulated by the Committee, in 2017 Intesa Sanpaolo  and the Trade Unions signed the Sustainable Development Protocol which defines positive actions aimed at providing  an additional work-life balance tool for employees with serious illnesses and/or over 60 years of age. In addition, in  order to provide a further solution to better reconcile personal needs with those of the work environment, through  the progressive and gradual management of the flexibility of working hours, employees that are going to meet the  legal requirements for early retirement or an old-age pension between 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2020  were able to request the transformation of their employment relationship into a part-time position with a reduction  in their salary and the continuation of the mandatory social security contributions recognised for full time positions. For employees that are over 60 or that suffer from serious illness, the same Protocol also introduces trial counselling  measures, flexible work according to individual needs and priority consideration in the event of requests for transfers  for distances over 70 km from the employees home. There was a new intake of people with disabilities, who are guaranteed a starting position that reflects their skills and  needs as well as a professional development plan for the future. Four training courses were held in 2017 involving  132 employees for a total of over 730 hours provided. Among the international subsidiary banks, Privredna Banka Zagreb, together with other Croatian organisations,  has signed the Diversity Charter, a European Commission initiative that sees 19 nations committed to promoting  and reporting initiatives to support diversity and non-discrimination in the workplace. As well as promoting internal projects in the area of inclusion and gender diversity, Intesa Sanpaolo is also  particularly active in supporting external initiatives. The Group is one of the founding members and supporters of the Valore D Association, the association of businesses  to promote female diversity, talent and leadership for the growth of companies and the country, which this year  launched the Manifesto for Female Employment in addition to organising numerous other training sessions on the  topic that were attended by various Group managers. In collaboration with Valore D, Intesa Sanpaolo supports Inspiring Girls Italy, an initiative of great educational and  cultural value that aims to help young women understand their talent and potential before embarking on fulfilling  training paths also in traditionally male-dominated areas. Another project carried out together with the City of  Milan, in synergy with Inspiring Girls Italy, is STEMintheCity (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics), an  educational initiative that promotes the sciences among adolescents and which is endorsed by, amongst others,  the United Nations, the Prime Ministers Office – Equal Opportunities Department, and the Ministry of Education,  University and Research (MIUR).  98 Employees OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 103-2; EMPLOYEE WELFARE 103-2 Employee well-being WELFARE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE COMPANY Intesa Sanpaolo has chosen a corporate welfare model that operates within an integrated system and includes:  the supplementary pension, supplementary health care, the cultural, recreation and sports association for  Intesa Sanpaolo Group employees (ALI) and the Fondazione Intesa Sanpaolo Onlus (Intesa Sanpaolo Foundation  NPO), as well as mobility management activities (see page 109) and activities focused on the needs of people  and the work-life balance. The company welfare system seeks to address the key issues in order to establish the best possible work-life  balance for employees and their families. It does this by promoting sustainable solutions and projects consistent  with their expectations. The activities are managed and monitored by the Employment Policy Department. During meetings of the Welfare, Safety and Sustainable Development Committee, a bilateral body set up  also with the aim of further improving the wellbeing of employees, representatives of the company and  the workers dedicate specific sessions to analysing and examining issues relating to assistance, services for  families and the more balanced use of time, identifying suitable improvement and awareness initiatives with  the aim of reconciling the companys organisational requirements with the personal lives of its employees. With the trial having finished at the end of 2015, the Flexible Work project continued in 2017 involving  an increasing number of structures and people across the Group (over 8,200 employees) and offering the  possibility of working from home, from different company sites and from the customers premises. In 2015  the project received the Smart Working Award of Milan Polytechnic and in 2016 won the SMAU Innovation  award, also receiving an honourable mention at the AIFIN Cerchio dOro awards for Financial Innovation.  Since 2017 it has also been possible to carry out flexible training at home. In addition, the extension of Flexible Work in the International Subsidiary Banks Division is under evaluation:  the feasibility analysis began with three pilot banks at the end of 2017; in the event of a positive outcome,  Flexible Work will be introduced in the these Banks by 2018. Another innovative instrument is the Time Bank, introduced with the trade union agreement of October  2015 in the area of the work-life balance and fully implemented in the following 2-year period, 2016-2017.  This reserve of time is made available by the company and employees so they can provide greater support  for people in difficulty, even for brief periods, and give them more time. It is also an initiative that appeals to  our generosity and spirit of comradeship because, in addition to the hours made available by the company,  with an initial reserve of 50,000 hours, every employee has the possibility of donating a little of their leave or  holidays to the bank, which the company will then match, up to a maximum of another 50,000 hours. In 2017 employees donated 6,400 hours, which were topped up with the same number of hours by the  company, for an overall total of 63,000 hours. As part of the same Time Bank initiative, a corporate volunteering  project was promoted that enabled 253 people in 2017 to carry out volunteer work, on work days, on behalf  of external associations and bodies chosen by the Group. A total of 1,850 hours of leave were granted. Maternity and paternity support is provided through an excellent company crche service in Florence, Milan,  Moncalieri, Naples and Turin which looks after 255 children, and a network of partner crches right across  Italy. Making the benefits of the companys significant welfare experience available to the community, this year  COMPANY POLICIES In terms of relationships with its employees, the Intesa Sanpaolo Code of Ethics promotes policies that  help foster a better work-life balance; the concrete implementation of this principle takes the form of  specific rules in the area of reconciliation. Welfare is a priority area with actions designed to foster motivation and involvement, placing people at  the centre with the aim of meeting their needs and those of their families. Accordingly, the meetings between the company and the Trade Unions have often centred on policies to  strengthen and fine-tune the instruments that make up the companys welfare package and significantly  contribute to improving the work-life balance of employees and, as such, also their well-being. Well-being that is also protected through the safeguarding of health and safety in the workplace via  increasingly effective measures, as outlined in the Groups Health and Safety Policy and Code of Ethics.  The internal regulations establish a System of Roles and Responsibilities - in the shape of company rules  and operating guidelines affecting many different parties - with regard to particular professional skills,  i.e. specific company departments.  99 Employees 201-3 crches were also opened for children who are long-term patients at hospitals in Monza and Naples, following  the one opened in Turin in 2016 (see page 82). Furthermore, following the October 2015 agreement on the  work-life balance, facilitation is available to fathers in the form of additional leave in the event of the birth of  a child. This amounts to a 10% increase in the compensation due if they take parental leave. Additional leave  is also granted in the case of parents that provide assistance to children with learning difficulties. As regards the supplementary pension plan, following the conclusion of the first phase, launched by the  collective agreements of October 2015 with the institution and the introduction of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group  defined contribution Pension Fund (5 billion euro and 65,000 subscribers at the end of 2017), work continued  to expand the offer and streamline the financial structure of the Fund, which currently comprises 5 financial  segments and 1 insurance segment. Subscribers can therefore make their own investment choices, distributing  their capital in one or more of the available areas. Gradual increase plans involving up to 3.5% of company  contributions are also available, particularly in favour of young employees, i.e. newly-hired permanent staff,  as well as employees that until now have not subscribed to any form of supplementary pension. It is also  possible to subscribe dependent family members, take out additional insurance coverage and continue to  subscribe to the Fund having reached retirement age. In 2017 agreements were signed with the Trade Unions  which also involved the pension funds of the former Venetian Banks, whose subscribers will be transferred to  the Intesa Sanpaolo Pension Fund in 2018. SUPPLEMENTARY GROUP HEALTH FUND As regards healthcare, the Group Health Fund, an NPO whose actions are inspired by cooperative and  social solidarity values, offers subscribers and their families supplementary and replacement services  for those provided by the National Health Service. In 2017 it provided services worth 147 million  euro, net of excesses. Following the 2016 campaign dedicated to cardiovascular prevention, this  year saw the conclusion of the osteoporosis prevention campaign, which involved the participation  of 10,800 women, and the start of work on the 2018 campaign to combat skin tumours. Major  risk coverage was extended to the 23,000 employees of the international subsidiary Banks and the  approved dentists network was expanded to improve the proximity of the service to subscribers and  the sustainability of the Fund. For the International Subsidiary Banks Division the International Healthcare Programme was launched,  an initiative that seeks to offer employees of the Division on permanent contracts an healthcare benefit.   The initiative makes it possible to access a network of second opinion services that include cutting- edge medical consultations and healthcare treatments in top-level health facilities in different countries to  those where employees live and/or work, as well as a series of complementary services (visa assistance,  hospitalisation, accommodation for accompanying persons, travel etc.). The service is activated in the event  that serious illnesses (cancer, transplants, highly complex surgery etc.) are diagnosed and covers all necessary  expenses to travel to the chosen facility, stay in the foreign country, perform the medical treatment/surgery  required by the employee and meet the related medical costs that will have to be borne when they return  home. The programme was launched in all International Subsidiary Banks in December 2017. Another form of corporate welfare is represented by the Associazione Lavoratori Intesa Sanpaolo – ALI (Intesa  Sanpaolo Workers Association), which seeks to bring people together, also using innovative methods, and to  promote personal services and initiatives to improve the work-life balance. ALI adopts programmes with a strategic vision while taking an executive approach to identify actions that  can really help workers reconcile their working lives with their private lives (for example, Junior campus and  Welcare family, a multi-channel system that offers services for the family and administrative consultancy [i]). In collaboration with the Intesa Sanpaolo Innovation Center, ALI carried out an innovative sharing economy  initiative with the creation of the ALI Group community on the TimeRepublik portal which enables members  to exchange their free time and share their skills and passions. In October 2017 the project received the  Innovation in Human Capital prize at the BAI (Bank Administration Institute) Global Innovation Awards in  Atlanta, in the US. Through the Fondazione Intesa Sanpaolo Onlus (Intesa Sanpaolo Foundation NPO), efforts to combat financial  and social hardship have continued and this has translated into support for employees, former employees and  retired employees in difficulty following the recent earthquakes, the promotion of art and culture with the  issuing of university study grants and, on a trial basis, PhD study grants for disadvantaged students. Last but  not least, financial support was provided for entities which operate directly in the field of solidarity and social   100 Employees OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 103-2/103-3 EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT The Internal Communications Service is responsible for developing a common culture based on corporate values and  fostering the sense of belonging of employees. An integrated system which, as well as the structured consultation  of employees, is made up of instruments like the Intranet, Corporate TV and the House organ which foster the  continuous sharing of information, engagement, the sharing of objectives and active participation in changes. Many activities were carried out in 2017: employees were asked to submit their ideas for the new Business Plan  (13,000 employees involved, of which 10,000 in Italy and 3,000 abroad), Il Codice della Bellezza (The Beauty  Code) was published to mark the first ten years of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, an engagement and information  activity carried out to foster the integration of employees from the former Venetian Banks.  In addition, Mosaico International was launched in July, making it possible to extend the Groups internal  communications globally in English (over 100 articles published with a total of 9,000 accesses). Structured listening is a tool that can provide support to the top management and the company structures with  regard to issues and specific requirements or project activities. To this end, during the year there was an increase  in the number of initiatives in this area (feedback, surveys, focus groups, web focus etc.) in Italy and abroad. Over  60 listening activities, 35% more compared with 2016, with the involvement of almost 40,000 people from the  Group Divisions and Intesa Sanpaolo Group Services.  One example was the survey on CSR issues carried out on a sample of 1,500 employees in order to contribute to  the stakeholder engagement process (see page 123). HEALTH AND SAFETY The Safety and Protection Department is responsible within the Group for overseeing health and safety activities.  Intesa Sanpaolo has adopted and successfully implemented an Occupational Health and Safety Management  System identifying, within its organisational structure, responsibilities, procedures, processes and resources for  implementing the company policy on the protection of employees. The risks to the health and safety of employees  are evaluated according to a multidisciplinary approach, considering the combined effect of the working  environment, processes and equipment as well as the subjective conditions of workers. The health and safety risk management process comprises the following phases:   identification of dangers and their classification;   risk assessment;   identification and preparation of prevention and protection measures and procedures;   definition of an action plan as part of a programme to guarantee the improvement of safety levels over time,  with the identification of the competent company structures;   realisation of the planned measures as part of the programme;   definition of worker information and training programmes;   monitoring of the implementation of the programmes and checks on the application and effectiveness of the  measures adopted;   management of residual risks. Intesa Sanpaolo (as Employer) – with the collaboration of the Head of the Prevention and Protection Service and  the Qualified Physicians and following the consultation of the Workers Representatives in charge of Safety - drafts  and updates the Risk Assessment Document which contains, among other things:   the report on the assessment of all health and safety risks during working activities, which also specifies the  criteria adopted for the assessment;   an indication of the prevention and protection measures implemented and the individual protection equipment  adopted following the assessment;   the programme of measures regarded as suitable for guaranteeing an improvement in safety levels over time;   an outline of the procedures for the implementation of the measures to carry out, as well as the  responsible company roles. The assessment and the relative document are updated on the basis of technical developments as well as significant  changes to the production process and organisational structure of the company that may impact on the risk exposure  of workers. This commitment was fulfilled in 2017 by making the updated document available to all personnel. welfare with targeted projects. The overall sum set aside by the Board of Directors in 2017 came to around 3  million euro and included the allocation for canteens and dormitories for the poor and needy. The activities  carried out by the Fondazione Intesa Sanpaolo Onlus are outlined in detail on the corporate website [i].  101 Employees OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 103-3 The process for managing risks at the Groups sites, implemented in close collaboration with the competent  company functions, resulted in an overall reduction in risks of 22% between December 2016 and November 2017. In September 2017 a process began to update the risk assessment for all branches and sites of the former  Venetian Banks. This was completed in December and the new risk factor survey will therefore form part of  the 2018 action plan. The post-robbery support programme continued in 2017, providing medical and psychological support - according  to the seriousness of the trauma suffered - to employees that have been victims of such incidents. The programme  involved all branches where robberies or attempted robberies have taken place. Thirty activities were organised  involving over 100 employees. Since 2017 this initiative has also been extended to include incidents of verbal or physical violence and all traumatic  events (e.g. natural disasters) brought to the attention of the Prevention and Protection Service. Due to the  uniqueness of such events, the Traumatic Events Management team provided employees with specific assistance  programmes according to the gravity of the situation and the state of health of the employees involved. Other important initiatives were held throughout the year including the updating of the assessment of the  amount of time spent at video terminals for personnel that work in branches with the new layout. The method  used was work sampling which, already employed in the Group for several years, is based on a statistical  mathematical model which, following a significant number of samples, makes it possible to determine how  much time a homogeneous group of workers spends at the video terminal. 19 work sampling days were held  for branches with the new layout. This assessment was also updated for personnel that work in the Intesa Sanpaolo Head Office Departments  using the job analysis method. All of assessments carried out defined the list of homogenous groups of workers exposed to video terminal  risks. Currently over 17,000 employees undergo health surveillance for this risk.  In addition to the work-related stress and video terminal usage times already described, further job analysis  was carried out in relation to the networks new branch organisational model. This entailed collecting  the ergonomic perceptions of employees that work in this type of branch through the issuing of specific  questionnaires and the analysis of the ensuing results in order to examine the following aspects in each of the  types of workstation used: comfort (satisfaction due to the absence of discomfort); ease of use (satisfaction  due to effectiveness and efficiency of use); microclimate. Given the gradual ageing of the population, the working population included, and the speed of technological  and digital advancement, it is essential to understand how aging workers perceive the technological  innovations and to define models for integrating the resources and skills of workers and the companys  digital technologies. To this end, a trial project was set up to evaluate the physical and psychological state  of health of personnel that work in this type of branch. The project gave employees the opportunity to sign  up, on a voluntary basis, to a programme of medical check-ups performed by local qualified physicians. The  results were used to produce a specific epidemiological report, also with the use of standardised scales and  measurements like the Work Ability Index. 85 branches with the new layout took part in the project as well  as over 900 employees.  WORK-RELATED STRESS RISK ASSESSMENT In 2017 the work-related stress risk assessment for staff of the Intesa Sanpaolo Head Office Departments  was updated, thus continuing the work begun at the end of 2016 with Intesa Sanpaolo Group Services: a  total of 52 meetings were held for the issuing of specific data collection questionnaires. The work-related stress risk assessment was also updated for the Group Banks in Italy, particularly  with regard to the branches with the new layouts (see page 65). For these, in addition to the so-called  preliminary assessment requested by the INAIL method, 10 focus groups were organised in Milan, Turin,  Rome and Naples with the collaboration of the Department of Clinical and Community Sciences of the  University of Milan. A number of managers, coordinators and directors from this new type of branch  had been invited to take part. The analyses carried out did not highlight any critical issues. All the  results of the assessment updates are documented in the Risk Assessment Document which is available  to all employees.  102 Employees OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 103-2; 403-1; 403-4 BRITISH OHSAS 18001:2007 CERTIFICATION FOR OHSMS In 2017 the Intesa Sanpaolo Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) was certified  as compliant with the British OHSAS 18001:2007 standard. The verification process, carried out by an  independent third-party body, involved the direct assessment of activities by way of audits in the various  organisational structures (21 branches and the Turin skyscraper), interviews with staff (at all levels, including  supplier personnel), the analysis of documents and records, and the evaluation of the effectiveness of actions  implemented in response to the findings of internal audits. WORKER SAFETY REPRESENTATIVES (WSR) Following a 2016 union agreement the Groups Worker Safety Representatives (WSR) were elected. Their  areas of responsibility are defined on a geographical basis. In 2017 the names of the elected Representatives were communicated on the company intranet; their  number later increased following the operation to acquire the former Venetian Banks and currently  comprises 128 employees. A programme of dedicated training activities was carried out between June and October 2017.  Thanks to this series of activities it was possible to make the procedures for consultation and participation  in the overall health and safety management system fully operative, as established by the regulations. With the aim of strengthening its supervision of occupational health and safety in the international subsidiary banks  of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, a project was launched which involved gap analysis audits based on the OHSAS  18001 standard in 2016 and the analysis of the evidence collected in 2017. Generally speaking a good level of  compliance with the requirements of the law was identified, which in some cases represent the main drivers of the  activities. Taking account of the need to harmonise the approach of the international subsidiaries also around the  issue of health and safety, the Safety and Protection Department and the International Subsidiary Banks Division  have defined a strengthening plan inspired by Group best practices and focused on continuous improvement. The  plan is based on four pillars: organisational clarity, the sharing of common methodologies through Guidelines for  the health and safety systems, the development of the expertise of the specialist teams, and the involvement of  the top management. More specifically, in 2017 a meeting was organised with the top management with the goal of sharing approaches  and considerations on the project and an analysis of the current state of monitoring was launched in order to  identify a target profile which, in 2018, will lead to the standardisation of practices among international branches. As well as respect for laws, regulations and signed agreements, the Occupational Health and Safety  Management System aims to monitor and carry out activities aimed at identifying and mitigating the effects  of the dangers that can lead to accidents and professional diseases. To further minimise residual risks,  continuous improvement actions are performed. Another goal is effective communications between the Bank  and its employees with meetings and training on Health and Safety issues.  Environment and Climate change  104 Environment and Climate change RELEVANT ISSUES Direct environmental impacts  page 106 Greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption  page 107 Responsible management of resources  page 110 Green economy  page 112 Loans and services for the green economy  page 112 Green culture and initiatives  page 114 WHY THESE ISSUES ARE RELEVANT  Climate change is an extremely relevant phenomenon whose consequences are not only limited to the environment  but have major repercussions also for the social dynamics of the present and future generations. This is clearly borne out by the recent Climate Change Conferences, the initiatives of the European Commission and  the high-profile working groups that are gradually being formed to gather the contributions of international experts  from the areas of civil society, the finance industry and the academic world, as well as representatives of European  and international institutions and associations from the finance industry. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosures and the High Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance appointed by the European Commission, for  example, stand out for their contribution in terms of accelerating the transition towards a low-carbon economy  through the drafting of Guidelines for the development of a sustainable finance strategy. The National Energy  Strategy, the 10-year plan developed by the Italian Government with the aim of making the domestic energy  industry more competitive, safer and more sustainable, moves in the same direction, contributing to decarbonisation  as per the commitments made under the Paris Agreement. In this context, Intesa Sanpaolo is a financial institution that assists this transition both through its actions to mitigate  its direct emissions and through its support for the business community. PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND RESULTS ACHIEVED In 2017 the Group continued its commitment to reducing its environmental footprint also through the  development of projects aimed at promoting the efficient use of natural resources, support for research and  innovation in the area of improving energy performances, and the analysis of the risks and opportunities that  derive from climate change. In terms of green loans, around 1.3 billion euro was disbursed in favour of renewable energy, energy efficiency  and environmental protection. In addition, in June 2017 Intesa Sanpaolo became the first Italian bank to issue  a Green Bond of 500 million euro.

The Groups Code  of Ethics and the Rules for environmental and energy policy, approved by the top management, define the  principles and guidelines that regulate the environmental responsibility of the Group and the monitoring  of the direct and indirect impact of its activities. With reference to the direct environmental impacts of the  Banks operations, an ISO-certified Environmental and Energy Management System has been implemented  and the positions of Energy Manager and Mobility Manager have been introduced. The Group also monitors  the indirect impact of the activities of its customers and suppliers in the knowledge that the granting of  loans and purchasing choices can encourage them to take environmental responsibility. The Intesa Sanpaolo  Group also closely manages the risks connected with climate change in order to promote adaptive behaviour  or conduct designed to mitigate them and, at the same time, to develop a culture centred on prevention.  The monitoring of these risks is based on the processes established for the governance and implementation  of the Group Code of Ethics, the Environmental and Energy Management System and the sustainability  reporting, which make it possible to identify goals and action plans aimed at guaranteeing effective risk  monitoring (see page 53). A dedicated structure – the Corporate Social Responsibility Sub-Department (CSR) – has the task of  overseeing the areas that fall under the Groups social and environmental responsibility, including the more  specific issue of climate change, through the planning, management and monitoring of sustainability policies  and instruments. The CSR Sub-Department reports to the Managing Director, CEO and Board of Directors  through the Chief Governance Officer and collaborates with a network of Delegates in the various Group  structures, in Italy and abroad. Furthermore, the Safety and Protection Head Office Department, which  reports directly to the Managing Director and CEO, is responsible for governing the Environmental and  Energy Management System adopted by the Group and promoting improvement objectives, guaranteeing  the maintenance of international ISO certification in collaboration with the competent structures. CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION PLAN In accordance with the environmental responsibility commitments undertaken by the Group, since 2009 Intesa  Sanpaolo has set itself mid- to long-term goals through the creation of specific Action Plans. The first Intesa Sanpaolo  Environmental Plan covered the four-year period 2009-2013, and was followed by the plan relating to 2013-2016.  Both Plans set themselves measurable goals in the areas of energy savings, economic savings and the reduction of  CO2 emissions. The scope of the plans, limited to Italy in the first Plan, has gradually increased with the inclusion of  various International Subsidiary Banks. Given the positive experience of these Plans, in 2017 the CSR Sub-Department, in association with the Real Estate  and Logistics, Procurement, Human Resources, Information Systems, Safety and Protection Head Office Departments  and the International Subsidiary Banks Division, drafted a new Environmental Plan - the Climate Change Action  Plan - with targets for 2022 and 2037. This Plan was reviewed by the Risks Committee and approved by the CEO. In  the new Plan the Intesa Sanpaolo Group outlines its goals as regards reducing the CO2 emissions connected with its  activities, taking 2012 as its reference year, also for the emission factors, in order to put its results in their historical  context. The CSR Sub-Department will monitor the achievement of the targets on an annual basis, with any variations  in scope taken into account, and the results will be analysed with the relative competent structures. The goals for  2022 include a reduction in absolute emissions connected with energy consumption (direct and indirect) of 37%  compared with 2012 (a 31% reduction was recorded in the period 2012-2016). The Plan also includes goals related to consumption and energy production from renewable sources, and more specifically:   an increase in the use of renewable energy sources, from 76% at the end of 2012 to 81% by the end of 2022;   the maintenance of electricity production levels from photovoltaic energy (over 1,000 MWh in 2016), taking  account of the restrictions and characteristics of the real estate assets. Finally, in accordance with the international climate change agreements, long-term targets for 2037 have been set  which will be monitored and eventually reviewed at 5-year intervals.

In particular, the certification scope covers a sample of operating units (over 220) which, also  in 2017, were awarded compliance certification pursuant to the ISO 14001 (new version) and ISO 50001 international  standards. The System monitors all activities and operations carried out in the above operating units which have, or  may have, an effect on the surrounding environment, and is subject to periodic controls and internal audits aimed at  guaranteeing the compliance of the System with the requirements of the reference standards and the principles of  the continuous improvement of environmental and energy performances. The top management of Intesa Sanpaolo is committed to the development and application of the EEMS through an  annual plan that includes the review of all significant environmental and energy aspects and the definition of annual  objectives that are consistent with the Rules for the environmental and energy policy. Various company functions  are involved in applying the Management System: Safety and Protection Head Office Department, Real Estate and  Logistics Head Office Department, CSR Sub-Department and Training Department. In addition, there is an EEMS  Delegate in every operating unit with whom the various structures interface for aspects in their remit. With the extension of the certification scope to another 25 operating units in 2017, every Bank in the Banca dei  Territori Division of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group is represented in the Management System by a variable number  of operating units which altogether, in terms of systems, climate zone, size and organisational characteristics,  ensure that the sample is representative. The goals pursued, through the attentive monitoring of environmental  aspects and energy use, have made it possible to improve performances in terms of the supervision of  environmental risks, the reduction and optimisation of consumption, the awareness of employees and the  involvement of internal departments asked to contribute to the functioning of the System in various ways. For  all of these reasons and in the context of continuous improvement, as per the reference regulations, the gradual  extension of the certification scope is foreseen. CIB Bank (Hungary) has also maintained its certification according to the UNI CEI EN ISO 50001 standard. At the  end of 2017 the Bank renewed the certification of its properties (83) and services thanks also to the installation  of data loggers in some branches, improving the management of the data centres and replacing old systems with  highly energy-efficient systems. The efficiency measures also regarded office machinery with more advanced models  purchased and around 700 items of equipment donated to the Order of Malta. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION The mitigation and containment of CO2 emissions play an important role in the policies of the Group  which, with the Climate Change Action Plan, has identified specific medium-term actions for reducing its  environmental footprint and, as a result, its emissions. This in the context of the continuous improvement of  its environmental performance which has already seen major reductions in the electricity and thermal energy  consumption, and the subsequent emissions, over the last decade (53.6% reduction in Scope1 + Scope2  Market-based emissions compared to 2008). 2017 saw an increase in electricity and thermal energy consumption (+0.9% compared to 2016) mainly  due to the more rigid weather conditions recorded in some months of the year and the extension of the  organisational reporting boundary.  Scope1 + Scope2 Market-based greenhouse gas emissions were also up by 3.8%, primarily because of the  higher emission factors compared with 2016. The Intesa Sanpaolo Group also calculates Scope1 + Scope2  emissions using the Location-based method (201,813 tonnes +5.9%), which does not take account of the  benefits deriving from the purchase of certified energy from renewable sources. In general, the Intesa Sanpaolo Groups greenhouse gas emissions are reported in CO2 equivalent in accordance  with the international GHG Protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol), in the form of:   Scope1 direct emissions, relating to the use of fuel for heating and the fleet;   Scope2 indirect emissions for centralised air-conditioning and electricity;   Scope3 indirect emissions deriving from activities connected with the company but not directly controlled  by it (paper, waste, office machinery etc.). With the goal of continuous improvement, there was also an expansion in the reporting of Scope3 indirect  emissions in 2017, which included emissions generated by energy carriers in the natural gas supply chain, in  the production of the energy sources used in the electricity mix and in the distribution and transformation  of electricity itself. On an annual basis Intesa Sanpaolo also drafts a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory in which it provides a  detailed report of the emissions generated by the operating units included in the certification scope of the  Environmental and Energy Management System (EEMS). MATERIALS 103-2; ENERGY 103-2/103-3; WATER 103-2; EMISSIONS 103-2 EMISSIONS 103-3; 305-1; 305-2; 305-3; 305-5; EFFLUENTS AND WASTE 103-2;  ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 103-2; EX FS2; DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS 103-2/103-3  108 Environment and Climate change These emissions derive from the production and consumption of thermal energy, electricity consumption, air  conditioning systems, paper consumption and fuel consumption by the company fleet of vehicles. Drafted in  accordance with the UNI EN ISO 14064 standard, the Inventory undergoes an annual certification audit by an  external body. The reference scope has gradually and continuously expanded; for this reason the emissions  generated by the new Turin Headquarters were also added to the Inventory in 2017. This expansion resulted  in a slight increase in emissions (under 3%) mainly due to the Turin skyscrapers paper consumption and  company fleet. EFFICIENCY AND OPTIMISATION OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION In accordance with the multi-year plan, the actions and measures to reduce electricity and thermal energy  consumption continued in 2017 in both Italy and the International Subsidiary Banks, where there is an increasing  awareness of energy efficiency issues. The actions undertaken confirm that the Intesa Sanpaolo Group also  assesses the potential risks connected with climate change that may influence the future management costs of the  properties (see page 53). Below are some of the initiatives: Finally, in line with the Rules of environmental sustainability for the development of sustainable branches,  the site renovations or the development of new branches are carried out in accordance with criteria for the  improvement of energy and management efficiency: since 2008 around 1,000 Group buildings have undergone  energy certification processes. Thanks to the measures introduced in recent years, in Italy the Group was able to claim tax deductions of around  6 million euro in 2014-2017, around 1.75 million euro of which relative to 2017. Project Description Forecast annual savings Measurement of electricity  consumption (Italy) Investment:  137,000 euro Around 60 new datalogger were  installed.

As regards the purchase of electricity from renewable sources, in 2017 the Group reached an overall consumption  percentage of around 82.3%. Notwithstanding the use of self-produced energy from cogeneration at the Parma  site (incidence of around 1% with economic savings of around 192,000 euro), in Italy the purchase of energy from  traditional sources has been almost completely eliminated. The situation in the International Subsidiary Banks is  different with national legislation imposing various limits in some cases. In any case, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank (Slovenia)  has eliminated its emissions by using 100% hydroelectric energy while Privredna Banka Zagreb (Croatia) purchases  over 50% of its electricity from renewable sources. Additionally, despite market restrictions, part of the electricity  used by Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania, VB Banka (Slovakia), Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Romania and CIB Bank (Hungary)  comes from renewable sources thanks to the national energy mix.  Although limited by the type of property, the self-production of renewable photovoltaic energy rose by 8.3% in the  14 Italian and 2 Slovenian sites in 2017 with total annual production exceeding 1,156 MWh.  Thanks to the government incentive and the economic savings stemming from the fact that no energy was purchased  at the three main photovoltaic plants (Moncalieri, Settimo Torinese and Sarmeola di Rubano), the financial return in  Italy in 2017 came to around 290,000 euro.  Finally, in line with Italian Legislative Decree 28/11, consideration was given to the thermal energy produced in Italy  using heat pump air conditioning systems with around 2,800 tonnes of CO2 emissions avoided as a result. MOBILITY Forming part of the Human Resources Department, the Mobility Management function is dedicated to assisting  with the commutes of employees to improve their quality but also to promote sustainable modes of transport.   The goal is to translate the feedback from employees into concrete actions in order to provide a structured  range of options for daily commutes and implement the actions of the Home-Work Commuting Plans. In 2017  a questionnaire was prepared to get a better understanding of the demand for home-work mobility among  employees, how their behaviour has changed and which areas of improvement to focus on in the near future. The main goals pursued by the Intesa Sanpaolo Group are: the reduction in the use of private individual transport,  as requested by the so-called Italian Decreto Ronchi, the improvement of road safety, as established by the  international ISO 39001:2012 standard, and the reduction of the Groups CO2 emissions. As regards the last of these objectives and taking account of the union agreement signed on the work-life balance  (which also introduced measures to help people that work a long way away and that have specific personal needs  to move closer to their residence or home), below is a summary of the most important initiatives:   the spread of Flexible Work, which innovatively combines the management of peoples private lives with the  company's organisational requirements (see page 98);   the Mobility Office platform which promotes the use of public transport, enabling employees to request annual  season tickets directly from their workstation and also to take advantage of discounted rates with the option of  paying in instalments (the service is active in the cities of Bologna, Florence, Milan, Naples, Padua, Rome, Turin  and Venice and will gradually be extended to other cities);   company shuttle service available in Turin, Milan, Naples, Padua, Venice and Vicenza, which has a positive impact  on the environment (an estimated 397 tonnes of CO2 avoided) as well as on peoples quality of life;   development of car and bike sharing services. In Italy ALI (Associazione Lavoratori di Intesa Sanpaolo)  has  formed partnerships with the main networks in Bologna, Florence, Milan, Naples, Padua, Rome, Turin and  Venice. Similar solutions are also available at Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Romania, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank (Slovenia)  and Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania with bicycles owned by the Bank. At Privredna Banka Zagreb (Croatia) and  CIB Bank (Hungary) employees can take advantage of special parking facilities and services (changing rooms and  showers) and the application of discounts on purchases of bicycles and accessories;   management of the company fleet through precise choice criteria and usage guidelines that promote respect  for the environment. In this context the process of updating the company fleet has continued with Euro 4 and 5  vehicles replaced by Euro 6 vehicles, which have more than doubled in number since last year;   remote communications developed for both listening activities (internal communications web focus groups  managed online) and work activities with the gradual increase in the use of Skype for Business (instant messaging,  voice over IP or online meetings) instead of business trips/transfers. ENERGY 103-2  110 Environment and Climate change COMPANY CAR POOLING With the aim of inverting the findings of internal investigations, which suggest that a large number  of employees go to work in their own car, a pilot company car pooling project was launched in  November 2017 involving around 90 employees from the Milan-Bisceglie site. Car pooling is a mode  of transport based on the sharing of private cars by multiple people with compatible routes and  timetables. The aim is to share the car for commutes in order to improve the quality of transfers,  make savings on transport expenses, and reduce traffic, pollution and road accidents. Using an app,  created for the specific needs of Intesa Sanpaolo, a trial initiative was developed that facilitates the  matching of travel supply and demand and the sharing of the relative costs, with the possibility of  managing the disbursement of incentives, in the form of fuel and parking vouchers, and forming a  network of users. Car pooling is already active at the Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania, CIB Bank (Hungary) and Banca  Intesa Beograd (Serbia) with positive results. RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES  According to the Code of Ethics and the Rules for the environmental and energy policy, the Groups responsibilities  include the close evaluation of the consequences of its activities on ecosystems and the reduction of its environmental  footprint. For this reason the responsible management of resources is a priority issue for the Intesa Sanpaolo Group  in its attempts to mitigate its impact on the environment. PAPER  In accordance with the Sustainability rules for the purchase and use of paper and derivative materials, the  reduction in paper consumption continued in 2017, falling by around 919 tonnes compared with 2016 (-12.3%).  In 2017, the Groups work in Italy focused on the implementation of various paperless initiatives, which involved  the reduction of data sheets, the consultation of information sheets on screens, online statements, the Zero  Carta project in training initiatives and, above all, the project for the digitisations of contracts and accounts.  Thanks to these actions, it was possible to avoid the use of about 3,720 tonnes of paper, corresponding to a  reduction in CO2 emissions of over 7,680 tonnes with cost savings of about 4.3 million euro. As regards the International Subsidiary Banks, the Paperless Branches project, launched in 2014 at Privredna  Banka Zagreb (Croatia) and extended in 2017 to CIB Bank (Hungary), made it possible to save over 50 tonnes  of paper in 2017.  An important contribution to the reduction of paper consumption is made by the multichannel projects in Italy  and the Digical project for the Groups International Subsidiary Banks (see page 64). OTHER GREEN PURCHASES In 2017, around 42 tonnes of environmentally-friendly stationery was purchased in Italy. In line with the Sustainability rules for the purchase of office machines, the Bank assesses the environmental impact  connected with the purchase and responsible use of the following equipment: photocopiers, printers, desktop  computers, computer monitors and standalone computers, notebooks. In 2017 the environmental criteria were also  used for the purchase of ATMs/MTAs. In the promotion of sustainability aspects due consideration is given both to legislation and relevant compliance  requirements in force, as well as to specific environmental evaluation criteria. WATER In the Intesa Sanpaolo Group water is predominantly used for hygiene purposes and, to a lesser extent, for the  generation of cold air for air-conditioning. In 2017 the Groups per capita water consumption fell by around 25% compared with 2016, coming to around 19  cubic meters per employee on the basis of the invoices paid during the year.  In Italy the New Headquarters is an excellent example of efficient water management: in 2017 water consumption  was again well below the Group average at around 7 cubic meters per employee. Thanks to the drinking water  dispensers it was possible to avoid the use of 192,000 half-litre plastic bottles, which correspond to a 3,840-tonne  reduction in plastic consumption and an 18-tonne reduction in CO2 emissions. MATERIALS 103-3; 301-1; 301-2; WATER 103-3; 303-1  111 Environment and Climate change HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT The Intesa Sanpaolo Group focuses particular attention on the monitoring and management of hazardous waste for  the environment, including radon and asbestos. Radon is a gas normally present in the subsoil which can however penetrate into closed environments due to the  presence of cracks or the permeability of the foundations of buildings, for example; in such cases it can accumulate  and reach concentrations that are harmful to human health if inhaled. In line with current legislation, which for  underground work spaces fixes thresholds of attention and action depending on the concentration level, the  Safety and Protection Head Office Department carries out campaigns for the measurement of the average annual  concentration in order to protect the health of employees. Where necessary, a communication on the topic is issued  so workers and their representatives are suitably informed on the matter. The campaigns concluded in 2017 did not  highlight any significant risk situations. During the year new measurement campaigns were also launched in the  Region of Puglia, which with a specific ruling fixed lower concentration limits than the national average for non- residential buildings open to the public. In the same way, although the activities carried out by Intesa Sanpaolo employees do not in any way expose workers  to dust and materials containing asbestos, in 2017 the Safety and Protection Head Office Department once again  carried out a specific risk assessment for all workspaces. The measurements, carried out by an external consultant  responsible for storing materials containing asbestos which performs periodic checks according to the timeframes  established by law, confirmed that there is no contamination: all of the values measured are lower than the threshold  established by the laws in force and similar to those present in the external environment. CORRECT WASTE MANAGEMENT The handling of all waste produced at the Groups sites has been entrusted to outside companies that operate in  the local area, have the necessary permits for transporting and/or disposing of waste, and use specifically authorised  vehicles. These companies have been appointed to oversee the collection, sorting, correct temporary deposit and  disposal of the waste. As for waste that is collected separately (e.g. paper, glass, plastic etc.), the management  methods used are those indicated by the municipal regulations. In 2017 the amount of waste produced by the Group came to 3,132 tonnes (34.2 kg per employee), 9.4% down  compared with 2016. More specifically, there was a 27.8% reduction in Italy and an increase in the International  Subsidiary Banks mainly due to the disposal of equipment and material as part of energy efficiency measures. Only 3.6% of waste is disposed of in landfills, 1.6% is incinerated with energy recovery and the remaining 94.8% is  recycled or reused/recovered. In 2017 the regenerated toner project was launched in Italy which involves the partial replacement of black ink  cartridges with regenerated cartridges: around 33% of the toner cartridges purchased during the year for printing  in black and white are regenerated.

As widely demonstrated by international studies and research, climate change can also be regarded as a  business opportunity and an economic development lever. With this in mind, Intesa Sanpaolo is very active  in supporting individuals and businesses committed to reducing their environmental footprints through the  promotion of green products and services. This takes place through the bank branches of the Banca dei  Territori Division and Banca Prossima, the Mediocredito Italiano Energy Desk for business loans, the support  of the Chief Innovation Officer Area for the Circular Economy and innovation and the direct investment of  Equiter in green businesses. In addition, particular importance is given to training and study and research initiatives, as well as to events  on environmental issues held by Intesa Sanpaolo and/or its partners. LOANS AND SERVICES FOR THE GREEN ECONOMY In 2017 the Group allocated 1,256 million euro to the green economy, corresponding to 2.0% of all Group loans.  The offer involves all customer segments: retail customers (8.4%), businesses and Third sector (19.8%), leasing  (0.5%), corporate & public finance (7.1%) and project finance (64.2%). Total disbursements between 2010 and 2017 came to over 16 billion euro with an inconsistent trend also due to  different incentive policies. RETAIL CUSTOMERS With regard to retail customers, the Bank continued to provide loans and mortgages for environmental purposes in  2017. These loans regarded the replacement of fixtures and high-performance boilers, the renovation of buildings  from an energy efficiency perspective, the purchase of environmentally-friendly vehicles and the installation of  solar and photovoltaic panels. In addition, Mutuo Case prefabbricate in legno (loan for prefabricated timber-frame  houses), meets the needs of customers that are more sensitive to environmental issues, channelling resources into the  purchase of wooden buildings that respect specific safety and construction standards. During the year the new Servizio Valorizzazione Immobiliare (Real Estate Enhancement Service), an additional loan  service, became fully operational. It is designed to support customers who intend to invest in their homes through  energy redevelopment and restructuring works, providing free information on tax benefits and savings on energy  bills, as well as to support the best loan and home protection solutions. Customers can also take advantage of  discounts on the services of partners of the initiative which operate in the energy savings and redevelopment sectors. BUSINESSES CUSTOMERS 2017 also saw the ongoing disbursement of short and medium/long-term loans in support of projects for the use of  photovoltaic panels, biomass plants, hydroelectric plants and energy efficiency works for professionals and businesses. With regards to start-ups (see page 77) as part of the Start up Initiative project three editions dedicated to the Circular  Economy were held in Milan and London in 2017.  In total around 20 start-ups were involved and presented to an  audience of over 100 institutional investors and businesses. Businesses can continue to use the Finanziamento Energia Imprese (Businesses Energy Loan), which is designed to  support investment plans focused on the development of efficient energy production plants and diversifying energy  sources and/or streamlining consumption, as well as the Finanziamento Energie Rinnovabili (Renewable Energies Loan),  created for the construction of new plants for the production of renewable energies other than photovoltaic energy,  such as biomass and small-scale wind energy. Mediocredito Italianos contribution was once again quite significant this year: the Bank continued to support  businesses that invest in renewable energy production plants and the energy efficiency of their production  processes, providing dedicated financial solutions and specialist advisory services. During the year loans were  granted to support projects mainly in the photovoltaic, wind and hydroelectric sectors. At the end of 2017  Mediocredito Italianos portfolio in the green sector came to over 1.5 billion euro, equal to around 10% of all  medium and long-term credit. All of the financed projects were carried out in Italy and regarded: photovoltaic  302-5; PRODUCT PORTFOLIO 103-2; FS8; GREEN ECONOMY 103-2/103-3  113 Environment and Climate change plants (79.7%), biomass or biogas plants (6.5%), hydroelectric plants (6.5%), energy efficiency measures (2.4%)  and wind energy plants (4.9%). The financed projects also included energy efficiency measures carried out by energy intensive manufacturing companies  through the installation of cogeneration plants. In order to regulate energy efficiency investments made directly by  businesses, or rather indirectly through the intervention of an ESCo (Energy Service Company), credit guidelines have  been developed for this type of project. All loans, overseen step by step by the specialist Energy Desk, are always preceded by an examination in support of  the Banks credit assessment. Customers can count on a comprehensive service that ranges from risk assessment  to the structuring of the most appropriate financial solutions, and from consultancy on new technology trends to  new market opportunities. In the lease area, 6 new Leasenergy product contracts of a value of 6.2 million euro were signed in 2017, in line with the  trends of the energy lease sector in Italy. The new lease contracts will result in annual emission savings of around 4,400  tonnes of CO2. There are around 1,400 existing lease contracts, which have contributed to the construction of plants for  the production of over 1.7 Gigawatts of energy from renewable sources. The Intesa Sanpaolo Group also continued to pursue its Circular Economy project thanks to which numerous initiatives  and actions were carried out in 2017 to promote the awareness and adoption of this model in various domestic and  international locations. During the year around 40 Italian businesses were subjected to the Circular Economy Standard,  created to verify and analyse the level of circularity of businesses along their value chain, i.e. the innovation of their  business model according to the principles of the circular economy. In addition, the Italian Manifesto for the Circular  Economy was signed which, fruit of a partnership developed during the year with ENEL, involved major Italian businesses  also at international level. Finally, the Insurance Division proposes supplementary insurance coverage for the loans provided for the purchase and  installation of a photovoltaic plant. Polizza Business Fotovoltaico (Photovoltaic Business Insurance policy) protects the  photovoltaic plant from material and unforeseen damage accidentally caused to third parties, protecting the plant from  damage caused by fire, atmospheric events, vandalism, theft, malfunctions or electrical problems, and covering losses in  profits due to the interruption or fall in the production of clean electricity as a result of the insured events. THIRD SECTOR Banca Prossima continues to support Third sector businesses that intend to invest in energy efficiency projects  with solutions that make it possible to save on energy costs and increase the overall sustainability of the social  activity. At the end of 2017 total loans relative to the agreement with Federesco (National Federation of ECSos)  came to 1.5 million euro. These initiatives generated savings of around 545 toe (tonnes of oil equivalent) in  2017, corresponding to around 1,167 tonnes of CO2 avoided. DIRECT INVESTMENTS The subsidiary companies that for several years now have responded to the environmental challenge include  Equiter, in which Intesa Sanpaolo has a 33.7% stake, Compagnia di San Paolo, Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio  di Torino and Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Cuneo. As well as investing its venture capital in the sectors of  the environment, infrastructure and energy with the aim of promoting the socio-economic development of the  territory, Equiter also provides advisory on third-party funds. More specifically, with assets of around 190 million euro, Equiter is the leading operator in Italy in terms of  funds managed as part of the JESSICA programme (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City  Areas). JESSICA is a European Commission initiative in collaboration with the European Investment Bank that  allows the Regions to use part of their structural funds to make sustainable urban development investments,  including projects on energy efficiency and the production of energy from renewable sources, through  financial engineering instruments like the Urban Development Funds. These funds invest by purchasing shares  or making loans to profitable projects, which are therefore able to generate a sufficient enough cash flow  to guarantee a return on the capital invested. In Italy, the JESSICA initiative has been implemented by the  Regions of Sicily, Campania and Sardinia.  Equiter completed the investment of the resources it manages in  the three Regions in 2016, financing 41 projects, 29 of which relating to energy efficiency projects in Sardinia  (of a total value of 37 million euro) and 12 of which relating to urban development in Sicily (90 million euro)  and Campania (63 million euro). In 2017 it monitored the progress of the financed works. Equiter is also an advisor, as well as a direct investor with a 26.8% stake, in the first closed-end fund in Italy  completely dedicated to Public-Private Partnership infrastructure. With a size of 120 million euro, the PPP Italian  Fund has invested in the development of 10 projects in the green sector for the annual production of around 130  GWh of electricity from renewable sources, which have made it possible to avoid 42,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions. Finally, as regards direct investments, Equiter is the sole shareholder of Equiter Energia, an investment vehicle  with a portfolio of plants in the photovoltaic and wind energy sectors with an overall capacity of 13 MWh and  an annual production level of around 28.5 GWh. 302-5  114 Environment and Climate change GREEN BOND In June 2017 Intesa Sanpaolo issued a 500 million euro Green Bond connected with environmental sustainability projects. First issued in 2007 by the EIB (European Investment Bank), Green Bonds are traditional bonds – in terms of their  structure and contractual terms – that must respect specific requirements in terms of the use of funds (they must  be used for green projects), transparency, reporting and the use of proceeds. The commitments undertaken by Intesa Sanpaolo are defined in a set of guidelines (Green Bond Framework)  inspired by the Green Bond Principles, a voluntary protocol that favours the transparency of the operation  and involves the close monitoring of the environmental projects that receive the funds. The compliance of the  framework with these principles was verified by an external ESG research and analysis company. The projects financed by the bond must belong to the following three categories:   infrastructures for the generation and transmission of energy from renewable sources (solar, photovoltaic,  wind, biomass and hydroelectric);   investments in infrastructure or processes for reducing the use of energy and fostering greater energy efficiency;   construction of new buildings or the redevelopment of existing buildings according to the best  environmental standards. The Bond is designed to cover the financial requirements of projects – already part of the Mediocredito Italiano  portfolio or new – which will be selected by a dedicated working group. The Bank also pledges to draft an annual  Green Bond Report which will be certified by a third-party company and published on the company website. The  Report will provide information on the use of the net proceeds of the security and the environmental benefits  stemming from refinanced or newly-financed projects. Lastly, in 2017 Banca IMI, as part of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, participated in six Green Bond issuances,  becoming Italys market leader. GREEN CULTURE AND INITIATIVES One of the goals of the Intesa Sanpaolo Rules for environmental and energy policy is the spread of the culture  of sustainability among both its employees and its customers. This paragraph outlines the main initiatives  launched in 2017. TRAINING The internal training programme gives all employees in Italy the chance to use the Ambientiamo multimedia  platform which in 2017 provided over 900 hours of training on climate change, renewable energies and  correct waste management. In addition, for those that work in operating units covered by Environmental  and Energy Management System certification or in central offices involved in the activities of the EEMS, a  specific course on the issue was also provided in 2017, as established also by the international reference  standards: in 2017 around 200 employees were able to access the online course, joining the 1,800 employees  previously trained. In the same way, subsidiary CIB Bank (Hungary) trained around 1,870 employees on the  obligations relating to the ISO 50001 standard via the online platform. Finally, six meetings were organised  with the participation of Federesco at the Regional Governance Centres of the Banca dei Territori Division:  the initiatives, which involved around 30 employees, sought to raise the awareness of colleagues around  the issues of energy efficiency and the possible savings solutions offered by the world of ESCos. As regards  the issue of socio-environmental risks in loans, in 2017 Banca Intesa Beograd (Serbia) trained around 30  employees from various operating units involved in the application of the procedures established by the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. As for customers, Intesa Sanpaolo Formazione continued to provide the Think Green course to 89 agricultural  entrepreneurs who, focusing particularly on the protection of biodiversity, plan to innovate and develop their businesses. To spread the culture of innovation in the area of the Circular Economy, the promotion of the BioCircE Master  (the first Italian Masters qualification in this area) continued, seven meetings were held with secondary schools  as part of the Italian Alternanza Scuola-Lavoro project and the Intesa Sanpaolo Award for Innovation &  Circular Economy in collaboration with ISSNAF (Italian Scientists and Scholars in North America Foundation) –  which every year acknowledges the best Italian researchers working in the USA and Canada – was presented  in New York. 302-5; EX FS4  115 Environment and Climate change PARTICIPATION IN ASSOCIATIONS AND DEBATES ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES The Group made an important contribution to the international debate on the topic of environmental  sustainability in 2017, which was also useful in preventing risks related to regulatory changes. In the area  of green finance it collaborated in an ongoing manner with ABI in specific working groups, participating  for example in the consultation stage regarding the National Energy Strategy. In terms of the European  Commissions initiatives in the development of sustainable finance, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group joined the  Support to Circular Economy Financing expert group of the European Commission.  It also joined the Sustainable  Finance Working Group of the European Banking Federation (EBF) and the Association for Financial Markets  in Europe (AFME). The Group contributed, directly or via trade associations, with observations during the public consultations  on particularly important documents: High Level Expert Group on sustainable finance interim report with  the aim of positively influencing the final report of the HLEG published in 2018, Boosting Green Finance  (the European Banking Federation report) and the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures. It also participated in the MATT – MISE consultation on the circular economy, in the  European-level discussion on the themes of the Green Lending Principles and the Green Supporting Factor,  in the National Observatory on Sustainable Finance promoted by the Italian Ministry of the Environment  and Protection of Land and Sea and UNEP-FI, and in the drafting of the Sustainable Finance and Local  Development document promoted by the Italian Sustainable Finance Forum. In addition, the Group company Studi e Ricerche per il Mezzogiorno (SRM) oversees the activities of the  Maritime Economy Observatory, which aims to reduce road transport and use increasingly environmentally- friendly and high-performance ships with minimum environmental impact. SRM is also part of SOS LOG, the  association for the development of sustainable logistics whose mission is the sharing of information, research  and initiatives aimed at spreading the culture of transport and sustainable logistics. STUDIES The Groups commitment to the development of study and research projects in the environmental field continued in  2017. Some of the most important publications:   Le risorse idriche nellambito della Circular Economy (Water resources in the Circular Economy): to reduce  the withdrawal of water resources, improve situations of water stress and minimise environmental impact,  the study highlighted how the policies of the Circular Economy represent an important step that must  supplement the adaptation of infrastructure and the improvement in management efficiency;   Terzo rapporto sulla bioeconomia (Third report on bioeconomics): the opportunities and challenges  connected with bioeconomics regard the use of renewable resources in production processes, limiting  environmental pressure on ecosystems and reconciling economic development, environmental needs and  changes in the social sphere;   Innovation Trend Report: a study that stems from the in-depth analysis of data and information collected  from hundreds of national and international sources. An exploration of the main megatrends to understand  what they are, what impact they have on consumers and how companies have interpreted them. The trends  identified include the sustainability trend;   Circular Economy Overview and Smart Building Innovation Trend: two innovative studies in collaboration  with Frost & Sullivan. GREEN EVENTS In order to raise the awareness of customers and employees around green issues, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group  participates in various initiatives aimed at spreading the culture of sustainability and good practices as  widely as possible. The main international events in which the Group participated in 2017 were the World  Environment Day promoted by UNEP (the United Nations Environment Programme) and the European Week  for Waste Reduction promoted by the European Commission. In Italy Intesa Sanpaolo also took part in the  Energy Saving Day (part of the M'illumino di meno campaign) while some International Subsidiary Banks  take part in the WWFs Earth Hour. EX FS4  Human rights  117 Human rights WHY THESE ISSUES ARE RELEVANT According to the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, approved in 2011, the State has a duty to  protect human rights and businesses must respect them wherever they operate (regardless of the ability or desire  of States to fulfil their obligations). Victims of abuse in the workplace must also be able to access appropriate and  effective remedies more easily. In fact, through their activities businesses can have various types of impact on human rights: positive impacts,  through the supply of innovative services that improve peoples quality of life; or negative impacts, through the  exploitation of workers, for example, or the enforced transfer of people or entire communities. Businesses can  also be indirectly involved in violations committed by other businesses or States.  In its role as an intermediary, a financial institution like Intesa Sanpaolo activates a value chain that involves many  different individuals, entities, businesses and States. For this reason, as well as respecting the relevant legislation  in force in all countries in which it operates, it is committed to identifying, mitigating and, where possible,  preventing potential violations of human rights connected with its activities, as recommended by the UN Guiding  Principles for Business and Human Rights.

Aware that its activities have direct or indirect impacts on human rights, Intesa Sanpaolo has defined its areas of  responsibility towards each of its stakeholders. In fact, it has considered its impact on its employees, customers, suppliers  and the community. The environment is another theme closely related to the principles of human rights and the  promotion of high environmental standards must therefore be regarded as key to respecting and enjoying these rights. As an issue that is relevant to all areas of the Groups operations, human rights is therefore touched upon throughout  the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement, as summarised in the following table: FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING 103-1; 407-1; CHILD LABOR 103-1; FORCED OR COMPULSORY LABOR 103-1;  RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE 103-1  118 Human rights PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND RESULTS ACHIEVED Approved by the Board of Directors in December 2017, the Group adopted a specific human rights policy which  revisits the principles already outlined in the Code of Ethics and translates them into tangible commitments..

COMPANY POLICIES  Through the Group policy, Human Rights Principles, Intesa Sanpaolo pledges to:   support the protection of human rights according to the principles established in the Universal Declaration  of 1948 and subsequent international conventions on civil and political rights and economic, social and  cultural rights;   recognise the principles established by the fundamental conventions of the ILO (International Labor  Organization) and in particular the right to freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining,  the abolition of forced and child labor, and non-discrimination in employment;   contribute to combating corruption, supporting the guidelines of the OECD (Organisation for Economic  Co-operation and Development) and the anti-corruption principles established by the UN in 2003, and  also by taking a zero tolerance approach to any eventual episodes of corruption. THE PROCESS OF MONITORING HUMAN RIGHTS The implementation and gradual extension of the protection of human rights is monitored by the CSR Sub-Department  in the Chief Governance Officer Area through:   the monitoring of the implementation and governance of the Group Code of Ethics, also with third-party  evaluation in line with the international UNI ISO 26000 standard, with specific evidence of the areas  connected with human rights [i];   the sustainability report, which involves stakeholders and defines improvement objectives and the relative  metrics. It is subject to the certification of an independent auditor outside the Group;   the analysis of potential risk areas in the sphere of human rights which, for every principle in the international  conventions, outlines the possible impacts of the companys operations on its stakeholders and the relative  company regulations.

These activities were  implemented in compliance with the AA1000 AccountAbility standard and the methods of engagement were chosen  according to the specific type of stakeholder and in such a way as to guarantee the best possible representation. The CSR Sub-Department carried out this process in close collaboration with the company functions responsible  for communications and dialogue (e.g. customer experience, internal communications etc.), in line with its  perception of sustainability as a value that is shared throughout the entire company. All activities were managed by an independent third party, without any representatives of the Bank, to guarantee  that all ideas were expressed freely and without any influence. As well as specific topics of interest to each group  of stakeholders, other more indirectly-linked aspects were covered, encouraging dialogue and the consideration  of different points of view. STAKEHOLDER MAP The stakeholder map represents the Bank's network of relations and the results of the engagement activities  in 2017 are presented as summaries in order to highlight the priority topics that emerged in terms of  materiality analysis.

A total of two focus groups were held together with over 4,000 telephone interviews, which regarded four different  categories of stakeholders. There were also 2 questionnaires, which involved over 2,500 people all in all. Direct listening  actions were supplemented with indirect actions in the form of document analysis. The results deriving from the engagement of the individual stakeholder groups were classified on the basis of Intesa  Sanpaolos priority issues. The main results are reported for each topic. Company value and solidity: this issue emerged when listening to almost all stakeholder categories and was  always given maximum priority, constituting an element on which the credibility of CSR actions and policies  depends. The most cross-cutting topic in this area is risk management, not just financial in nature but also socio- environmental, connected in particular with loans and investments. Integrity in corporate conduct: the theme of correct corporate conduct is a priority not only for customers  but also for employees, particularly with regard to the Code of Ethics, highlighting the increasing level of  responsibility assumed around CSR issues. Surveillance, especially in relation to risks connected with corruption,  is a topic that was highlighted by almost all stakeholder categories consulted (during the activities), even if it  cannot be deemed to be critical. These high visibility issues are of great interest to the world of communications  and have a clear impact on the Banks reputation not only with regard to the financial community but also  the social sphere. Employee growth and development: as expected, the biggest contribution to the theme of the development of  employees comes from the same category of stakeholders. The most relevant issues for employees are: transparency  in career advancement and production bonus criteria, the spread of initiatives throughout the network and the  greater involvement of workers in company governance. However, other types of stakeholders, such as Investors  and Suppliers, also showed a lot of interest in issues connected with staff development, particularly in terms of the  application of ESG criteria for performance assessments and promoting diversity. Employee well-being: it is once again employee stakeholders that attribute the greatest significance to the  well-being of workers inside and outside the workplace with the business and welfare policies implemented  by the Bank being the two most important areas. This issue has also been raised by Suppliers, particularly  as regards the monitoring of employee health and safety. The importance attached to this topic shows how  the majority of stakeholders expect the Bank to play a wide-reaching and influential role (also in the areas of  welfare and working environment). SUMMARY OF ISSUES EMERGING FROM THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS  124 102-43; 102-44 Stakeholder engagement Employment protection: Employees rated this issue as very important, suggesting the development of an  organic employment plan, for example. Investors also placed major emphasis on this topic. Highlighting the  importance of the spread of CSR criteria right along the supply chain, the engagement of Suppliers had the  highest score in this area. Quality and innovation in customer relations: the topic that places the emphasis on the need for quality relations  with the customer is addressed across the board by the various stakeholder categories and reflects the importance  of reviewing the Banks business practices from a CSR perspective. Customers are the stakeholders that place the  greatest importance on this theme, followed immediately by the Community. The main feedback relates to the need  for transparency and closer ties with the territory, also through the development of financial instruments suitable for  individual contexts. Issues regarding digitalisation and cyber security are still considered important. Access to credit and financial inclusion: the theme of access to credit was strongly emphasised by Investors,  proof of the rise in popularity of more economically sustainable forms of investment. Enabling disadvantaged  people to access credit more easily and financial education were also important themes for Customers, as they  were for the Community, which mainly highlighted aspects connected with microcredit activities. Employees gave  this issue a lower score. Responsible asset management: one of the issues to receive most emphasis during the 2017 Intesa Sanpaolo  stakeholder engagement activities was the responsible asset management. As well as the great significance  attached to it by Customers, stakeholders representing the interests of the Environment and the Community  also demonstrated great awareness of this issue, particularly with regard to the introduction of environmental  and social criteria in the evaluation of investments. The importance attributed to this topic highlights how the  Bank is requested to create sustainable and widespread economic value in society through responsible investment  management based on ESG criteria. Direct environmental impact: this topic is typically of great interest to Environment stakeholders. In fact, it  is widely mentioned in the category even if it is never given priority status. It is interesting to note how other  categories (Investors, Employees and Suppliers) also show an interest, proof of how the culture of sustainability  is widespread throughout the company. The area in which the Bank could seemingly do more in terms of direct  environmental impacts is that of energy savings, even if stakeholders are undoubtedly more interested in the  indirect impact of its activities. Green economy: indirect environmental impact was a key issue when interviewing almost all categories of  stakeholders, always receiving above-average scores. This result shows that the biggest contributions that banks  can make to environmental sustainability lie in their financial activities: loans that allow customers to adopt energy  saving and environmental protection systems, the promotion of the circular economy, the introduction of ESG criteria  when evaluating the granting of loans, the issuing of Green Bonds. This perception on the part of stakeholders  confirms their level of maturity and understanding as, despite the reduced impact of sites and activities, the  consequences of credit and investment actions can significantly influence the path towards sustainability. Relations with the community: relations with the community are also scored very highly by customers,  highlighting the growing interest in broadening the horizons of the repercussions of the Banks activities. In fact,  customers want increasing levels of transparency and communication not only in terms of the products and  services offered but also as regards ethical conduct. The other stakeholders also show strong interest in this theme,  which is therefore across the board. It only falls slightly in significance for Suppliers and Employees.

The Fideuram Ethical Funds have been established under Luxembourg law. The performance of the Ethical Funds benefited, in 2017, from defensive management of the bond component, whose average financial duration was kept generally within three years. The share component benefited, above all during the final part of the year, from the greater intensity of the upward movement on the market. However, global equity investment was  adversely affected by currency exposure. * The term indipendent organisations means asset management companies other than those that belong to the Fideuram Group (Fideuram Investimenti and Fideuram Asset Manage- ment Ireland) which establish mutual funds which are then placed with customers.

Eurizon Azionario Internazionale Etico: over the year, the performance of the Fund was positive and slightly above the benchmark. The currency and shares components of the  investment portfolio were kept in line with the impact recorded in the reference basket. As regards the sector, a pro-cyclical positioning was chosen, with more focus on technological,  financial and raw materials securities, and less on typically defensive sectors, such as pharmaceuticals. Eurizon Obbligazionario Etico: over the year, the performance of the Fund was positive, including with regard to the benchmark. The main positive contributions came from the con- structive position of spread markets, the extra focus on the US dollar in the first part of the year, careful geographical allocation and the lower focus on duration, which was considerably  accentuated during the second part of the year. Eurizon Diversificato Etico: over the year, the performance of the Fund was marginally positive, in line with that on the reference markets. Equity exposure remained close to neutral  with regard to the benchmark, with a pro-cyclical sectoral and geographical exposure. Over the year, there was less focus on duration, with a concentration on the long-term maturities  of German and American curves. In terms of currency, investments at the start of the year were chiefly in the US dollar; this extra focus was financed by a lower focus on the Euro,  Australian dollar and Renmimbi. ESG target 40: over the year, the performance of the Fund was slightly positive. There was a positive contribution from the trends on the reference share markets and the selection of  securities with solid fundamentals and high ESG scores. The portfolio components invested in the capital market and liquidity had a negative impact on performance. Sustainable Global Equity: over the year, the performance of the Fund was positive and exceeded the benchmark. In comparison with the reference parameter, there was a positive  contribution from the selection of securities with solid fundamentals and high ESG scores. Eurizon Flessibile Azionario: over the year, the performance of the Funds was positive. There was a positive contribution from the trends on the reference share markets and the selection  of securities with solid fundamentals and high ESG scores. There was a negative impact from the portfolio components invested in the money markets and liquidity. **The overall number shown refers to the equity issuers held in funds established under Italian law.  141 Indicators CLAIMS, COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS Type 2017 2016 2015 Italy Abroad Group Italy Abroad Group Italy Abroad Group Loans 27,215 5,559 32,774  33,262   6,302   39,564   26,624   14,507   41,131  Payment systems 7,247 20,452 27,699  7,389   19,793   27,182   7,464   17,173   24,637  Organisational issues, Internet site, other 8,457 8,269 16,726  6,285   7,722   14,007   6,904   12,298   19,202  Insurance products 5,650 285 5,935  5,316   182   5,498   4,894   156   5,050  Current accounts, deposits and securities  dossier 3,315 5,510 8,825  2,360   5,619   7,979   2,414   5,705   8,119  Investments 1,823 351 2,174  1,946   120   2,066   1,806   220   2,026  Total 53,707 40,426 94,133  56,558   39,738   96,296   50,106   50,059   100,165  With regard to customer requests in the area of the protection of personal data in Italy, 101 reports of presumed violations of the Privacy Code were received in 2017 (155 in 2016) together  with 8 appeals from the Italian Data Protection Authority.
