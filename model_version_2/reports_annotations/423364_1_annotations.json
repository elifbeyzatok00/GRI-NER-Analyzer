The company establishes and manages the vision of  realizing global top-tier green management and strategies in accordance with safety and health  environmental management policies. The construction division conducts all business management in an eco-friendly manner from the  perspective of environmental management as a total construction company. All the executives and  employees, including the CEO, recognize the environmental impact of construction activities on  society and continuously implement environmental management based on the core values of CJ,  which are integrity, passion, creativity and respect.   Organization in Charge of Environmental Management The logistics division operates a group in charge of environmental management that consists of  the Safety and Environment Team of the head office, an environmental organization consisting  of environmental officers and the environmental managers of each workplace. The Safety and  Environment Team, which is the department in charge of environmental management, establishes  the strategies and detailed guidelines for environmental management and integrates and manages  the environmental performance of each business site. In addition, the company strengthens  management to implement environmental management for overseas business sites based on the  expansion of global business.    Environmental Management System Certification Since the Incheon Branch acquired ISO 14001 certification in 1999, the logistics division has  expanded the scope of the certification to all of our offices in 2010 and has maintained certification  to this date. In accordance with certification standards, we have established environmental  management guidelines and implemented evaluation and management for environmental impact in  actual business. In addition, the company provides training to reinforce the management capabilities  of each business site manager to operate the management system and cultivate internal capacity  for independent review. In the future, we will further internalize the operation of the environmental  management system to minimize environmental pollutants from business activities in all business  sites. In addition, we will reinforce management to prevent environmental pollution accidents in  the operation and management of environmental facilities and freight handling processes.  In 2001, the construction division also acquired ISO 14001 certification for domestic and overseas  civil engineering, architecture, housing, electricity, industrial and environmental facilities, firefighting  construction, information communication construction and additional service, and has maintained  the certification from that point on.  Coping with Climate Change Greenhouse Gas and Energy Management System In the logistics division, the head office and business sites are registered in the National Greenhouse  Gas Management System (NGMS) to monitor the amount of energy used, systematically calculate  and manage greenhouse gas emissions. Based on the NGMS, we have set a goal of reducing our  GHG emissions by 2021 through the research and analysis of GHG data such as energy costs, GHG  emissions and reduction targets for our business sites. Environmental issues such as resource depletion and  climate change are emerging across the globe, and these  issues have an impact on corporate business activities. To  cope with global environmental issues, efforts for reducing  environmental impact are required among companies. In  addition, it is necessary to manage internal safety issues in  terms of reduction of corporate risk and cultivation of business  capability. CJ Logistics aims to reinforce competitiveness  through proactive environmental management policies,  recognizing the importance of eco-friendly logistics and safety  management in the environmental sector.

Each business site registers the amount of all energy usage of business activities, including monthly  electricity consumption, vehicle fuel consumption and other energy usage for management and analysis. In response, the business site must  align with the target of GHG emissions based on the implementation of the national GHG & energy target management system. In 2017, CJ  Logistics emitted 202,671tCO2-eq, which is lower than the GHG emission target of 236,728tCO2-eq by 34,057tCO2-eq. CJ Logistics will advance  the current greenhouse gas management system and effectively cope with climate change through efficient management of GHG emissions  and energy use.  * The amount of GHG emissions and energy use can be identified on p.81 Activity of Reducing Energy usage The logistics division implements various education activities to reduce energy usage in business. We operate eco-driving training to improve  driving habits that waste energy such as rapid start, rapid acceleration, sudden braking and engine idling. We are also actively conducting  energy-saving activities such as reducing the amount of electricity use by installing and changing high-efficient LED and induction lamps in the  interior lighting of buildings such as distribution centers.  In the construction division, we have designed and constructed a building to allow natural ventilation and lighting of the clubhouse to save  energy. As a result, bright indoor lighting is secured even without separate lighting during the day. In addition, about 70 golf carts in the club  utilize electricity instead of fossil fuels and help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. We also continuously review and implement measures for  applying renewable energy such as solar heat and photovoltaic energy.     Activity to Offset GHG Emissions The logistics division conducts activities for enhancing the awareness of the environment and environmental protection in local communities  to offset GHG emissions. In 2013, we signed the Agreement for Energy Forest Project on Abandoned Highway Roads with the Korea Forest  Service, Korea Highway Corporation and Green Korea United. Annually, we contribute to the offsetting of greenhouse gas emissions by  participating in the creation of \"Energy Forests\" using abandoned roads and vacant rest areas. In addition, we conduct an urban greening  project and provide ecological experience education for children in local childcare centers. We will reinforce eco-friendly green logistics  activities to reduce GHG emissions, ensure energy saving in daily life and proactively prepare to introduce eco-friendly logistical equipment and  continuous exchange for high-efficiency lighting at the distribution center.  Resource Management Water Management The construction division manages the amount of water use and wastewater in all business sites. In 2017, we used 688,763 tons of water and  reused 56 tons by filtering muddy water. Due to the nature of the resort business in the construction division, most of the water usage was  focused on managing a wide area of grass and wood. Aside from the existing method to rely on automatic irrigation in the management of golf  club courses, we proactively utilize hand watering and minimize the consumption of water resources by installing low-flow toilets and water  tank storage compressors in all washrooms of the club. Jeju Nine Bridges uses an integral type of advanced wastewater treatment method and  contributes to reducing water quality pollution and energy by removing organic substances, nitrogen and phosphorus by low-consumption  electricity.   Waste Management The logistics division promotes the reduction of any waste in business activities and efficient management by enacting the waste management  guideline. We manage the amount of waste in accordance with waste-related internal standards and properly and legally handle waste.  The construction division manages the amount of waste by using the Allbaro System, which is the national total waste management system. By  separating waste into each type, the system allows for a virtuous cycle of waste as well as recycling as a resource.  Realization of Eco-friendly Logistics and Construction Green Logistics The logistics division realizes green logistics by optimizing and utilizing distribution bases, facilities  and systems in an eco-friendly direction. For instance, we reduced the number of transport vehicles  to realize the reduction of energy and carbon emissions through the optimization of transport routes,  large-scale transportation, complex and consistent transportation and joint logistics by utilizing  connective transportation among different bases. CJ Logistics also realizes eco-friendly logistics  through the purchase of freight vehicles in the form of low-pollution and high-fuel economy SCR  (Selective Catalytic Reduction), enlargement of vehicles, green parcel delivery service utilizing electric  bicycles and four-wheeled vehicles, and electric conversion for port crane energy and photovoltaic  energy generation utilizing the rooftops of distribution centers. We also enhance the efficiency of  vehicle operation by real-time vehicle control through an integrated logistics IT system, optimization  of transport routes using freight information-based transportation planning, integrated allocation of  vehicles and improvement of cargo loading return rate. We are also promoting a modal shift from  energy for road transport such as railroad and vessels to high-efficiency energy transport means by  analyzing integrated freight volume.    Acquisition of Sustainable Golf Course Certification Haesley, a golf club of the construction division, acquired the certification of Sustainable Golf  Course from the GEO, a U.K. organization with a purpose of certifying sustainable eco-friendly  golf courses, in 2014 and received recertification in 2017 as well. The GEO (Golf Environment  Organization) was established in the U.K. in 2000 and has become a prestigious eco-friendly golf  course certification organization, which strives to ensure sustainability in golf facilities and improve  the environment. The organization has partnerships with 40 golf-related institutions in Europe  and other parts of the world such as the R&A (Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews) of the  U.K., European Tour and EIGCA (European Institute of Golf Course Architects). Evaluation items in  the certification of an eco-friendly golf course according to GEO are composed of three items— Nature, Resources and Community. With detailed sub-items, a strict review process is followed.  The certification of GEO can be finally acquired through two rounds of verification by meeting  the standards presented by GEO. Even after the certification is acquired, the certification can be  maintained only through recertification every three years.  Conservation of Biodiversity The construction division makes continuous efforts to take the lead in environmental protection  regarding biodiversity. We have strived to create a course with essential geographical features  while not undermining the nature. Thanks to these efforts, a total of 60 species of animals and  plants reside in the environments of yeoju Haesley Nine Bridges, including the eagle owl (natural  monument), common buzzard, kestrel and small wrinkled frog (endangered species class 2).  The club also provides members with conveniences through eco-friendly methods. In the spring  of every year, we release pond snails into the pond and provide water plants on the floor of the  pond as feed to alleviate the growth of green algae. We also released snakeheads into the pond  to reduce the number of fruit flies and mosquitoes. As a result, the number of fruit flies and  mosquitoes were decreased, while the number of birds was increased as the fry of snakeheads  serve as the feed for birds. yeoju Haesley Nine Bridges  Sustainable Golf Course Certification by GEO yeoju Haesley Nine Bridges   OVERVIEW 2017-2018 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS SUSTAINABILITY ISSUE  SUSTAINABILITY FRAME AppENdIx 44 CJ Logistics Sustainability Report 2017-2018 45 Health and Safety Risk Management CJ Logistics implements a safety design review (SDR) to prevent any health and safety risks in advance.  When investing in new construction, expansion of a building, and installation of logistics equipment, we  conduct the SDR to check safety issues from the planning stage to ensure safety of facilities.  To prevent safety risk factors among business sites and facilities throughout the country, the logistics  division regularly conducts  in-house or external safety inspections. Through these activities, we identify  risks found at each business site and implement measures to remove them. During severe weather  conditions, such as heavy rainfall, heavy snow, extremely cold weather, and typhoons, we conduct a pre- safety check. CJ Logistics will ensure immediate improvement of any severe risks through continuous  analysis and evaluation of risk factors for its business sites. CJ Logistics will also reinforce its win-win safety  management program and proactively prevent occupational accidents in business sites by supporting the  safety management capabilities of suppliers and encouraging various activities. The construction division not only predicts and evaluates risk factors in the construction site, but also  establishes safety measures and intensively checks whether measures are conducted through the risk  assessment process. We also apply the mobile smart safety system and perform more active and efficient  health and safety risk management, including reinforcing two-way communication with partners, improving  risk factors immediately, streamlining paperwork and conducting real-time monitoring.  Activities for Reinforcing Logistics and Construction Safety Introduction of Safety Golden Rule (Basic Safety Rule) The logistics division has enacted and adopted the Safety Golden Rule to ensure safety for all employees when  performing management activities. The Safety Golden Rule, which is composed of nine major items, was  prepared by reflecting the intention of management, including company-wide health and safety environment  management policies, government policies, legal requirements and statistical analysis of company-wide  accidents. In 2018, with the beginning of the proclamation of the CEOs commitment to the Safety Golden  Rule, we promoted and guided the rule and made a pledge for employee commitment. We also implemented  monitoring to check status, as well as conducted a campaign for business sites to comply with the Safety Golden  Rule autonomously. CJ Logistics expects to achieve the safety management target by introducing the Safety  Golden Rule and faithfully implementing the rule, managing human errors by enhancing safety awareness  among employees and complying with basic principles. In the future, we will actively enforce the Safety Golden  Rule for all employees, of all business sites and partners, and establish a safety-first culture at an early stage.    Settlement of Clean 5 in the Construction Site The construction division has established five action items (Clean 5) to stabilize an on-site safety culture, which  include the participation of partners, compliance of safety regulations, strict equipment management, site  organization and removal of risk factors. We also launched a management  system to conduct safety activities and  comply with the basics and principles based on the health and safety management system. Through these activities,  we pursue creating an enjoyable and pleasant working environment and expanding a mature safety culture. Reinforcement of Health and Safety Capabilities The logistics division implements special education for industrial safety to prevent occupational  accident risks among employees and partners each year. As for a warehouse, we participated in a win- win cooperation program and established a safety management process for creating a safer working  environment by considering the characteristics of accommodating many employees. Based on these  activities, we carry out safety management activities for win-win relationships by considering the safety  of all employees and partners. In 2017, CJ Logistics implemented special industrial safety education,  practical firefighting safety education and transportation safety education for the employees of partners.

Organization in Charge of Health and Safety CJ Logistics checks overall safety management activities in the Safety Management Department  where the CEOs of all affiliates of CJ Group attend and makes decisions on major issues (safety,  environment, information).  CJ Logistics inspects and makes decisions for safety management activities at RM (Risk Management)  meetings where all executives attend on a monthly basis. We also operate a company-wide safety  management committee and reflect opinions from each business division for any issues regarding  health and safety, including establishing a plan for preventing occupational accidents, selecting  items for health and safety education and checking and improving working conditions. In addition,  organizations in each business line designate a separate staff member in charge of safety. Group Safety Day CJ Logistics participates in monthly Group Safety Day events with all executives pursuant to the  spread of an on-site safety culture. We also support safety in business sites by making swift decisions  with regard to safety in sites by the management. The company also gives awards to excellent  workers regarding safety and zero-accident cases in each business site.    Advancement of Safety Management System Based on internal health and safety management regulations, the logistics division establishes health  and safety policies for employees and partner companies. In particular, we formulate and implement  risk assessment and pre-safety evaluation guidelines to prevent any potential safety-related risks in  business operations. In addition, the company develops work guidelines for managing various risk  factors and establishes a management system to operate safety management systems that exceed  legal requirements. In 2017, we renewed OHSAS 18001 system certification and reinforced the  capabilities of safety management of our global operations by revising the procedures and guidelines  for the safety management manual and distributing English versions.  In the construction division, we also revised work guidelines that exceed legal requirements to  promote detailed safety management activities through the authorization of OHSAS 18001. We are  conducting safety risk prevention activities on a regular basis by analyzing risks related to health  and safety and creating an atmosphere where all employees can lead with the same mindset. We  continue to cooperate in fulfilling autonomous health and safety management and corporate social  responsibilities.

As a project for mutual cooperation among CJ Logistics, our partners,  specialized external institutions and consulting agencies, the system develops and supplies safe  transportation management manuals and solutions for partners and actively prevents accidents that  can occur while transporting hazardous chemicals.  Partner Safety Management – Safety and Win-Win Cooperation Program The logistics division has established and operated a win-win cooperation program for joint  participation of partners led by a parent company to prevent accidents among partners with lack of  information and investment capability for health and safety. The program aims to improve partners  capabilities for health and safety management, establishes and operates a sustainable health  and safety cooperation system between CJ Logistics and partners by carrying out technical and  financial support activities. We established a cooperation system between CJ Logistics and partners  for five hub parcel terminals and six W&D centers. We also conducted various activities to build an  autonomous safety system for partners, including a health and safety win-win cooperation group, risk  assessment and compliance with four core safety rules in industrial sites. The logistics division not  only seeks to secure the safety of partners at the same level of CJ Logistics, improve the capability  of health and safety management, and reduce accidents, but also to solidify the implementation of  responsibilities for partners and promote a win-win development by strengthening responsibilities  for health and safety.  Prevention of Traffic Accidents through Advanced Safety Devices  The logistics division installs rear-view surveillance cameras to prevent accidents that can occur while  delivery vehicles are driving in reverse. We also install and operate advanced driver assistance system  (ADAS) in our freight vehicles with the function of lane departure warning and forward collision alerts to  prevent accidents caused by carelessness of drivers such as being drowsy and neglecting to look ahead.   Health and Safety Education and Training The logistics division conducts education and training related to health and safety to prevent accidents  and made it possible to react in the event of an accident. We offer safety education to employees  who are exposed to the risk of accidents and teach skills to deal with accidents in logistics equipment  and facilities by sharing safety accident cases through training. In addition, the company strives to  reduce the occurrence of safety accidents and expansion of damage by providing training based on a  theoretical study on emergency procedures and methods to handle emergency. For instance, we offer  a group health and safety training for drivers; in 2017, 148 drivers participated in and completed the  training program nine times.  The construction division operates job and class based education programs for all employees and  managers of partners and provides systematic and effective customized education by developing  independent education contents with consulting advice from professional education institutions. We  also cultivate the potential of all employees to address health and safety management issues through  constant activities on reinforcing their skills and raising safety awareness to create a safe business site.   Safe Operation Management through Smart Integrated Logistics System The logistics division has introduced the Smart Integrated Logistics System to manage freight  vehicles and the status of operation. The Vehicle Control Center is capable of monitoring integrated  system by identifying the current situation of each vehicle on a real-time basis through a mobile  carrier communication network (WCDMA), including the location of the vehicle, route, transported  freight, fuel consumption and speed. We also manage ten major safety indicators presented by the  Korea Transportation Safety Authority, including sudden start, sudden stop and sudden acceleration,  by analyzing digital driving records on a real-time basis. Drivers can ensure safe and effective driving  by identifying vehicle dispatching instructions, freight information, loading and unloading area maps,  notifications, nearby traffic accident information and safe driving indicator information through a  mobile application.  Systemization of Safety Inspection in the Construction Site The construction division conducts continuous regular and periodic safety inspections to improve  the level of health and safety management in the construction site. To strengthen safety inspection,  we have adopted expert inspection practices from 2017 checking construction equipment every two  months, examining consulting and installation, and dismantling and constructing of a tower crane  every three months. We also enact and operate the top seven special safety rules (high-place work,  fire-related work, construction equipment, temporary power, temporary facilities, lifting work and  enclosed space work) to comply with the construction site focused on high-risk tasks, and advance to  accomplish safety management targets through strict implementation of basics and principles.

OVERVIEW 2017-2018 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS SUSTAINABILITY ISSUE  SUSTAINABILITY FRAME AppENdIx 52 CJ Logistics Sustainability Report 2017-2018 53 Reinforcement of Customer Communication Implementation Strategies To ensure smoother communication with customers and reinforce capabilities for customer service,  CJ Logistics has established three major strategies (innovation of customer response structure,  changing the role of the customer center and enhancing service capabilities) and derived and  managed core related tasks.  Operation of Customer Communication Channels CJ Logistics has established various channels to strengthen customer communication. In terms of  individual customers, we receive and address customer inquiries through the online customer center  and care line. For corporate customers, we operate the client portal system to make efforts to  communicate with client companies.  Management of Voices of Customers (VOC) The VOC is managed by the Customer Satisfaction Team, and received VOCs are classified and managed  in each type after providing customers with guidance depending on the characteristics of processing. In  particular, in case of emergency VOC and severe claims, such case is immediately reported to the CEO  or director of a division after determining the level of emergency. Then, the director convenes a Risk  Management (RM) meeting depending on the case to establish and take measures. We also manage the  ratio of having VOCs for complaints and claims, VOC processing lead time and share the materials for  analyzing the current status of VOC on a regular basis to the entire company.  Operation of AI Consulting System In 2017, CJ Logistics introduced a learning-type artificial intelligence (AI) Chatbot for the first time in  the parcel industry and allowed it to give responses to simple inquiries from customers at any time.  Chatbot based on learning-type AI is able to have a natural conversation with customers and give  answers to the overall issues faced by parcels. CJ Logistics derives big data from various customer  opinions which are collected through the call center and makes chatbot to learn the data to give  proper answers to customer inquiries. The introduction of Chatbot is expected to enable real-time  response for customer inquiries and vitalize two-way communication with customers. Consumer-centered Management Consumer-centered Management (CCM) Consumer-centered management (CCM) is led and implemented by the Customer Satisfaction Team  under the Chief Customer Officer (CCO). The Customer Satisfaction Team operates CCM, manages  improvement activities, conducts response efforts for customer complaints and collects, analyzes and  processes VOCs through the call center. We also establish strategies for CCM, conduct regular monitoring  with a target and share related activities to the entire company through the company intranet.  Recertification of Consumer-centered Management (CCM) In 2014, CJ Logistics received the certification of consumer-centered management (CCM) led by Korea  Consumer Agency and certified by the Fair Trade Commission. In 2016, we received the recertification  of CCM, which verified continuous management focusing on consumers. CJ Logistics aims to acquire  recertification in 2018 as well.  Customer  Satisfaction Learning-type AI Chatbot Support for the Vitalization of Golf Searching for and Supporting Promising Golf Players CJ Logistics proactively supports promising golf players to help them to become competitive global  players under the philosophy of sponsorship searching for promising golf players. The sponsored  golf players have exhibited great performance on the global stage and elevated the profile of CJ  Logistics as well as Korea. CJ Logistics began its support in 2015 and currently sponsors a total of  eight players in 2018. We have sponsored many golf players who went on to global fame, including  Kim Si-woo, the youngest champion in the PGA Tour THE PLAyERS Championship. Golf Related Social Contribution Activities CJ Logistics conducts volunteer work in connection with local children centers to support the hopes  and dreams of local children with sponsored golf players. We also invited promising Korean golf  players to the U.S. Masters championship and provided them with the opportunity to see the match  and participate in the event as a caddy. We will expand various social contribution activities for the  local community with golf players.  Sponsorship for THE CJ CuP @ nInE BRIDGES Since 2017, CJ Logistics has actively supported Koreas first PGA contest, THE CJ CUP @ NINE  BRIDGES. This contest is implemented to support Korean golf players to reach the global stage and  vitalize the Korean golf industry. It also contributes to vitalizing the local community based on new  cultural content. We will strive to contribute to developing the local community through proactive  support.   OVERVIEW 2017-2018 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS SUSTAINABILITY ISSUE  SUSTAINABILITY FRAME AppENdIx 54 CJ Logistics Sustainability Report 2017-2018 55 Efforts to Protect Customer Information   Customer Information Protection System As cases of personal information leakage are emerging as a social issue with the development  of IT technology, CJ Logistics has established a preemptive system to protect customer personal  information. To protect information, we comply with relevant laws such as the Information  Protection Act, Act on Promotion of Information, Communication Network Utilization, Information  Protection and establish independent personal information processing guidelines. We also guide  customers for safe information management, including using, managing and discarding personal  information, so that their information is not used for other purposes.    Certification of Information Protection System CJ Logistics has acquired the information protection system certification to establish a global-level  information protection system and prevent information protection risks. In 2009, we acquired ISO  27001, the international certification of the information protection management system, for the  first time among total logistics companies. In 2017, we also acquired the ISMS, which is a domestic  information protection management system certificate. We will continuously supplement and  improve the system and more proactively manage customer information management by improving  information leak prevention solutions.    Establishment of Information Management Standards To respond to internal and external security issues more swiftly, CJ Logistics amends and manages  information security regulations once a year and performs continuous improvement activities by  classifying the level of information assets and conducting a risk assessment. We provide employees  with training to raise their awareness of the importance of personal information and make it  mandatory for partners to sign an agreement to comply with information security. We also store  invoices based on the Information Protection Act to prevent the leakage and exposure of personal  information written in invoices in the process of loading and delivering products and discard invoices  safely through a specialized shredding company. Only parcel data from the last three months can  be searched through the business system, and the data are deleted after a 5-year backup period in  accordance with the Framework Act on National Taxes. Management of Customer Satisfaction CJ Logistics conducts safety surveys for corporate and individual customers and finds any  improvement issues to enhance customer service. For corporate customers, we hold a satisfaction  survey through the partner portal system once a year, while conducting a service satisfaction  survey on mobile for individual customers. We also proactively participate in external evaluations  and commit ourselves to improve customer service. CJ Logistics has received various awards from  external institutions through various activities seeking the convenience of customers.   Customer Satisfaction-related Activities   Selection as an Excellent Parcel Service Company In the Parcel Service Evaluation for 2017 among 16 domestic parcel companies led by the Ministry  of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, CJ Logistics received the level of B++ in the general parcel  group (C2C, B2C). As an evaluation was conducted on the expeditious service, kindness, safety  and differentiated characteristics of parcel service, CJ Logistics was evaluated as having the most  excellent general parcel service among private companies.    Cultivation of Parcel Experts CJ Logistics focuses on cultivating parcel experts to ensure prompt response for customer requests.  We nurture professional parcel personnel by operating an education program utilizing actual best  practices and an offline, in-person training program such as Maintain Service Basics. Award and Reward for Excellent Service Employees CJ Logistics adopts and operates the Service Certification System to improve customer service.  For excellent service employees, we give certification as well as incentive payments, which motivate  the employees for their service mindset.

Safe Delivery Culture Campaign In 2018, CJ Logistics conducted the Making Safe Transport Culture Campaign to create a secure  parcel culture with the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. We provided about 130 delivery personnel  with training for the Road Traffic Act, traffic laws, regulations and compliance for drivers and held  a vehicle parade to cultivate the awareness of safe driving. In particular, as parcel workers deliver  products in a designated section every day, those who first recognize any abnormal signs such as  road fractures, damage to public facilities and unexpected accidents are these delivery personnel.  By utilizing these activities, it is expected to boost the effects of ensuring community security  regarding crime prevention and transport safety. In April, the company concluded the Agreement  for Community Security by Police-Private Partnership with the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency  and agreed to deal with mutual sharing of crime vulnerable elements, creating the environment to  prevent crimes, reporting missing people, reporting transport violation cases/crime-prone regions  and engaging in pedestrian safety campaigns.

Mid- to Long-term Risk Response CJ Logistics continuously analyzes internal and external management environments, identifies  risks which can have a crucial impact on overall business in the mid- to long-term perspective and  establishes and implements measures for effective response through analyzing aspects.  Fair Trade Compliance Program Operation of Fair Trade Compliance Program In 2017, CJ Logistics launched the compliance program (CP). The CP presents concrete code  standards for legal compliance based on the Fair Trade Act and Fair Transactions in Subcontracting  Act and helps to prevent risks for violation of the Unfair Competition Prevention Act. CP Operational Organization CJ Logistics appoints the fair trade compliance manager under the CEO and organizes the  compliance department and committee to promote responsible CP operation. We also designate  compliance managers for each business department and management support division.  CP Training CJ Logistics provides regular CP training to establish CP at an early stage and enhance compliance  capabilities among compliance managers of each department. In 2017, we designated 250  compliance managers for each department, and all compliance managers completed regular CP  training. We also provided further, intensive training for all employees of departments with a high  possibility of legal violation, including parcel delivery drivers. Pre-CP Monitoring CJ Logistics conducts regular monitoring and checks the implementation of compliance management  to prevent risks related to fair trade more actively. In 2017, we conducted interviews and completed  checklists for monitoring targets in six business sites for the first and second half of the year. It  checked for any infringement of the Fair Trade Act and Fair Transactions in Subcontracting Act.

Competition in  the industry is intensifying as global total logistics  services improve, and for this reason, we need to  establish a mid and long-term response strategy. \tWe expand our business scope to new global  markets including M&A deals while making  continuous efforts to provide differentiated services  to our customers through R&D activities. We also  strive to secure market competitiveness early,  enhancing our consumer and brand credibility  through quality improvement. Adaptation\u0007to\u0007 climate\u0007change \tResponding to climate change has become a major  issue in the international community. As government  regulations are changing including the GHG target  management system and emissions trading system,  changes in the energy paradigm are also accelerating.  \tFor logistics companies that use various modes of  transport to conduct their business activities, there  is a growing need to manage the financial impacts  of environmental regulations. \tWe are committed to managing greenhouse gas  emissions at our business sites, and make efforts to  reduce emissions through the economic operation  of transportation. In addition, we will focus on  reducing environmental impact by establishing  mid- to long-term strategies to respond to the  demand for eco-friendly logistics and strengthening  environmental regulations. Customer\u0007 information\u0007 protection\u0007 \tDue to the advancement of the information  society, social interest in the protection of personal  information is steadily increasing. \tIn particular, legal regulations on the management  of personal information collected in business  activities are expanding. The level of a companys  information management system becomes a crucial  issue which can affect customer relations. \tWe are strengthening the maintenance and  management of our personal information  management system (ISO27001, ISMS) certification  to reinforce our customer information protection  system and ensure compliance with government  regulations. The Information Strategy Team, a  dedicated organization, focuses on monitoring and  reinforcing information access control continually  so that we can preemptively respond to personal  information leakage incidents.

Operation of Social Contribution Committee CJ Logistics operates the Social Contribution Committee to strengthen transparency in executing  donations and respond to requests for reinforcing social ethics management. The committee is  composed of the CEO, CFO and compliance assistance director in addition to CSV management  team leader as an assistant administrator. For transparent execution of donatiosn, we have made  it mandatory to conduct the review by the Social Contribution Committee for any donations with  an annual sum of KRW 100 million or more from 2018. For donations with an annual sum of KRW 1  billion or more, prior review should be conducted by the Social Contribution Committee, followed  by resolution as an agenda by Board of Directors (resolved in favor of two-thirds of the Board of  Directors). In the first half of 2018, donations with an annual sum of KRW 1 billion or more (2 cases)  were executed after the review and resolution of the Social Contribution Committee and Board of  Directors.   Creation of Compliance Management Handbook In 2017, CJ Logistics prepared a compliance management handbook to reinforce law-abiding  awareness through easy access to compliance guidelines. After, we distributed the handbook to  all departments of headquarters and local business sites. The handbook includes compliance  management guidelines and codes of conduct for employees to comply with relevant laws such as  the Fair Trade Act, Fair Transactions in Subcontracting Act and Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.  Creation of CP Letter In 2018, CJ Logistics has started to create and distribute CP Letters to increase the interest in CP and  encourage autonomous participation in compliance management. The CP Letter covers the latest  legal enactment and amendment news and policy trends by the Fair Trade Commission.   Reinforcement of Communication for Compliance Management Establishment of Compliance Management Website          CJ Logistics has established a compliance management website to promote the companys  compliance management and CP activities, internally and externally both manage CP activities  systemically. On the website, we encourage employees to share CP materials engaging in compliance  management autonomously. We expect to strengthen risk management with regards to compliance  management as CP operation becomes more vitalized. Win-Win Coordination Committee In June 2017, CJ Logistics launched the Win-Win Coordination Committee to address conflicts  between the company and partners in advance and built a long-term communication system with  partners.

KMRs assurance team(hereinafter the team) evaluated the adherence to Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and  Responsiveness, and the reliability of the selected GRI Standards indices as below, where professional judgment of the team was exercised as materiality criteria. The team checked whether the Report has been prepared in accordance with the Core Option of GRI Standards which covers the followings.    \tGRI Reporting Principles    \tUniversal Standards    \tTopic Specific Standards        - Management approach of Topic Specific Standards        - Economic Performance: 201-1, 201-2        - Indirect Economic Impacts: 203-2        - Anti-Corruption: 205-2, 205-3        - Energy: 302-1, 302-3, 302-4, 302-5        - Water: 303-1        - Biodiversity: 304-1, 304-2, 304-3         - Emissions: 305-1, 305-2, 305-4, 305-5        - Effluents and Waste: 306-1, 306-2        - Employment: 401-1, 401-2, 401-3        - Occupational Health and Safety: 403-2        - Training and Education: 404-1, 404-3        - Diversity and Equal Opportunity: 405-1, 405-2        - Non-Discrimination: 406-1        - Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining: 407-1        - Child Labor: 408-1        - Forced or Compulsory Labor: 409-1        - Human Rights Assessment: 412-2        - Local Communities: 413-1, 413-2        - Supplier Social Assessment: 414-1, 414-2        - Customer Health and Safety: 416-1, 416-2        - Marketing and Labeling: 417-2, 417-3        - Customer Privacy: 418-1 This Report excludes a data sand information of joint corporate, contractor etc. which is outside of the organization, i.e. CJ Logistics, among report boundaries. Our approach In order to verify the contents of the Report within an agreed scope of assurance in accordance with the assurance standard, the team has carried out an assurance  engagement as follows:    Reviewed overall report    Reviewed materiality test process and methodology     Reviewed sustainability management strategies and targets    Reviewed stakeholder engagement activities    Interviewed people in charge of preparing the Report Our conclusion Based on the results we have obtained from material reviews and interviews, we had several discussions with CJ Logistics on the revision of the Report. We reviewed  the Reports final version in order to confirm that our recommendations for improvement and our revisions have been reflected. When reviewing the results of the  assurance, the assurance team could not find any inappropriate contents in the Report to the compliance with the principles stipulated below. Nothing has come to our  attention that causes us to believe that the data included in the verification scope are not presented appropriately.    \tInclusivity        Inclusivity is the participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to sustainability.       - CJ Logistics is developing and maintaining stakeholder communication channels in various forms and levels in order to make a commitment to be responsible for the \u0007           stakeholders. The assurance team could not find any critical stakeholder CJ Logistics left out during this procedure.    \tMateriality        \tMateriality is determining the relevance and significance of an issue to an organization and its stakeholders. A material issue is an issue that will influence the \t        decisions, actions, and performance of an organization or its stakeholders.        - CJ Logistics is determining the materiality of issues found out through stakeholder communication channels through its own materiality evaluation process, and the \u0007             assurance team could not find any critical issues left out in this process.    \tResponsiveness      Responsiveness is an organizations response to stakeholder issues that affect its sustainability performance and is realized through decisions, actions, and \t        performance, as well as communication with stakeholders.        - \u0007The assurance team could not find any evidence that CJ Logisticss counter measures to critical stakeholder issues were inappropriately recorded in the Report. We could not find any evidence the Report was not prepared in accordance with the Core Option of GRI standards. Recommendation for improvement We hope the Report is actively used as a communication tool for stakeholders and recommendation for improvements.    \t CJ Logistics communicates with stakeholders through its sustainability report and strategically utilizes sustainable management. Still, the company is advised to  continue to improve its indicators to fulfill GRI guidelines and reflect this into KPIs of related personnel.  Our independence With the exception of providing third party assurance services, KMR is not involved in any other CJ Logisticss business operations that are aimed at making profit in  order to avoid any conflicts of interest and to maintain independence.
