Financial results, commitment to cus- tomers, passenger and employee safety, environmen- tal management and social and economic development  and other elements are connected in this report. In the 2017 edition of the report – covering the entire  operation in the period from January 1st to December  31st –, the Group has innovated in the way in which its  shares information with stakeholders. The publication is now ordered in five major blocks of  information. The first part focuses on institutional in- formation and managing for sustainability.

We aspire to become one of the most admired air- line groups in the world, and I am certain that the steps  we have taken in the last few years in terms of client  initiatives, destinations network, productivity, and sus- tainability have set us on the right path to achieve this. Our commitment is to offer passengers a unique travel  experience; this is why all our decisions focus on cus- tomer satisfaction. With the current trend aiming to- wards a customized travel, in 2017 the Group imple- mented a new business model for domestic markets.  Supported by Mercado LATAM and a new segmented  fares structure, this new model brought to over 85% of  our passengers the access to tariffs up to 40% lower  and a greater flexibility in their travel. Its rollout among  our domestic affiliates implied a great effort from all  of us at LATAM Group, and we are proud of the positive  results we have obtained. Also, after seeing the great difference to the international  travel experience that on-board dining makes, we em- barked upon the challenge of redesigning the traditional  food tray served on board the Economy cabin of flights  lasting over seven hours. As a result, we developed a new  dining experience, unique in the industry, that gives our  passengers more options to choose from, a more com- fortable format, and gourmet quality food that showcase  the best of Latin American and international cuisine, with  over 300 new dishes. All this is available at no additional  cost to our passengers, who have loved the new service. Along the same line, we have continued to invest in  self-service technologies, so that our passengers can  tend to themselves in a simple, transparent, and fully  independent way. As an example, during 2017 we set  up over 700 kiosks throughout more than 80 airports.  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) ac- knowledged our self-service initiatives and certified us  in the Platinum category of its Fast Travel program,  confirming our commitment with offering a leading  travel experience in the industry. In 2017, we made great achievements in terms of expand- ing and optimizing our network, opening 30 new routes,  including Santiago-Melbourne, whose 15-hour duration  makes it LATAMs longest non-stop flight. Moreover, the  Group continued to strengthen its hubs, connecting Sao  Paulo to Bariloche and more domestic destinations in  Brazil, Lima to Rio de Janeiro and Cartagena, both Lima  and Santiago to various secondary cities throughout Ar- gentina, and Santiago to Orlando and Santa Cruz. Simultaneously, in 2017 we continued to work towards  obtaining the approval of the Joint Business Agreements  (JBAs) with American Airlines and IAG (British Airways  and Iberia). The antitrust authorities of Brazil, Colombia,  and Uruguay have already granted their approval, and we  Message from the CEO [102-14] Enrique Cueto CEO LATAM Airlines Group A new business  model for domestic  markets brought  to over 85% of our  passengers the  access to tariffs up  to 40% lower and a  greater flexibility  in their travel. 30 were opened in 2017.  new   routes 5 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  whose focus is both to compensate the environmen- tal impact of our operations and to actively contribute  to society. Accordingly, for the fourth consecutive year,  we were included in the World category of the Dow  Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), which acknowledges  the performance of the top 10% leading companies in  sustainability within this index, being among the only  three airline groups in this category worldwide. The efforts we have made these past years have mir- rored in a steady improvement of our financial re- sults. In 2017, operating income was the highest in  our history, reaching US$715 million, while net profit  totaled US$155 million, surpassing the US$69 million  from 2016. On the revenue side, these results were  boosted by the development of our business strate- gy, as well as an overall better economic environment  in the markets where we operate. Moreover, assisted  by our productivity and efficiency measurements, we  were able to keep costs below 2016 inflation levels  and the fuel increase of 2017, thus expanding our op- erating margin to 7%. We also managed to make progress in strengthening  our financial front. In 2017, we continued with our in- vestment discipline, being the year with the lowest fleet  commitments in LATAMs history. We also achieved a  significant improvement in our debt profile, aside from  disposing of a US$450 million revolving credit facility1,  which was fully available at yearend. As a result, we  achieved the highest cash flow and lowest indebted- ness level since the association of LAN and TAM, main- taining a healthy liquidity level. In a nutshell, 2017 was a year of transformation, with  important steps towards a more efficient organization,  with a unique position in the market in terms of cus- tomers offer and destinations network, so we can en- sure that our business model will be competitive and  sustainable in the long term. The market acknowledged  this improvement, which was reflected in the 54% in- crease of stock price in 2017. I would like to thank our  shareholders for the trust they have placed in this ad- ministration and in LATAM Groups project. The major changes we implemented throughout 2017  were possible thanks to the work of the many teams in- volved. This is why I cannot end this letter without first  thanking everyone in the great LATAM family for their  effort, commitment, and dedication.  I encourage you  to keep this same spirit alive and to keep working with  passion and excellence, ensuring that our clients dreams  reach their destination, all this in our aim to become one  of the most admired airline groups in the world.  Enrique Cueto CEO LATAM Group are only awaiting the approval in Chile and the confirma- tion of Open Skies in Brazil (which has already been ap- proved by Congress). We expect to complete this process  in 2018 so we can begin to implement these new agree- ments, which will provide our passengers with access to a  broader network of destinations, as well as more flights,  better connection times, and better prices. In order to expedite the coordination among our affiliates  and streamline the decision-making process, we defined  a new organizational structure in 2017, shifting from  business units to a functional structure that focuses on  four main areas of responsibility—Clients, Operations,  Marketing, and Finance. This will enable us to adapt con- tinuously to an evolving industry and a volatile economic  environment, thereby improving our competitiveness. At LATAM Group we uphold a long-term commitment  to the region, reflected in its sustainability strategy,  LATAM UPHOLDS A LONG-TERM  COMMITMENT TO THE REGION,  REFLECTED IN ITS SUSTAINABILITY  STRATEGY, WHOSE FOCUS IS BOTH TO  COMPENSATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL  IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS AND TO  ACTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY. 1  Subject to borrowing base availability. 6 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  Who we are  Who we are \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits 7 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION  ATAM Airlines Group and its affiliates operate in the domes- tic markets of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador  and Peru, in the regional market among these countries and  on long-haul flights to and from North America and Cen- tral America, Europe, Africa and Oceania. The airline group is  considered a benchmark in connectivity in Latin America and  in the world. In 2017, the Group connected 137 passenger  destinations in 24 countries, with an average of over 1,300  flights per day. Cargo transportation covered 144 destina- tions in 29 countries. The parent company of the Group has  its headquarters in Chile and the Group has 43,095 employ- ees of 64 nationalities. Its shares are traded on the Santiago  (Chile) and the New York (United States) stock exchanges.  [102-1, 102-2, 102-4, 102-6 and 107-7] The LATAM Airlines Group (formerly LAN Airlines) is com- prised of affiliates in Peru, Argentina, Colombia and Ec- uador; as well as LATAM CARGO and its subsidiaries; TAM  S.A and its subsidiaries TAM Linhas Areas S.A. (LATAM  Airlines Brasil) and its business units TAM Transportes  Areos Del Mercosur S.A. (LATAM Airlines Paraguay)  and Multiplus S.A. In October, LATAM announced the sale of its subsid- iary Andes Airport Services S.A., responsible for ground  maintenance services at Santiago airport (Chile). The  transaction involving two Spanish companies allows the  Group to focus its efforts on its core activity in order to  continue to enhance service levels for passengers and  cargo customers.  In financial terms, 2017 saw important operating and fi- nancial results for the Group. EBITDAR (earnings before  interest, taxes, amortization, depreciation and aircraft  rentals) was US$2.3 billion, 9.5% up on 2016. Operating  earnings increased by 25.8% compared with the previ- ous year, reaching US$715 million, the highest ever for  LATAM. Net profit totaled US$155.3 million.

Another 21 international  routes are scheduled for 2018:  An ever-growing network BOOSTING ACCESS With the aim of offering customers greater  connectivity and a wider range of options,  the Group establishes operating agree- ments with other airline groups for the  joint operation of routes. During the course  of 2017, the Group advanced towards  the implementation of two Joint Busi- ness Agreements (JBA), one with the US  company American Airlines and the other  with the International Airlines Group (IAG),  which controls British Airways and Iberia.  The agreements have been approved in  Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay. In Chile, the  proposal is being analyzed by the countrys  antitrust authority (Tribunal de Defensa de  la Libre Competencia). These commercial agreements, which  do not involve any change of ownership  among the parties and do not affect the  competitive environment, are a means  of enhancing the value proposition for  customers and attracting new users to  air travel. They ensure the Group's pres- ence on new routes and in new connec- tion hubs and increase the offer and fre- quency of direct flights to destinations  not operated by the Group. These syn- ergies optimize costs, which translates  into cheaper air tickets. Strategic hubs The Group also has  strategic hubs in major  South American airports  enabling connection  to a growing number  of destinations and  facilitating travel for  passengers. LATAM  Airlines Group and its  affiliates currently  have four main hubs in  operation: Guarulhos (Sao  Paulo/Brazil), Lima (Peru),  Brasilia (Brazil) and  Santiago (Chile). Global alliance LATAM Airlines Group  is a member of the  oneworld global  alliance, consisting of  15 airlines with flights  that connect Latin  America, North America,  Europe, Asia, Africa and  the Middle East. WHEN THEY  COME INTO  OPERATION,  THE JBAs WILL  OPEN ACCESS TO  MORE THAN 420  DESTINATIONS  AND OVER  800 MILLION  POTENTIAL  PASSENGERS. \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits 9 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION  LATAM brand In the course of 2017, the Group advanced in the pro- cess of consolidating the single LATAM brand, which  should be concluded by 2021. The visual identity has  already been implemented on 21% of LATAMs aircraft,  in 31% of its hangars and buildings and in 84% of the  LATAM Travel offices. The new uniform has also been  adopted by the air crews from all the countries, with  the exception of Argentina. In 2018, the client purchase experience will also be uni- fied. With the integration of the passenger service sys- tems, ticket purchase, the issue of boarding cards and  consultations about flight status will take place on the  same platform, regardless of the flight code, LA or JJ. #ELVUELODEFRANCISCO  LATAM was the airline group chosen to transport  Pope Francis and his entourage of approximately  130 people during his visit to Chile and Peru, in  January 2018. After completing his scheduled pro- gram in the capital, Santiago, the Pope went on to  the other Chilean cities of Temuco and Iquique in  an Airbus A321 from the LATAM fleet, which bore  the papal emblem and the slogan #ElVueloDeFran- cisco (#FrancisFlight, in English) on the fuselage.  LATAM was also responsible for the Popes flights  to Lima, Puerto Maldonado and Trujillo in Peru, and  his return trip, via a direct flight from Lima to Rome  (Italy). Total time in the air was over 25 hours, cov- ering a distance of 17,288 kilometers. The trip lasted a total of six days, but preparations  began six months before. In addition to customizing  the aircraft both internally and externally and adapt- ing the in-flight services, LATAM participated fully in  planning the journeys with the Vatican and the avia- tion authorities involved. This is the second time the  Group has transported a pontiff. In 1987, Pope John  Paul II flew to eight cities in Chile via LAN. To commemorate the Popes visit to the two coun- tries and disseminate a message of peace and har- monious coexistence with the environment, LATAM  organized two symbolic acts which will involve vol- unteer employees in 2018. One is the planting of  five thousand seedlings of native tree species in  the Chilean region of Santa Olga, affected by for- est fires in the beginning of 2017. The other action  is the planting of one thousand tara trees, a medici- nal plant, in the Pachactec region of the Peruvian  province of Callao. With LATAMs network and capillarity, we intend to  be the driving force behind the development of air  transportation in South America. We are working to  ensure the highest levels of service so that we may  respond to the demands and fulfill the expectations  of different passenger profiles. This involves build- ing closer relations with passengers, monitoring their  experiences with our brand, responding rapidly to  new trends and innovating continuously.

[102-5] mission is to establish strategic direction for the Group.  In this, it is supported by the Directors Committee, com- prising three independent board members, in line with the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the respective SEC guidelines.  Given the similarity of functions, the Directors Commit- tee also exercises the role of Audit Committee (for further  information on the board, consult goo.gl/AWPQfC). New structure In the beginning of 2017, LATAM adopted a simpler,  more streamlined structure in the executive sphere.  This is aimed at ensuring the Group achieves its estab- lished objectives and overcoming industry challenges.  Four macro areas reporting directly to the CEO were set  up: Clients, Commercial, Operations and Fleet, Finance.  Together with the CEO, they make up the Senior Man- agement Committee, which meets on a weekly basis to  monitor more strategic questions for the business, with  support from the vice president of Human Resources  and the Strategic Planning director and representatives  from other areas. The Human Resources, Corporate Affairs, Safety, Tech- nology, Planning and Legal areas operate across the entire  Group. In each country where a LATAM affiliate operates  – Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru –,  there is a CEO who is responsible for the local operation  (see the complete orgAnizAtionAl ChArt on the next page). \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits 13 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION   Cueto Group  Qatar Airways   Ebien Group  Bethia Group  Amaro Group  Hirmas Group  AFP (Chilean Pension Fund Managers)  ADR (American Depositary Receipts)  Overseas investors  Others 1 Information from December 31, 2017. 27.9 10.0 5.9 5.5 2.6  21.2 4.1 10.5 12.1 [102-10] SHAREHOLDER BREAKDOWN1   (%) TOTAL 606,407,693  shares paid up and underwritten MARKET RELATIONS LATAM maintains permanent rela- tions with shareholders and other  capital market actors.

As  part of its Compliance program, the Group has its Code of  Conduct, which sets forth the behavior expected of LATAM  staff at work and in interactions with other stakehold- ers. The Group also maintains an efficient self-regulatory  framework, which is reviewed and updated periodically. The Chief Compliance Officer tracks compliance-related  questions on a regular basis. Employees undergo training  in ethics, compliance, anti-corruption and anti-competitive  practices. In 2017, a new version of the e-learning program  on the Code of Conduct was launched, reinforced with prac- tical examples that facilitate the connection of daily work  routines with the questions addressed in the document, in  addition to a final test to verify the programs effective- ness. This program is mandatory for all new employees. In the course of the year, all Group employees received  training on the Code of Conduct. Specific training pro- grams were taken by a total of 72% of the workforce and  89% of senior management – executives and members  of the Board of Directors. [205-2] Moreover, 151 professionals act as compliance am- bassadors in their units.

Contributions are allowed only if they are compliant  with applicable legislation. Any contributions must  be aligned with the LATAM Code of Conduct and re- quire approval by the Board of Directors, represented  by the Senior Management Committee. There have been no contributions since the policy  was created. [415-1] ETHICS CHANNEL [102-17 and 205-3] This is the channel through which reports on  violations of laws and internal standards are  received, encompassing: non-compliance  with the LATAM Code of Conduct, labor ir- regularities and cases of discrimination,  sexual or moral harassment, fraud, corrup- tion and bribery, among others. To ensure the identity of the whistleblow- er is preserved and the reports are ad- dressed correctly, the channel is managed  by a third-party provider. After an initial  analysis, the required cases are assessed  by a specific investigation committee in  each country (Code of Conduct Adminis- tration Committee), comprising represen- tatives of the Human Resources, Compli- ance and Legal areas, among others. This  body decides on the measures to be taken  in each case. In 2017, there were no confirmed cases  of corruption involving the team. Neither  were any supplier contracts terminated due  to corruption. Corporate policies [102-16] All LATAM executives and employees are  supported by internal policies that provide  orientation on how to conduct business on a day  to day basis. Worthy of note among these are:   Code of Conduct  (goo.gl/mWDrrl)   Policy on Executives Roles   and Responsibilities    Risk Management Policy   (Further information on PAge 34.)

As part of this dynamic ecosystem, LATAM believes  it is important to review this process periodically. The  most recent review was conducted from November  2017 to January 2018 with the participation of senior  management and consultation of external stakehold- ers (see PAge 77).

The bonus program is orga- nized in three tiers. The first, which is the main trigger determining the  payment or not of the bonus, is the non-occur- rence of an airplane accident during the year. The second tier takes into account performance  against corporate targets, in which the diverse areas  are co-responsible, contributing their expertise and  specific approaches to the achievement of common  targets for the business as a whole. Safety-related  questions are part of the targets for all executives,  broken down into distinct commitments for each  area. Items such as on-time performance, customer  satisfaction, organizational climate and engagement,  financial performance, cost efficiency and productiv- ity are addressed in a more transversal manner, with  responsibility attributed to more than one area. The third tier in the calculation measures perfor- mance in terms of specific indicators and targets  according to each area of activity and individual  performance targets. he corporate Sustainability Policy approved by the  Board of Directors in 2016 helped drive sustainabil- ity further into LATAM business strategy during the  year. The document helps to shape shared value  generation initiatives aimed at shareholders, em- ployees, clients, suppliers, the airline sector and so- ciety as a whole. With the Sustainability Policy in place, in 2017, the  Group focused its efforts on raising the awareness  and engaging leaders and teams in implementing  the economic, social and environmental dimensions  of the concept in work routines and decision mak- ing processes. Presentations were made to the Se- nior Management Committee and to specific areas,  such as Legal, Human Resources, Marketing and  Safety, among others. The sustainability goals and targets are monitored by  the Board of Directors. In 2017, the board started to  assess how it could enhance the current governance  structure, including the incorporation of diversity-re- lated questions. It should be noted that all new direc- tors undergo training on sustainability.

These references were also considered in drafting the  Groups Sustainability Policy. The following standards  incorporated by the Group are worthy of note:   —ISO 26000 standard: the international Corporate  Social Responsibility standard.   —Global Compact: a United Nations Organization ini- tiative to encourage the adoption of corporate re- sponsibility practices in the areas of human rights,  human rights in labor relations, the environment and  anti-corruption. LATAM is a signatory to the Com- pact and monitors its progress in relation to the  goals (further information on PAge 84).   —Sustainable Development Goals: a global develop- ment agenda promoted by the UN, which defines  17 goals related to the eradication of poverty, food  security, health, education, gender equality, reduc- tion of inequality, energy, water, climate change,  sustainable cities and inclusive economic growth,  among others. These goals are broken down into  169 targets (further information on PAge 24). RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS LATAM has direct operations in six South  American countries and a presence in other  regions around the world. Consequently, re- spect for human rights, diversity and multiple  cultures are important components of the  organizations sustainability strategy and of  the business itself. These aspects are key in  managing the workforce comprising 64 differ- ent nationalities, and also influence relations  with clients, suppliers and local communities. To continue to advance in these questions  based on a more proactive strategy and  measures that drive a greater impact, LATAM  created a working group comprising staff  from the Sustainability, Human Resources  and Risk areas. Planning of the actions was  initiated at the end of 2017, with execu- tion scheduled for 2018. Consulting external  sources and best practice benchmarks, this  team will conduct a preliminary diagnosis of  risks and opportunities associated with di- versity and human rights in the context of  the Group and its relations within the value  chain. The work will include the mapping of  vulnerable groups. Based on the initial data,  a pilot program should be developed in Peru.   —Guiding Principles on Business and Human  Rights: a guide prepared by the special represen- tative of the United Nations General Secretariat,  John Ruggie, which sets forth parameters and  guidelines to protect, respect and remedy human  rights in the business world.   —Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning  Multinational Companies and Social Policy: this  was drafted by the International Labor Organization  (ILT) aimed at promoting the active participation of  multinational companies in driving economic and  social progress, while simultaneously minimizing the  negative effects of their activities.   —The Organization for Economic Cooperation and De- velopments (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational  Companies: this provides a series of recommenda- tions for companies and governments with principles  and voluntary standards to ensure business conduct  adherent to the law and best international practices.   —Global Reporting Initiative (GRI): an international  multistakeholder organization that seeks to drive  standardization and ongoing improvement in manag- ing and communicating sustainability in companies  and organizations of different sizes and in different  sectors. This gave rise to the GRI methodology, a  global reference for reporting on sustainability. 23 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  Alignment with the SDGs LATAM is committed to the Sustainable  Development Goals established by  the United Nations Organization (UN).  In 2017, the Group analyzed the main  connections between its material top- ics and the SDGs, identifying opportu- nities to contribute to the achievement  of the UN targets. The clearest example is the topic cli- mate change, which encompasses  managing the operations emissions  impacts and its eco-efficiency mea- sures, which are directly linked with  SDG 13, climate action, with SDG 7  (clean and accessible energy), as well  as SDG 11 and 12 (sustainable cities  and communities and responsible con- sumption and production respectively).  The full correlation is shown ahead. The global agenda has also been the  object of discussion at industry level.  Recently, the Air Transport Action Group  (ATAG) published a study which maps  the SDGs to which the airline sector  may make a more effective contribution  and which served as a reference for the  internal study produced by LATAM.

All its partnerships are based on the prin- ciples of ethics and transparency. LATAM engages in the key topics for the industry and  the business, such as those concerning air safety, taxa- tion and other charges. One subject which is becoming  increasingly relevant on the continent is the potential  expansion of the air travel market and the consequent  need for governments to invest more in improving air- port infrastructure (further information on PAge 33). Environmental agenda [102-12 and 102-13] The Group plays an active role in debates and ini- tiatives to mitigate environmental impacts through  participation in working groups and multisector fo- rums. There follows a list of some of the main fo- rums and iniciatives in 2017:   —IATA (International Air Transport Association): a  member of the association, LATAM focuses specifi- cally on discussions involving climate change, noise  and environmental management. IATA was one of  the bodies that worked actively on approving COR- SIA (Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for Inter- national Aviation), an industry agreement approved  in 2016 aimed at reducing and mitigating emissions  from air transportation by 2035.   —ALTA (Latin American and Caribbean Air Trans- port Association): in this association, LATAM  leads regional discussions on emissions and cli- mate change.   —Reforestemos Patagonia (Reforesting Patago- nia): LATAM Airlines Chile was a founding member  and maintains an active participation in this initia- tive to reclaim the ecosystem in Chilean Patagonia.   —BAM (Bosques Amaznicos): the organization  manages this REDD (Reducing Emissions from  Deforestation and Forest Degradation) project,  whereby LATAM Airlines Peru offsets emissions  from its ground operations.   —South Pole: the organization has managed the  environmental protection projects that enable  LATAM Airlines Colombia to neutralize the GHG  emissions from its ground operations since 2013.  Since 2017, this program has also encompassed  air emissions from the domestic operation.   —CEBDS (Conselho Empresarial Brasileiro para o  Desenvolvimento Sustentvel or Brazilian Sus- tainable Development Business Council): LATAM  belongs to this body which promotes sustainable  development in association with governments and  various civil society actors.   —WWF – Brasil Business Network: LATAM Brasil  is part of this group of companies committed to  promoting the conservation of biodiversity and  the rational use of natural resources.

It has been necessary to evolve to  ensure a new value proposition for customers, as well  as to drive business sustainability and generate shared  value for stakeholders. To shape this evolution, in 2016 the Group launched its  Change to One transformation plan. Aligned with the  organizations strategic macro-pillars (destination net- work; leading brand and customer experience; costs;  organizational strength; and risk management), Change  to One is aimed at speeding up the changes and driving  results in the short, medium and long terms. This movement involves more than 1,500 initiatives  organized in five main areas: Shaping  evolution I The execution of these initiatives directly or indirectly  involves 2,000 employees of LATAM and its affiliates. Sixteen working groups dedicated to specific areas,  such as digital strategy and information technology  systems, maintenance chain and supply chain and  brand, were created. Divided into stages, with defined  deadlines and targets, the work is monitored from  planning through to implementation. By the end of 2017, the Group had concluded 80% of  the initiatives planned. Worthy of note among the de- liveries are: 2017 marks the year  of LATAMs  transformation. A  new  domestic  operational  model,  launched gradually from 2016 in the coun- tries in South America in which the Group's  affiliates operate – with the exception of  Argentina (further information in Customers); New in-flight meal service – LATAM market  (further information in Customers); The organizational structure, which simplified  and streamlined decision making by replac- ing the format based on business units with a  more transversal structure (see PAge 13).

To meet projected demand, LATAM should  receive two new Airbus A321-200 aircraft in 2018. 16 working groups 1,518 iniciatives LATAM IN  TRANSFORMATION This movement has proven to us that transformation should be a  permanent goal in all LATAM areas and for all Group employees. This  is not a specific project with a final implementation deadline, but a new  way of managing the business that will drive our reinvention as a com- pany whenever necessary in order to address emerging challenges.\" ROBERTO ALVO  SENIOR COMMERCIAL VICE PRESIDENT Expanded access to air transportation LATAM maintains it commitment to boost access to air  transportation services in the region. In addition to di- rectly impacting Group revenue generation and, there- fore, the capacity to build up the business over time,  this commitment has a positive influence on the coun- tries in which LATAM operates. The expansion of the  sector has the potential to drive distinct economic sec- tors (commerce and services), with positive effects on  employment and income levels, as well as development. Although the sector has grown in recent years, the op- portunities for further expansion of the air travel mar- ket in Latin America are still significant. According to  IATA (International Air Transport Association) statistics,  in 2017 the region accounted for only 5.2% of domestic  flights worldwide, measured in RPK (Revenue Passen- ger Kilometers).In Chile, which has one of the highest  average number of flights per person on the continent,  the rate of domestic flights was 0.55 trips per inhabit- ant in 2016. In the United States and the United King- dom, the rate is four times higher. The Group has been focusing efforts on leveraging this  growth potential in the sector in a sustainable manner.  In parallel with the adjustments in the business itself,  LATAM has been closely monitoring the work being  done by different government areas on investing in and  updating airport infrastructure in the region. Expansion works are being undertaken at Santiago airport  (Chile), and are scheduled to be completed in 2020. In  2017, ongoing construction work in the baggage handling  and document checking areas in the immigration sector  affected passengers flying with LATAM and other airlines. Investments are scheduled for Lima airport in Peru, the  two main airports in Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Gua- rulhos international airport in Brazil. Through the asso- ciations representing the sector, LATAM is monitoring  the projects and maintaining dialogue with the govern- ment areas and the concessionaires that manage the  airports to guarantee efficient operations in the short- term, until completion of the expansion works. Inter- nally, LATAM has been analyzing the need for invest- ments to expand the capacity of its hangars located in  the areas around these airports. Another point requiring attention is the need to ad- just airport charges, which still represent a significant  percentage of the total cost of travel in some coun- tries, such as Chile. Furthermore, there is a need for  investment to improve public transportation systems  between cities and airports to facilitate connectivity  for passengers.

Strategic risks are inserted in a matrix that considers  the probability of occurrence and the potential impact  of each. The tool includes intersecting and emerging  risks. Internal Audit supports this work systematically  and, whenever necessary, incorporates topics mapped  as relevant in its monitoring processes. Although it has a dedicated area, LATAM engages all  leaders in controlling risks. The Risk Desk, created in  2016, is one of the forums engaged in internal dissem- ination. Representatives from multiple areas partici- pate in the meetings promoted by the corporate team. Worthy of note in 2017 was the reinforcement of com- pliance-related risks and a training program for directors.  The system for managing strategic cross-cutting risks,  which standardizes identification, monitoring and report- ing tools, was also extended to the local operations. In  the larger scale operations, such as Brazil, Chile and Ar- gentina, the Finance area oversees this system, with sup- port from the country CEO and the corporate team. Matrix In 2017, the LATAM risk matrix comprised more than 50  topics, broken down into 11 categories that cover the  environment, safety, regulatory environment, supply  chain and employee management, among others. Emerging risks include those linked with external  events, such as the propagation of infectious diseases,  natural disasters, as well as wars and acts of terror- ism. In more extreme cases, these episodes could de- crease or even paralyze the demand for air transpor- tation services for a determined period of time, be it  due to decisions by authorities to prohibit travel to and  from the affected countries/regions, or to customers  themselves deciding to postpone their trips. The miti- gation measures LATAM takes include the adoption of  rigorous safety standards and procedures to prevent  the spread of contagious diseases, permanent contact  with the competent authorities and the organization of  preventive communication campaigns, in addition to  the emergency response plan, which is activated in the  event of air crashes and other catastrophes. Risk  management R Another emerging risk is the possible adoption of more  restrictive laws and regulations on climate change and  greenhouse gas emissions in the countries in which  LATAM operates. These could have a negative influence  on the Groups operational costs and earnings in the  medium term. To mitigate this risk, LATAM invests con- stantly in fleet modernization, in fuel efficiency and in  emissions reduction. Also worthy of note is the Groups  adhesion – by means of the International Air Trans- port Association (IATA) – to the Carbon Neutral Growth  (CNG2020) commitment to offset emissions.

There was a 28% in- crease in the average spend per pas- senger compared with 2016, mainly  from baggage dispatch services, the  sale of preferential seats and flex- ibility in rescheduling flights. LATAM CARGO Cargo segment revenue recovered  in the second half of the year. The  unit revenue, measured in revenue  per available tonne kilometer (ATK),  grew 8.5% in 2017.  LATAM AIRLINES BRAZIL  DOMESTIC MARKET In the Brazilian domestic market, the  Group continued to adjust its capac- ity during the year, which together  with the improvement in the macro- economic context, boosted unit rev- enue (measured in revenue per ASK  – available seat kilometers). FLEET PLAN   —During 2017 LATAM continued to adjust its fleet  plan, reaching US$326 million, the lowest amount  in recent history. This reduction in investment needs  reinforced the Groups capital structure. LATAM  ended the year with an operating fleet of 307 air- craft, a reduction of 22 aircraft compared to 2016.   —Fleet commitments for 2018 and 2019 total  US$714 million and US$1,213 million, respectively,  and the number of aircraft should reach 316 in 2018  and 322 in 2019. FINANCIAL LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY Leverage (adjusted net debt/EBITDAR) decreased from  5.3x in 2016 to 4.5x in 2017.

Re- lations with partners are focused  on business competitiveness,  product and service excellence,  joint growth and stimulating  good sustainability practices. The  Procurement area is responsible  for the ongoing management of  the contracts undertaken with  these partners, seeking to bal- ance costs and conformance with  the criteria required by LATAM,  especially with respect to qual- ity, safety, social, environmental  and financial matters, as well  as legal compliance. Context and positioning Management approach POLICY Corporate Procurement Policy sets forth the financial, social and environmental  requirements to be followed by business partners, in line with the directives in the  Groups Code of Conduct and Anti-Corruption Policy and the specific regulations of the  countries in which LATAM operates. The document was revised in 2017. The objective  was to prioritize strategic matters related to managing the supply chain; questions  concerning routine relations with partners were incorporated into internal procedures. COMPLYING WITH THE CODE OF   CONDUCT To become a LATAM supplier, a compa- ny must confirm its compliance with the  document, which contains guidelines on  ethics, anti-corruption and compliance  with occupational health and safety,  social and environmental responsibility  and human rights (guarantee of decent  working conditions and non-use of child  and slave labor) standards. The code is available at the address:   goo.gl/hPim77. THIRD-PARTY INTERMEDIARIES (TPI) Whenever suppliers act as agents represent- ing the airline group in dealings with local or  overseas civil servants, for all intented purposes  they will be considered to be third-party inter- mediaries (TPI). Suppliers qualified as TPIs follow specific proce- dures and are required to present additional in- formation. They must also guarantee compliance  with the LATAM Group Code of Conduct and Anti- Corruption Policy. Their contracts include specific  anti-bribery & corruption clauses. All TPIs are  subject to an in-depth due diligence review. RISK MATRIX The risk matrix monitors the more  significant risks and impacts in each  supplier category, be it products  or services. In alignment with the  policy, the risks monitored include  ones that may impact LATAMs  financial health and ethical conduct,  as well as compliance with labor,  tax, industry and sanitary standards,  human rights, as well as good envi- ronmental and social practices. For partners considered to be criti- cal (suppliers of components that  are essential for the operation or  difficult to replace, who have annual  contracts in excess of US$1 million  or who relate to government au- thorities on behalf of LATAM), there  are also periodic audits. Technical  partners in particular are subject to  monthly performance assessments  (read more on PAge 40). RISK ANALYSIS Every month, LATAM analyzes information on suppli- ers with active contracts using the Lexis Nexis system.  This system utilizes an extensive international data base  encompassing involvement in corruption, anti-competitive  conduct, financing terrorism and drug trafficking, exploi- tation of child and slave labor and environmental non- compliance.  Cases identified as risks are analyzed on a one to one  basis by the Compliance area to check whether the alert is  justified or not. If it is considered to be grounded, the area  either indicates the corrective measures to be taken or  recommends the termination of the contract. In 2017, 10,600 assessments were undertaken; 767 of these  resulted in alerts which are currently under analysis. No ir- regularities had been confirmed by the end of the year.  Advances in 2017 All contracts include an environ- mental clause whereby partners  must comply with the pertinent  legal requirements, take respon- sibility for any resulting sanctions  and communicate any environmen- tal damage to LATAM. In 2017, this  clause was also incorporated into  purchase orders, which substitute  contracts in short-term commercial  relationships. The additional condi- tions refer specifically to the obser- vation of anti-corruption practices  and the implementation of environ- mental protection measures on the  part of suppliers.

With a customer-centered cul- ture, LATAM strives to anticipate  industry trends and stay abreast  of the evolution of passenger  expectations and requirements.  The Group aims to boost con- nectivity in Latin America and  capture the growth opportunities  generated by increased demand  for air travel. In 2016, the average  number of domestic flights per  inhabitant was 0.22 in Argentina,  0.47 in Brazil and 0.48 in Colom- bia. In Chile, where demand has  steadily outstripped economic  growth  in recent years, the rate  is 0.55, approximately a quarter  of the figure for Europe. IN 2017, THE GROUP PRIORITIZED TWO WORK FRONTS: New service culture - Results Airports   Management approach Advances in 2017   — Consolidation of the new service culture,  focused on the pillars of efficiency,  safety and care, with the aim of enhanc- ing the passenger experience before,  during and after each LATAM flight,  through improvements in the service  levels provided by the different teams.   — New value proposition for domestic  flights, which stimulates access to  airline services and drives the Groups  entry into new market niches. Since 2015, LATAM has been  consolidating a new customer- centered service culture aimed at  generating proximity and reinforc- ing identification with the brand.  The measures are concentrated in  the Twist project. This has involved  the reformulation of management  practices and the implementation of  new work routines, such as daily and  pre-flight dialogues between leaders  and teams, a platform for receiving  suggestions for improvements from  employees and a program to recog- nize outstanding performance. The  project has translated into greater  alignment with customer needs,  increased autonomy for employ- ees and heightened efficiency and  satisfaction. This new service culture has already  impacted more than 20,000 employ- ees at 140 sites. In 2018, the new  model should be extended to the  LATAM customer support areas. CUSTOMER FOCUS To add value to the customer  experience and foment the use of  air travel in the region, LATAM has  designed a new way of traveling  based on the premise that there  are a number of different customer  profiles with different needs who  will now be offered differentiated  services. Basic fares have been  reduced by 25% on average, with  passengers able to choose pack- ages that incorporate additional  services, such as:   — baggage dispatch;   — choice of seat;   — flexibility to alter date of travel;   — car rental at destination. Additionally, there is the buy- on-board meal service (Mercado  LATAM), which has a new menu  with more than 30 options of  foods and beverages. The model has already been ad- opted in all the countries in which  the Group operates, with the  exception of Argentina. In Brazil,  the in-flight meal service is being  implemented gradually, in accor- dance with determinations from  the competent local authorities. The plan for 2018 is to take this  new travel model for domestic  markets and to apply it for re- gional flights between countries in  Latin America.

The Group also carries out a systematic annual survey  based on the Net Promoter Score (NPS) methodology,  where the score may range from -100 to + 100. In 2017,  this survey was incorporated 330,000 responses, rep- resenting 0.5% of the Groups clients. The satisfaction  level was 29 points, 12 points below the level in 2016,  which is attributable to adaptation to the new sales  model and OTP in key principal markets. Over the course of 2017, passengers were adapting  to the new travel model for affiliate carrier domestic  flights in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. As  anticipated, satisfaction levels dropped following the  introduction of the new service, but in the following  months customers began to recognize the value of at- tributes such as flexibility when purchasing tickets and  quality cuisine at an affordable price.

This was due to problems with air traffic control,  meteorological conditions and operational and mainte- nance issues with LATAM aircraft. Given that OTP is one of the most highly valued de- terminants of overall customer satisfaction, LATAM  has developed a series of wide-ranging measures to  improve performance in this area. The Group is also  increasing the frequency and quality of information  provided to passengers and guaranteeing the quality of  hotels, transfer services and meals in the event of de- lays and cancelations. 43 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION ECONOMIC   DIMENSION \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  Technology as an ally LATAM also progressed in its digital strategies to  make life easier for customers. The total number  of active users of the LATAM application increased  from four million in 2016 to 4.9 million in 2017. The  app enables users to buy tickets, reserve their seat,  check in, issue a virtual boarding card and consult  flight status. These services are also available on the  LATAM corporate site. To give customers even greater autonomy, the Group  increased the number of self-service kiosks at the  airports. In addition to checking in, these allow pas- sengers to print their baggage labels. A total of 713  (three out of each four) kiosks already offer these  services at 66 airports in 11 countries. LATAM also decided to revolutionize the  meal service on long-haul flights last- ing over seven hours. The small portions  (starters, hot dishes and desserts) were  replaced with a main dish – there are  always three options on the menu –, on  average 40% larger than the meal served  previously, prepared with even greater  care and quality. The objective is to en- sure the passenger has an experience  similar to that offered by a restaurant. Customer acceptance of the model was  tested and measured in real time on 14  flights. Based on the results of the test  phase, LATAM launched the new menu  officially in Chile in October. The initia- tive, which also reduces the volume of  plastic waste on aircraft on every flight,  is already in place on all international  routes to/from Brazil, Peru, Argentina  and Ecuador. It has been subjected to  small adjustments based on the experi- ence and learning derived from managing  the new model.

In  2017, the portfolio for the international market was  enhanced. It offers three types of shipping service:  standard; express, which ensures delivery within a  specific timeframe; and flex, a more economical so- lution for non-critical shipments. When opting for  the flex service, the client has a guaranteed delivery  date but the route and the type of aircraft (passen- ger or freighter) are decided by LATAM, enabling op- erational cost optimization and, consequently, more  competitive prices. The types of service are combined with the so-called  care options, enabling customized treatment in accor- dance with nature of the cargo being shipped. There  are exclusive options for transporting live animals,  oversize cargos, hazardous materials, valuable goods  and pharmaceutical products, among others.

The document, approved by senior management, sets  forth the parameters for continuous performance im- provement in this area. International standards and  norms were used as a reference in the elaboration of  the policy and also as a guide for the Groups environ- mental management systems (EMS). These enable  LATAM to measure the gains achieved against the in- vestments involved in a more accurate manner. It is  also possible to track the costs avoided in function of  the improvements implemented. In 2017, these to- taled US$100.3 million. In an ongoing process, 96% of the operations had an  environmental management system in place in De- cember 2017, compared with 91% the previous year.  In total, 27% of the operations (measured in RTK -  revenue tonne-kilometres) have a certified system in  accordance with international standards. This is the  case with the Miami operation (United States), which  has been recertified in the ISO 14001 (environmental  management) standard. The next step will be to adapt  the system to the most recent version of the standard  (ISO 14001/2015). IEnvA – management program focused on the sector LATAM remains committed to the directives set forth in  the IATA (International Air Transport Association) vol- untary Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) initiative. In  2017, the international air operations from Chile were  recertified under the program. In addition to LATAM   Airlines Group another 12 airlines have received either  stage 1 or stage 2 certification. The Group is focusing  its efforts on obtaining this certification for domes- tic operations in Chile, as well as for its operations in  other countries.

LATAM Airlines Group was the first airline in Latin  America and third in the world to receive certifica- tion under the IEnvA voluntary program. In 2017, the international operation in Chile was  recertified for the second time. The Group also  adopts the programs Best Environmental Man- agement Practices Manual as a reference to en- sure more consistent management in the water,  effluent and waste areas. Focused on airline operations and thus taking  into account sector specificities, the program is  aligned with the ISO 14001 environmental man- agement standard.  To drive continuous improvement and to ensure  other airline companies are compliant with the  best practices set forth in the program, the IEnvA is  currently being adapted to the new version of the  standard (ISO 14001/2015) and also to ISO 50001,  a specific standard for energy management.

The calculation is based on 260 airline companies which  account for 80% of international air traffic. Context and  positioning According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  from airline operations correspond to approximately  2% of total emissions generated by human activities.  Although this percentage is low compared with other  industries, the emissions represent the sectors main  environmental impact. Management approach FUEL EFFICIENCY  During the course of the year, 25 projects were  conducted under the Fuel Efficiency Program, which  involves areas such as Services, Airports, Mainte- nance and Operations. The consumption of 50 million  gallons of fuel was avoided (6,050 TJ), equivalent to  US$100 million. Since 2012, the expenses avoided   with the Fuel Efficiency Program have totaled  US$506 million. [302-4] Worthy of note was the identification of opportunities  for improvement based on the automated analysis  of information from all flight stages and the study  of different routes and aircraft. An example is the  Bogota-Santiago-Bogota route: the analysis enabled  the reduction of the outward bound flight time by 20  minutes and the return flight time by 40 minutes. The assessments also generated economies in calcula- tions of fuel reserves for taxiing procedures based  the specificities of each airport and the takeoff and  landing times. LATAM TARGETS LATAM is committed to IATA targets:   —  An annual increase of   1.5% in fuel use efficiency;   —  Limit growth in emissions   from 2020;   —  Halve the Groups carbon footprint  by 2050, with 2005 as base year. Different initiatives are coordinated  in a structured management process  that involves:   — Objective measurement of impacts;   — Establishment of goals and targets;   —  Reducing emissions, mainly through efficient  fuel use;   —  Offsetting emissions (investment in certified  projects);   —  Active participation in sector joint efforts: part of  Carbon Neutral Growth (CNG2020), a voluntary  sector initiative establishing emissions offsetting  targets and deadlines; through IATA (International  Air Transport Association), the Group is keeping  close track of the developments of the COR- SIA agreement (see PAge 53) and is preparing to  implement it in the countries in which it operates;   —  Support for discussions aimed at creating and  reinforcing a biofuel production chain for wide- spread use in the aviation industry (see PAge 54). 80% of the sectors GHG  emissions come from  flights of over 1,500  kilometers, in which air  travel is the most efficient  means of transporting  people and cargo.

The Group is fully com- mitted to climate action, with a structured strategy  to drive ongoing performance improvement through  reduction and offsetting measures. The Groups  progress is monitored by means of its greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions inventory, conducted annually  based on the ISO 14.064 standard. The calculation  uses international reference data and is based on in- formation gathered from the management systems  in diverse areas. The data demonstrates a steady improvement in  performance both in terms of total emissions (abso- Operating  eco-efficiency C lute value) and intensity (relative value). From 2016  to 2017, LATAM managed to reduce total greenhouse  gas emissions by over 280,000 metric tons. This is  equivalent to 650 return flights between Santiago  (Chile) and Auckland (New Zealand), that is, two years  of operations on this route. It should be noted that this reduction in impacts is  occurring in parallel with an expansion in LATAMs  activities. Efficiency measures enabled the Group to  transport more while generating fewer emissions. THE PURSUIT OF ECO-EFFICIENCY  INVOLVES DIFFERENT FRONTS,  WITH A FOCUS ON ATMOSPHERIC  EMISSIONS, WATER CONSUMPTION  AND WASTE GENERATION.

Emissions from ground  operations had been neutralized since 2014. The neutraliza- tion certificate ensured exemption for LATAM Colombia from  a tax introduced by the Colombian government at the end of  2016 which charges US$5 for each metric ton of carbon emit- ted from burning fossil fuels.

In  the year, four new aircraft were incorporated into the fleet  by the Group. Fleet modernization influences fuel consump- tion and reduces CO2e and NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions,  as well as generating lower noise levels. This is another im- pact monitored by the Group, which especially affects peo- ple living close to certain airports, an ongoing consequence  of urban expansion. The environmental differentials of the new aircraft com- pared to the previous generation aircraft should be noted: At the end of 2016, the sector was the first to as- sume a public commitment to put a cap on its GHG  emissions. The agreement became known by the  acronym, CORSIA, which stands for Carbon Offset- ting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation.  Voted by the 191 member states of the International  Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), during a conference  in Montreal (Canada), the commitment establishes  the gradual reduction of GHG emissions for interna- tional flights by airlines from the signatory countries  until carbon neutral growth is achieved in 2035. In 2017, an ICAO working group developed the Stan- dards and Recommended Practices (SARP), deliv- ered to the governments of the signatories of the  agreement in December. The document will provide  the basis for defining means of Measuring, Report- ing and Verifying (MRV) emissions. Based on the parameters established, the airline op- erators will define emissions monitoring plans, that  should be approved by the regulatory authorities in  each country. Publication of the reports will start in  2019, and these will be considered in the reduction/ offsetting targets to be applied when the countries  join the agreement. The agreement will be implemented in stages, with  a voluntary phase scheduled to last until 2026, af- ter which a mandatory stage will be in place from  2027 to 2035. SECTOR COMMITMENT In the course of the year, LATAM Airlines Colombia acquired  carbon credits from reclamation projects managed by the  environmental consultancy South Pole. The initiatives in- clude two REDD projects – the first enabling the protection  of 13,500 hectares and more than 40 species threatened with  extinction in the Darien region, while the second is aimed at  forestry reclamation and the preservation of 16 indigenous  territories in the Mataven jungle. There is also an action in- volving the reclamation of the Chinchina river basin. During the  year almost 328,000 metric tons of GHG emissions were fully  offset, equivalent to 92% of the total emissions generated by  domestic, international and ground operations in the country. Since 2012, LATAM operations in Peru, Colombia and Brazil  have been offsetting emissions from ground operations. The  volume offset totals 461,834 t CO2e.   —two Boeing 787-9, a model that uses  approximately 20% less fuel and gener- ates 20% less GHG emissions;   —two Airbus A320Neo, with an estimated  15% reduction in fuel consumption and  50% reduction in noise levels.

So far, however, the  materials with potential for use in aviation present major  limitations that restrict their application on a large scale.  Examples of these are the imbalance between production  volume and demand, high prices and complexity in dis- tribution. For the Group, overcoming these obstacles de- pends on an integrated and a multisector approach involv- ing producers, aircraft engine manufacturers, distributors,  government authorities, airlines and regulatory bodies. Energy Aviation fuel is the component with the largest impact  on LATAMs total energy consumption, but the Groups  pursuit of energy efficiency also involves other activi- ties. From the second half of 2018, the administrative  building and maintenance facilities in Chile will be pow- ered by wind and solar energy. This was made possible  by a recent alteration in the countrys legislation, en- abling LATAM to acquire energy directly from the gen- eration companies on the open market at a price ap- proximately 15% below current costs. IN PRACTICE  LATAMs commitment to the pursuit of alterna- tives to aviation fuel has led to concrete achieve- ments. The most worthy of note being: [302-1] INTERNAL ENERGY  CONSUMPTION (TJ)  2014 2015 2016 2017 Aviation fuel 159,801.37 158,889.43 155,310.60 151,502.79 Gasoline 5.43 10.07 24.48 7.81 Diesel 79.65 351.70 161.33 271.81 Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) 8.57 7.23 6.88 7.10 Natural gas 0.04 1.28 0.01 0.59 Ethanol - 0.26 - 0.09 Electricity 228.36 214.92 165.39 271.12 Total 160,123.42 159,474.89 155,668.69 152,061.31 In spite of the current difficulties, the Group recognizes  the importance of this effort in ensuring the sustainable  development of the airline sector and remains commit- ted to seeking new energy sources. In the diverse coun- tries in which it operates, LATAM plays an active role in  discussion forums on this issue, promoting debate and  development. This participation is particularly intense  in Brazil. The Group believes that the country is well  positioned to drive  biofuel development: it has broad  experience and technology in alcohol production for the  automotive industry, in addition to large areas of avail- able arable land. In 2017, LATAM took part in the debates promoted by  the Brazilian government prior to the introduction of its  national biofuels policy (RenovaBio). This initiative is  aimed at promoting the employment of different mate- rials, including biokerosene, based on the establishment  of targets and tax incentives. In 2010, the Group pioneered a  test-flight with biofuel in Brazil. This  was done before the creation of the  standard by the American Society  for Testing and Materials (ASTM),  currently responsible for certifying  production of this type of material. In 2012 and 2013, it was the first  airline to use biofuels in commercial  flights in Chile and in Colombia. The  two flights were on the routes Santia- go – Concepcion and Bogota – Cali. The Group invests in generat- ing knowledge about the efficiency  of biofuels by means of studies  and research. LATAM tracks technological ad- vances in the production and use of  biofuels closely.

On the other, the  development of the so-called 4.0 industry,  which exploits the potential of technological  innovation to drive efficiency and productiv- ity. Together, these factors are transforming  the work place in the most diverse industries. At LATAM and its affiliates, the challenges and  opportunities are even greater when the size  and diversity of the workforce is taken into ac- count – 43,095 employees of 64 nationalities  in the 23 countries in which the Group oper- ates – and the effort involved in consolidating  a single culture and standardizing processes.  [102-8] Management approach In 2017, LATAM and its affiliates empha- sized two major activity fronts: Advances in 2017 COMPLETE VISION Up until 2016, each coun- try in South America in which  LATAM and its affiliates operate had  an operational control center. With  the simplification, only two centers  were maintained, in Brazil and in Chile  which provide services to the rest of the  Group. Thanks to an automated system,  it's possible to have complete vision of  the operation. For example, when there  are flight delays in one country, the  control center team is able to rapidly  dispatch a LATAM reserve aircraft lo- cated in another country, managing the  contingency and avoiding disruptions  for passengers. EFFICIENCY AND SIMPLICITY In senior management, the decision making  process was reviewed, resulting in the forma- tion of four major areas, directly related to  business strategy and now responsible for  activities in all the countries, and the support  areas, which also span across borders.  The reorganization eliminated the duplication of  work and responsibilities. As a result, the organi- zational structure is lighter and more horizontal. The staff turnover rate in the year was 15.5%,  similar to the 2016 and 2015 rates, which were  14.8% and 15.5% respectively. [401-1] [+] AttAChment ATTRACTIVENESS As a result of LATAM Group transforma- tion, in 2017 internal staff appointments  grew significantly, driven by the employee  performance review process. The number  of movements and career progressions  totaled 5,800, representing 13% of the  workforce. Posts were filled internally  at all levels: leadership positions (30%),  middle management positions (28%) and  other functions (12%). Another measure to drive Group attrac- tiveness was the inclusion of non-mone- tary benefits subject to local laws in the  package provided for employees: Efficiency and simplicity: syner- gies that enable the optimization  of work, rapid decision making  and execution, gains in productiv- ity and competitiveness. Attractiveness: attracting and  retaining talent, including internal  promotion, recognition practices,  support for development and  greater balance between personal  and professional life.  Short Friday : the possibility  of leaving work at 1 p.m. on  Fridays throughout the year. The  hours are compensated between  Monday and Thursday;  Home Office: permitted once  a week, conditional upon the  agreement of the employees  immediate manager;  Jeans Day: permitted every  day of the week, enabling  greater convenience and com- fort for employees; and  Discounts of between 50% and  70% on airfares confirmed in  advance, as well as free tickets  when there are seats available  on flights. \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION 60 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY  Proximity and  engagement A LATAM AND  ITS AFFILIATES  PROMOTE CLOSE,  TRANSPARENT  RELATIONS  BETWEEN LEADERS  AND THEIR TEAMS. ttracting and retaining talent, professional develop- ment and ensuring employee health and safety are  management priorities for LATAM and its affiliates.  In 2017, the Group continued to deploy tools to drive  proximity and dialogue between leaders and their  teams. On a weekly basis, leaders meet with their teams to  keep them up to date with the main news in the pe- riod, including financial and operating results, in addi- tion to clarifying any doubts. The Group also published  a good practice guide to provide all leaders with ori- entation on managing and interacting with their teams,  with the objective of further consolidating the LATAM  culture and driving alignment. Every four months, employees evaluate their immediate  managers by means of the Barometer survey. The result- ing perceptions are discussed collectively and shape ac- tion plans. This streamlined process has a positive effect  on organizational climate and employee engagement. LATAM and its affiliates use Organizational Health Index  (OHI) methodology, which measures levels of alignment  with business strategy, renovation capacity and perfor- mance quality. In 2017, the consolidated result was one  point below the score for the two previous years, but the  Group remained stable in comparison with other compa- nies using the methodology. The OHI results are organized  in three quartiles. LATAM and its affiliates are in the third  quartile, where the best-performing companies are con- centrated. In 2017, the index was based on consultation  of a universe of more than 800 companies and 2 million  employees. 61 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION  DEVELOPING THE TEAM [404-1] In 2017, LATAM and its affiliates  invested more than US$26.5 mil- lion in professional training. The  total number of hours training was  1.74 million. This represents an av- erage of 39.8 hours per employee,  an increase of 10% over 2016.   [+] AttAChment FUTURE LEADERS In 2017, 89% of the Groups criti- cal positions had potential succes- sors mapped, close to the target  of 90%. From this total, 47% were  already apt to assume their new  function, while 53% were still under  development. People are determinant for the success of any orga- nization, particularly those in the service sector, such  as LATAM.

Stronger communication in LATAM offices Following a trend adopted by different organizations in  various parts of the world, the LATAM Group's offices  are also undergoing a transformation. The objective is  to provide an environment that stimulates interaction  and create sinergies between employees. The space  reorganization plan allows for more meeting rooms and  collaborative environments, in addition to eliminating  fixed work posts. Employees are aware that at the end  of each work shift they should put their work and per- sonal belongings away in the lockers provided, ensuring  that the space they used on that day is tidy and orga- nized, ready for its next occupant. The office at LATAM  Airlines Brazil has already been adapted. The changes  are underway in Chile, and future modifications will be  planned for the other countries. NEW HR PLATFORM Another novelty in 2017 was the  launch of the HR Connect online  platform, that enables all employ- ees at any location to rapidly and  easily access a series of human re- sources information, such as data  on remuneration, leave, health plan  and holidays. From January to  December 2017,  there were 53,000  posts on the  platform. LATAM RECOGNITION PLATFORM The Group focuses efforts on driving em- ployee  recognition,  understanding  that  this  is also an effective way of disseminating the  LATAM Airlines Group and its affiliates culture. In 2016, the Recognition Platform was created.  This is open to any employee wishing to recog- nize a colleagues conduct in caring for people,  safety and efficiency. Today, in addition to recog- nition between employees in the same area and  between managers and subordinates, a growing  number of people access the online platform to  recognize the conduct of professionals working in  other LATAM areas. From launch in  May 2016, 11,163  employees were  recognized two times  or more. 63 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  PREVENTIVE APPROACH In 2017, LATAM and its affiliates extended monitoring of the  action plan index (API), which entails an innovative, proactive  approach to risk management, to all its units. From the universe  of potential risks identified, the monitoring indicates how many  are being managed based on mitigation plans. Calculation of the  index also takes into account the level of seriousness of the risks  mitigated. For example: putting into practice a plan to manage a  risk with a high potential for damage has a greater weight in the  final index than managing a risk with a low damage potential.

All work-related accidentes  that cause at least one day lost are included. 2  Days lost/average number of employees X 100. Includes days lost by work- related injuries, diseases and fatalities. PERFORMANCE There was an improvement in all  the general safety indicators, but  the result is still below target. The  lost days rate was 15.5 in 2017,  54% lower than in 2016 and 33%  lower than the 2015 rate. The in- jury rate (1.03) was higher than the  target established for the period  and some accidents occurred. All  the maintenance teams receive  alerts related to incidents and  training refreshers in the use of the  correct procedures. IMPROVEMENT TARGETS Similar to operational security,  occupational health is guided  by a continuous improvement  system that sets increasingly  ambitious targets based on  historical performance. For  2018, LATAM and its affiliates  enhanced their methodology for  establishing injury rate perfor- mance targets. There was an  increase in the weight attributed  to critical risk related incidents  with the potential to cause  permanent injuries or fatalities;  high impact incidents (accidents  resulting in more than 100 days  lost); and fatalities of company  employees or third-parties. COMMITMENT AND ATTITUDE   —  Go & See: leaders participate in specific  meetings on safety and environmental  performance in the subsidiaries, dem- onstrating that everyone must show  commitment.   —  Adaptation of the online system to mo- bile format, enabling any employee to  make a post about a safety incident or  deviation (further information on PAge 66).   —  Engagement of employees from differ- ent areas to assist the Health and Safety  team in the identification of new risks  for inclusion in the API on field visits. The injury rate dropped  48.5% between 2013  and 2017; for 2018 the  Group projects a further  18% decrease. STRAIGHT TO THE POINT Context and positioning Employee safety is a priority for  LATAM and its affiliates, which  translates into ongoing efforts  to identify, mitigate and prevent  risks in the work place and in  activities, in an approach that  goes beyond mere legal compli- ance. The critical risks mapped  by LATAM are:   — Exposure to noise   — Work at height   — Handling aircraft engines   —  Operation of mobile   equipment   —  Handling hydraulic   systems   — Work in confined space  Safety is everyones responsibility;  Respect for everyone in safety  procedures;  The use of personal protective  equipment (PPE) is mandatory.  Everyone should immediately re- port unsafe conditions or actions; Management approach In occupational health and safety,  LATAM and its afiliates prioritize:   —  Improving performance in key indicators such  as injury, days lost, critical risk, high impact  incident and fatality indicators. The Group  also employs an Action Plan Index (API) to  monitor execution.   —  Full commitment to safety (employees   and leaders). GOLDEN RULES For each one of the six critical risks  mapped by LATAM and its affiliates,  there is a corresponding Golden  Rule, which systematizes the be- havior to be adopted by employees  when executing this activity. The  Golden Rules are complemented by  another four principles applicable to  the entire Group, which establish: Occupational health and safety 64 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  Safety  ety Saf 65 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  Context and positioning Management approach MANAGING RISKS   —  Expert scrutiny: In 2017, a  program to proactively identify  potential risks during flights was  initiated. This involves tempo- rarily transferring experienced  pilots from their regular duties  to act as observers on flights.  Their recommendations gener- ate improvement plans for  training and operating routines.  The first round of the program  was focused on the ability of  crews to actively monitor the  flight. In all, 200 observations  were undertaken.   —  Attention all: Another new  feature during the year was the  updating of the online platform  open to all employees enabling  them to report safety incidents  and deviations. In 2017, there  were more than 17,400 reports.  At the end of the year a version  for tablets and smartphones  was released, facilitating and  streamlining the process. With  the mobile version, the em- ployee can prepare the report  offline. It is then stored and  sent as soon as the device is  connected to the internet. Operational safety STRAIGHT TO THE POINT Safety is a non-negotiable value for LATAM  Airlines Group and its affiliates and managing it  effectively is essential for business continuity.  The Group is compliant with the most rigorous  international norms and aligned with standards of  excellence in this area. After concluding the integration of safety risk  management in 2016, the Group continues to en- hance its practices and systems in a standardized  manner. The major focus is on safety and security,  where the processes are aimed at preventing ac- cidents and protecting clients and employees. INTEGRATED SYSTEM Since 2016, LATAM has  been using a system  that monitors on average  95% of the flight infor- mation from all different  flight phases. As soon  as the aircraft lands, the  data  - around 1,200  parameters are gener- ated per second  - are  processed automatically  and analyzed by special- ists. This system permits  prior identification of  technical problems,  standard operating pro- cedures deviations and  maintenance needs. LATAM PERFORMANCE  70%  fewer deviations/ incidents in ground  operations than the  airline industry average,  according to International  Air Transport Association  (IATA) data. The Safety, Quality and Environment Policy makes  LATAM and its affiliates commitment to the highest  standards of management and performance explicit. 4 PILLARS   —  The definition of policies and respon- sibilities, which establish the roles  of each person, in particular, those in  leadership functions.    —  Risk management to identify, analyze and  mitigate operational risks by means of  proactive, reactive and predictive tools.   — Monitoring safety standards and indicators.   —  Promoting a safety culture (read more on  page 67). Advances in 2017 CONSTANT IMPROVEMENT LATAM and its affiliates also have a moni- toring panel, which includes data on flight  safety (such as risk of terrain collision,  unstable approach and loss of control),  security, workers and ground operations. Operational safety employs a continuous  improvement process based on targets  and alert settings. The target level of safe- ty (TLS) is established in accordance with  the average of the best 12 monthly perfor- mances over the previous 24 months, and  the alert settings are based on standard  deviations, aimed at quantifying the unac- ceptable performance threshold during a  specified monitoring period. When an alert is triggered, appropri- ate follow-up action is taken, such as  further analysis to determine the source  and root cause of the abnormal event  rate and any necessary actions to ad- dress the unacceptable trend.   ON THE GROUND Ground activities are critical both in terms  of equipment and structures and work.  During fueling and the loading/unloading  of baggage and cargo, for example, an  average of 12 vehicles work in confined  spaces close to the aircraft. This question  merited the creation of a new discussion  and improvement forum in 2017, in which  serious incidents or ones with high dam- age potential are analyzed. 66 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  ATAM Airlines Group and its affiliates initiated a new cy- cle focused on strengthening the organizations safety  culture in 2017. The measures comprise the Safety 2.0  program, which incorporates communication, engage- ment and training strategies aimed above all at ensuring  all areas are committed to monitoring specific indica- tors and achieving the organizations goals and targets  in this area. In the operational sectors, for example, the  indicators monitor the level of excellence in managing  incidents, while in the Human Resources area targets  are related to reducing occupational injuries. With this  change, LATAM is evolving to a model in which all lead- ers share responsibility for disseminating and consoli- dating the safety culture. Safety 2.0 also included the enhancement of the au- dit system with the mapping of critical processes, which  serves as a basis for more in-depth and effective analyses. Safety culture L In 2017, LATAM and  its affiliates worked  on reinforcing its  safety culture,  emphasizing leaders  responsibility for  disseminating this  commitment among  the entire workforce. Rigorous monitoring  LATAM monitors two groups of indicators, with on-target  performance for both. The safety performance index FLT aims to measure flight  safety indicators in an integrated manner, incorporating  weights for each event as well as different accelerators  based on operational risk. The safety performance index MNT measures flight  and ground consequences caused by maintenance is- sues, such as engine failure (the weight of which is  doubled due to its seriousness), air turnback, diversion  and rejected landing. Safety is a watchword for LATAM and covers care  for our employees, passengers and the community  as a whole. We are aware that safety demands  monitoring and a commitment to continuous  improvement in preventive practices. The Safety  2.0 movement reflects this positioning and is aimed  at ensuring that our safety standards evolve in line  with our business growth strategy.

Overseen by the Emergency  Committee, it is underpinned by four major principles:   —providing care for passengers and family members,  including psychological support;    —supporting the authorities in investigation processes;    —communicating pertinent information to the press;    —ensuring the maintenance of LATAMs activities.  When activated, the plan mobilizes 3,985 employees in  11 local committees – there is a committee in each of  the Groups subsidiaries: Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Peru,  Colombia, Ecuador, United States, Paraguay, Spain,  Mexico and LATAM Cargo Brasil. Since 2016, the Group has organized Emergency Weeks  in its 11 subsidiaries, with the purpose of raising aware- ness among leaders and employees. These events in- volve training, drills and simulations. In 2017, almost  1,300 people in the teams directly involved in the  emergency plans underwent training. Including the air- port teams, 7,600 staff members were trained. Currently LATAM is focused on developing its online  training system. Other work focuses include improve- ments to the programming of the Emergency Weeks  and the development of a future incentives policy for  volunteer participants. SHARING EXPERIENCE LATAM greatly values dialogue, sharing experiences and learning  with other airline companies within the applicable legal framework.  This is why it participates in specific working groups and forums  such as those organized by the International Air Transport Associa- tion (IATA) and the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport As- sociation (ALTA). In 2017, in conjunction with other Latin American airlines, LATAM  organized a working group to discuss international security, in- cluding terrorist attacks and other threats while boarding passen- gers and during flights. To enrich the debate, representatives from  a North American and a European airline were invited.  4.5 minutes  The time it takes  LATAM's emergency  response plan to  mobilize participants.   Snapshot   Other management fronts Safety management also encompasses the occupational  and infrastructure areas. The former is related to em- ployees (see PAge 64) while the latter is aimed at stop- ping illicit actions that could impact security. To prevent  security breaches, the Group has a series of procedures  such as controlling the entry and exit of employees and  visitors to LATAM and its affiliates premises and safe- guarding aircraft remaining on the tarmac and in hangars  overnight, as well as cargo shipments. At the airports,  LATAM and its affiliates are compliant with applicable  legislation related to boarding passengers without the  proper documentation (out-of-date or counterfeit) or  inadmissible passengers, (barred at the destination). In  2017, more rigorous security rules were announced for  all international flights arriving in the United States, and  LATAM adapted its procedures accordingly.

The connections generated by the airline  industry drive and can modify the profile of  economic activity in different regions. Ac- cording to an estimate by Oxford Economics1,  the airline sector corresponds on average to  3.5% of the wealth generated per year. In  Brazil alone, the economic impact generated  by air travel is approximately R$312 billion  a year, equivalent to 3.1% of all the wealth  produced in the country. Context and positioning LATAM works on ensuring that a growing number of  people have the opportunity to fly and invests in  new operating models to adapt to the evolution of  the consumer profile. By means of a broad network  of destinations and strategic hubs, the Group helps  to drive mobility in Latin America, promoting tourism  throughout the region and economic activity in the six  countries in which it operates.  In addition to its indirect economic impacts, the  Group actively promotes sustainable tourism and  preservation of the environment and the historical  and cultural heritage of the region, as well as provid- ing logistics support for social actions and humani- tarian aid.  Strategic vision: LATAM is reviewing its corporate  citizenship directives to ensure strategic align- ment with the countries in which it operates and  to drive even greater relevance and effectiveness  in its social investments. The elements consid- ered in this review include: diagnosis of exist- ing programs; mapping of positive and negative  operational impacts; and benchmarking. Sustainable tourism: eight cities benefited by the  Cuido mi Destino  program (see PAge 71). Social logistics: through humanitarian aid initia- tives, transportation of recyclable materials to  ensure protection of fragile habitats and the  donation of air tickets to charities and non- governmental organizations, LATAM places the  businesss connectivity at the service of society,  benefiting thousands of people (see PAge 73).

The projects involve the training of residents, the re- pair or reconstruction of tourist spots, the restora- tion of green areas and foment for typical regional  activities. These initiatives are aimed at reviving the  regions potential for tourism and promoting local  commerce and services. In 2017, LATAM invested US$227,294 in the program  and benefited eight locations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile,  Colombia and Peru. Total investment since 2009 has  exceeded US$2 million. Sustainable  tourism S [203-1 and 203-2] REVITALIZING A BELVEDERE  In 2017, LATAM Airlines Argentina inaugurated a  new route between Santiago and Neuqun, in Ar- gentinean Patagonia, and this destination was in- cluded in the program. The iniciative involved 25  students from the city and from San Pedro de Co- lalao, in the province of Tucumn, who had already  participated in a previous edition of the program. They worked on revitalizing a belvedere – Mirador  Del Este –, with the development of recreation ar- eas, the provision of new benches for visitors, new  trash cans and even a solar energy-powered station  for recharging cellular telephones and other electron- ic devices. In addition to the students, the program  involved six LATAM volunteers, five teachers from  two schools and a total of ten representatives from  the Neuqun tourist board, a partnering university  and a civil society association. more than   US$2 million invested in Cuido  mi Destino from  2009 to 2017. Environmental awareness  The project was implemented in Raposa, in the state  of Maranhao, and reinforced the tourism potential of  the municipality, as well as promoting community  environmental awareness. There were workshops for  students and events open to the local population.  These included the planting of tree seedlings, garbage  collection, the painting of 220 meters of walls in pub- lic areas, the manufacture of garbage containers made  from recycled materials and signs for tourist and cul- tural attractions in Raposa. The actions involved 230 students and 15 teachers  from public schools in the municipality, eight vol- unteer employees and nine community members,  who were responsible for the workshops. An aver- age of 150 people participated in each of the four  open events. 71 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  ISOLATED ENVIRONMENT  In Colombia, work continued on the project focused  on conservation and environmental care on the island  of San Andrs, an important tourist destination in the  country. Around 90 students and 75 LATAM employee  volunteers participate in the project. In 2017, the par- ticipants were organized in groups to clear garbage  from a two-kilometer stretch of beach and to paint  eight murals that decorate the coastal area. Launching careers At the end of 2017, LATAM Airlines Peru launched its new  program to foment sustainable tourism in the country.  This is the Cocineros que Vuelan (Flying Cooks, in the  English translation) program, to be undertaken in part- nership with the Fundacin Pachactec, different public  authorities and with support from renowned chefs, who  will act as sponsors of the participants. In the program, LATAM will provide full study scholarships for  youngsters who want to study gastronomy. The two and a  half year course comprises theoretical and practical compo- nents, with the scholarship covering expenses with meals,  accommodation and transportation. All the foundation stu- dents may also compete for an internship program in inter- national benchmark restaurants, that includes return tickets  and a living allowance.  The program will capture talents from 12 locations in  which LATAM operates. The idea is precisely to help these  future chefs to disseminate Peruvian gastronomic culture  and to drive the economic development of their com- munities. The Group will also invest in promoting health- care and tourism in the participating cities and regions,  with measures that should benefit approximately 38,000  people by 2021. While the course is underway, five and  six-year old children studying in the schools participat- ing in the program will receive medical accompaniment  focused on eradicating anemia and malnutrition within  the communities. Teachers and parents will also benefit  from seminars addressing questions such as sustainable,  healthy eating habits and promoting local tourism. SUSTAINABLE TOURISM  INITIATIVES SUPPORTED BY  LATAM STRENGTHEN LOCAL  ECONOMIES. Long-term vision  In Chile, the programs focus continues to be the Huilo  Huilo nature reserve, in the province of Valdivia. The ob- jective here is to consolidate tourism as a tool to drive  social development for the community and to conserve  native flora and fauna, in particular measures to prevent  the extinction of the symbolic Chilean mammal the hue- mul, in Spanish, also known as the South Andean deer.  Undertaken in partnership with the Fundacin Huilo  Huilo, the project has been in place for three years. In  2017, it included training in entrepreneurship and digital  inclusion for artisans and tourist guides, talks with stu- dents and residents about environmental awareness,  institutional support for the launch of the Fundacin  Huilo Huilos book El Huemul, and the construction of  three houses which constituted the Artisans Settle- ment, in Kmun Park. 72 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  ATAM also takes advantage of its structure and network as  as a group to develop another sphere of corporate social  responsibility. This involves enabling the transportation  of people, animals and cargos either free of charge or at  subsidized prices in emergencies or cases of vulnerability  in order to generate social and environmental value. This  action front ranges from the donation of air tickets – via  partnering institutions – to people needing medical treat- ment, the transportation of organs and tissue to be used  in transplants, the transportation of recyclable materials  collected in fragile and isolated habitats, animal rescue  and support for humanitarian aid. An example is the Avin Solidario (Humanitarian Airplane),  which went into action in three emergency situations in  2017 based on requests from embassies and humanitar- ian aid organizations. LATAM was active in combating the  fires that affected Southern Chile in January. The Group  also provided support in Peru, where more than 133,000  people were made homeless by the floods caused by the  El Nio phenomenon in March. LATAM Peru organized 27  charter flights to transport 174 metric tons of donations  and 2,300 people, including victims made homeless and  volunteers. In partnership with the Another Joy Founda- tion, the program helped victims of hurricane Maria, which  hit Puerto Rico in September. The hurricane was one of the meteorological phenomena  that affected different countries in Central America, the Ca- ribbean and North America in the second half of the year.  This was the first time LATAM released a cargo aircraft ex- clusively to deal with an emergency – normally the Group  provides space in its aircraft for the transportation of di- verse items (food, medication, personal hygiene products  and others), as well as volunteers. Since Puerto Rico is not  part of the LATAM destination network, it was necessary to  form a task force to speedily organize the flight to the coun- trys capital, San Juan, in order to get permission from the  authorities responsible for controlling air space, among other  things. In all, six LATAM teams were mobilized to ensure the  transportation of 44 metric tons of emergency supplies. Social   logistics L Humanitarian aid FOR 2018, THE GROUP IS  PREPARING A NEW ACTION  PROTOCOL FOR NATURAL  CATASTROPHES AND OTHER  EMERGENCIES. [203-1 and 203-2] In support of a campaign led by the Brazilian airport  authority Infraero (Empresa Brasileira de Infraestrutura  Aeroporturia), LATAM Airlines Brazil also transported  212.6 metric tons of goods for communities impacted  by floods in diverse regions of the country. Through  these actions, a total of 438 metric tons of humanitar- ian cargos were transported during the year. 73 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  Transportation of   recyclable materials In partnership with the local government on Easter  Island in the Pacific Ocean, a flight of approximately  six hours from the Chilean capital, Santiago, LATAM  transported 171 metric tons of recyclable materials,  such as cardboard, aluminum, plastic and electronics,  in 2017. The partnership has been in place for four  years, and the income generated by the commercial- ization of the materials is invested in environmental  preservation projects on the island. LATAM is the only  airline that operates on Easter Island. A similar agreement was made with the government  of the island of San Andrs in Colombia, declared  a Biosphere Reserve (Seaflower) by the United Na- tions Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organiza- tion (UNESCO). To date, LATAM has transported 13  metric tons of used tires to the countrys capital,  Bogot, where a supplier reprocesses the material  for use as a source of energy in other processes.  By avoiding the accumulation of this type of mate- rial, the initiative contributes towards preserving the  ecosystem and improving sanitary conditions on the  archipelago, as well as decreasing the incidence of  disease-carrying mosquitoes. Transportation of animals LATAM transported 129 animals under threat, including wild  birds, penguins and monk seals. The service provides sup- port for animal rescue efforts undertaken by environmental  organizations in diverse countries and enables the return of  these animals to their natural habitats. In Brazil alone, 102  animals were transported, including toucans and macaws. Transporting organs and tissue In December 2017, the term of commitment between  LATAM and the Brazilian Ministry of Health for the  transportation of organs and tissue used in transplants  was renewed. Since the partnership began in 2013,  some 6,700 organs have been transported. 74 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  DONATIONS POLICY Approved at the end of 2016, the LATAM Donations Policy was implemented in  2017 with the objective of organizing the Group's cash donations, provision of  services for charities and humanitarian aid. The document sets forth the criteria,  the validation stages and the levels of authority required for the concession of  courtesy tickets, the free transportation of cargo and cash donations to non- governmental organizations, foundations and other civil society entities. The  policy, overseen by the Legal and Compliance areas, enables the Group to en- sure conformance. Beneficiaries are submitted to a prior assessment, which en- compasses legal compliance, and all contracts include an anti-corruption clause. Non-financial contributions are defined locally by the Corporate Affairs area.  Cash donations require the joint approval of different executives.

Co- lombia invested in the donation of 1,200 new uni- forms for children and youths supported by the Fun- dacin Vida y Esperanza. In Argentina, 50 boxes of  clothes and non-perishable foods were collected and  distributed to families affected by heavy rains in the  city Comodoro Rivadavia, in the province of Chubut.  In Brazil, the traditional Winter Clothing Campaign  raised 750 kg of clothes, blankets and other articles. LATAM Airlines Ecuador also donated 7,000 energy  bars to a food bank in the city of Guayaquil. These  items had been offered during flights to the island of  Baltra, in the Galapagos, before the implementation  of the LATAM Market. A campaign was initiated to encourage employees to  donate their old uniforms. In Brazil, the clothes were  collected by the NGO Amigos do Bem, which takes  them apart and distributes the material in underprivi- leged communities. A total of 9,400 employees par- ticipated in the initiative. In Chile, 2.5 metric tons of old uniforms were sold to  a clothes recycling company. The proceeds were do- nated to the Fundacin DeBuenaFe, which promotes  entrepreneurship among underprivileged women. In Peru, the old uniforms of 1,200 employees were sent  to the Asociacin de Artesanas de Pachacamac, a re- gion close to the countrys capital, Lima. The women in  the association transformed the donated clothes into  new products, which were then sold by the association. The dream of flying  LATAM Airlines Peru made the dream of flying come true  for 150 underprivileged children during 2017. The project  was supported by 106 employee volunteers. In Argenti- na, 133 children from public schools in the Buenos Aires,  Cordoba and Iguazu regions benefited from the program. In Chile, every week 19 volunteers receive students  from schools in diverse regions of the country. The  students get free flights to visit the LATAM operation- al base in Santiago. This is the heart of the Groups  operations, staffed by more than 2,500 people. In Ecuador, the project organized a special initiative on  International Girls Day on October 11. A mother, her  daughter and a niece had the opportunity to fly for the  first time ever.

Report and  materiality L ATAM is publishing the 2017 edition of its Sustainability  Report, which presents the main advances and challeng- es in managing for sustainability during the year. The  information covers all the companies of the LATAM Air- lines Group for the period from January 1st to December  31st. The report was submitted to external assurance  (see PAge 85). The principles adopted in the preparation  of the document – context, balance – completeness,  materiality and stakeholder inclusiveness – were es- tablished in accordance with the GRI (Global Reporting  Initiative) guidelines, the main sustainability communi- cation benchmark in the world. As a basis for selecting the topics to be addressed  in the publication, the Group conducted a materiality  definition process which involved diverse consulta- tions with its stakeholder groups and an analysis of  the organizations principal significant economic, envi- ronmental and social impacts. [102-40, 102-42, 102-43, 102-46, 102-50 and 102-56] The commitment to managing sustainability and to  maintaining open dialogue was reaffirmed in 2017,  when LATAM reviewed the list of most relevant  topics for the business and stakeholders. The work  shaped the preparation of this edition of the report. 77 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017  SUMMARY \\Presentation   \\Who we are   \\Sustainability   \\Our business   \\Suppliers   \\Customers \\Environment   \\Employees   \\Safety   \\Society   \\About the report   \\Attachments   \\Credits  ECONOMIC   DIMENSION SOCIAL   DIMENSION ENVIRONMENTAL  DIMENSION Defining priorities After the consultations and analysis of the data, the  topics were prioritized based on a comparison of the  level of relevance (stakeholders view) and the level of  impact (view of LATAM senior management and mate- rial topics identified by the SASB). The matrix, compris- ing ten topics, was validated by the LATAM CEO. As a result, the 2017 Sustainability Report covers the  way in which LATAM works to manage each material  topic, as well as the performance it achieved in 2017,  measured by GRI and SASB indicators and other moni- toring systems used by the Group. It should be noted that while the new list of relevant  topics does not include eco-efficient management; re- ductions in noise and other emissions; and value chain,  which were on the previous list, the Group retains its  focus on these issues. They are incorporated into the  approach adopted for other relevant aspects. For ex- ample, the topic mitigation of climate change includes  the efficient use of fuels, and the topics financial sus- tainability, destination network and sustainable tour- ism also take into account aspects related to the value  chain.

Standards and Assurance Process We have carried out our task according the guidelines of  the International Standard on Assurance Engagements  Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial In- formation (ISAE 3000) issued by the International Au- diting and Assurance Standard Board (IAASB) of the In- ternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC). Our review has consisted in an enquiring process to dif- ferent units and management areas of LATAM, which  have been involved in the developing process of the  report, as well as in the application of analytic proce- dures and checking tests, which are described in the  following items:   —Meeting with Ms. Alejandra Cueto, Sustainability An- alyst.   —Analysis of the adaptation of the 2017 Sustainability  Reports contents to the GRI Standards: Core option,  and the review of the indicators included in the re- port in order to verify that they are aligned with the  established protocols in the standard. We also check  whether the character of not applicable or not mate- rial indicators is justified.   —Verification, through checking tests of quantita- tive and qualitative information according to the GRI  Standards indicators included in the 2017 report, and  its adequate gathering from the data provided by LA- TAM information sources. Conclusions   — The assurance process was based in the indicators es- tablished in the materiality process carried out by LATAM.  Once those indicators were identified, prioritized and val- idated they were included in the report. The reported and  verified indicators appear in the following table: 102-1 102-2 102-3 102-4 102-5 102-6 102-7 102-8 102-9 102-10 102-11 102-12 102-13 102-14 102-16 102-17 102-18 102-40 102-41 102-42 102-43 102-44 102-45 102-46 102-47 102-48 102-49 102-50 102-51 102-52 102-53 102-54 102-55 102-56 103-1 201-1 201-2 203-1 203-2 205-2 205-3 206-1 302-1 302-4 305-1 305-2 305-3 305-4 305-5 305-6 305-7 306-2 307-1 308-2 401-1 403-2 404-1 414-2 415-1 417-3 419-1   —Regarding the verified indicators, we can say that has  not revealed any attention that causes us to believe  that the Sustainability Report 2017 LATAM has not  been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards  in those areas identified in the scope.
