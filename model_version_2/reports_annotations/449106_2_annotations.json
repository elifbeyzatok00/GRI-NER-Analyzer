Our history in Asia spans more  than a century and throughout  that time we have earned a  reputation as a trusted partner in  all of our communities.  2020 was a difficult and in some  ways unprecedented year. The  outbreak of COVID-19 touched  so many of us and impacted  individuals, communities and  global events. I am especially  proud that despite this difficult  operating environment, our  outstanding teams were able  to demonstrate AIAs Purpose  of helping people live Healthier,  Longer, Better Lives. I am  immensely grateful to all of our  employees, agents, and partners  for their ongoing commitment to  supporting our customers and  communities when they needed  us the most.  Effective corporate governance  helps ensure that AIA remains  resilient during the most  challenging times. The Boards  Independent Non-executive  Directors have extensive  experience in the public and  private sectors; perspectives that  have been invaluable in providing  objective judgement and direction  this year. As a Board, we continue  to meet our commitment to ensure  that our practices are aligned  with global best practice. We are  firm believers that our strong  governance culture, supported  by sound risk management,  is fundamental to ensuring  a sustainable future for our  organisation.  Our commitment to sustainability  and our ability to manage  associated risk have created  tangible value for our business  and for the communities we  serve. Over the years, we  have endeavoured to build  sustainable measures into our  key metrics. This also guides our  approach to our customer and  employee relationships, helping  ensure that we have the right  processes in place to build on  our strong history. This includes  seeking and considering input  from key internal and external  stakeholders on issues related  to climate change, public health,  data privacy, cybersecurity, and  ethical business practices. For us,  managing these risks effectively  is instrumental to the sustainable  growth of our business and, in  turn, our Group.  As we embark on a new  decade, I believe the long-term  fundamental drivers of growth  for the life insurance industry  in Asia remain robust. AIA  continues to benefit from the  powerful demographic, social  and economic changes that are  occurring in our markets. Rising  incomes are driving rapid growth  in the middle classes and Asian  consumers are transforming  the regions economies. At the  same time, the provision of  social welfare remains low. The  pandemic has accelerated many  trends, particularly the interest  in Healthier, Longer, Better Lives.  These structural trends are  creating substantial opportunities  for us to help people across the  region meet their long-term  savings and protection needs.  We believe that protecting our  customers while helping them  on their journey to become  healthier is the best service we  can provide, for today and for the  future.  In 2021, we look forward to  continuing to play a leading role  in creating a more sustainable  tomorrow as we help millions  of people live Healthier, Longer,  Better Lives.

Mr. Lee Yuan Siong Group Chief Executive and  President  PAGE 7 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 PAGE 7 2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX A transformational,  long-term   ESG Strategy The COVID-19 pandemic has  transformed the way we all live  and work and brought out the  very best of AIA and our people.  I am extremely proud of our  teams across the organisation  whose efforts helped AIA  demonstrate our resilience  and commitment to our  customers and communities  who were dealing with the  challenges of lockdowns and  mandated quarantines. We  moved quickly to build on our  digital capabilities to provide  customers with uninterrupted  support and service. In addition,  we worked with governments  and our partners to increase  protection to our customers  and provided critical donations  to organisations supporting  frontline healthcare workers.  All of this helped provide peace  of mind to our customers when  they needed us the most.  Helping our customers live  Healthier, Longer, Better Lives  has become our Purpose as an  organisation and it underpins  everything we do. Continuing to  incorporate ESG considerations  within our operations will  remain vital for AIA as we  transform our Purpose into  STATEMENT FROM GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND PRESIDENT reality—with tangible and  measurable outcomes for our  customers and communities.  I am proud to announce  that we have launched a  transformational, long-term  Environmental, Social, and  Governance Strategy (ESG  Strategy) reflective of our  position as a global industry  leader. For more than a  century, AIA has strived to  have a positive impact on our  customers and communities  across Asia. Our ESG  Strategy further embeds that  commitment and identifies five  key areas of focus: Health and  Wellness; Green Operations;  Sustainable Investment; People  and Culture; and Effective  Governance. Health and Wellness  While economic development  in Asia has brought significant  improvements in standards of  living, lifestyle-related diseases  are the main contributor to  premature deaths in the region.  At the same time, expectations  of wellness, health and  maintaining quality of life into  old age are increasingly front  of mind for many Asians. As a  trusted partner, we engage with  our communities and provide  products that are focused on  delivering better outcomes for  our customers, helping them to  stay healthier and live better for  longer.  Green Operations The environment has a direct  impact on the health and  well-being of our customers,  employees and communities.  Therefore, it is vital that we  ensure appropriate measures  are taken to address key  areas of impact within the  environmental footprint of our  own businesses, particularly  in areas such as waste  management and property  development. It is equally  important that our business  partners are expected to adopt  best practices that enable our  communities to thrive for many  generations to come.   Sustainable Investment We use our influence as a  leading life insurance company  in Asia to drive sustainable  investment across the region.  We seek sustainable outcomes  and secure investment income  STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT  PAGE 8 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 PAGE 8 2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX in order to deliver on the long- term savings and protection  needs of our customers. We  also understand the impact  that our investments can have  on peoples lives and believe it  is essential to take ESG factors  into consideration when making  our investment decisions so  that we help drive sustainable  behaviours to create long-term  value. A testament to this can  be seen in our ambition to  divest from the coal mining  and coal-fired power sectors  by 2028, making us the first  major insurance firm in Asia to  make this commitment with no  exceptions. People and Culture Our people span multiple  nationalities, cultures and  communities, which we  believe gives us a competitive  advantage that is integral to  our continued success. We  promote an inclusive and  collaborative culture that  supports the development of  key capabilities. This provides  a platform for meaningful and  rewarding careers with AIA. By  engaging with and empowering  our people, we are confident  they will grow with us in their  professional lives and do their  best when supporting our  customers and communities. Effective Governance Sound and effective governance  and operating to the highest  standards of responsible  business practices underpin  sustainability. It guides AIAs  approach to engaging with  our stakeholders, effectively  managing risk, while supporting  innovation in our businesses  and allows us to continue to  drive economic and social  development across the region.  In 2020, we were pleased that  our practices were recognised  by a number of independent  third parties. This is  demonstrated through our CDP  score, which placed AIA among  CDPs Leadership group  (score of A-) for climate change  performance, the highest  scoring tier for our sector. This  is one of the highest ratings for  climate change performance  for a Hong Kong-headquartered  company. We are also glad  that for two consecutive years,  Sustainalytics has placed  AIA in the first percentile of  companies in the insurance  industry. Despite the trials of the  past year, we have seen  unprecedented collaboration,  including governments,  companies, and non-profits  working together to serve our  communities with courage and  compassion. We have seen  multiple COVID-19 vaccines  approved at unprecedented  speeds and businesses quickly  adopt technologies to maintain  critical access for patients  during the darkest times. At  AIA we are deeply aware of the  social and environmental issues  our communities face, and are  committed to overcoming them  in a sustainable and ethical  fashion.  We look forward to continuing  to be a long-term partner for  all our customers, to helping  ensure they live Healthier,  Longer, Better Lives, and  by doing so, we will make  a positive difference to the  sustainable development of our  communities for decades to  come.

The insurance industry plays  an important role in addressing  the sustainability challenges our  communities face across the  region. Life and health insurance  provides people with peace  of mind knowing that they are  protecting themselves, their  families and their employees  against lifes uncertainties. Our  policies protect millions of people  and businesses of all sizes. Non-communicable diseases  (NCDs) are a leading cause of  death globally. AIA is committed  to wellness programmes that  help our customers address the  significant risk factors associated  with increasing levels of NCDs  in Asia.  In addition, life and health insurance  solutions play a vital role in  supporting the continued growth  and development of the region.  They collect regular premiums  from individuals holding long-term  savings and protection policies.  These premiums are pooled by life  insurance companies and deployed  into large-scale collective capital  investments to match policyholder  benefits. These finance long term  investment in infrastructure and  commercial investment to support  further economic growth.  While rapid urbanisation and  economic development bring  rising wealth, lifestyle changes  have also disrupted the traditional  family networks that people have  historically relied upon for security  and support. These shifts,  including the most recent  challenges posed by COVID-19,  have exacerbated the protection  gap for many in our communities.  Life and health insurance and  savings options help to address  the protection gaps from these  societal shifts, reducing the  burden on families and national  healthcare systems, while  providing people with a range of  options for accessing medical  treatment.

Material ESG issues are  sustainability challenges that  have the potential to affect  our business, stakeholders,  strategy, and reporting. Our  leadership team identify  material issues by taking  account of the feedback from  our stakeholders and the risks  and opportunities posed to our  business.  We Engage with Our  Stakeholders  AIAs Environmental, Social  and Governance Committee  (ESG Committee) oversees  the development of the  ESG Strategy and monitors  performance against ESG  metrics and initiatives at the  Company. The ESG Committee  comprises members of the  Group Executive Committee,  and an Independent Non- executive Director of the Board.  The ESG Committee considers  feedback from the Groups  stakeholders, including  investors, employees,  customers, regulators, and the  Board. The ESG Committee  also considers research both  commissioned internally  and published by academic  institutions.  AIA is proactive in engaging  with our stakeholders on ESG  matters, including investors.  The Company also regularly  responds to consultations  with regulators and industry  associations on ESG topics. We Assess Material ESG  Risks and Opportunities  In consideration of stakeholder  feedback and the risks and  opportunities posed to our  business, the following three  material issues have been  identified by the ESG Committee  as being central to our efforts  to operate sustainably while  supporting our communities.   Other issues that present  both risks and opportunities  to our business more broadly  are outlined on this page and  discussed in sections of this  Report. Given the challenges  posed by COVID-19 to our  communities, this was included  as a material issue for 2020.

This contributes  to our development of new  products and initiatives that  motivate people across Asia to  adopt healthier lifestyle habits.  In 2020, we released a ground- breaking research initiative,  Healthier Together, revealing  eight key ingredients that  enable people to live Healthier,  Longer, Better Lives. The  study was conducted by global  data insights company Kantar  Group and involved in-depth  interviews with more than 80  experts from a broad spectrum  of professional disciplines. In  addition, there was a survey  of 6,000 consumers across  our six markets in the region,  representing a cross-section  of cultures in Asia, including  Australia, Mainland China, Hong  Kong, Malaysia, Thailand and  Singapore.  The findings of the study  delivered a blueprint for How  to live Healthier, Longer,  Better Lives with specific  behaviours people can adopt  to achieve this, beyond the  obvious steps of exercising,  eating healthily and getting  sufficient sleep, particularly  in the context of COVID-19.  Based on extensive insights and  data, we discovered eight core  ingredients, along with tangible  actions that people can take. What you can do: Take time to understand what  motivates you, understand  what is important to you in life,  and understand your limits,  strengths, and weaknesses. What you can do: Feel confident identifying  what is right for you, focus  time and energy on things you  can control, and be capable of  improving your mental health. Understand yourself and  your emotions Take time to understand your  motivations, values, strengths  and weaknesses. Feel a sense of independence Feel confident identifying  what you can control and  what is right for you. The nature of risk has changed. Poor lifestyle choices and a general of lack of  awareness of healthy living practices contribute to high rates of NCDs across Asia3.  AIA will continue to work with our customers and communities to better understand  and raise awareness of the evolving health challenges and concerns faced by people,  providing tailored content, preventative screening and wellness solutions that motivate  people to adopt healthier lifestyles.

The group of survey participants  who felt they are adopting  most of the ingredients of living  Healthier, Longer, Better Lives,  said that COVID-19 had less of a  negative impact on their lives.

When  the outbreak of COVID-19 and  social distancing measures  accelerated the need for holistic  digital health solutions, global  healthcare and technology  companies were able to scale  existing software platforms  and expand their telemedicine  capabilities. Throughout this year, AIA has  deployed telemedicine solutions  and many of our business  units strengthened their  partnerships with providers  to ensure that our customers  had vital access to healthcare.  We used these solutions to  empower our customers with  the right knowledge, tools and  professional support to help  them be more resilient.  From January to December   2020, AIA Singapore saw  a sevenfold increase in  telemedicine consultations  for chronic diseases through  Whitecoat, a mobile application.  AIA Sri Lanka provided free  telemedicine consultations for  all its customers from January  to April 2020 through its oDoc  service. AIA China, through its  strategic partner WeDoctor,  also provided teleconsultations  to help customers manage  chronic illnesses.  AIA continues to enhance  its telemedicine business  by utilising a combination  of artificial intelligence  (AI), biometrics, online risk  assessments and physical  health screenings to ensure a  seamless customer experience.  Our goal is to minimise  unnecessary face-to-face visits  with doctors and steer them to  the most appropriate healthcare  specialist that will be able to  deliver accurate diagnoses.  As at December 2020,  telemedicine consultations  were available to 1.3 million  customers. Please refer to the Supplement:  Supporting our Communities  through COVID-19 for further  details on telemedicine  initiatives in the context of  COVID-19.

Having worked with  Medix in Hong Kong and  Singapore since 2016 and 2018  respectively, we have expanded  our regional partnership to  Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia,  Vietnam, India and Australia.  Our partnership means AIAs  policyholders have access  to a review of their medical  circumstances by specialists  drawn from Medixs team  of 300 in-house physicians  and its global network of  more than 4,000 world- leading, independent medical  specialists.  The holistic medical  assessment ensures people  have access to the tools needed  to make the best decisions  concerning their condition and  their care, including access to  a second opinion if desired.  As well as relieving concerns  about diagnoses, it also helps  ensure they receive the best  possible care wherever they  are in the world. By providing  our policyholders with personal  medical case management,  AIA helps overcome local  healthcare disparities and  makes international expertise  available. This year, in Australia,  Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia,  Vietnam, and Hong Kong, AIA  and Medix offered an additional  COVID-19 rehabilitation case  management service. Eligible  policyholders who experienced  ongoing COVID-19 related  health issues after being  discharged from hospital  were offered support through  recovery and rehabilitation to  help them rebuild their health. AIAs partnership with Medix  enhances our differentiated  proposition in health and  well-being and demonstrates  our pledge to go beyond the  traditional, passive insurance  business model to become  a genuine partner with our  customers by improving  recovery outcomes.

Developing innovative  propositions that offer  cover and mechanisms to  obtain cover for previously  uninsurable diseases and  conditions, new diseases  and conditions, and expand  this coverage to include new  treatments and access to  care.   Increasing existing  insurance cover of our  customers, to address any  shortfall in treatment costs,  through new add-ons or  solutions. Small and Medium  Enterprises AIA is a major provider of  group insurance, supporting  businesses and protecting their  employees across the region.  More than half of the Asian  labour force works for Small  and Medium Enterprises  (SMEs), and as they prosper,  SMEs contribute significantly  to the development of local  economies. In 2020, AIA issued  more than 80,000 SME policies  covering more than 2.3 million  employees in 2020. AIA offered free COVID-19 cover  for SME employees in select  markets, while in others we  enabled digital services such  as teleconsultation services  for doctor appointments. As  a recognition of our close  partnership with SMEs, for the  third consecutive year, AIA  Hong Kong received the Best  SMEs Partner Award from the  Hong Kong General Chamber of  Small and Medium Business, for  providing high-quality, flexible  products and services across  both group insurance and  retirement. Financial Education Financial education is a  fundamental part of the  development of communities  and we host a number of  initiatives across our markets  to educate our communities  on the importance of savings  and insurance. By improving  financial literacy and helping  people make informed financial  planning decisions, we are  empowering people to improve  their own financial well-being  and that of their families and  local community. One of our signature  programmes is run by the  Philam Life Foundation (the  Foundation), the Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR)  arm of our business in the  Philippines. The Foundation  runs programmes to help  Filipinos achieve financial  security, where only about one  third of the adult population had  a bank account in 2019.  What is the  Protection Gap? The protection gap is the  shortfall in resources required  to protect individuals and  families against unforeseen  mortality and morbidity risks.  In Asia, the mortality protection  gap for 2019 was estimated at  US$83 trillion and it is thought  to be increasing by 4 per cent  every year. Research suggests  that more than three-quarters  of households in Asia face a  mortality protection gap of  about eight times the average  annual household income4. Contributing to this gap are the  rising costs and complexity  of healthcare alongside the  growth of lifestyle-related  diseases, particularly diabetes,  hypertension and high  cholesterol. The COVID-19  pandemic has also shown how  vulnerable we are to novel  infectious diseases. The lack of sufficient protection  cover for all these diseases  can have broader social and  economic consequences across  the region, not to mention  their potential impact on lives  and families. AIA serves the  holders of more than 38 million  individual policies and over   16 million members of group  insurance schemes across the  region. As the largest pan-Asian  life and health insurer, we are  in a unique position to address  these challenges.

Philam  SAVES is a volunteer initiative  by our employees and financial  advisors, and is endorsed by  the Philippine Governments  Department of Education. In 2020, we signed an  agreement to extend Philam  SAVES to reach 150,000  grade 4 and 5 students in the  Bangsamoro Autonomous  Region of Muslim Mindanao, in  southern Philippines. With this  agreement we exceeded our  commitment to reach 100,000  savers by 2020. Strategic  partnerships:  empowering  women in   Sri Lanka According to a 2015 AIA  survey, Sri Lankan women  are the primary decision- makers on matters relating  to their familys protection  and future, and are proactive  about managing their health  and financial well-being.  Sri Lankas low insurance  penetration rate of 1.7 per  cent suggests that if insurers  can understand womens  protection priorities and  connect with more women, the  number of Sri Lankan women  and families insured would  increase. This year, AIA Sri Lanka and  the International Finance  Corporation (IFC) signed  an agreement to develop a  targeted womens insurance  programme strategy and  suitable products for  Sri Lankan women. The  partnership will allow AIA  to reach more women and  empower them to protect what  is most important to them. As  well as increasing womens  access to suitable products,  we hope this initiative will  also help bring more women  into the insurance industry as  employees, agents and future  leaders. Microinsurance Offerings More than half the worlds  population do not have any  kind of formal social security  protection5. For people living  in rural and underserved  urban areas, microinsurance  products can provide protection  for those who are unable to  afford traditional insurance  solutions. AIA Philam Life in the  Philippines and Tata AIA Life  in India offer microinsurance  products in their respective  markets, reaching communities  without access to traditional  life and health insurers. By  partnering with microfinance  institutions AIA Cambodia has  expanded protection cover to  more communities across the  country. 5 ILO 2019  PAGE 24 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 HEALTH AND  WELLNESS This section supports SDG Target  1.5 of building resilience of the poor  and those in vulnerable situations  and reduce their exposure and  vulnerability to climate-related  extreme events and other  economic, social and environmental  shocks and disasters.

Health problems associated  with lifestyle factors and  pollution are reflected in  an increase of NCDs, which  account for 71 per cent of  all deaths globally6. 37 per  cent of deaths from these  diseases also occur before  the age of 70 while low and  middle-income countries face  the greatest risk from NCDs,  further compromising poverty  reduction and development  efforts7. Communicable diseases  including HIV, tuberculosis,  malaria and viral hepatitis, put  billions of people around the  world at risk.

AIA has also developed  a wellness programme to  meet the specific needs of our  customers in Mainland China. We monitor and report on  the health impacts of the  AIA Vitality Programme with  verifiable health data. To date  we have captured 8.7 million  health assessments, 4.1 million  body mass index (BMI) readings  and are tracking more than  790,000 workouts submitted via  fitness trackers each day.

Pandemic prevention  measures changed many  peoples established fitness  habits and threatened to  negatively impact physical and  mental well-being. To ensure that AIA Vitality  members maintained their  fitness and wellness habits, even  when they had to stay home  and were socially isolated, AIA  found new ways to engage with  customers, and introduced new  ways for them to earn points and  stay motivated.  During the year, we made  several enhancements to  the AIA Vitality platform to  improve reach and engagement.  Members completed nearly  one million new mental well- being assessments over the  12 months as we increased  our focus on mental resilience  across our markets. We also  entered an exclusive regional  partnership with Holmusk,  a global data science and  healthcare technology company  to develop AI enabled nutrition  coaching services for AIA  Vitalitys nutrition programme.  In March 2020, when Australia  moved into a nationwide  lockdown, many people could  not go to the gym, workout  outdoors or participate in sports  as they usually did. In response,  AIA Vitality increased the  number of points awarded for  daily step goals, leading to a 23  per cent increase in members  using tech devices to track their  activities. AIA Australia and AIA New  Zealand also developed the  AIA Vitality Well-being Toolkit,  an online resource comprising  articles, podcasts and videos,  providing tools, tips and  inspiration on staying mentally  and physically well and active at  home. Members could also earn  points through participation in  online workouts when advised  to stay indoors. In October, AIA Singapore  organised AIA Health &  Wellness Live 2020, awarding  AIA Vitality Points to members  for tuning in. This two-day  event featured both live  and pre-recorded content,  featuring panel discussions on  balancing business productivity  and employee wellness, the  healthcare revolution, and  provided tips from health  and mental wellness experts,  healthy recipe cooking  demonstrations and workouts. Innovating to Address  Health Challenges AIA continues to develop new  products that provide care to  our customers throughout their  lives, to support the prevention,  treatment, and management of  health outcomes. Cancer and Serious Infections  Disease Protection In 2020 we launched AIA One  Absolute – Cancer & Serious  Infectious Disease Protection  (AOACS) in Hong Kong, a first- in-market proposition that pays  claims based on the impact of  the customers condition and  their medical journey.  There are more than 100  types of cancer and myriad  treatment options that depend  on the type and stage of the  cancer and whether it has  metastasised from the original  site. Meanwhile, infectious  diseases continue to evolve,  and existing viruses such as  malaria and dengue have  spread to new areas. Scientists  have discovered at least 40 new  infectious diseases since the  1970s, including SARS, Ebola,  MERS, avian flu, swine flu and  Zika virus, while diseases such  as cholera and tuberculosis,  thought to be in decline, have  rebounded. Rather than linking claims to a  technical or medical diagnosis  or medical bills, AIA has  innovated to address changes  in cancer treatments and  outcomes. As well as providing  life insurance and health  protection based on the severity  of cancer and carcinoma-in-situ  and future medical advances  in treatments, AOACS includes  cover for any known or novel  serious infectious disease  that the WHO declares to be  a Public Health Emergency of  International Concern, which  includes COVID-19. With claims calculated using a  transparent scoring system and  total benefits payable up to 160  per cent of the sum assured in  the most severe cases, AOACS  offers extra protection for  conditions with a high degree  of severity, at an affordable  premium. Well-being Coaching  Programmes  More people are surviving  cancer than ever before, thanks  to early detection and improved  treatments.  Regardless, a cancer diagnosis  can be an overwhelming  and isolating experience.  Recent studies suggest health  outcomes and quality of life  can improve with greater  patient engagement and self- management, but there is a lack  of supporting tools for cancer  patients outside of the clinical  setting.  Research has also  demonstrated that patients  who focus actively on their  well-being, such as logging  PAGE 28 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 HEALTH AND  WELLNESS  PAGE 29 PAGE 29 HEALTH AND WELLNESS Engaging and  Inspiring Healthy  Living Greater Access to  Quality Care Champion  Financial Inclusion Delivering Better  Health Outcomes SUPPLEMENT:  Supporting our  Communities  through COVID-19 2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX their symptoms, exercising, and  undergoing rehabilitation, have  better health outcomes while  undergoing cancer treatments  and in their post-cancer lives.  In 2018, in light of these  findings, AIA partnered  with CancerAid to develop a  pilot programme to support our  customers undergoing cancer  treatment.  The CancerAid Coach Program  is a digital application-based   initiative that includes weekly  educational modules, self- management tools and  techniques, and a personal  coach who provides education,  motivation, accountability, and  well-being support. The six- week coaching programme  empowers members living with  cancer to gain greater control  over their disease and support  them to make a successful  transition to a full and  meaningful life after cancer.  This digital and personalised  approach helps patients to  navigate their care and achieve  improved health outcomes. The results have been positive:  40 per cent of CancerAid  Coach customers progressed  through to AIA comprehensive  occupational rehabilitation  programmes, and 82 per cent  of customers who enrolled in  these programmes returned to  work. In addition, 97.5 percent  of customers reported that  they were satisfied with the  programme.

From the early weeks of the  pandemic, AIA responded  rapidly, staying true to our  Purpose of helping people live  Healthier, Longer, Better Lives.  People working in every part  of our business were proactive  and quick to adapt. We changed  the way we worked to address  the needs of our stakeholders  and respond to unexpected  situations. It was vital that  we acted quickly and stayed  resilient to ensure continuity of  support.

For long-term income  protection claimants, we lifted  the requirement for a monthly  medical certification and placed  these customers on scheduled  payments for three months, to  avoid the need to visit a doctor  in person. For other claims,  staff sought to get information  from claimants by phone or via  telehealth services, to reduce  the need for in-person medical  reviews. Sri Lanka AIA worked with Sri Lankas  Ministry of Health to provide  free life insurance cover  worth LKR 500,000, as well  as a hospital cash benefit  to employees from three  of the main hospitals and  centres dedicated to treating  COVID-19. As part of its own  #ShareTheLove campaign, AIA  Sri Lanka also gave customers  the opportunity to give someone  else a year of life cover worth  LKR 1 million when they bought  a new policy. Expanding Protection Cover Many of our customers faced unexpected health concerns and worries about financial insecurity. AIA  wanted to reassure and support our customers and encourage community resilience by offering additional  insurance cover free of charge in some markets, as one of a number of other initiatives. Mainland China In the early days of the  pandemic, AIA China took a  series of immediate actions  to alleviate the financial  stress suffered by patients.  This included a RMB 200,000  payment to policyholders  in case of disability or as a  compassionate benefit to  families as a result of COVID-19,  during the critical period from  February to June 2020. AIA  China also provided insurance  protection of up to RMB  600,000 for each medical  worker from a total of 43  hospitals, who went to Hubei  province and its capital city of  Wuhan to offer their care and  support. Hong Kong and Macau AIA Hong Kong responded  to the developing pandemic  by providing free enhanced  protection against COVID-19  and claim support measures to  all customers.  Identifying a protection gap  for frontline cleaning workers,  AIA initiated a campaign titled  Unsung Heroes and offered  free protection benefits as a  way to thank these essential  workers who provide an  invaluable service to Hong Kong  and Macau. The AIA Foundation  also donated 10,000 health  protection kits to disadvantaged  families.  As a significant commitment  to our communities, AIA  extended free COVID-19  coverage until 30 September  2020, with HK$/MOP 15,000  diagnosis benefit and HK$/ MOP 150,000 compassionate  benefit, to all Hong Kong and  Macau residents and AIA  customers who registered  for the free cover via the AIA  Connect mobile app. As part of  this campaign AIA offered free  COVID-19 protection cover to  over 500,000 people. Singapore AIA Singapore provided  free COVID-19 coverage for  2.6 million existing eligible  individual customers, corporate  members, employees and  AIA representatives. As part  of the AIA #ShareTheLove  2020 campaign, we enabled  customers to purchase  affordable life cover for  themselves and provide loved  ones with additional cover for  free. AIA offered complimentary  AIA #ShareTheLove Insurance  plans covering COVID-19 and 21  infectious diseases, including  dengue fever for the essential  workforce.  To ease worries about financial  instability, AIA Singapore  introduced AIA Retrenchment  Cover for selected AIA plans  as a complimentary benefit for  policyholders should they be  retrenched involuntarily and  remain unemployed. This free  coverage waives the premiums  for specified policies for up to  12 months.

Across the world, as concern grew about healthcare facilities being overwhelmed, we  worked with our strategic partners to develop more online medical services to offer accessible solutions to  our customers and ease pressure on local medical infrastructure. When it became imperative to practice social distancing and exercise caution when meeting indoors, we  were able to leverage our existing digitalisation initiatives and accelerate other projects to make many of our  products available online.  At a time when health, well-being and access to healthcare were of the utmost importance and yet often  inaccessible, we put digital solutions in place to facilitate and ensure continuity of care. The value of  telehealth services has been demonstrated in many of our markets. Key examples of some of these initiatives  are outlined below. Mainland China By making its network of  over 45,000 licensed doctors  available to provide online  medical consultations directly  to customers, AIA China and  its strategic partner WeDoctor  helped to ease pressure on local  hospitals dealing with COVID-19  patients. Thailand To support people at high risk of  contracting the virus and those  concerned about symptoms,  AIA Thailand, in collaboration  with communications firm True  Digital Group and SAMITIVEJ, a  Thai hospital group, launched   Virtual COVID-19 Clinic. The  service provided a 24/7  teleconsultation service free of  charge for a one-month period. Singapore Aiming to reduce some of the  pressure on the health system,  AIA Singapore, in partnership  with on-demand telemedicine  provider WhiteCoat, offered  corporate customers access  to teleconsultation services  with doctors as part of their  employee benefits and  covered the cost of 50,000  teleconsultations for holders  of the HealthShield Gold Max  policy. Australia To reduce the potential  impact of the pandemic, AIA  Australia moved face-to-face  occupational rehabilitation  services to a telehealth service  and delivered more services to  customers at home through its  health coaching programmes.  Medical studies suggest that  patients who recover from  COVID-19 have an increased  chance of developing chronic  lung diseases. To ensure  better health outcomes for  our customers, AIA Australia  created an industry-first  telehealth programme  called Breathe Well, to help  customers manage their  respiratory health. Breathe  Well offers seven coaching  sessions delivered by exercise  physiologists and education on  appropriate exercises during  their recovery. The programme  also identifies participants who  require a formal rehabilitation  programme and then  connects them with an expert  rehabilitation team. Sri Lanka In recognition of the difficult  circumstances, AIA Sri Lanka  made its oDoc service free to  select insurance customers.  oDoc is a mobile application  that connects patients with  doctors for video, audio  and text consultations,  allowing customers to book  over 400 Sri Lanka Medical  Council registered general  practitioners and specialists,  receive prescriptions and get  medication delivered. If lab  tests are required, the app can  arrange for a mobile lab to be  sent to homes or offices.

We also introduced AirSign and Sign Everywhere solutions, so our customers could have the option to sign  forms on their mobile phones without meeting in person. AirSign solutions have been launched in Hong  Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Myanmar and Cambodia. In an industry  first initiative for Sri Lanka, AIA also enabled customers to use enterprise-grade, secure remote digital  signatures.  Hong Kong In July, AIA Hong Kong  launched Remote Insurance  Purchase to make it safe for  customers to buy insurance  and receive uninterrupted  protection by connecting with  AIA via digital, telephone, post  and video-conference services.  A total of 23 products were  made available under this  arrangement, including medical,  critical illness, term policies and  personal accident categories. Indonesia  Amid extended social  restrictions in Indonesia,  we introduced AIA DigiBuy,  which allowed customers to  purchase insurance through a  virtual meeting by telephone  or video call. Through AIA  DigiBuy, agents were able to  explain product and benefits  and continue the sales process  remotely. The Philippines AIA Philam Life launched The  Coffee Closing Project, an  enhanced digital selling platform  with a 20-minute three-step  process:  1.  e-Submission and  e-Signature, where  customers review and  acknowledge the insurance  agreement;  2.  e-Payment via debit or credit  card; and  3.  Auto Underwrite using  Fusion, a proprietary  technology, to finalise the  insurance policy.  Award for Resilience  At the 2020 Hong Kong  International Data Corporation  (IDC) Digital Transformation  Awards, AIA received the Hong  Kong 2020 Special Award for  Resiliency. The market research  company reported that AIA  responded with speed and  purpose to the outbreak of  COVID-19 by accelerating the  adoption of new digital tools  and online capabilities, to ensure  agents could continue to deliver  uninterrupted service and support to  our customers and our communities. Remote agency meetings,  communications and remote sales  were enabled across all markets,  and by the end of April 2020,  almost half of AIAs sales were  being closed remotely. In addition,  significant progress was made  on increasing access to digital  learning and recruitment, with  most markets on track to deliver  enhanced capabilities. While  COVID-19 helped accelerate the  adoption of some of these new  tools, digitalisation drives our  transformation strategy.

Supporting Mental Well-being  In Australia, AIA proactively  engaged with regulators  and the government to raise  concerns about the potential  for increased mental health  problems. AIA Australia,  alongside other insurers  and superannuation funds,  partnered with mental health  organisation SuperFriend to  advocate for the adoption of  initiatives to address mental  health issues during the  pandemic.  In May, AIA Australia entered a  partnership with the Mentemia  mental well-being platform,  to launch an evidence-based  mental health app. Available  free of charge to everyone in  Australia for six months, the  app contained simple, bite- size tools and techniques to  help communities cope with  common stressors.  AIA Malaysia partnered  with ThoughtFull to  provide its employees with  free unlimited access to  mental health coaching by  certified professionals via  ThoughtFullChat, a mobile app. Community Support and Donations From the start of the pandemic, AIA recognised the importance of supporting local communities and  healthcare infrastructure, responding to the new issues faced by communities with both donations and  community engagement. Across the markets we operate in, we pledged a total of nearly US$1 million of pandemic support to  charities, medical institutions and partners who can channel resources to families in need, extending our  support to a wider group of beneficiaries. Mainland China In collaboration with WeDoctor,  AIA China contributed more  than RMB 4 million to sponsor  medical kits to Wuhan and  surrounding cities in Hubei,  which included 10 tonnes of  disinfectant, 960 virus testing  kits, 60 respirators and 20  thousand pairs of surgical  gloves. In partnership with the  Amity Foundation, more than  3,800 AIA China agents and  employees raised over RMB  500,000 in funds that were  used to purchase an ambulance  and 150,000 pairs of surgical  gloves for Hubei province.  Vietnam To provide financial support  for doctors and medical staff  working on the frontline, AIA  Vietnam made donations  totalling VND 2 billion for  essential medical equipment.  AIA Vietnam also set up a  financial assistance programme  of up to VND 23 billion for  frontline medical workers who  tested positive for COVID-19. Thailand Fight Together Against  COVID-19 rallied AIA Thailand  employees, agents, business  partners and customers to  engage with communities  across the kingdom as  volunteers on various relief  projects targeting low-income  families, people with disabilities  and other under-served groups.  They distributed 12,000  kindness survival kits to people  most affected by COVID-19 in  12 provinces across Thailand  and our agency force also  donated THB 300,000 to local  hospitals and the National  Cancer Institute.

Our main focus  is on digitalising more of our  customer interactions, to create  better service options and  reduce the amount of paper we  consume.  During 2020, as a result of  the COVID-19 pandemic, we  made more products available  through digital channels and  customers were able to buy  products and submit more  claims online than ever before.

AIA will take initiatives to reduce our operational carbon footprint, while also  reducing waste and raising awareness on the impacts of pollution. Reducing our Carbon Footprint In 2020, the Group produced  42,550 tonnes of CO2e, or  1.8 tonnes per employee.  The decrease in our overall  footprint this year was due  to a significant reduction in  business travel and remote- work measures put in place  across our Group in response to  COVID-19.  Total energy consumption  across the Group was  71,651,432 kWh, amounting to  3,062 kWh per person.  The largest contributor to  our operational footprint is  the electricity we use in our  buildings, which contributes to  our Scope 2 emission footprint  of 38,029 tonnes. Other sources  of emissions include those from  our corporate vehicle fleet and  business travel.   AIA continues to monitor our  environmental footprint, and  implement energy efficiency  measures, where applicable  throughout our business,  including solutions such as LED  lighting and video conferencing  technology.  Please also refer to Our TCFD  Report for details on our historic  carbon footprint, and our  approach to addressing climate  change.   Waste Management  In 2017, AIA established  an Environmental Policy to  specifically champion group- wide efforts to manage our  operational footprint. Building  on this policy, AIA launched  its internal Environmental  Procedures in 2020 and will  monitor and review them  annually or as required  to ensure relevance and  effectiveness. We are committed to reducing  the amount of single-use plastic  we use in our daily operations,  promotional materials and  by third parties representing  AIA. This has already been  implemented for staff dining  areas and workspaces at Group  Office, for AIA Group events and  at the AIA Leadership Centre  (ALC).  We also encourage the  recycling and reduction of  waste in other significant areas  of our operations, practicing  waste separation during  corporate events and ensuring  that unwanted electronic  waste such as computers and  telephones are donated or  disposed of properly. Other recommendations  include prioritising sustainable  seafood at all catered corporate  events, and where possible,  sourcing from sustainable  palm oil producers. As part  of our ESG Strategy, we also  intend to establish procedures  to measure and disclose the  amount of waste our operations  produce. Pollution  Addressing pollution is a  challenge that goes beyond the  influence of a single business,  and requires the concerted  effort and action of both the  private and public sectors.  AIAs memberships in ESG  organisations provide us with  one such forum to discuss  environmental issues with peers  and other leading businesses.  Burning coal and wood in the  home for cooking and heating  is still commonplace in many  parts of Asia and this is a  well-known cause of indoor air  pollution. Research supported  by AIA this year showed that  these residential sources also  contribute significantly to  outdoor air pollution. Advances  in technology have reduced  emissions from traffic and  electricity generation, meaning  that emissions from residential  cooking and heating now  account for a greater proportion  of outdoor air pollution. It is  crucial that efforts to reduce  fine particulate matter (PM2.5)  find ways to address these  residential pollution sources. AIAs influence lies in raising  awareness on the health  impacts of pollution, and in  exploring ways in which we  can assist our customers  in reducing their exposure  to specific pollutants. Our  solutions enable us to play a  more active role in addressing  this risk factor and in enabling  our customers to live Healthier,  Longer, Better Lives.

Investee engagements at AIA  are conducted on specific  themes or sectors and therefore  may touch all of our investee  companies, or only those within  the sector engaged, for example,  our engagement across the  palm oil sector. AIAs ESG team  and Group Investment function  will coordinate on areas for  engagement, the preparation of  any materials, assessment and/ or scoring methodology, and  briefing of our research analysts  who engage regularly with our  investee companies.  AIAs ESG team continues  to work closely with the  Group Investment function,  sharing and seeking to  apply industry knowledge,  trends, and international best  practices, as well as devising  and implementing specific  investment engagements,  aligned with international  market-leading approaches,  and outcomes for certain  topical areas. The ESG team and  Group Investment function will  seek to enhance our investee  engagement approach and  methodology, for example,  through using internal scores  so that deeper and broader  insights can be derived, across  sectors, geographical locations  and/or asset classes. Proxy Voting Voting at company meetings  is an important part of the  dialogue between a company  and its shareholders. As an  asset owner it is a fundamental  aspect of our fiduciary duty  to our customers and our  commitment to sustainability.   Our Proxy Voting Standard  (Voting Standard) is based on  principles of good corporate  governance, which serve to  protect the long-term interests  of shareholders. Senior  investment management at  our business units will decide  on whether the voting event  or transaction is significant  enough for review by AIA. If a  review is justified, the relevant  research analyst and portfolio  managers will provide an  analysis of the voting decision  and resolution. The relevant  portfolio managers will then  determine whether AIA will  participate in voting. Our Voting Standard also  outlines a list of mandatory ESG  issues that must be considered  in our voting decisions.  Our Approach  to the Palm Oil  Sector  Unsustainable palm oil  production has significant  negative social and  environmental impacts,  including deforestation,  pollution and biodiversity  loss. AIA is a member of the  Principles for Responsible  Investment (PRI) Investor  Working Group on Sustainable  Palm Oil and is committed  to engaging with companies  across the palm oil value  chain to encourage more  sustainable practices. We  also assessed our exposure to  palm oil producing companies  in our investment portfolio,  across both fixed income and  equity asset classes, engaging  with these businesses on  improving their sustainability  practices both in their  operations and supply chains.  AIA also developed additional  internal guidance and scoring  methodology for our research  analysts in engaging with, and  assessing the sustainability of,  a palm oil plantation or mill,  across asset class.  AIA continues to engage with companies on any ESG-related concerns before or after  an investment decision, regardless of asset class. AIA believes that active engagement  with investee companies, particularly those in emerging market economies, is an  effective mechanism for improving ESG awareness and practices, driving sustainable  behaviour and in securing sustainable, long-term outcomes.

We believe that  sound governance underpins  good corporate behaviour, which  contributes to good results for  stakeholders and our abilities to  achieve sustainable long-term  outcomes.  Business owners and asset  managers are increasingly  aware of the potential risk and  value impact of ESG factors,  and their effect on profitability  and investment returns. AIA  understands that issuers looking  to create long-term stakeholder  value must ensure a sound  approach to the planning and  management of ESG aspects.  Ignoring ESG risks is likely to  have financial consequences  alongside other key  considerations such as ignoring  credit, currency and commercial  risks, or other reputational issues.  AIA believes that a sustainable  business model drives shareholder  value, is a key determinant of  management ability, and determines  whether an issuer can meet its  financial obligations longer term. AIAs investment decisions with  respect to ESG are based upon:   an assessment of ESG factors  in potential and actual investee  companies;   the belief that active engagement  with investee companies is a  more effective mechanism to  promote, develop and enhance  ESG-related business practices;  and  certain specified exclusions  where those sectors or categories  have been determined to not be  consistent with our Purpose. AIA assesses ESG issues as they  relate to an investee companys  operations, considering the impact  that ESG risks may pose to a  companys profits, assets, business  and people. AIA employs a consistent  approach to addressing these ESG  issues, considering a range  of ESG factors, including but  not limited to water shortage,  energy supply, climate change,  environmental regulations,  labour supply and relations,  resource scarcity/bottleneck,  management capability  and integrity, and financial  management.  Research analysts are required  to incorporate an assessment of  ESG risks and issues into their  research reports. AIA research  analysts refer to a companys  ESG report to better understand  how these issues and risks are  being managed. Analysts also  consider ESG research and  data produced by third-party  research providers.  Given the increasing importance  of ESG scores, and the insights  that this can provide, AIA will  also be considering ways to  incorporate ESG scores into  the assessment and research  process.

This leadership group has  ownership of our approach,  including maintaining  appropriate documentation,  as well as training and  development of the portfolio  managers and research  analysts at business units.  In 2019, AIA was the first  Hong Kong-headquartered  business to become a signatory  to the PRI as an asset owner.  Continue to build on the  consideration of ESG  issues in the investment  process by augmenting  knowledge and capacity  among our investment  analysts through  dedicated training  initiatives. This allows us to benefit  from the resources of the PRI  as we continue to integrate  ESG considerations into our  process and demonstrate our  commitment to sustainable  investment. AIA will submit its  first report to the PRI in 2021.  AIA has also been a supporter  of the TCFD since 2018.  AIA will review regional  and international initiatives  to address climate change  and continue to evolve our  approach based on our external  commitments.  Developing and enhancing capacity on understanding and assessing ESG issues is a  priority for AIA, and essential in making informed and relevant investment decisions,  as we believe that a sustainable business model drives shareholder value. Given the  dynamic and constantly evolving nature of the ESG space, and material ESG risks that  companies face, our analysts are provided with access to ESG resources, materials and  training. Our analysts complement their  research activities by accessing  and utilising ESG resources,  including webinars, industry  discussion forums, external  research reports and thought  leadership articles. The Group  Investment function works  closely with the ESG team  to raise awareness and keep  the research and portfolio  management teams informed  about industry developments,  and the current focus areas  of stakeholders such as  regulators, asset owners and  trade associations.

To understand how business  leaders were adapting to  the new environment, AIA  conducted a survey with its  portfolio companies in 2020.  We wanted to assess and  identify leaders in relation to  business continuity, and support  for local communities during  the pandemic. Throughout  the engagement, we found  consistent humanitarian-centric  responses in local community  engagement.  Key findings include:   Across South East Asia,  the private sector played a  critical role in organising and  distributing resources and  accelerating the production  of personal protective equipment  to address community needs. In  Malaysia and the Philippines, the  private sector led by providing  COVID-19 testing and quarantine  facilities and alleviating  overburdened public healthcare  systems. Indonesian firms also  responded quickly to the surge in  demand for essential health and  hygiene products.   In Mainland China, a coordinated  private sector response  contributed significantly to  the countrys continuity and  recovery after the immediate  impacts of COVID-19. Chinese  firms mobilised resources,  scaled critical technologies that  facilitated better research and  treatment, and rapidly redirected  expertise and supplies to stem  the spread of COVID-19.   Hong Kong and Singapore  saw private sector donations  of critical medical supplies to  healthcare professionals along  with launching community  engagement initiatives.  Rapid scaling of digital  solutions across all markets  helped sustain business  continuity, build community  resilience and fast-tracked  the pace of digital integration.  There was widespread  adoption of cloud services  and private networks  along with increased video  conferencing for group and  client meetings among our  portfolio investees, many of  whom implemented remote  working procedures.  The survey reiterated the  essential role played by  businesses across Asia, in  redirecting expertise and  resources and contributing to  community resilience during  these times.

Much of the investment needed  to close the infrastructure and  climate funding gap will be from  the private sector. AIA continues  to mobilise savings, directing  this to infrastructure and  other productive investments.  This contributes to the  sustainable development of our  communities in Asia. As an asset owner, with   US$247.4 billion invested  assets, we already have  significant investments in  infrastructure, healthcare  and other industries. Our  commitment to sustainable  investment supports the growth  and development of capital  markets and provides valuable  capital for infrastructure,  economic growth, and thereby  the sustainable development of  the region and our communities.  AIA has been active in providing  funding for many infrastructure  projects in the region. Out of our  total fixed income and equity  investments, approximately  US$32 billion is invested in  infrastructure-related sectors,  representing an increase of 6.6  per cent compared to 2019. This  demonstrates our unwavering  commitment to the long-term  sustainable development of our  markets.  US$1.1 BILLION in green bonds AIA is aware of the continual need to contribute to the sustainable development of our  communities.

Portfolio Exclusions  We believe longer-term  stakeholder value, including  investment return, will be  impacted by the ultimate  decline in sustainability  of certain sectors. It is  therefore from a long-term  risk management perspective  that AIA has decided to  exclude some sectors from  our investment programme.  Any sectors excluded from  the investment programme  are reflected in the automated  pre-trade controls implemented  in our investment trading  platforms, providing robust pre- trade restriction governance. In 2018, we took the significant  initiative of excluding tobacco  manufacturing from our  investment portfolio, divesting  US$500 million in corporate  equities and bonds. Our view  is that tobacco products are  inconsistent with our Purpose,  including our wellness  initiatives and programmes  aimed at encouraging healthier  lifestyle choices. We also exclude cluster  munitions from our investments.  Cluster munitions are a  controversial weapon that  cause significant civilian  casualties, with some of our  markets signing treaties to ban  their manufacture. AIA does not  invest in such businesses, and  our investment exclusion list  reflects this commitment.  While we believe that active  engagement is a more effective  mechanism for improving ESG  awareness and practices in  parallel to driving sustainable  behaviour as opposed to the  outright exclusion, AIA will  continue to monitor regulatory  and thematic developments,  and regularly review its  exclusion list. All of our directly managed  full discretion investment  operations, including any assets  managed by our discretionary  external managers, are required  to abide by AIAs exclusion list.  This year, AIA took significant  steps to divest our exposure  to coal-mining and coal-fired  power generation sectors. Further details of AIAs  approach can be found in  Significant Steps to Address  our Exposure to the Coal  Sector within the Sustainable  Investment section on page 51. Our Investment  Managers  As an asset owner, we work with  many investment managers  who manage and invest money  representing general account  assets on behalf of AIA. We  consider the ESG practices of  investment managers during  the selection process, reviewing  their approach to both ESG  engagement with investee  companies and assessing ESG  factors during investment  decisions. After awarding a  mandate, AIA continues to  monitor the ESG practices  of these external parties  throughout the relationship.  In consideration of both our Purpose and our commitment to secure sustainable long- term investment outcomes, our ESG Strategy outlines our approach and the initiatives  we have taken to exclude certain sectors from our investment universe. These are  sectors which are deemed inconsistent with our Purpose and objectives.

Carbon Footprinting Our Portfolio Measuring Our Footprint AIA is committed to being  transparent with our stakeholders  and focusing on areas of impact  in our ESG reporting. As such, we  engaged a third-party consultant,  Deloitte Advisory (Hong Kong)  Limited (Deloitte), to assist us in  the significant initiative of carbon  footprinting our directly managed  equity portfolio investments as  at 31 December 2019 and 30  November 2020.  AIA remains staunchly  committed to reducing its  carbon footprint. We continue to  look for measures that will aid in  demonstrating the outcomes of  our efforts in this regard over a  sustained period. We continue  to evolve our measurement  methodology as the market and  our investees make fuller and  more consistent disclosures  on carbon emissions. As  demonstrated by the outcomes  below, we are pleased and  proud to show a 24 per cent  reduction in one of our primary  measurement bases over the  past three years.  Methodology and  Application AIA measures carbon  footprinting in its directly  managed equity portfolio  investments with reference to  the weighted average carbon  intensity (WACI) of the issuers  in the equity portfolio. This  is calculated based on the  portfolio companies emissions  (or estimates of these emissions  where this information is not  publicly available) relative  to their sales, with the sales  information being based on  publicly available sources,  weighted by the percentage  that each portfolio companys  market capitalisation represents  in the market capitalisation  of the whole portfolio. This  As an asset owner, our environmental influence extends to our investments and the  diverse sectors in which we invest, primarily across Asia. AIA is committed to being  transparent with our stakeholders and focusing on areas of impact. This includes  reporting on our portfolios carbon footprint.   methodology for calculating the  carbon footprint was developed  in conjunction with Deloitte, but  applies a standard metric for the  market established by MSCI Inc. Deloitte was engaged to  calculate the weighted average  of the issuers carbon intensity  in the equity portfolio, given  the subjective nature of the  calculation methodology and  their experience in undertaking  similar exercises. Deloitte had  previously been engaged to  calculate the weighted average  carbon intensity of the issuers  in our equity portfolio for 2018.  In the current exercise, Deloitte  has taken advantage of  enhanced market disclosure  and data availability across our  investment portfolio to restate  the WACI of our equity portfolio  for 2018, and has corrected  certain data errors relating to  their 2018 calculation.   Results The results confirm AIAs delivery  of the commitment it made to  address the carbon intensity  within its equity portfolio actively  and aggressively.  There has been a decrease of 24  per cent since 2018 due to our  ambitious efforts to divest from  the coal mining and coal-fired  Weighted Average of the Issuers Carbon Intensity (tonnes of CO2e/ US$ million) 2018 (As restated - Note) 2019 As at 30 November 2020 413.82 368.06 313.57 Note: A Weighted Average of the Issuers Carbon Intensity (tonnes of CO2e/ US$ million) of 301 as at 31 December 2018 was  previously reported. energy sectors.

Employee Coaching and  Internships We encourage our employees to  expand their networks, benefit  from guidance and foster  communication across different  departments and seniorities.  Currently coaching is supported  in many of our business units  and at Group Office. Across our business units,  we also offer development  opportunities for hundreds  of interns. Our programmes  provide interns with first-hand  experience of what a career at  AIA is like and an opportunity  to learn crucial skills in a fast- moving and customer-focused  environment. They also provide  us with a great opportunity to  identify future talents for our  business. 2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PEOPLE AND  CULTURE  PAGE 57 PAGE 57 PEOPLE AND CULTURE Developing   Our People Diversity and  Inclusion A Risk-aware  Culture Recognising and  Rewarding Our  People SUPPLEMENT:  Supporting Our  Employees   During COVID-19 PAGE 57 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 Agency Learning and Development  AIA Singapore  Recruits 500  Local Graduates  Against a background of  increased redundancies  and a worsening job market  in Singapore due to the  pandemic, AIA created  up to 500 new career  opportunities, in-depth  training and financial  support for fresh graduates. The AIA Financial Career  Scheme 2020 equips  individuals with skills and  knowledge to pursue a new  career path in the financial  services industry as an AIA  Financial Adviser or AIA  Premier Consultant. From  September, successful  candidates were enrolled  progressively and received  structured training over  an initial 10-month period  leading to three recognised  certifications. All successful  candidates enrolled in  the programme were also  assigned a mentor.   Our Premier Agency strategy  focuses on developing best-in- class agents through innovative  approaches to training and  development. This differentiates  AIA through the quality of advice  we offer our customers and our  ability to tailor solutions to their  specific needs.  AIA has embraced e-learning  for training and development.  With more than 80 per cent of  agency training available through  e-learning and virtual classroom  sessions, agents can log into  the Learning Management  System (LMS) via smartphones  or tablets at any time to update  their knowledge. LMS features  are continually updated, and the  system is accessible by trainers  across markets. It includes  training courses for both agents  and agency leaders, to help  ensure that our best practices  are appropriately shared and  embedded across the Group.  Learning about AIA Vitality  is a key part of the product  training process for agents. We  empower our agents to engage  with customers about the  improvements they are making  to their health and well-being on  an ongoing basis.  AIA continues to work with  specialised professional  development associations to  enhance our agency leadership  programmes. This year we  introduced revised modules from  LIMRA to upgrade distribution  management capability.  Across the Group, we launched  Chartered Insurance Agency  Management (CIAM) certification  for agency leaders and  Chartered Insurance Distribution  Executive (CIDE) certification for  distribution executives.  To address the need for a  quality pipeline of young  agents, we revised our  distribution management  programme to focus on  recruitment, productivity and  retention practices. AIA Group  Agency Distribution has also  introduced a business-wide  approach to performance  coaching to develop distribution  executives and sales leaders as  performance coaches accredited  by the International Coaching  Federation. Coaching empowers  our agents to engage and  support their teams to give their  best at work and encourages a  greater sense of ownership. By  engaging our next generation  in developmental and change  processes we are developing and  coaching future leaders. 2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PEOPLE AND  CULTURE  PAGE 58 PAGE 58 PEOPLE AND CULTURE Developing   Our People Diversity and  Inclusion A Risk-aware  Culture Recognising and  Rewarding Our  People SUPPLEMENT:  Supporting Our  Employees   During COVID-19 PAGE 58 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 At AIA, there is zero  tolerance for discrimination  or harassment in any form,  across all aspects of diversity,  including race, colour, religion,  sex, nationality, age, disability,  military service, marital status  and sexual orientation.

As a company with operations in 18 markets, we  draw upon diverse perspectives and create an inclusive environment, that promotes  innovation, better decision-making, adaptability and problem-solving that enable us to  realise our Purpose.  Across the Group, networks,  such as our employee-led and  executive-sponsored Gender  Equality Network at AIA  Australia and AIA New Zealand,  organise networking events,  professional development  sessions and opportunities to  support and enable gender  equality. To foster a supportive  work environment, we created  The NetWork at Group Office.  This umbrella organisation  enables employee affinity  groups to facilitate diversity  and inclusion initiatives and  events for the professional  and personal development of  our people. In support of our  locally led networks for women,  AIA is a member of the Hong  Kong chapter of the Women in  Finance Asia Network and the  30% Club, which are working to  develop a diverse pool of talent  for all businesses to enhance  gender balance at all levels of  organisations.

AIA is one of 16 companies that  joined the Sri Lanka SheWorks  Partnership, a two-year peer  learning platform for sharing  business results and good  practices on advancing gender  equality in the workplace.  Member companies recognised  that advancing gender equality in  business leads to better access  to talent, higher productivity,  more customers, and a stronger  bottom line. SheWorks covers  more than 170,000 Sri Lankan  employees. In 2020, AIA Sri Lankas Director  and Chief Officer - Legal,  Governance and Operations and  SheWorks member Chathuri  Munaweera, received an  award for being one of the 16  trailblazers who are driving  gender equality and gender  parity in Sri Lanka.  As part of its move to create  a gender smart workplace,  AIA Sri Lanka has enhanced  womens presence in leadership  positions via mentoring and  building succession pipelines.  Propelling Ideas is a leadership  learning programme that  helped nurture six women  leaders while increasing  womens representation in the  top management tier. Among  its family-friendly employee  benefits, AIA Sri Lanka offers  100-day maternity leave, which  has resulted in three out of four  mothers returning to work.  Chathuri Munaweera Director & Chief Officer - Legal,  Governance & Operations, AIA Sri Lanka Gender parity is central  to having a dynamic  balanced workforce. Female  employees and Wealth  Planners play an integral  part in our business success.  AIA recognised early on, the  narrowing trends of female  participation at work in Sri  Lanka. We have taken many  sustainable steps to ensure  that our female colleagues  have a work environment  that provides flexibility,  at life stages where such  support is needed most.  It is not just about fixing  the basics and having the  best support during key  stages of motherhood, but  also ensuring that there  is room to grow in your  career whether in sales or in  support functions. Diversity and inclusion are  the key components that drive  innovation in our businesses.

A Risk-aware Culture  Trust is integral to the  products and services that  AIA offers to our customers  and is the foundation of all our  interactions in the workplace,  and with all other external  stakeholders. We hold ourselves  to the highest professional  standards as defined in the  Code, which outlines how we  maintain this trust and reflects  our Operating Philosophy of  \"Doing the Right Thing, in  the Right Way, with the Right  People... the Right Results will  come\".  AIAs Operating Philosophy  and Code further outline  expectations on professional  conduct, identifying expected  risk awareness and channels  for reporting on potential risks.  Frequent training and internal  communications ensure that  all employees are familiar  with the appropriate reporting  options, which typically start  with an employees manager or  through the use of our internal  or external hotlines.  Employees must certify  compliance with the Code and  other key policies annually  and in this way, we check  that employees understand  their obligation to speak up,  reporting any potential risks  via the Groups channels. We  assess whether employees  are confident that, should they  raise an ethical matter, it will  be appropriately handled, and  whether their manager makes  them feel comfortable about  raising concerns about risk.  A strong and resilient culture is key to the effective management of risk and relates to  how an organisation navigates the challenges and opportunities posed to its business.   2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PEOPLE AND  CULTURE  PAGE 61 PAGE 61 PEOPLE AND CULTURE Developing   Our People Diversity and  Inclusion A Risk-aware  Culture Recognising and  Rewarding Our  People SUPPLEMENT:  Supporting Our  Employees   During COVID-19 PAGE 61 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 Recognising and Rewarding  Our People During AIAs recruitment  processes we assess candidates  competencies and experience.

Throughout the year,  many business units moved  to remote or flexible working  arrangements when required.  Our response has been specific  to local needs and has evolved  as precautions were introduced  by governments to prevent  the spread of the disease. At a  corporate level, this required  proactive and targeted  communications. We deployed a  range of tools, including online  resources on local intranets and  microsites such as our COVID  hub, and used videos, virtual  town halls and messages from  senior leaders to support our  employees and provide up-to- date information regarding the  effect of the virus.  With many of our people around  the region working from home,  we focused on finding ways to  work and collaborate effectively  on a remote basis, including  utilising technology efficiently.  The need for social distancing  and lockdowns in some cities  and markets, combined with  travel bans, saw a rapid  increase in the use of video  conferencing. The medical insurance  policies across the majority of  our business units provided  permanent employees with free  coverage for expenses related  to COVID-19.  When our employees were  able to work in the office, we  ensured safeguards were put in  place to deliver a safe working  environment. This included  temperature checks, policies  regarding masks in the office,  and scenario planning should  someone in the office building  test positive for COVID-19.  To support the mental well- being of our employees, we  also promoted our Employee  Assistance Programmes, which  are available in a number of  markets and include a 24-hour  support hotline.  AIA also has a group-wide  incident management plan  and local plans to handle any  potential case of COVID-19  within our offices. All business  units have business continuity  and incident management plans  in place and activated a team  of senior leaders to handle  our pandemic response. This  communications effort included  a high level of collaboration  from a range of functions at  the company, including Risk,  Human Resources, Corporate  Facilities, Technology and  Operations and Corporate  Security. 2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PEOPLE AND  CULTURE  Board Governance Effective Risk  Management and  Responsible Business  Practices Promoting ESG Best  Practice ESG Rating and Index  Inclusions PAGE 67 EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE  2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PAGE 67 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE  Effective  Governance  Strong corporate governance  is essential both to the  delivery of sustainable value  and to maintaining a culture  of business integrity.

ESG Governance The Boards membership  includes expertise in the  management of ESG matters,  with various members  demonstrating deep fluency in  ESG issues and trends, while  bringing valuable experience  and perspectives gained  from their previous positions  serving on ESG or sustainability  committees of listed companies,  as well as in public service and  government positions.  Our Board includes members  with deep experience in our  markets, including in areas  as diverse as commerce,  regulation and the public  sector. This expertise is  supported by a structure  that enables appropriate  oversight while allowing for  in-depth consideration of  various matters by the Boards  committees and delegation  of operational matters to  management, while ensuring  that the Board retains overall  control.  Board Independence  Board independence is  critical to effective corporate  governance. Providing  independent and objective  judgment that acts in the  interests of the Company and  its stakeholders is central to  the Boards oversight. Nine out  of the ten Board members are  Independent Non-executive  Directors.  With the exception of the Group  Chief Executive and President,  the Board is made up entirely  of Independent Non-executive  Directors, underscoring our  strong commitment to operating  according to international best  practice. Board Committee  Composition Each of the four Board  committees, namely the Audit  Committee, the Nomination  Committee, the Remuneration  Committee and the Risk  Committee, is chaired by an  Independent Non-executive  Director. The Audit Committee,  the Nomination Committee, and  the Remuneration Committee  comprise of Independent  Non-executive Directors. The  Risk Committee includes the  Group Chief Executive as its  only non-independent Director.  His inclusion is to ensure that  the Risk Committee has the  benefit of detailed financial  and operational information to  ensure appropriate oversight  in support of ensuring the  sustainability of the Groups  operations. Board Diversity Board diversity is important  to ensuring robust corporate  governance and decision- making. The Board draws on  extensive business, financial,  government, regulatory and  policy experience from a broad  spectrum of backgrounds, as  relevant to the Groups business  operations and development.  The Board also reflects a  diversity of nationalities,  ethnicities, educational  backgrounds, functional  expertise, gender and age.

The boards of  directors of our business units  are responsible for reviewing  this framework to ensure that  it is sufficiently effective given  local business environments  and context.  We address ESG-related risks  according to the process  outlined in the RMF and  categorise them based on  the nature of the risk to our  operations. Data protection,  cybersecurity, people  management and responsible  business practices may have  immediate operational impacts  and are therefore viewed and  treated as operational risks.  Long-term challenges such  as pollution and lifestyle risk  factors impact the health and  well-being of people across  our markets and are viewed as  insurance risks given the impact  they may pose. Such emerging  ESG issues may be discussed  by the BRC, eRC or the ESG  Committee. AIA conducts scenario testing  and business continuity analysis  to ensure sufficient capital is  earmarked to provide protection  to our policyholders and to  ensure business continuity  under stressed conditions.   For further details on our  approach, please refer to the  Risk Management section of the  Annual Report 2020.  Our internal audit function  provides independent  assurance on the effectiveness  of our key controls and  recommends control  improvements as necessary.  The function provides  assurance that the appropriate  controls in place to address  material risks are effective. AIA recognises that long-term  ESG risks, such as climate  change, pollution, the global  pandemic and lifestyle-related  NCDs, have far reaching  impacts on our markets and  require concerted contributions  from businesses, governments  and the general public alike. AIA  aims to address these issues  through discussion within our  ESG member organisations,  and by playing a proactive role  through our business where we  remain committed to enabling  Healthier, Longer, Better Lives  across the region. 15 MSCI 2019 Effectively manage ESG  risks and opportunities  throughout our business,  maintaining and  ensuring the sufficiency  of our risk management  framework to uphold  commitments to the  highest standards of  responsible business  practices.  A commitment to responsible business practices and effective risk management are  essential in order to create an environment where issues can be addressed promptly  as they arise. We are also committed to the fair treatment of our customers and their  data, always striving to understand their needs and wants.

The ESG Committee  is responsible for overseeing  the governance around ESG,  in addition to integrating  and addressing ESG issues  within our business. The ESG  Committee also considers ESG  research, feedback raised by  key stakeholders and reports by  rating agencies to provide input  on specific ESG issues relevant to  the Group. The ESG Committee met four  times in 2020 and reviewed our  ESG Strategy, progress, and the  content of this Report, and also  considered our submissions  to sustainability indices. The  ESG Committee is responsible  for updating the Board on ESG  matters and provided biannual  updates on material issues to  the Board during 2020, while  ESG risks are also discussed and  escalated to the Board through  the Risk Committee.  All employees at AIA are  responsible for contributing  to the realisation of our ESG  priorities, whether through  upholding our principles for good  governance or through direct  ESG-focused roles within the  Groups ESG team or Investment  function. Across AIAs markets,  employees also contribute to the  Groups ESG reporting initiatives,  the maintenance of our  sustainable buildings, and our  community outreach initiatives.

We take pride in our long  history of successful operation  and value the reputation we  have earned of being a reliable  and trustworthy company that  acts with integrity. Code of Conduct At the heart of our approach  to good governance is our  Code. The Code provides clear  guidance on how we conduct  business at all times and  applies to everyone who works  at AIA. It reflects our Operating  Philosophy, namely Doing the  Right Thing, in the Right Way,  with the Right People the  Right Results will come. It also  defines how we hold ourselves  to the highest standards of  professionalism, which is key to  maintaining trust and building  sustainable relationships with  our stakeholders – customers,  agents, distribution partners,  regulators and investors. The Code has been translated  into six languages and all  employees are required to  undertake training to familiarise  themselves with the Code upon  joining AIA. All employees are  also required to complete an  annual certification attesting to  their familiarity and compliance  with the Code. Training on the  Code is supplemented with  ethical leadership programmes  to equip AIA leaders with  practical training to manage  situations involving ethical  dilemmas. Each employee is expected to  take personal responsibility for  observing the highest standards  of integrity and conduct, and  to report any violations. We  believe that our environment  and the processes that we have  empower employees to identify  and escalate issues without fear  of retribution. Non-compliance  with the Code is subject to  disciplinary action, which  can include dismissal where  appropriate. AIAs business  partners, including its agents,  distribution partners and  suppliers are expected to apply  similar standards and to follow  the same responsible practices  as our employees.  Preventing Bribery and  Corruption Under our policies, employees  and other persons representing  AIA are prohibited from  offering, accepting, paying  or authorising any bribes  or any form of corruption in  any business interaction that  involves AIA and government  officials, our customers, or  employees. Anti-corruption training is  compulsory for all employees.  Reviews and assessments are  conducted from time to time  to monitor compliance with  the Anti-Corruption Policy.  The Anti-Corruption Policy  also outlines the roles and  responsibilities of employees  to ensure compliance. Our  business units are responsible  for implementing processes  and controls to reduce the  risk of corruption and ensure  compliance with all relevant  local laws and regulations. Preventing Fraud AIA is committed to the high  ethical standards outlined in  the Code and espouses a zero- tolerance approach towards  fraud. AIAs Anti-Fraud Policy  sets out standards for managing  the risk of fraud, including  training as well as preventive  and detective measures. Our  operating entities implement  procedures to prevent and  facilitate early detection of  fraudulent practices to protect  customer interests and those of  AIA, in line with this Anti-Fraud  Policy.  Incidents and allegations  or suspicions of fraud are  assessed and investigated.  If allegations or suspicions  are substantiated, AIA is  committed to taking a fair  and proportionate approach  in administering disciplinary  actions. Other actions may  include the loss of employment- related benefits, reporting  the fraud to law enforcement  authorities for prosecution or  seeking a legal remedy against  the employee for the fraud that  has been committed.

To that end, AIA maintains a  comprehensive Whistle-blower  Programme designed to handle  reports of misconduct and  inappropriate behaviour with  multiple reporting channels,  including dedicated email  channels and a 24-hour, multi- lingual third-party administered  ethics hotline which permits  complete anonymity.  All allegations are assessed  and investigated. Reporting  through internal channels (such  as Human Resources, Audit  and Compliance) accounted  for 66 per cent of the reports  received during the year. Issues  raised via the ethics hotline  are handled by the Group  Compliance team.  The Whistle-blower Programme  is overseen by the Board Audit  Committee, who receive regular  reports from Group Internal  Audit and Group Compliance on  the number and nature of issues  raised and the progress of all  material investigations. AIAs  Whistle-blower Protection Policy  prohibits any form of retaliation  against any employee providing  a good faith report of an actual  or suspected violation of the  Code, AIA policies or the law.  In 2020, the programme  received reports that included  a broad range of issues. The  Further details on our  ethics hotline can be  found here. subject of reports varied  widely, and included customer  complaints, Human Resources  and work grievances,  matters relating to individual  circumstances and matters  relating to alleged breaches of  AIA policies, workplace respect,  individual or small group ethical  conduct, and questions about  business practices.  Among completed  investigations in the period  2019-2020, 40 per cent covered  allegations which were at least  partly substantiated. Our Approach to   Anti-money Laundering (AML)  and Counter Terrorist Financing  (CTF) and Sanctions AIA is committed to a strict  programme of compliance with  all applicable AML/CTF laws  and regulations to prevent the  use of its products and services  for money laundering and  terrorist financing purposes. The Group AML/CTF Policy sets  out the detailed requirements  of the Group AML/CTF  Programme. This includes  a risk-based approach to  conducting customer due  diligence, ongoing monitoring,  suspicious activity reporting,  training and record keeping. AIA  uses a comprehensive AML/ CTF monitoring software and  online tool to screen, risk profile  and monitor customer activity. All new employees are required  to complete AML/CTF training.  Tied agents are also required  to receive appropriate AML/ CTF training. In addition, our  Group Economic Sanctions  Policy sets out standards to  manage the risk of dealings  with governments, individuals  and entities subject to sanctions  programmes. Our Commitments to our  Customers At AIA, we strive to meet  customer expectations and  earn our customers trust by  adhering to high standards of  quality and customer service  throughout the customer  journey. AIAs programmes  on consumer protection and  fairness, as well as customer  service and experience are  deeply rooted in AIAs Operating  Philosophy and Code.  As part of the product approval  process, business units  are required to perform an  assessment to ensure that  each product complies with all  applicable laws, regulations and  internal policies.  AIAs intermediaries also play a  major role in building trust and  confidence with our customers,  through their conduct and  professionalism. We have put  in place internal standards for  a business quality framework  that sets out the minimum  requirements to manage sales  conduct risk which we believe  ensures that the right outcomes  are achieved for our customers. The framework includes the  following key elements:   Market conduct guidelines  must define the proper  conduct and behaviour for  intermediaries;   Training programmes for  intermediaries on AIA  products and sales processes  should cover Know-Your- Customer diligence;   Sales processes must reflect  the Code, which includes  financial needs analysis  for product suitability and  affordability assessments;  and   Board Governance Effective Risk  Management and  Responsible Business  Practices Promoting ESG Best  Practice ESG Rating and Index  Inclusions PAGE 74 EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE  2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PAGE 74 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE   Our interactive Point of Sale  (iPoS) technology guides  our agents through the sales  process and helps ensure  a consistent, high-quality  customer experience.  We monitor adherence  to our standards through  various means, including  direct verification calls with  customers and a mystery  shopping programme.  Any misrepresentation, or  attempt to mislead or deceive  customers, for example through  unsupported or fictitious  claims about our products or  those of our competitors, is not  acceptable and may result in  disciplinary action.  AIA also has in place an internal  standard on our business  quality framework which sets  out the minimum requirements  applicable to business partners.  These include due diligence  checks on prospective  distribution partners, product  training and on-going monitoring  of business quality.  We have also put in place policies  to promote transparency in  communications with customers.  For example, there are internal  standards on sales illustrations,  which establish the minimum  requirements for disclosure  and information presented in  promotional materials for AIA  products. Our goal is to clearly  communicate key information  about product features and  projected insurance policy  values and any assumptions  that have been made relating to  charges and returns. As part of  the product approval process,  business units perform reviews of  all sales materials.  Customer Engagement With more than 38 million  individual policies and over  16 million participating members  of group insurance schemes,  the scale and footprint of our  customer base underscores our  impact on our communities as  we actively engage and nurture  long-term relationships with our  customers.  Achieving our Purpose of  enabling people to lead  Healthier, Longer, Better Lives  requires that we engage in  a meaningful way with our  customers at each touchpoint  in their journey, allowing us to  develop a deep understanding  of their unique needs and wants  and meet their requirements.  Customer segmentation  Helping our customers improve  their health requires that  we better understand their  needs. To that end, we conduct  research to understand the  needs of various customer  segments in order to customise  our products and services. This year, we expanded our  segmentation model to Thailand  to get a holistic view of different  customers in terms of their life  stage, attitude and behaviour.  With these segmentation  insights, we can customise  our proposition based on  unique customer needs. We  have also developed digital  sales tools and training to help  agents identify their customer  segments so they can provide  more relevant professional  advice and support, and engage  better with their customers. Listening to our customers to  deliver a best-in-class customer  experience  It is our strategic imperative  to create a distinctive,  personalised and meaningful  customer experience. To  deliver this, we must listen to  our customers and design and  deliver an end-to-end customer  journey anchored around their  needs.  Customer experience research  informs what customers expect  and how we may enhance  their interactions with us.  This research has enabled  us to understand more about  how customers interact with  us at different stages of the  customer journey, so we can  refine the design to better meet  their requirements. We have  also expanded our Voice of  Customer programme, which  was featured in last years  Report. Specifically, our annual  Customer Relationship Survey  (CRS) and Distributor Survey  have been refreshed with new  measurement metrics and  design to get deeper insights  at each stage of the customer  journey.  We have also refined the  framework design of our real- time closed loop customer  feedback system, which  provides us with customer  feedback right after their  interactions with AIA. By  identifying the stages of the  journey that are most important  to customers, we are able to  provide timely and proactive  support.

Handling of customer  complaints We have consistent guidelines  for handling customer  complaints across all our  business units. This includes  clear procedures and protocols  for dealing with customer  issues and the documentation  related to the handling of cases.  Customers can learn about  the channels for submitting  complaints through our  websites as well as in our  policy materials. AIA strives  to handle all complaints and  investigations in a prompt and  efficient manner.  Resources are in place to  address complaints across  our business units, including  a dedicated person to handle  issues within an acceptable  timeframe. We have also  established a process to  escalate issues to management  when required, including a line  of communication to Group  Office. Securing Customer Information  Data protection and  cybersecurity  In providing our products and  services, we ask our customers,  employees and business  partners to trust us with a  range of sensitive information.  To ensure we safeguard that  information, AIA has in place a  Group Data Privacy Compliance  Policy to ensure adequate  safeguards for our customer  and business data as well as  compliance with data protection  legislation. This policy is  communicated via classroom  sessions and e-learning to  employees at Group Office  and is regularly reinforced  through refresher training and  awareness activities focusing  on topics such as proper data  handling, breach reporting  and phishing. All employees  and agents are required to  safeguard customers personal  information and are prohibited  from disclosing customer  information to unauthorised  parties. AIA is committed to protecting  the interests of our customers,  partners, employees and  stakeholders, ensuring high  standards of information  security. AIAs Group  Information Security Policy  is consistent with industry- leading standards to ensure  that our systems, processes and  information are secure.  Our Group Chief Technology  Officer and a dedicated  information security team  oversee the quality and  consistency of technology risk  management and cybersecurity  across the Group. The team  maintains a focus on protecting  AIA from cyber threats by  detecting any anomalies,  effectively responding to  cybersecurity issues, enhancing  defensive controls and investing  in security analytics. This  includes focusing on our key  systems that process our  customer data as well as key  supporting business processes.  All cybersecurity issues are  handled by the Director of  Information Security, who  reports directly to the Head of  Group Technology Governance.  We also partner with leading  information security service  providers to provide further  capability to ensure a secure  operational environment.  AIA safeguards its critical  assets from cyber threats  using classification and threat  modelling techniques.  AIA believes that cybersecurity  is the responsibility of every  employee. Therefore, we  educate our employees about  how to protect themselves  and AIA from cyber threats  through web-based awareness  and readiness training and  conducting regular cyber- defence assessments including  incident management drills.  In 2020, AIA continued  to maintain ISO 27001  certification for our identity  access management and  cybersecurity operations  services on our security  controls, including our data  security and encryption  standards. AIA also  commissioned an independent  external assessor to conduct  a high-level review on our  cybersecurity controls and  processes performance  against the National Institute  of Standards and Technology  of the United States (NIST)  standards. AIA also continues to invest  in Information Technology  safeguards, including in  the areas of Cloud Security,  Data Protection and Mobile  Application Security, to ensure  sufficient operational controls  which meet our information  security objectives. In addition,  all cloud services providers  we engage must adhere to our  Cryptography Standard.

For  example, procedural controls  and information safeguards  are built into our iPoS and  interactive Mobile Office (iMO)  systems that have been adopted  by our insurance agents in  their sales processes and  broader day-to-day operations.  These safeguards include user  authentication and secure  storage of customer data.  Third-party assessments  AIA reviews the data security  standards of our third-party  vendors through our Third-party  Security Assessment process.  This regularly assesses a broad  range of security controls of  our vendors, including data  security and encryption, against  ISO27001 and NIST standards.  AIA also conducts privacy impact  assessments to avoid or minimise  adverse impacts on data privacy  and to ensure appropriate  safeguards are in place.  All access to customer data is  subject to appropriate approvals  and granted on a need-to-know  basis, with recertification to  confirm it remains correct. Finally, AIA also has insurance  coverage to protect the  organisation against cyber- security related events and  incidents. Supply Chain Management We work with many different  product and service providers  across our business.  Sustainability is a key element  of our supply chain as  summarised in our Supplier  Code of Conduct (Supplier  Code). The Supplier Code was  developed to complement  the Code. It applies to all of  our suppliers and references  international conventions  such as the UN Declaration on  Human Rights. The Supplier  Code encourages sound ESG  practices among our suppliers  and a general culture of  integrity in all matters. AIA  also considers a suppliers  sustainability performance  during supplier selection,  requesting information on  environmental policies and  employee information among  others.  As a Group, we work with  suppliers that demonstrate  sound practice in regard to  their ESG performance. We  may conduct supplier and  third-party assessments where  necessary.

The section below builds on  the Groups first TCFD report,  published last year and outlines  our contributions and progress  against each of the four pillars  of the TCFD recommendations. Governance of  Climate Change  Risks and  Impacts  Board-level Governance  At AIA, the Board retains  ultimate responsibility for the  oversight of the Groups risk  management activities and  monitors material group-wide  risks, whether they are common  to our industry or unique to  the Group and its businesses.  The Board is supported by the  BRC, comprised of select Board  members and chaired by an  Independent Non-executive  Director, as well as the ORC  and FRC which are comprised  of our senior executives. AIAs  RMF ensures that we have the  capabilities and processes  in place to identify, quantify,  underwrite and manage and  report risk. The Board is  responsible for reviewing this  framework to ensure that it is  sufficiently effective given the  Groups business environment  and context.   In addition, boards of directors  of our business units play a  similar role to ensure that  the local risk framework is  appropriately tailored to the  local business and environment. We address ESG-related risks  according to the process  outlined in the RMF and  categorise them based on  the nature of the risk to our  operations. The physical  impacts of climate change,  including flooding, or damage  to facilities have immediate  operational impacts and are  treated as operational risks.  Long-term challenges, such  as emerging ESG issues, may  be discussed by the BRC,  ORC, FRC, or the Groups ESG  Committee.  Management-level  Governance  The Groups ESG Committee  provides effective governance  for integrating and addressing  ESG issues, including climate  change, within our business.  The ESG Committee is  comprised of members of the  Group Executive Committee,  with representation from an  Independent Non-executive  Director of the Board. The  Committee meets on at least  a quarterly basis and plays  an integral role in overseeing  the Companys ESG Strategy,  policies and disclosure,  including reporting to the Board  on a biannual basis.  The ESG Committee also  considers ESG research,  feedback raised by key  stakeholders including  institutional shareholders and  reports by rating agencies and  provides input on material ESG  issues relevant to the Group. In 2020, feedback on climate  change was discussed by the  ESG Committee at all four  meetings, with key outcomes  and feedback formulated  and raised to the Board. This  included approval of the Groups  ESG Strategy.  On a day-to-day basis, AIAs  ESG team works closely with  the Group Investment function,  working to develop consistent  and enhanced approaches to  addressing climate risk issues  with the Groups analysts. The  team also coordinates with the  Groups Risk function on ESG  matters, including on climate  change, both at its Group office  and local business units.  Strategy The WHO raises climate  change as the greatest threat  to human health this century.  Our strategic approach to  addressing both the risks and  opportunities from climate  change is outlined below.  Climate change risk forms  part of our overall insurance  risk profile through its role in  increasing the frequency and  intensity of certain diseases,  and the health and mortality  impacts resulting from natural  disasters. We assess the overall  level of insurance risk by taking  into consideration a range of  diverse risk factors across the  many categories in our product  range. This diversity of risk  2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PAGE 81 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 OUR TCFD REPORT  Governance of  Climate Change  Risks and Impacts Strategy Physical Climate  Risks Transition  Climate-related  Risks Risk Management Metrics and  Targets PAGE 82 OUR TCFD REPORT combined with our reinsurance  programme and broad  geographic footprint helps us  to distribute risk and provide  protection against the impacts  of short-term climate change  effects.  Physical Climate  Risks  The physical risks of climate  change can be far-reaching  and affect the quality of life  for communities across the  countries where we operate.  Research shows that storm  surge, drought, and rising  sea levels are likely to pose  significant disruptions to  communities across the region  over the long-term, affecting  economic output and economic  productivity. As a life and health  insurer, the physical impacts  of climate change posed do  not impact AIA in the same  immediate manner as the  property and casualty sector.  Instead, AIA is more likely to be  impacted by these challenges  over the long-term.  Through our insurance and  investments solutions AIA plays  an important role in helping  communities adapt and achieve  resilience against the health  impacts of inclement weather  and climate-related diseases.  Rising temperatures and  increased precipitation are  likely to result in a greater  prevalence of vector-borne  and respiratory illnesses, heart  disease, and increases in heat- related morbidity and mortality.  For example, dengue fever  is a climate-related disease  and Aedes mosquitoes are its  vector. Since 1950, vectorial  capacity, which is the potential  for disease transmission, has  increased between 8.9 and 15  per cent for different strains  of the virus16. Through our  health insurance products, AIA  offers cover against dengue  in markets such as Singapore  where this is a growing concern.  Transition  Climate-related  Risks  Transition risks posed by  climate change include  increased regulation and  related financial obligations  such as the imposition of  carbon taxes, increased  disclosure, and more stringent  environmental risk management  that affect both our business  and those of the companies  that we invest in. Such risks  are likely to present more short  term impacts to companies  within our investment portfolio.  2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PAGE 82 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 OUR TCFD REPORT 0 -5 5 10 15 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020    %  DENGUE (GLOBAL): 0 -5 5 10 15 AEDES AEGYPTI AEDES ALBOPICTUS 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 CHANGE IN VECTORIAL CAPACITY VIBRIO BACTERIA (GLOBAL) 16 16 The Lancet 2020  Governance of  Climate Change  Risks and Impacts Strategy Physical Climate  Risks Transition  Climate-related  Risks Risk Management Metrics and  Targets PAGE 83 OUR TCFD REPORT Responding to environmental  challenges  Communities in Australia have experienced an increase in extreme  weather events and the 2019-2020 bushfire season was significantly  worse than previous years17. More than 33 people lost their lives, at least  11 million hectares of bush, forest and parks burned, and an estimated  3 billion animals were killed or displaced by the fires18.  AIA Australia supported affected customers with immediate, short-term  and long-term support. We provided tailored support to help customers  in bushfire areas to meet their immediate needs, including accessing  support services, accommodation, applying for government disaster  grants, accessing financial counselling and mental health support.   Life insurance policyholders impacted by the bushfires, including  those involved in fighting the fires, could apply for a premium waiver  for all benefits for six months. To reduce the stress on customers, AIA  also replaced lost policy documents without added cost. To alleviate a  distressing situation, we expedited and prioritised decisions on claims  for people in bushfire-affected regions to ensure people received timely  support. Devastating natural disasters can be traumatic, and many people  may struggle with mental health later. AIAs rehabilitation team also  developed new disaster recovery components for our well-being  programmes tailored to those impacted by the bushfires. Our Green Products AIA Company (Trustee)  Limited has long understood  the importance of positive  environmental stewardship in  generating financial return, and  options that take into account  both environmental ratings  and financial performance of  companies are available to our  MPF customers. In select markets, as part of our  unit linked investment products,  our customers are also able  to choose options associated  with renewable energy and/or  healthcare. 17 Australias 2019-2020 Bushfires: The Wildlife Toll, World Wide Fund for Nature  18 Australias fires killed or harmed three billion animals.

Identifying and assessing  climate risks AIAs risk governance  framework is built on the  Three Lines of Defence model  which clearly defines roles  and responsibilities for the  management of risk between  Executive Management  in the First Line, Risk and  Compliance in the Second  Line, and Internal Audit in the  Third Line. The Group and  business unit risk teams place  reliance on and work closely  with their respective first line  partners in ensuring ESG- related risks are anticipated  and managed. It is important  to note that all pertinent and  material risk exposures are  escalated for resolution to our  risk committees, regardless of  the ownership over any specific  ESG issue.  As previously discussed,  longer term ESG issues such  as pollution and lifestyle risk  factors primarily impact the  health and well-being of people  across our markets and thus are  viewed as insurance risks given  the impact they potentially  pose. The above examples of  ESG-related risks are managed  by our risk teams and are  discussed by the BRC, executive  risk committees, or the ESG  Committee as appropriate. Climate change impacts are  discussed within the Groups  ESG team, and collaboratively  with the Group Investment  and Risk functions. AIA  also regularly participates  in industry discussions on  environmental topics and is  a member of the Hong Kong  Green Finance Association.  AIA also regularly considers  academic research on climate  change. In 2017, research  funded by the UK Medical  Research Council outlined  potential impacts to morbidity  from climate change-related  temperature increases. The  research presented two  scenarios; a business-as-usual  carbon emission trajectory,  and those in adherence to the  Paris Agreement. AIA continues  to consider such research  and looks forward to further  guidance from regulators on  how such scenario analysis  should be meaningfully  conducted and has actively  contributed to consultations on  the topic with our regulators. II. Climate impacts and  strategies within our  investment portfolio Increasing transitional and  physical risks could affect  companies in our investment  portfolio, with research  indicating far-reaching impacts  from scenarios with 1.5C and  2C increases in temperatures.  As discussed in the Sustainable  Investment section of this  Report, consideration of climate  change, in addition to other ESG  factors, is mandated within our  investment process. AIA continues to engage  with businesses on raising  awareness of these risk issues,  and encouraging them to  address these in a transparent  way, thereby contributing in  the transition to a low carbon  economy. We also monitor  investment opportunities across  our markets in the transition  to a low carbon and climate  resilient future, supporting our  communities to achieve their  environmental targets and  objectives. 2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PAGE 84 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 OUR TCFD REPORT  Governance of  Climate Change  Risks and Impacts Strategy Physical Climate  Risks Transition  Climate-related  Risks Risk Management Metrics and  Targets PAGE 85 OUR TCFD REPORT Climate  Engagements  Regulators across Asia continue  to raise awareness of climate  change, introducing disclosure  requirements in regard to  carbon and energy footprinting.  However, there remain gaps in  understanding how such climate  risks may impact a companys  operations, the value of its assets  and profits.  AIA is devising ways to address  and mitigate the risk of stranded  assets in its portfolio. A  stranded asset may lose value  prematurely, either directly as a  result of climate impacts or as  a result of the broader energy  transition. As a responsible asset owner, we  also continue to raise awareness  of these issues with internal and  external stakeholders regionally.  Starting in 2019 through to early  2020, AIA engaged with over  1,400 companies in the Groups  investment portfolio to assess  how they address climate change  risks, including their awareness  of climate impacts, and any  initiatives to monitor and reduce  their environmental footprint.  Our goal was to provide insights  into the level of disclosure and  preparedness in addressing  climate change across asset classes,  from both a sectoral and regional  perspective.  Methodology  Investee companies completed a  questionnaire that formed the basis  for a subsequent scoring by the  Groups investment analysts. These  analysts used a scoring methodology  developed according to the guidance  provided by Transition Pathway  Initiative (TPI), a global, asset- owner led initiative which assesses  companies preparedness in  addressing physical and transitional  risks in the shift toward a low carbon  economy.  From the pool of companies  assessed, more than 1,200  companies were scored across 11  markets: Hong Kong, Singapore,  Mainland China, Malaysia, Indonesia,  the Philippines, Thailand, Australia,  Vietnam, South Korea and Taiwan  (China). These markets were  selected in consideration of the  Groups investment exposure and  considering the potential impact  posed by climate change to these  locations. Companies were scored on  a five point scale, where 0 indicated  no awareness by the investee  company of climate change  and environmental risks, and  4 where a company reported  a robust process for managing  climate issues. The scores  were based on each companys  disclosure to the survey and  response to environmental risks,  and not actual emissions or  environmental impact.  With the majority of the Groups  investment portfolio allocated  to sovereign bonds, this exercise  covered the Groups exposure  to both corporate bonds and  equities.  Additional due diligence was  conducted by the Groups  ESG team and Investment  function on select companies,  in consideration of investment  exposure, sector and region.  Results Leading Regions  The strongest overall climate  risk disclosure and awareness  was in Australia, with the market  noting the highest response rate  among companies surveyed.  After Australia, companies  across Singapore demonstrated  a strong understanding and  preparedness in addressing  climate risk issues, followed by  Hong Kong.  Large disparities remained  across South East Asia, with  leading listed companies  demonstrating a much stronger  understanding of the impacts  of climate risk issues on their  operations, in comparison  to small and medium-sized  enterprises (SMEs). This  raises concerns on the level of  preparedness among SMEs to  assess and address the impacts  of climate change on their  business.  2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PAGE 85 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 OUR TCFD REPORT  Governance of  Climate Change  Risks and Impacts Strategy Physical Climate  Risks Transition  Climate-related  Risks Risk Management Metrics and  Targets PAGE 86 OUR TCFD REPORT Companies in the financial  services sector reported the  lowest levels of awareness, with  limited disclosure and integration  of climate risks in most markets.  This was surprising given the  growing interest in disclosure  structures such as the TCFD and  the potential losses to companies  in financial services from climate  change. Exceptions to this trend  were Australian financials, driven  by local stakeholder interest in  climate change disclosure.  Other sectors, including the oil  and gas sector, demonstrated  a stronger understanding  of climate risk issues, likely  AVERAGE SCORES BY SECTOR ACROSS  THE 11 MARKETS SELECTED:  Financials  (score: 1.97) Utilities  (score: 2.03) Real Estate (score: 2.64) Industrials  (score: 1.93) Oil and Gas  (score: 2.63) due to stakeholder interest and  growing scrutiny of the climate  performance of these sectors. The  real estate sector also demonstrated  strong knowledge of climate risks,  particularly in markets such as  Singapore and Hong Kong, where  real estate companies were notable  sustainability leaders.  AIA also continues to recommend  that sustainability teams within  companies engage with key  functions such as investor relations  and finance, to educate stakeholders  on the impact of ESG issues, while  integrating ESG considerations  within the business.  AIA intends to build upon the  results of this analysis with  investee companies and seeks  to devise a proposed action  plan, through engagement and  where determined by AIA to be  appropriate, adjustment of our  exposure based on these results.  Through regulatory guidance  and international practice, AIA  also aims to further assess and  continue to conduct scenario  analysis of its investment  portfolio to different warming  scenarios. 2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PAGE 86 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 OUR TCFD REPORT  Governance of  Climate Change  Risks and Impacts Strategy Physical Climate  Risks Transition  Climate-related  Risks Risk Management Metrics and  Targets PAGE 87 OUR TCFD REPORT Total GHG Emissions per Scope (in tonnes of CO2e)  C02e tonnes 2020 2019 2018 2017 Scope 119 2,167 3,640 4,149 4,935 Scope 220  38,029 45,263 43,016 45,519 Scope 321  2,354 10,846 8,596 7,388 Total GHG Emissions   42,550 59,749 55,761 57,842 Total GHG Emissions Intensity per employee (scope 1, 2 and 3)   1.8 2.6 2.7 2.9 Metrics and Targets   Energy and Emissions In 2020, the Group produced  42,550 tonnes of CO2e, or  1.8 tonnes per employee. The  decrease in our overall footprint  this year was due to reduced  operations at our offices and  business travel due to COVID-19.  Total energy consumption  across the Group was  71,651,432 kWh, amounting to  3,062 kWh per person.  AIA has committed to a 25  per cent emission reduction  target per person by 2030 with  2017 as a base year. The target  applies to Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions. AIA will continue to  report on our progress against  environmental targets as  employees across our business  units resume business travel  and return to our office spaces. AIA will also continue to monitor  our environmental footprint, and  implement energy efficiency  measures, where applicable,  throughout our business. The largest contributor to  our operational footprint is  the electricity we use in our  buildings, which contributes to  our Scope 2 emission footprint  of 38,029 tonnes.  Other sources of emissions  include those from our  corporate vehicle fleet and  business travel.  Please also refer to the  Sustainable Investment section  of this Report for further detail  on how AIA carbon footprints its  investment portfolio.  19 Emissions from the fuel burnt by our corporate vehicle fleet, private air travel, generators and corporate kitchens. Scope 1  emissions include all markets where AIA has operational control.  20 Emissions produced as a result of the electricity used across the markets and the Towngas used in Hong Kong. Scope 2  emissions include all AIA markets where AIA has operational control. 21 Emissions produced indirectly from commercial business travel by airplane.

We identify emission factors  on electricity consumption for  each operating region via the  sustainability reports of utility  companies, or the Greenhouse  Gas Protocol database and  the List of Emission Factors  published by the Institute  for Global Environmental  Strategies.  AIA relies on third-party data  where this is available, with  business travel emissions data  for Group Office and AIA Hong  Kong provided directly by  our travel agent. At our other  markets where this data is not  available, such as AIA Malaysia,  AIA Singapore, and AIA  Thailand, we refer to the Carbon  Neutral Calculator for Short  – Medium haul flights by the  United Kingdoms Department  for Environment, Food, and  Rural Affairs (DEFRA) emission  factors.  Emissions from any private air  travel are calculated according  to the recommended practice of  the International Air Transport  Association (IATA). AIA also  refers to the Fifth Assessment  Report from the International  Panel on Climate Change,  in reference to any Global  Warming Potential (GWP)  factors used. 2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PAGE 88 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 OUR TCFD REPORT  PAGE 89 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 PAGE 89 2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX FEEDBACK FEEDBACK Feedback Thank you for your interest in this Report.

Inherent Limitations  The absence of a significant  body of established practice  on which to draw to evaluate  and measure non-financial  information allows for different,  but acceptable, measures  and measurement techniques  and can affect comparability  between entities. In addition,  GHG quantification is subject to  inherent uncertainty because  of incomplete scientific  knowledge used to determine  emission factors and the values  needed to combine emissions of  different gases. Our Independence and Quality  Control  We have complied with the  independence and other  ethical requirements of the  Code of Ethics for Professional  Accountants issued by the  International Ethics Standards  Board for Accountants, which  is founded on fundamental  principles of integrity,  objectivity, professional  competence and due care,  confidentiality and professional  behaviour.   Our firm applies International  Standard on Quality Control  1 and accordingly maintains  a comprehensive system  of quality control including  documented policies and  procedures regarding  compliance with ethical  requirements, professional  standards and applicable legal  and regulatory requirements. Our Responsibility  Our responsibility is to express  a limited assurance conclusion  on the Identified Sustainability  Information based on the  procedures we have performed  and the evidence we have  obtained. We conducted our  limited assurance engagement  in accordance with the  International Standard on  Assurance Engagements  3000 (Revised), Assurance  Engagements other than  Audits or Reviews of Historical  Financial Information, and,  in respect of greenhouse  gas emissions, International  Standard on Assurance  Engagements 3410, Assurance  Engagements on Greenhouse  Gas Statements, issued by  the International Auditing and  Assurance Standards Board.  These standards require that  we plan and perform this  engagement to obtain limited  assurance about whether  the Identified Sustainability  Information is free from  material misstatement.  A limited assurance  engagement involves  assessing the suitability in  the circumstances of the  Companys use of the Criteria  as the basis for the preparation  of the Identified Sustainability  Information, assessing the  risks of material misstatement  of the Identified Sustainability  Information whether due to  fraud or error, responding  to the assessed risks as  necessary in the circumstances,  and evaluating the overall  presentation of the Identified  Sustainability Information. A  limited assurance engagement  is substantially less in scope  than a reasonable assurance  engagement in relation to both  the risk assessment procedures,  including an understanding  of internal control, and the  procedures performed in  response to the assessed risks.  The procedures we performed  were based on our professional  judgement and included  inquiries, observation of  processes performed,  inspection of documents,  analytical procedures,  evaluating the appropriateness  The maintenance and integrity of the AIA Group Limited website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by  the assurance provider does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the assurance provider accepts no  responsibility for any differences between the Identified Sustainability Information of AIA Group Limited on which the assurance  report was issued or the assurance report that was issued and the information presented on the website.  GRI AND HKSE GUIDE CONTENT INDEX 2020 ESG    AT-A-GLANCE CHAIRMANS  STATEMENT STATEMENT FROM  GROUP CHIEF  EXECUTIVE AND  PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS  REPORT HEALTH AND  WELLNESS GREEN  OPERATIONS SUSTAINABLE  INVESTMENT PEOPLE AND  CULTURE EFFECTIVE  GOVERNANCE OUR TCFD REPORT FEEDBACK GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX GRI and HKSE Guide  Content Index GRI and HKSE Guide  Commentary Table  Independent  Practitioners  Limited Assurance  Report PAGE 107 GRI AND HKSE  GUIDE CONTENT  INDEX PAGE 107 AIA GROUP LIMITED   |   Environmental, Social and Governance Report 2020 of quantification methods and  reporting policies, and agreeing  or reconciling with underlying  records.  Given the circumstances of the  engagement, in performing the  procedures listed above we:  made inquiries of the  persons responsible for the  Identified Sustainability  Information;  understood the process for  collecting and reporting  the Identified Sustainability  Information;  performed limited  substantive testing on  a selective basis of the  Identified Sustainability  Information to check that  data had been appropriately  recorded, calculated and  reported; and  considered the disclosure  and presentation of the  Identified Sustainability  Information. The procedures performed in a  limited assurance engagement  vary in nature and timing from,  and are less in extent than  for, a reasonable assurance  engagement. Consequently,  the level of assurance obtained  in a limited assurance  engagement is substantially  lower than the assurance that  would have been obtained had  we performed a reasonable  assurance engagement.  Accordingly, we do not express  a reasonable assurance opinion  about whether the Companys  Identified Sustainability  Information has been prepared,  in all material respects, in  accordance with the Criteria. Limited Assurance Conclusion  Based on the procedures  we have performed and the  evidence we have obtained,  nothing has come to our  attention that causes us to  believe that the Companys  Identified Sustainability  Information for the twelve- month period from 1 January  2020 to 31 December 2020 is  not prepared, in all material  respects, in accordance with  the Criteria.  Our report has been prepared  for and only for the Company to  include in the ESG report and  may not be suitable for another  purpose. We do not assume  responsibility towards or accept  liability to any other person for  the contents of this report.
