Any other fiscal  years would be referred to similarly) This report also includes information obtained after this  reporting period. Scope of Report NEC Corporation and its Consolidated Subsidiaries Editorial Policy NEC has published integrated annual reports containing both financial and non-financial information since 2013. This year,  having defined its materiality in July 2018 in line with the Mid-term Management Plan 2020, NEC has changed the name of the  report to the Integrated Report.  The Integrated Report 2018 comprises four chapters respectively entitled Business Strategy and Vision, Business Activities,  Management Foundation, and Corporate Data.    Business Strategy and Vision describes the newly formulated the Mid-term Management Plan 2020 and priority themes from  an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) perspective, or materiality. Business Activities includes a message from the CFO  along with an overview from each of our segments and an introduction of our international business execution structure.  Management Foundation introduces the Companys initiatives in support of sustainable management, such as corporate  governance and environmental management promotion.   NEC will keep endeavoring to provide increasingly transparent and continuous information while incorporating feedback from  institutional investors and various other stakeholders.

This approach has been passed  down\tto\tus\tin\tthe\tNEC\tWay,\twhich\tencapsulates\tthe\tNEC\tGroups\t management philosophy, vision and business framework. The NEC  Way guides all of us at NEC. Meanwhile, the value that customers and society expect from us is  constantly changing. Up until now, our technologies and products  have been a sufficient source of value, but customers and society are  now requiring increasingly diverse sources of value. To remain an  essential company in the eyes of society in the years to come, we  must create new value by constantly keeping our finger on the pulse  of what it consists of.  To express this resolution both internally and externally, we  adopted Orchestrating a brighter world as our Brand Statement in  2014.\tThis\tBrand\tStatement\treflects\tNECs\tdetermination\tto\trealize\t bright, hope-filled societies and ways of life. As a leading integrator  that possesses both computing and network technologies who  The Mid-term Management Plan 2018 covered the three years from  fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2019. Under this plan, we worked to transform NEC  into a social value innovator through reorganization of our profit  structure and getting back on the track to growth. In our efforts in  reorganizing the profit structure, we have made steady overall progress  through to fiscal 2018; however, with getting back on the track to  growth, significant underperformance in our existing businesses, which  were meant to support the Company over the short term, left us unable  to realize our operating profit target of 150.0 billion. In light of this  situation, we revised our targets before the completion of the plan and  formulated a new mid-term management plan in January 2018. combines them with diverse knowledge and ideas in collaboration  with people around the world, this is our aim. As a social value  innovator, we will continue to provide value in the form of safety,  security, efficiency and equality, which are prerequisites for all  people, and an abundant society by leveraging our strengths. This is  our approach to sustainability and our vision for the Company. In 2005, NEC became a signatory to the United Nations Global  Compact (UNGC), a global initiative aimed at sustainable growth for  society and companies. In our corporate activities we now observe  the\tcompacts\t10\tprinciples\tpertaining\tto\tthe\tfields\tof\thuman\trights,\t labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. As part of efforts in  Orchestrating a brighter world, I am confident that NEC can also  contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) adopted by the UN in 2015.   In addition, with the formulation of the Mid-term Management  Plan 2020, NEC has defined its materialityâ€”priority management  themes from an ESG perspective. This outlines the approach to social  value creation that we have practiced since our foundation and  connects our business strategies with ESG initiatives as a new  declaration to our various stakeholders of our commitment to  achieving the mutual growth of NEC and society.

How can we become a  company that tackles its own targets quickly and carries them out to  completion?

The root cause of these  issues is the absence of a culture of commitment as well as a lack of  well-defined consequences or rewards at NEC.

I am  deeply aware of my responsibility in this regard as CEO.  rapidly to changes in global society and leverage our capabilities to  the fullest.  I have been highlighting that NEC needs to change for some time.  However, while we may recognize the necessity, when we set about  making changes, we come up against obstacles and find ourselves at  an impasse. I think this is because we have tried to transform by our  own efforts alone. This time, I will make use of external powers as  well in order to execute changes thoroughly.  we must discern what is truly necessary, be prepared to break from  our conventional ways of thinking, and drive transformation that will  restore\tNECs\tstrength. Issues Facing NEC Overcoming Issues Requires a Cultural Transformation My Commitment as CEO The Mid-term Management Plan 2020 has set the following mid-term  targets as a level to be achieved in order to be a sustainable company:  revenue of 3,000.0 billion, operating profit of 150.0 billion (5%  operating profit  ratio), net profit attributable to owners of the parent  of 90.0 billion, free cash flow of 100.0 billion, and ROE of 10%.  To realize these targets, we have established three mid-term  management policies: reform of profit structure, achievement of  growth, and restructuring of execution capabilities. Main Points of the Mid-term Management Plan 2020 05 06 NEC Corporation   Integrated Report 2018 NEC Corporation   Integrated Report 2018  Telecom Carrier Enterprise Public Business applications/ Data analysis Added-value services Optimized network Overview of the Mid-term Management Plan 2020 2  Achievement of Growth To achieve growth, NEC will focus on two areas based on its strengths in  artificial intelligence (AI), biometrics, security, and network services.  The first area is NEC Safer Cities. Here, we will expand the  development of platforms that enable people to live abundantly in  and outside of Japan, including public safety, digital government,  and smart transportation.  For the reform of profit structure, we will take steps to fundamentally  reform our profit structure, including reduction of fixed costs, in order  to carry out investments needed to get back on the track to growth.  Through three reforms targeting selling, general and administrative  (SG&A) expenses, business structure, and our production system, we  will create a structure capable of succeeding globally.  With regard to SG&A expenses, in fiscal 2019 we will carry out  structural reforms targeting 3,000 personnel working in back office  functions and the hardware business in Japan. We will look to  streamline fixed property, IT, and marketing costs, aiming to bring  the SG&A expense ratio down to 20% or less, and we will work to  improve the profit structure so that we can continue the necessary  investments required to transform our business model.  With regard to our business structure, we will resolutely  implement reforms to improve profitability in the Telecom Carrier  business*1 and the Energy business. In the Energy business, we have  made the decision to sell the electrode business and to discontinue  development and production of small-scale storage batteries. We  aim to achieve growth by concentrating our previously multi- directional operations anew in the energy system integration (SI)  business centered on NEC Energy Solutions, Inc.   The Telecom Carrier business is facing extremely rapid market  changes, which have dramatically reshaped the state of the business  up to now. First, in the network infrastructure area, we will strive to  improve profitability. In Japan, we will optimize resources in  accordance with revenue scale, while internationally we will look at  withdrawing from and scaling-down low-profit businesses.  Meanwhile, the software and services area will be strengthened as a  growth area. In Japan, we will accelerate the shifting of skills and  partnering\tin\torder\tto\tadapt\tto\tchanges\tin\tour\tcustomers\t investments and expand our provision of services to telecom carriers.  We will also grasp diversifying network needs and accelerate our  business development for non-telecom carriers. Outside of Japan, we  will position software and services as a key area and expand our  business, revising our strategy and business structure and setting our  strong TOMS*2 business as a core driver.  The second is NEC Value Chain Innovation. In this area, we will work  on initiatives for the formation of sustainable smart supply chains. We  will promote initiatives for realizing food supply and demand  optimization, cashless transactions, non-stop factories and plants, as  well as the provision of technologies such as AI, IoT, and networks.  By focusing on these two areas, NEC aims to achieve revenues of  3,000 billion in fiscal 2021. Looking at revenues in Japan and  internationally, we expect most of the increase from fiscal 2018 to  fiscal 2021 to be realized outside of Japan, with domestic revenues  remaining stable over this period. This projection is based on an  expectation of growth opportunities in Japan related to  infrastructure preparation for the Olympic and Paralympic Games  Tokyo 2020 and digital government, offset by an expected  contraction of our existing businesses.  Meanwhile, in our global domain, we plan to grow revenues  mainly in the safety business, expanding the business domain from  areas such as criminal investigation and immigration control to  include administrative platforms and citizen services, among others.  To accelerate growth in the global domain, we acquired U.K. company  Northgate Public Services Limited in January 2018 and we will  actively continue to pursue M&As in this vein.  To achieve rapid growth, NEC shifted to a dedicated operating  structure for its global business in April 2018 and appointed external  personnel with abundant global business experience and  performance history to take charge. Through this appointment, we  seek to examine whether our approach to date has been on the right  path, and to drive our transformation from a wider perspective,  giving consideration to how we might overcome the obstacles that  have defied our efforts up to now.

Specifically, we will seek to strengthen business  development capabilities and build an organization with the capacity  to carry out actions to completion. In strengthening our business  development capabilities, we will break away from the closed  innovation mindset to promote solutions development via  co-creation with our customers and business partners, aiming to  create new social value beyond existing frameworks. This approach is  aimed\tat\taddressing\tNECs\texisting\ttask\tof\tanticipating\tcustomer\t needs and accelerating monetization of competitive technologies.  In our effort to break away from the close innovation mindset, we  have already seen results from initiatives such as open research and  solution development, incubation through diverse schemes, and  software product delivery services. In April 2018, we announced the  establishment of dotData, Inc. in the U.S. to develop and sell software  that automates data science processes using AI in the field of big  data utilization, and analytic work that requires large amounts of  time to process manually.  With regard to solutions development via co-creation, we will  step up our initiatives by expanding our bases for co-creation and  trials in Japan and Singapore into other regions. In June 2018, we  announced the establishment of NEC X, Inc. in the U.S. to serve as  an incubator for accelerating the commercialization of our core  technologies. NEC X, Inc. aims to create an ecosystem centered on  the\tadvanced\ttechnologies\tof\tNECs\ttalent\tand\tresearch\t laboratories and to accelerate new business development through  open innovation.   In addition, we will strengthen our relations with governments,  international institutions, and standardization bodies with a view to  creating new social value as we strive to anticipate the future needs  of society and our customers.  In order to realize an organization with the capacity to carry out  actions to completion, we will introduce structures to allow us to  complete execution quickly while enabling employees to maximize  their\tcapabilities,\tthereby\tenhancing\tNECs\texecution\tcapability. Specifically,\twe\twill\tdefine\tmanagements\tresponsibilities\tand\t authority more clearly to strengthen their commitment to results. We  will also introduce a new evaluation and compensation system for  rewarding those who take action and actively hire and appoint  human resources with diverse skills into executive and other  positions. These measures will enhance our execution capability  while firmly establishing a culture that encourages innovative actions  and challenges.  To realize these initiatives, in April 2018 we launched the NEC Group  Culture Transformation Division, appointing a professional from  outside NEC to execute human resource system and culture reforms.

This is another reason why we  must first complete the reform of profit structure in fiscal 2019, as it  is the first step towards getting back on the track to growth.  actively share my ideas about the transformation with them. I have  therefore instituted dialogue sessions where I can personally share  my ideas with NEC Group employees, and I will continue to hold  these sessions going forward.  Now is the time when NEC must make dramatic changes if it is to  be regarded by society as a sustainable company. We are  determined to break from our conventional ways of thinking,  discern what is really necessary, and drive a transformation that will  restore\tNECs\tstrength.

In formulating our Mid-term Management Plan 2020, we  identified materiality comprising of new priority management themes for sustainable management from  environmental, social, and governance (ESG) perspectives in order to connect our non-financial initiatives more closely  with our business strategies so that they can be translated into growth not only for NEC but for society. NEC identified  candidate themes making reference to global megatrends, the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and other items  that the Company is observing to achieve its goal of Orchestrating a brighter world. We then conducted dialogues with  external experts in the fields of sustainable management, civil society, and medium- to long-term investment, to  determine themes with a strong awareness of connecting them to our mid-term management plan. By working through  a PDCA cycle for the mid-term management plan, we will check on the progress of our initiatives as we move forward.  Priority Management Themes from an ESG Perspective   Support NEC's Growth, Society's Development and Maximize Value We identified nine priority management themes based on issues that have a powerful  impact on both NEC and society, arranging them in three layers.   1  Sustainable Growth Enablers   We will engage on these themes to minimize risks to NEC and society,   and to maximize the social value that NEC generates. 2  Engines of Change   We will engage in these themes as engines for maximizing   economic value and social value as well as minimizing risks to   NEC and society. 3  2020 Growth Focus to Create Social Value   The growth areas of the Mid-term Management Plan 2020 are   defined as the themes that management should place   priority on from ESG perspectives.

NEC will contribute to realizing safe, secure, efficient and fair cities where  individuals can exhibit their potential to the full and live better lives, by utilizing  cutting-edge technology such as biometric authentication, AI, and the IoT. For example, by having a wider range of our customers use NEC  products and services such as biometric authentication solutions and  AI-based\tcrime/disaster-prevention\tsystems\tand\tproviding\tthese\tto\ta\t larger number of organizations, NEC will ensure that the social value  we provide will be amplified in terms of both quantity and quality. For fiscal 2021, NEC will focus on expansion of our international  sales and aims to increase our international sales to 200 billion. NEC Value Chain Innovation Our society faces various kinds of social issues, such as food waste, labor shortages,  changes in consumption patterns, and diversifying threats. NEC will develop cutting- edge technologies and promote co-creation with customers in order to connect people,  goods, and processes, reaching across the boundaries between enterprises and  industries to create new value. In doing so, NEC will support a more sustainable planet,  sustainable growth for companies, a society where people can live in abundance, and a  brighter world for the future. For example, NEC aims to amplify the social value we provide by  developing and supplying larger numbers of services, such as  promoting NEC Value Chain Innovation, which aims to optimize the  demand-and-supply balance. For fiscal 2021, we have set out a goal of expanding our domestic  sales to 85 billion in growth fields including NEC Value Chain  Innovation. Vision for the Company and Non-Financial Indicators NEC Initiatives for Contributing to the Achievement of the SDGs For each of the following nine themes, NEC has established a vision for the Company and non-financial indicators for measuring progress.  Since information and communications technology (ICT) has the potential for responding to a variety of issues, we believe that we can contribute in  various ways to all the goals outlined in the SDGs by engaging in dialogues and co-creation with customers and stakeholders. For example, looking only at the targets among the areas defined as growth fields in the Mid-term Management Plan 2020, NEC Safer Cities and  NEC Value Chain Innovation, there are various SDGs initiatives to which NEC wishes to contribute on its own, namely No. 3, No. 7, No. 8, No. 9, No.  11,\tNo.\t12,\tNo.\t16\tand\tNo.\t17.\tThere\tare\ta\tlarge\tnumber\tof\ttargets\tthat\tcould\tpotentially\tbe\tset\tout\tas\tgoals.

Operating profit improved by  23.0 billion year on year to  53.2 billion, mainly due to  increased revenue. 2018 result 2018 result Review of Operations THREATS  Competition for orders is intensifying, increasing the number of projects  with difficult requirements in cost and delivery. As a result, constant  improvement of quality and cost competitiveness is necessary.  We need a new business structure that can cope with changes in the  market environment, such as a shift in the industry itself with the trend  towards broadcasting via IP and transformation of the viewer rating and  advertising model. STRENGTHS  Strong track record gaining high credibility, advanced technologies in the  process, and high market share in Japan in delivering products and  systems that support social infrastructure â€“ such as systems for  governmental organizations, broadcasters, power companies, as well as in  cyber- security â€“   Ability to propose concepts for customers future based on domain  knowledge, specifically operational expertise and deep understanding of  database construction acquired through many years of working with  customers.   Provision of vertically integrated solutions with the NEC the WISE lineup  of AI technologies, Bio-IDiom biometrics, IT and networks including  security, and full-layer ICT including sensing technology. WEAKNESSES  While there is a high proportion of large-scale projects in Japan, there are  fewer projects which provide regular income streams, such as in services,  leading to exposure to risk from demand volatility.   Additional costs result from the complexity of project management for  large-scale projects and the issues inherent in system development  using cutting-edge technology. These costs can have an impact on  business results.  OPPORTUNITIES   The Japanese governments Digital Government action plan will drive  the creation of a common platform for government, and wider use of the  My Number System is being examined.  Expectations for safe, secure, efficient administration of the Olympic and  Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 and further investment to respond to  increasing number of tourists visiting Japan.  Cyber-attacks pose a growing threat around the world, gaining attention  and increasing demand for reinforcement of systems and monitoring  services for cyber security.  We expect increased investment toward utilization of ICT across a variety of  domains, such as health care and education. Public Business Comprised of Two Areas Public Business â€” SWOT Analysis Public Business In the Public Business, we provide safe, secure and efficient social solutions for governments,  governmental agencies, local governments, public institutions and other organizations by combining  our distinctive technology assets, including network, sensor and analysis technologies, with a broad  expertise in systems integration. Public business consists of Public Solutions, which is responsible for business involving regional sales functions and local governments in Japan,  the Public Infrastructure, which takes charge of business involving government organizations and enterprises supporting national and social  infrastructure. Based on the new organization established in April 2017, the Public Solutions considers both the local needs and the required policy seeds. In  this area NEC works together with regional stakeholders, such as local governments, universities, and businesses, to accelerate the development of  new regional businesses, such as smart cities and utilization of the Social Security and Tax Number System (My Number), and health care. Based on  our many years of achievements gained in supporting government agencies, the Public Infrastructure further improves the social infrastructure we  provide to support a safe and comfortable lifestyle for everyone. 2018 2018 2019 (Forecasts) 2019 (Forecasts) 2017 2017 (Fiscal year ended on March 31) Revenue  Operating Profit, Operating Profit Ratio (Billion ) (Billion )  Operating Profit   Operating Profit Ratio Review of Operations Public Business 25 26 NEC Corporation   Integrated Report 2018 NEC Corporation   Integrated Report 2018  Executive Vice President  Chikara Nakamata Executive Vice President   Kazuhiro Takada Public Solutions Business Japan is facing social issues arising from declining birthrates and aging  population, increasing social security costs, a declining work force, and reduced  spending and economic power. NECs job is to grasp these issues and address  them firmly and create sustainable social value. Using our accumulated  experience, the latest AI and biometrics technologies, and co-creation, we will  tackle these issues as a leader in providing value across industry boundaries. Public Infrastructure Business In this area, NEC supports stable operation of key national infrastructure.  The experience and trust we have cultivated over the years ensure stable  profits in excess of company-wide targets. These profits are continuously  invested in advanced technologies including biometric technologies, such as  facial recognition, and space-related technologies, such as Hayabusa 2. In the environment surrounding the Public Solutions Business,  the market in Japan continues to be brisk, with business model  changes driven, in particular, by AI and IoT developing on a  scale that far exceeds the traditional scope of ICT vendors.  Meanwhile, the traditional ICT market is contracting, and we  need to expand its opportunities in business domains for  solving social issues.   In\tthis\tenvironment,\tthe\tJapanese\tgovernments\tDigital\t Government action plan is promoting a review of government  which itself is predicated on digital technology and with a  focus on increasing convenience for citizens and business  operators. In the government sector and various areas where  the government interacts with the private sector, NEC will help  to realize Digital Government action plan by working to  create highly convenient services from a user perspective by  leveraging the My Number System and biometrics.  In the area of health care, NEC will contribute to dealing with  labor shortages and managing social security costs, for  example by developing an endoscopy diagnosis support  system that uses AI-driven image analysis technology and an  electronic medical record system intended for use with medical  data. In this way, we will help to realize a healthy, long-lived  society where individually tailored, high-quality healthcare and  medical services can be provided to people easily.  In the lead up to the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo  2020, we will ensure safety and security by providing public  safety-related solutions such as biometrics and behavior  detection and analysis, as well as providing wireless networks  for administration use and urban operation centers.  We will focus our efforts on these areas of digital  government, healthcare, and public safety, as we build  infrastructure to support abundant living for people.  We have a duty to support the stable running of mission critical  operations in the field of security using ICT for customers  including governments, governmental agencies, broadcasters  and power companies. By supporting key national  infrastructure over the long term, we will ensure stable  profitability. Under the Mid-term Management Plan 2020, we  will generate stable operating profits in excess of company- wide targets as an earnings base for the whole company.    To further capture earnings, we will undertake a  transformation towards a profitable structure by increasing cost  efficiency, including cost reductions. In the space business,  which faced profitability issues, we achieved a profit in fiscal  2018 by implementing cost structure reforms and business  portfolio selection and concentration.   Through these improvements to our earnings, we will secure  funds for investments that we will be focused on advanced  technologiesâ€”the supporting core of our business. Specifically,  investment targets include biometrics technology, such as  fingerprint, facial, and iris recognition that offer world-leading  accuracy, satellite-related technologies for carrying out  missions in uncharted places in the harsh environment of  space, such as Hayabusa 2, and cyber security technologies  including the security field. Continuous investments will  enable us to strengthen our competitive advantages in the  future and our ability to create value.  To support business expansion over the medium to long  term, we will leverage our advanced technologies to provide  solutions for the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020.  These will include cyber security, security ICT such as image  analysis and accident prediction solutions, rigorous and  efficient border control using biometrics, and 4K and 8K TV  broadcasting systems.  Initiatives in the Medium- to Long-Term Initiatives in the Medium- to Long-Term Expanding the Business Domain to   Solve Social Issues Creation of Stable Earnings and Investment in  Advanced Technologies to Prepare for the Future Examples of Initiatives NEC Iris Recognition  Technology Ranked First in  Accuracy Evaluation by U.S.  National Institute of  Standards and Technology In\tApril\t2018,\tNECs\tiris\trecognition\ttechnology\tachieved\tthe\thighest\tmatching\taccuracy\tevaluation\tin\tan\t evaluation test performed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a world- leading\tauthority.\tFurthermore,\tin\tpast\ttesting\tperformed\tby\tNIST,\tNECs\tfacial\trecognition\twas\tranked\tfirst\t four consecutive times, and its fingerprint recognition has ranked first eight times in total.

Major broadcasters in countries around the world are conducting trial testing of 4K and 8K broadcasts. NEC has  been the technical partner for trial testing of an 8K terrestrial broadcast by Brazilian broadcaster TV GLOBO, and  NECs\tcodecs*2 have been used in 4K broadcast trials by BBC of the U.K. and TV Station of South Korea.  *1  Television master control equipment: A system for compiling broadcast data, including programs and commercials,   and outputting it according to a program *2 Codec: Image compression and decompression equipment Examples of Initiatives Healthcare:   Real time endoscope  diagnosis support system  using AI National Cancer Center Japan and NEC announced the development of a real time endoscopy diagnosis  support system using AI in July 2017. We aim to prevent failure to diagnose bowel cancers and  precancerous lesions (neoplastic polyps in the bowel) during endoscope examinations of the bowel by  discovering them in real time during the endoscopy.  Digital  Government:   Contributing to Wider Use of  My Number Cards among  Local Governments  NECs\tsystem\twas\tadopted\tfor\tthe\tpioneering\tuse\tof\tMy\tNumber\tcards\tas\temployee\tidentification\tcards\t by the Tokushima prefectural government. The system manages room access based on My Number cards  to provide secure staff access management within designated areas at government buildings.  Meanwhile, in Chiba City, NEC has built a library system that allows patrons to borrow books by simply  swiping their My Number card at the library counter. Through initiatives such as these, NEC will  contribute to wider use of My Number cards. Review of Operations Public Business 27 28 NEC Corporation   Integrated Report 2018 NEC Corporation   Integrated Report 2018  Revenue was 408.7 billion,  almost remaining flat   year on year. Operating profit worsened by  4.0 billion year on year to  35.7 billion, mainly owing to  increased investments   in the IoT area. 35.7 39.7 8.7% 9.7% 7.8% 32.0 408.7 408.6 410.0 2018 result 2018 result THREATS Although the private sector market in IT is expanding, the acceleration in  adoption of cloud computing and the penetration of AI and IoT are bringing  dramatic change to NECs business environment in terms of customers  investment fields and competitors. We expect a decrease in existing solutions  businesses in the medium term, and new business model creation and the  capability to support customers digital transformation will be increasingly  important for achieving growth.  STRENGTHS  Reliability and achievements cultivated over many years of providing IT  services to domestic clients in the manufacturing, retail and service, and  financial industries  Ability to integrate technology and business to create value and respond  bimodally to customers needs in business development and solutions  development scenarios  The knowledge and expertise we have developed in manufacturing  innovation at our own plants as a company in the manufacturing industry,  as well as SCM transformation for global corporations WEAKNESSES  Need to strengthen initiatives that will impact society positively across the  boundaries between enterprises and industries  In order to achieve further growth, need to transform to a business model  that makes use of knowledge and resources accumulated for each industry  and client and consolidates them across the organization OPPORTUNITIES  Our society faces various kinds of social issues, such as global food waste and  energy consumption, as well as changes in the human resources  environment due to labor shortages, diversification of consumption patterns,  including an emphasis on customer experience and a shift towards cashless  societies, and fraudulent transactions involving internet banking. AI, IoT, and  other advanced digital technologies are increasingly expected to provide  solutions for these social issues. The period through to fiscal 2021 has been positioned as a period of solidifying a base for future growth in the Enterprise Business.  Throughout this period, NEC will offer solutions for solving social issues as services through partnering with customers, thereby  transforming its business model into a recurring income stream model. Towards this goal, we have been working to establish  common business platforms, refine the value of existing businesses where we have strengths, develop human resources, and  prepare and strengthen co-creation programs with customers and partners.

The committee has been established to enhance transparency of nomination and remuneration  of Directors*. The committee is made up of five members, including three Outside Directors, one  of whom is appointed as the chairperson. * The Compensation Committee established in 2001 was enhanced to become the Nomination and  Compensation Committee in 2010. The Chief Officer position was instituted in July 2011 to strengthen a company-wide strategy  for realizing the NEC Group Vision. In April 2017, NEC extended the authority delegated to the  Chief Officers in order to strengthen the corporate functions and accelerate the speed of  decision making. In June 2004, the term of Directors was shortened from two years to one year in order to clarify  their responsibility for management. The number of Directors was reduced to streamline the Board of Directors. The aim is to ensure  even sounder management through greater discussion at meetings of the Board of Directors and  to deliver prompt decision making. NEC added an Outside Director in June 2001 for a total of two Outside Directors in order to  strengthen the supervisory functions of the Board of Directors. The number of members has  increased and the system of five Outside Directors has continued since its inception in June 2007.

Furthermore, NEC introduced a new mechanism  in order to reflect opinions and advices of Outside Directors in the  operation of business. Under this mechanism, NEC notified those  opinions and advices to the relevant parties in NEC, and reported the  progress to the Board of Directors.  Procedure of the analysis and evaluation (1) Questionnaire  In Fiscal 2018, NEC sent a questionnaire regarding the role,  composition and operation of the Board of Directors to all Directors  and A&SBMs, and all of them answered the questionnaire. Before  sending the questionnaire, NEC improved the questionnaire by  adding questions for free descriptive answers and questions for  evaluation of achievement of the measure introduced in the previous  fiscal year based on the result of the analysis and evaluation  conducted in the previous fiscal year so that evaluation and opinions  of Directors and A&SBMs could be reflected more adequately on their  answers to the questionnaire. (2) Discussion based on the result of the analysis and evaluation  After analyzing the effectiveness of the Board of Directors based on the  result of the questionnaire, NEC reported such result to the Board of  Directors in March 2018. In the said Board of Directors, all Directors  and A&SBMs discussed the improvement for the Board of Directors  from the viewpoint of the reinforcement of the function and  governance system of the Board of Directors, the best practice to  discuss the management strategy and a method for decision making  For further details on the corporate governance of NEC Corporation, please visit the following URL:  https://www.nec.com/en/global/about/governance.html Corporate Governance 41 42 NEC Corporation   Integrated Report 2018 NEC Corporation   Integrated Report 2018  Messages from an Outside Director and   an Audit & Supervisory Board Member Ensuring Compliance and Risk Management NEC considers compliance to not only mean compliance with the law, but also in the wide sense to include  compliance with socially accepted norms and common sense. Likewise, our risk management activities include  properly understanding risks that have an impact on the companys business, and taking preventive measures  efficiently and effectively, including compliance violations.  NEC positions compliance at the foundation of management, and recognizes compliance and risk management as  priority themes Materiality which are essential for corporate governance. We, including the top management, will  continue to promote these company-wide efforts. In fiscal 2017, NEC Corporation received notification of three violations  of the Antimonopoly Act from the Japan Fair Trade Commission. On  November 18, we received an on-site inspection in regard to  transactions for wireless digital emergency firefighting equipment. To  keep these events fresh in mind and reconfirm the importance of  compliance for each individual, we have decided to make November  18 NEC Compliance Day.

Such a dramatic shift in our environment presents significant business  opportunities for NEC, considering that its competitive advantages are derived from its cutting-edge  technologies and top-tier talent pool.  With international competition becoming even more intense, it is no longer enough to develop the  most advanced technologies. A company is also required to triumph over its competitors from a  business standpoint. I have been an Outside Director of NEC for seven years, and during this time I have  come to the conclusion that developing the ability to consistently convert technological prowess into  revenue is a challenge which NEC should be focusing on. In order to achieve this goal, NEC would first  need\tto\tacquire\ta\tclear\tunderstanding\tof\tcurrent\ttrends,\thow\tthose\ttrends\tare\tevolving,\tand\tcustomers\t latent needs. Using this understanding as the starting point, NEC would then move beyond its  traditional boundaries and engage in dynamic third-party collaborations while establishing a  competitive business model that will flourish on the global stage.  The Mid-term Management Plan 2020 which was introduced in Fiscal 2019 is an important step towards realizing this transformation. Given  the rapid pace at which technology is evolving, it is vital that all NEC directors, corporate officers, and employees share a healthy sense of  urgency and focus on swiftly achieving the mid-term management targets. I hope to see NEC push forward with its efforts to create social value  under its brand message Orchestrating a brighter world by assembling knowledge and expertise from both internal and external sources. I look forward to supporting NEC in realizing sustainable growth and increasing its corporate value in my role as an Outside Director.  I was appointed Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member in June 2018. NEC is working to enable  people to live in abundance by using advanced technologies. I feel strongly motivated to participate in  NECs\tactivities\tas\ta\tglobal\tcorporation\tproviding\tsocial\tvalue\tin\tthe\tform\tof\tsafety,\tsecurity,\tefficiency\tand\t equality.

I have worked for many years as an attorney at law specializing in labor law and have been involved  in corporate legal affairs in the fields of personnel and labor.

Furthermore, as society  undertakes\tworkstyle\treforms\tgoing\tforward,\tJapans\tpersonnel\tand\tlabor\taffairs\tare\tgoing\tto\tbe\t radically transformed. As society changes at a dizzying pace, I believe the experience and knowledge  that I have accumulated in the fields of personnel and labor will prove to be a strength.    NEC is taking steps to restructure execution capabilities under the Mid-term Management Plan 2020.  These include introduction of a fair personnel evaluation and compensation system that rewards people who produce results and a sweeping  transformation\tof\tthe\tcorporate\tculture.\tPeople\tare\tthe\tfoundation\tthat\tsupports\ta\tcompanys\torganizations\tand\ttechnologies,\tand\ttransforming\t personnel systems to achieve corporate growth requires serious and bold decisions.

Establishing the NEC brand as an essential presence   in the digital age While treasuring our traditional NEC brand image of being trustworthy and familiar, NEC will prepare for an  era where digital technology penetrates every part of society by positioning itself to realize a safe, secure,  efficient, and equal society through the power of innovation.

Carrying out the Mid-term Management Plan 2020   to completion I consider it my No.1 mission to achieve the Mid-term Management Plan 2020 with a sense of conviction,  and to restore the trust of all our stakeholders. To help achieve it, the most important task is to transform  NECs\tculture\tthrough\treforms\tof\tthe\tpersonnel\tevaluation\tand\tcompensation\tsystem,\tand\tother\tmeans.\tTo\t this end, we will unify the business strategy and personnel strategy, and accelerate our efforts to create a  strong business model and develop human resources.  Realizing an operating profit ratio of 5% by fiscal 2021 The greatest issue facing NEC today is strengthening its earning capability. As CFO, I will steadily promote  the following three initiatives to achieve the Mid-term Management target of a 5% operating profit ratio: 1)  resolute optimization of fixed costs, 2) execution of countermeasures for underperforming businesses with  clear timeframes, 3) execution of growth investments, including M&A, to generate additional earnings.

Through our global research  laboratory network, world-leading research personnel, and co-creation with global business partners, we will  provide outstanding technological capabilities, business verification, and the necessary common platform.  By transforming R&D into an ecosystem-type structure, we will create key technologies to unlock one-to- many solutions that have unrivalled impact.

Particularly, in order to win in the global market where competition becomes tougher everyday and the  needs from customers are diverse, we need to be proactive in proposing new solutions rather than waiting  for requests from customers. I am committed to create a culture of taking risks and playing offense, with  everyone working together. Further promoting compliance among Group employees   in Japan and internationally The NEC Group has treated compliance as an important management priority for some time. Management  has often declared that compliance is a top priority and has been promoting employee awareness through  various measures.

We will proactively advance these activities to maximize the social value that NEC provides.  Strengthening business development capability by   creating customer value using the latest technologies Up to now, NEC has received high evaluations from the markets for its latest technologies, but has not  shown a sense of urgency in developing them into businesses. As such, it has not reached its full growth  potential. I will pursue various possibilities to create new business opportunities without being tied to  existing paradigms and accepted ideas, involving inventive people from in and outside the Company in  order to realize growth by promoting commercialization of core technologies.  Establishing a digital management foundation We are in an era where to survive companies must visualize their businesses through digitalization, and  use that information as an asset to continuously transform and innovate their approach. As CIO and CISO,   I will promote digitalization of business processes and workstyle reforms to establish a digital management  foundation to support NEC as it shifts into a higher gear.

Guided by this belief, NEC makes  it clear that it endeavors to respect human rights under all circumstances in the NEC Group Charter of Corporate  Behavior and the NEC Group Code of Conduct, which are the foundations of its corporate activities. The NEC  Group Human Rights Policy states that NEC will promote initiatives on respecting human rights across the  Companys entire value chain by dialogue and consultation with its stakeholders and implementing human rights  due diligence. NEC is aiming to develop human resources who are able to continuously create value for society, constantly acting  from a customer-oriented perspective with a high sense of ethical values and a deep understanding of the  essential issues faced by customers and society, based on the approach of self-development, where employees  consciously develop their own skills. In addition, we consider that promoting diversity and inclusion and fostering  an organizational culture that can incorporate diverse perspectives and ideas will lead to new value creation and  innovation. Based on these ideas, in April 2016 we formulated our People Philosophy*.  * A philosophy that states our ideas and attitudes for human resources that will lead the creation of value for society based on the NEC Group Values and NEC Group Code of Conduct. The increased use of AI and IoT brings a risk of privacy infringements  and negative impact on human rights in the form of discrimination. Privacy\tis\tone\tof\tthe\tCompanys\tmateriality\tissues,\tand\tin\tApril\t2018\t we held a dialogue session based on the theme of Privacy-related  challenges for business. During the dialogue, we heard opinions pointing out that the  flipside of technology is that there are ethical issues and NEC is called  upon to communicate its stance, also that it is important to include  consideration of ethical issues in business and to develop these as  competitive strengths.

We also received a critical comment that NEC should  cultivate a corporate culture where people can take up new challenges  In our R&D divisions, in order to create solutions for society, we are  actively promoting development of human resources who can take on  advanced global issues and recruitment of experienced personnel  with wide-ranging knowledge on social issues. We are also taking  steps to stimulate personnel exchanges between operating divisions  and research divisions in an effort to develop skills to promote  commercialization of technologies.  while considering whether they have properly prioritized human  aspects ahead of technology, or whether they have put ethical  perspectives on the back-burner.   * QCD: Quality,  Cost, Delivery forced labor based on the NEC Group Charter of Corporate Behavior, the  NEC Group Code of Conduct and the NEC Group Human Rights Policy.

In addition, we are aggressively recruiting people with the highest  levels of skill in their industries, both in Japan and internationally. We  will continue to encourage richly diverse human resources from  various professional fields to engage in multidimensional discussions,  respecting one another regardless of gender or nationality, as we  transform our organization to enable it to generate great innovations. Dialogue with External Experts on Privacy Issues Compliance with the UK Modern Slavery Act Dialogue with External Experts on the Theme of Sustainably and   Socially Literate Human Resources Developing Human Resources Who Can Support Innovation During my student days, I participated in an internship at an African NGO and I have wanted to contribute to the lives of African  people ever since. Since joining the Company, I have been responsible for overall sales in the East African region. In my second  year, I was posted to Nairobi in Kenya for on-the-job training, and there I learned sales skills such as proposing, negotiating,  and responding flexibly through serving local customers.  NEC has been helping to enhance telecoms networks in Africa. Having a telecoms environment has enabled the rapid  spread of new services such as mobile money. When I see this startling pace of development in Africa, it really impresses me  with the huge potential that ICT brings to society.  Meanwhile, we are currently focused on the safety business utilizing biometrics. I am working each day to try and make  daily life safer and more secure for people using ICT, while giving consideration to human rights such as privacy.  At the Value Co-creation Center, when we decide on research themes, we start with social issues as a starting point, rather than  technologies. Currently, we are working on the themes of urban congestion and aging infrastructure.  Having diversity within companies has become more and more important these days. My group also has members coming  from diverse backgrounds. In my group, however, we have never tried to consciously push diversity. It is just that the human  resources we gathered to achieve our goal happened to be a woman or someone with a foreign nationality. To me, diversity is  not a goal in itself; it is merely a means to an end. There are numerous training modules in NEC and at other companies that enable participants to experience social issues.  However, the problem is that after they complete the training, they return to their ordinary lives and forget about what they have learned. In July 2018,  NEC opened its sixth global research facility in India. Here, I want to create fields and mechanisms where employees not only experience social issues, but  also conduct research and development to solve the social issues and ultimately commercialize them. I Want to Contribute to   Social Development in Africa We Should Not Stop by Just Experiencing Social Issues,  We Need to Create Fields and Mechanisms that Takes  It All the Way to Commercialization As a mother with one  child, I work short hours  and so I strive to make  my work more efficient.

Achieving sustainable society by collaboration I. Building sustainable management foundation Continuing from fiscal 2017, NEC held an IR meeting specializing in  the E (environment) of ESG. A total of 13 institutional investors from  12 companies participated.  At the meeting, we gave an explanation of our progress on mid- term environmental management targets as well as our newly  formulated guidelines on climate change measures looking ahead to  2050. We received wide ranging feedback and proposals, such as  requests to clearly indicate how environmental activities connect with  business competitiveness, or how we are trying to connect them.  Looking ahead, we will hold regular IR meetings related to ESG to  improve our ESG initiatives.  NEC conducted a dialogue between our personnel responsible for  environmental management promotion and in charge of demand- supply optimization solution business promotion, and external experts  with perspectives on sustainable management and the environment.  The\texperts\tmentioned\twith\tregard\tto\tNECs\tdesired\tenvironmental\t management, KPIs for environmental targets, and initiatives to  connect these with operations, that NEC should strategically conduct  environmental management to find ways of connecting  environmental issues to sales and increased brand value, and ways of  developing human resources to achieve this, and that NEC needs to  take a wide perspective, such as driving innovation by envisaging a  future of limited electric power availability. The knowledge that we  obtained through these dialogues will be reflected in our initiatives on  environmental management.

The joint venture company affixes RFID tags to shipping containers  being loaded and unloaded at ports of Mumbai.  It has also installed  RFID\treader/writers\tat\tlocations\tsuch\tas\tport\tentrances\tand\texits,\ttoll\t plazas on the expressway, and inland container depots where customs  inspections are carried out. The information is uploaded to the cloud  and shared with other logistics systems. By this service, consigners and freight forwarders could obtain  accurate positional information of their container in transit along the  1,500 km stretch between Delhi and Mumbai on a near real-time  basis, just inputting the container number. As the result, this service shortens shipping lead times, reduces  inventory levels, improves the accuracy of production plans and also  contributes to reduce the consumption of fossil fuel by realizing  efficient transportation. NEC approved this service as ECO Symbol Star*2 since we expect  that the service will reduce approximately 170,000 t-CO2e emission  annually in addition to shortening shipping lead times and to  reducing shipping cost. The number of base stations is expanding rapidly due to the sharp  increase of mobile phone subscribers nationwide in India. However,  there are many regions in India with fragile power supplies that suffer  from frequent power outages and regions that are not supplied with  power at all. In such regions, mobile telecom operators use diesel  generators during power outage to operate base station continuously,  therefore the burden of diesel fuel cost of the generator becomes a big  financial problem. Since the Indian government requests for green-industry, mobile  base station companies in India are required to reduce fuel  consumption by diesel generators, operation cost and CO2 emissions  simultaneously on the viewpoints of both business management and  environmental issue. These issues were taken up for the energy related discussion  between the governments of India and Japan (the India-Japan Energy  Dialog),\tand\tthe\tdemonstration\tproject\tby\tJapans\tNew\tEnergy\tand\t Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) opened to  the public in 2013. As\tthe\tresult\tof\tNECs\tapplication\tfor\tthe\tproject,\tNEC\twas\tselected\t by NEDO to implement the demonstrational operation from  September 2013 to March 2017. Through this operation, the energy  management systems, which consisted of photovoltaic generation  systems, lithium-ion rechargeable battery systems, remote monitoring  of\twhole\tEMS\tsystems,\toperation\tplanning\tand\tbattery\tcharging/ discharging control, were installed into 20 mobile phone base stations  in India.  Since the systems were confirmed to be able to reduce the  annual CO2 emissions to about 40% of their original level by the most  suitable operation plan using the data acquired by the system itself,  NEC approved this EMS system as ECO Symbol Star. Through the 2-year-operation on the actual sites, we could acquire  know-how needed as a business, like various knowledge for the  operation. We are going to link these findings to develop specific  business in India  where more than  400,000 mobile  phone base  stations exist.
