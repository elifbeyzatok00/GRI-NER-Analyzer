No.: 10403782  002  Vestas annual report 2017  In brief Countries in which Vestas1) has:  sales and service offices manufacturing facilities2) research and development facilities  installed wind turbines EUR 10bn In 2017, Vestas generated a  revenue of EUR 10.0bn and  reached an EBIT of EUR 1.2bn. EUR 21bn At the end of the year, the wind turbine  order backlog reached EUR 8.8bn and  the value of the service order backlog  reached an expected contractual  revenue of EUR 12.1bn. 8,779 MW The capacity delivered in 2017 can  generate more than 23 million MWh of  electricity per year – enough to cover  the residential electricity consumption  of more than 13million Europeans and  globally reduce carbon emissions by more  than 11million tonnes of CO2 per year. Pioneering the wind power industry Founded in 1898 as a blacksmith shop in western Denmark, Vestas  started manufacturing wind turbines in 1979. Since then, Vestas has  gained a market leader position with 90 GW of installed wind power  capacity and 76 GW under service across the globe – and has 23,303  dedicated Vestas employees working in more than 50 countries. Vestas works in close partnerships with customers and suppliers to  offer the most efficient sustainable energy solutions. Our core business  is the development, manufacturing, and maintenance of wind energy  solutions – with competencies that cover every aspect of the value  chain from site studies to service and maintenance. On behalf of our customers, Vestas monitors the performance of more  than 35,000 wind turbines globally. This allows our engineers to carry  out preventive maintenance, ensuring maximum yield at all times, and  to collect knowledge to develop the next generation of wind turbines.  Global leader in sustainable energy solutions The current world population of 7.6 billion is expected to reach 8.6 bil- lion in 2030, 9.8 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion in 2100, according to  the United Nations report 2017.3) This means increased consumption,  despite limited resources, and increased demand for energy to create  prosperity – or energy to feed the worlds population.  That is why our mission is to deliver best-in-class energy solutions for  the benefit of Vestas customers and the planet. In collaboration with  our customers, suppliers, employees, the surrounding communities,  and our shareholders, we will deliver on our mission.

Vestas three main business areas Vestas business model is built on three main business areas, which  enable Vestas to execute its corporate strategy:    Power solutions   Service   Offshore Vestas has a strong position within all three areas which offers a solid  base for continued growth and stability. In the coming years, Vestas expects the onshore wind turbine market to  have a stable growth in new installations. An expected close to double- digit growth of the accumulated installed base worldwide will create  further opportunities to grow the service business. Finally, offshore  wind power is projected to become a large-scale renewable technol- ogy, creating the foundation for a high-growth scenario in the offshore  market. Vestas business model Vision To be the global leader  in sustainable energy  solutions Mission To deliver best-in-class  sustainable energy  solutions for the benefit  of Vestas customers  and the planet  004  Vestas annual report 2017  In brief The future looks bright Although we acknowledge that our market conditions are changing, we continue to look forward  to improving our efficiency and competitive position. Renewable energys journey to become  mainstream energy continues to progress, driving a positive long-term outlook and creating mul- tiple opportunities for the wind energy sector. These are opportunities that we will take advantage  of with the right strategic approach and the right management team in place, and I am confident  that we will achieve our strategic ambitions. The route to continuing leadership in sustainable energy  I want to highlight some steps on our journey to becoming the global leader in sustainable energy  solutions. In 2017, we announced a collaboration with Windlab Limited, an Australian-based developer, to  create the worlds first utility-scale, fully integrated wind, solar, and battery project. The Kennedy  project is designed to shape a path forward for how to integrate more renewable energy into the  energy mix and address grid stability challenges that have been a traditional restraint to greater  uptake of renewable energy. Learnings from this project ultimately can help accelerate the global  transition to an energy mix led by renewable energy. We have also engaged in a collaborative partnership with battery manufacturer Northvolt AB. This  initiative, like Kennedy Energy Park in Australia, is about leveraging Vestas core, wind expertise,  as a strong base for creating smart, sustainable energy solutions. Inevitably, short-term results are impacted by current market challenges, but we strongly believe  that successful execution of our strategy will lead us to new growth opportunities and sound  profitability. Our financial performance in 2017 allowed the Board to increase cash returns to the  shareholders, as demonstrated by our dividend and the completion of two share buy-back pro- grammes during the year. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our customers, shareholders, and employees.  You all make the company successful, and you enable Vestas to be a key driver in the worlds tran- sition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Bert Nordberg Chairman of the Board of Directors Standing strong in a changing  market environment   Going forward, we will  continue to deliver solutions  with the lowest cost of  energy by enhancing our  technology and service  leadership. Located more than 1,200 km from the port of  Mombasa, the Lake Turkana wind park in Kenya  exhibits average wind speeds exceeding 11 m/s.  Staying ahead in a changing market environment The changes that are happening to the renewable energy industry are coming fast. This past year,  we saw the price of electricity from renewable sources being significantly reduced and competition  become fiercer in markets around the world. Facing this dynamic market, we have stayed in the lead,  reporting solid results, and delivered on our strategic objectives to grow faster than the market,   deliver best-in-class margins, and offer the lowest cost of energy solutions to our customers.  Achievements in 2017 Looking back at 2017, I am encouraged by the results Vestas has made in terms of order intake,  revenue, profitability, and cash flow generation. In addition, many other achievements were made as  well during the year. We continued the development of our two commercially successful platforms,  including an upgrade of the 3 MW platform to 4 MW with the introduction of three new variants.  2017 was another busy year at Vestas production facilities. We managed to cope with a high  manufacturing level while at the same time strengthening our global footprint and competitive- ness. Safety continues to be an integral part of achieving operational excellence, and over the last  10years, Vestas has been building a strong safety culture. In 2017, Vestas stayed well below its  target of max. 6.0 total recordable injuries per one million working hours. Service delivered strong financial performance, and continues to be an ever-increasing value crea- tor for Vestas. Service is on track to delivering 50 percent revenue growth by 2020 versus 2016.  Despite the turbulent situation with the US tax reform, we are pleased that the final version of tax  legislation preserves the original terms, and leaves in place the phase-down schedule and value of  the Production Tax Credit. Positioned and prepared for new challenges and opportunities We need to stay agile, both in how we use our wind expertise to shape future technologies, and in  how we organise our business to adjust to the changing market. Combining our commercial best  practices and resources is part of staying agile and enables us to both further consolidate our  market leadership and position ourselves strongly to capture future growth opportunities.  I want to thank all Vestas employees for your dedication to help creating a more sustainable   future for the world.

The decarbonisation of the energy sector is underway, and estimates show that renewable energy  will dominate future power generation. Wind energy is becoming a mainstream source of energy,  and the long-term outlook for renewable energy creates multiple opportunities for the wind  energy sector.  Vestas remains committed to its vision to be the global leader in sustainable energy solutions.  Wind power will remain the core of Vestas offerings, but at the same time the company envisions  that a broadened focus on sustainable energy solutions will enlarge the wind turbine market,   enable new revenue streams, and expand Vestas presence in the market. In 2017, Vestas show- cased what future sustainable energy solutions would look like by combining wind, solar, and   battery energy storage in the worlds first utility-scale on-grid hybrid project.  To support its overall vision, Vestas remains dedicated to its four strategic objectives of being the  global leader in the wind power plant solutions market and global leader in the wind power service  market, while delivering the lowest cost of energy solutions and best-in-class global operations. At the same time as wind energy is becoming the lowest cost of energy solution in many markets,  competition in the industry has become even more fierce, while renewable energy markets are  transitioning away from tax and policy support to more competitive tender structures. In this envi- ronment, Vestas has delivered on its strategy to grow faster than the market and produce best- in-class margins, and has strengthened its global leadership in all three business areas: onshore,  offshore, and service.

November 2017. 011  Vestas annual report 2017  Strategy and ambitions Sustainable future for the wind power market Renewable energys journey to become mainstream energy continues  to progress, driving a positive long-term outlook and creating multiple  opportunities for the wind energy sector. Driven by increasingly strong national commitments to reducing CO2  emissions, as well as the phasing-out and replacement of older fossil  fuel and nuclear generation capacity, more space is being created for  renewable energy within the global energy mix. Concurrently, growth in  global electricity demand is creating further prospects for renewables.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that demand for elec- tricity will grow by 60 percent towards 20401), driven increasingly by  renewable energy generation investment in developing countries.  Government actions are also contributing to this trend, with growing  long-term policy stability and country-specific CO2 reduction targets cre- ating a supportive environment for continued investment in renewables.  The decarbonisation of the energy sector is underway, with estimates  showing renewables overwhelmingly dominating power generation  capacity leading up to 2040.2) In the context of the transition from  fossil fuels to renewables, and within the range of renewable energy  technologies, wind is in a strong position.

November 2017. * Based on Sustainable development scenario. The constant reduction in the levelised cost of energy for wind, as well  as improvements in reliability and productivity of wind power plants,  have seen the prospects for wind energy improve significantly. This  trend is expected to continue over the coming years as wind energy  continues to outcompete fossil fuel-based generation on cost, while  reducing CO2 emissions that cause global warming. This scenario presents a strong environment for the stable growth of  wind energy, leveraging the continued maturity and competitiveness of  the sector in the context of a global market that is moving away from  fossil fuels for energy generation. Vestas vision – to be the global leader in   sustainable energy Vestas vision to be the global leader in sustainable energy solutions  builds on its pioneering legacy in the renewables industry and serves  as a response to the emerging market opportunities Vestas sees  ahead. As Vestas strives to achieve its vision, the company will con- tinue to enable a more cost-effective and sustainable energy sector.  For Vestas, sustainable energy solutions comprise power-generating  equipment, services, and digital solutions, as well as new business mod- els that support a faster journey to a fully decarbonised energy sector.  Being a global leader means being actively present in all key markets.  This requires offering the most competitive portfolio of solutions ena- bled by technology and service leadership. Combining these assets  with industry-leading commercial capabilities will allow Vestas to win  market share by being the preferred partner of its customers.  Being a global leader also enables Vestas to drive scale and sustain  best-in-class margins, allowing for reinvestment into innovations for  the benefit of customers, shareholders and the planet. Vestas strategy – the route to continuing leadership  in sustainable energy Sustainable energy solutions will build upon Vestas core business,  widening its commercial playing field and opening the door to new,  profitable revenue streams. Wind power will remain the core of Vestas  offerings and Vestas anticipates that sustainable energy solutions  will enlarge the wind turbine market, enable new revenue streams and  expand Vestas global market share.  As a pioneer in the renewables industry, Vestas has vast experience in  developing, installing, and managing complex energy solutions ena- bled by competencies across the broader energy system. Vestas has  leveraged this experience and expertise to take significant steps on  the journey from global leader in wind to a global leadership position in  sustainable energy solutions. Going forward, Vestas will continue to deliver solutions with the lowest  cost of energy by enhancing its technology and service leadership. To  ensure it stays ahead, Vestas will continue its lead in R&D and innova- tion to secure an industry-leading product portfolio, while investing into  growing and differentiating the service business. Together, these imper- atives will accelerate the transition to a more sustainable energy mix. Vestas global presence, position in the onshore and offshore power  plant market and its service backlog, create a strong starting point for  leading this transition. Building on global scale and continuous focus  on improving operations, Vestas stays committed to preserving its  best-in-class margins above industry competitors. Furthermore, Vestas continues to future-proof and expand its commer- cial reach in order to realise its long-term vision and strategic objec- tives while meeting the evolving challenges of the renewable energy  sector. A few recent examples illustrate this movement:   In October 2017, Vestas announced a collaboration with energy  developer Windlab Limited to build the worlds first utility-scale,  on-grid hybrid project integrating wind, solar, and battery energy  storage. Projects like these enable a higher penetration of renewables,  a lower levelised cost of energy and respond directly to customers  most important goal: business case certainty.    In December 2017, Vestas signed a strategic partnership with battery  technology provider Northvolt AB. The aim of the partnership is to  bring the most competitive battery storage solutions to the market  and determine how to better integrate storage and renewable energy  generation technologies as a means to better integrate renewable  energy into the power grids, ultimately leading to an increased uptake  of renewables. Strategic objectives Overall, Vestas remains dedicated to its strategic direction. The strat- egy towards 2020 continues to revolve around the four strategic  objectives that enable realising Vestas vision:   Global leader in the wind power plant solutions market   Global leader in the wind power service solutions market   Lowest cost of energy solutions   Best-in-class global operations  012  Vestas annual report 2017  Strategy and ambitions For each of the strategic objectives, Vestas has set clear targets and  defined a sub-set of strategic enablers to drive its organisation for- ward. Below, Vestas high-level ambitions and selected strategic ena- blers tied to the four strategic objectives are outlined. Global leader in the wind power plant solutions market Vestas ambition is to grow faster than the market to uphold its global  leadership position in wind power, while delivering industry-leading  margins. To achieve this, Vestas will continue to focus on profitable  growth in mature and emerging markets, partnering more closely with  customers on project origination and collaborating to develop fully  optimised solutions. Furthermore, Vestas will continuously focus on  transforming its commercial capabilities to support a gradual transition  of its offerings and enable customers to win in auctions and other com- petitive tendering schemes. Global leader in the wind power service solutions market Vestas ambition is to organically grow its service business by more than  50 percent towards 2020 versus 2016 revenue, while also delivering  best-in-class margins. To achieve this, Vestas will continue to fast-track  its multibrand business, further develop its digital service offerings, and  lower costs through an end-to-end value chain optimisation logic.  Lowest cost of energy solutions Vestas ambition is to reduce levelised cost of energy faster than mar- ket average. By doing so, Vestas aims to provide its customers with  the highest returns on investment in the industry. Vestas investments  in new technology are the largest in the industry. Going forward, it is  Vestas ambition to sustain leadership in R&D investments in order to  support an industry-leading portfolio of sustainable energy solutions.  Furthermore, Vestas will increase focus on accelerating cost reductions  through an end-to-end value chain focus. Best-in-class global operations Vestas ambition is to have the most flexible and lowest cost of opera- tions within the industry. Vestas size and subsequent scale provide a  competitive foundation for lowering costs at every stage of the value  chain. To fully leverage its scale, Vestas will continuously optimise its  production footprint and level of outsourcing to further improve flex- ibility, labour cost efficiency, and capital expenditure. Finally, working  capital management remains a high priority for Vestas. Consequently,  the companys focus remains on improving the cash conversion cycle  and lowering working capital. As the industry is currently going through a transition, during which  new opportunities will emerge, Vestas also needs to continually change  and expand its ambitions. Looking ahead to 2020, three key themes span across Vestas strate- gic targets:    Raising the bar – Vestas will set more ambitious targets to push the  company to stay ahead of competition   Refining initiatives – Expanding Vestas strategic enablers to reflect  new market realities   Accelerating execution – Accelerating execution of new and existing  enablers to deliver on the targets Vestas business areas   – a strong and balanced portfolio Vestas holds leadership positions in all three key areas of wind: onshore  wind turbines, offshore wind turbines, and service. All three areas are  attractive individually, and when combined, create a well-balanced port- folio of business at different stages of maturity in terms of growth, com- petitive dynamics, and profitability. Continuing to pursue leadership in  all three areas allows Vestas to achieve significant and complimentary  benefits commercially, operationally, and financially. Long-term market outlook:   the transition to maturity, stability, and opportunity Towards the early 2020s, the wind power industry will be entering a  phase of significant change driven by increasing maturity, changing  regulation, continued rapid reduction in levelised cost of energy, and  shifts in the customer landscape. The overall challenge to decarbon- ise the energy sector remains in place, with further and longer-term  decarbonisation of the energy  sector being required in order to slow  down the pace of climate change. This perspective is one rationale sup- porting the increased long-term commitments to renewable energy by  nations, states, cities, and corporations, and ensures demand for sus- tainable energy solutions over the coming decades. Vision & proof points Mission statement Values Strategic objectives Accountability  Collaboration  Simplicity Best-in-class global operations Lowest cost of energy solutions Lowest Cost of Energy Solutions  Preferred Partner  Leader in Revenues  Best-in-Class Margins Global Leader in Sustainable Energy Solutions Deliver best-in-class energy solutions for the benet  of Vestas customers and the planet Global leader  in the wind power plant  solutions market Global leader  in the wind service  solutions market The building blocks  of the corporate strategy  013  Vestas annual report 2017  Strategy and ambitions Leading up to and during this period, policymakers and energy system  stakeholders will increasingly focus on the total system value of new  generation capacity beyond offering the lowest cost of energy. This  will add further momentum to renewables that can provide energy at  the time and location where it is most valued. Vestas is taking industry  leadership in commercialising storage solutions, utility-scale wind- solar hybrids, and other long-term innovations that address the full  value to the energy system. While these trends add short-term volatility at industry level, they cre- ate opportunities and enable Vestas to leverage its strong position and  exposure across wind power plant and service solutions. The changes reflect a required step on the path to a more mature,  unsubsidised renewable energy industry, which is now able to cost- effectively meet demand for large-scale, sustainable energy  solutions.  Globally, policymakers and stakeholders are increasing their commit- ment to renewable deployment. Notably, the EU has recently confirmed  its commitment to renewables with a 27 percent target by 2030. In the  USA, several states are increasing targets for renewable power in elec- tricity systems. Countries like India and South Korea have increased  their targets for wind deployment. This is to a large extent driven by the  increased cost-competitiveness of wind. As such, the stakes for wind OEMs have increased. Delivering on the  strategic priorities enables profitable growth through the mid term and  enables Vestas to maintain leadership in an expanded and maturing  industry through the long term. Onshore Onshore wind power has crossed a threshold and is today the lowest- cost of energy solution in several parts of the world. Reductions in  levelised cost of energy will accelerate in coming years, unlocking new  markets and further expanding winds competitiveness against con- ventional energy sources. Towards the mid 2020s, global onshore markets are expected to grow  at approx. 3-5 percent annually from the 2017 base3), as healthy vol- ume in mature markets is coupled with emerging market growth.

November 2017.  014  Vestas annual report 2017  Strategy and ambitions strong position in emerging markets, and maintain a clear leadership  position in mature markets.  As wind energy and other renewable technologies become more com- petitive, they serve to support the gradual but complete transition of  market mechanisms towards large-scale tenders and auctions. Addi- tionally, this trend will require an accompanying commercial transition –  specifically, a stronger emphasis on partnering with customers to tailor  packages that combine products, services, and commercial solutions for  tenders and auctions, as well as taking an active role in deal origination. At the same time, intense competition for large auction orders is driv- ing downward pressure on remuneration for owners of new wind power  plants. This development also impacts the supply chain, including accel- erated pressure on OEMs to reduce levelised cost of energy. However,  experience also shows that markets tend to gradually stabilise after  the introduction of new market mechanisms, leading to lower but more  stable levels. Due to its global reach, Vestas is already very familiar with  the transition to the new reality of auctions and believes to be stronger  positioned to benefit here than most of its peers due to broad exposure  to, and familiarity with, auction and competitive tender schemes. Beyond auctions, repowering is another significant opportunity. In tra- ditional wind markets such as North America, Europe, and China, repow- ering will drive an additional valuable supplement to greenfield instal- lations, as customers recognise the strong business case of replacing  ageing turbines at high-wind sites with more efficient and productive  technology. This adds to the strength of the long-term forecasts. Long-term opportunities are also driven by the evolution of other com- mercial elements. As renewables gradually replace fossil-fuel gener- ated energy, the requirements of grids and energy systems will evolve  and challenge OEMs to provide solutions that integrate multiple tech- nologies, including effective energy storage, provide more efficient and  effective asset management, and utilise data and digital solutions to  enable renewables to better integrate into power grids.  Vestas will continue to accelerate its focus on introducing new and more  efficient wind power plant solutions while reducing costs at all levels of  the wind power value chain. In sum, the added emphasis on levelised cost  of energy reduction places a premium on Vestas position with global scale  efficiency, technology leadership and industry-leading R&D capabilities.

Service Service will continue to see high volume growth of more than 10 percent  annually throughout the period, driven by growth in the installed base.  Service growth is key to Vestas by providing a highly predictable and prof- itable component of its overall business portfolio.

This offers solid  growth opportunities for  the service business. Source: MAKE Consulting: Q4 Global Wind Power Market Outlook Update. November 2017. Vestas is in a strong position to grow its service business even faster  than the market, and from the level in 2016, Vestas aims to grow  service revenue by at least 50 percent towards 2020, while also con- tinuing to deliver industry-leading and stable service margins. The  strong performance in 2017 indicates that Vestas is on the pathway of  achieving this ambition.  Achieving this requires Vestas to differentiate itself by delivering more  value to customers than its peers and to deliver services at the low- est cost. Vestas is strongly positioned to deliver through its focus on  operational excellence across the service value chain and by having the  largest fleet under service globally (76 GW). Towards 2020, Vestas will  continue to enhance its service leadership and value-add to customers  through the expansion of its multibrand capabilities, the deployment of  new digital tools, and other means to increase customers energy pro- duction, reduce their operating expenses, and increase their revenue. At  the same time, continual efficiency improvements will ensure the quality  of Vestas service offerings and help maintain its cost leadership. Beyond 2020, the growth of the service market is expected to con- tinue as the onshore installed base is projected to double to approx.  1,000GW by 2026.4) Given the strong growth and Vestas high profit- ability in this segment, service is likely to become the companys largest  profit stream. Vestas will continue to expand its volume leadership posi- tion through Vestas own wind turbines and increasing multibrand sales. Offshore The offshore segment is expected to accelerate growth, with projected  industry volumes growing at 15-20 percent annually from a small base  of roughly 3 GW installed in 2017.4) Northern Europe will remain the core market for installations in the  near-term, and the overall market is expected to grow moderately  towards 2020. However, as other regions come on line, strong growth  is expected beyond 2020 – mainly driven by Asia Pacific. Due to long  lead times, the segment is characterised by a relatively high degree of  certainty of minimum market volumes.  Through MHI Vestas Offshore Wind, Vestas offshore joint venture with  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Vestas will continue to invest to claim a  leading position and expand the joint ventures reach in offshore wind  throughout this period. MHI Vestas Offshore Wind has established  itself as a leading offshore wind player, with orders over the last few  years from the UK, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands.  With the outlook for offshore wind energy looking positive through the  opening of new markets and further reductions in the cost of energy,  MHI Vestas Offshore Wind is now shifting its strategic focus to expand  into new markets and further consolidate its position in mature markets. 4)  Source: MAKE Consulting: Q4 Global Wind Power Market Outlook. November 2017.  Priorities for capital allocation 1. Organic growth   Investments   Research and development   Strong balance sheet to enable growth 2. Acquisitions   Bolt-on acquisitions 3. Dividend    25-30 percent of the net result of the year  after tax    Payout during first half year given approval  by the Annual General Meeting 4. Share buy-back    From time to time to adjust capital  structure    If relevant, launch during second half year  based on realised performance 015  Vestas annual report 2017  Strategy and ambitions Vestas capital structure targets, as well as related dividend policy, link to the strategic aspirations  of the company.  The main priority is to invest in Vestas corporate strategy and use capital resources for required  investments and R&D to realise this strategy.  As a player in a market where projects, customers, and wind turbine investors are becoming larger,  Vestas aims to be a strong financial counterpart. Capital resources will be maintained to secure  compliance with the capital structure targets:    Net interest bearing debt/EBITDA ratio below 1x at any point in the cycle    Solvency ratio of min. 25 percent by the end of each financial year  Available capital resources may also be used for bolt-on acquisitions to accelerate or increase  profitable growth prospects.  Any decision to distribute cash to shareholders will be taken in appropriate consideration of the  capital structure targets and availability of excess cash. Determining the level of excess cash will  be based on the companys growth plans and liquidity requirements.  The dividend policy reflects the general intention of the Board of Directors to recommend a  dividend of 25-30 percent of the years net result after tax, which will be paid out following the  approval by the Annual General Meeting.  In addition, Vestas may from time to time supplement with share buy-back programmes to adjust  the capital structure. Such share buy-backs, if any, will likely be initiated in the second half of the  year based on realised performance.  In years without major investments, most of the free cash flow may be distributed to shareholders  through dividends and share buy-backs.  Capital structure strategy Vestas has 38,892 wind turbines  under service distributed all over  the world, from Nicaragua over  Morocco to China.   016  Vestas annual report 2017  Strategy and ambitions Outlook 2018 Revenue is expected to range between EUR 10bn and 11bn, including  service revenue, which is expected to grow. Vestas expects to achieve  an EBIT margin of 9-11percent with the service EBIT margin remaining  stable.  Total investments1) are expected to amount to approx. EUR 500m, and  free cash flow1) is expected to be minimum EUR 400m in 2018. It should be emphasised that Vestas accounting policies only allow the  recognition of revenue when the control has passed to the customer,  either at a point in time or over time. Disruptions in production and  challenges in relation to shipment of wind turbines and installation  hereof, for example bad weather, lack of grid connections, and similar  matters, may thus cause delays that could affect Vestas financial  results for 2018. Further, movements in exchange rates from current  levels may also impact Vestas financial results for 2018.

The wind power industry is undergoing a transition towards  a more mature, unsubsidised renewable energy industry. This transi- tion leads to a highly competitive market, and will likely drive a further  consolidation in the industry. Beyond the transition, a matured mar- ket for wind energy creates opportunities for Vestas to leverage and  strengthen its leadership position. Within this context, Vestas is able to present updated long-term finan- cial ambitions that reflect its projection for market conditions and the  presumed result of its strategy – including initiatives that are currently  being undertaken. During the transition, revenue in the Service segment is expected to  grow organically by at least 10 percent annually with stable EBIT mar- gins compared to 2017.  Updated long-term financial ambitions Revenue Grow faster than the market and be the market leader in  revenue EBIT margin At least 10 percent Free cash flow Positive each year ROIC Double-digit each year over the cycle Outlook  In 2017, Vestas installed wind  turbines in Honduras (59 MW) and  Mongolia (50 MW) for the first time.

How Vestas performed  and created value in 2017 017  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance More than 23,000 dedicated  employees are working for Vestas  across more than 50 countries  – and their mission is to deliver  best-in-class sustainable energy  solutions for the benefit of Vestas  customers and the planet.  018  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance Income statement Result for the year Revenue Revenue amounted to EUR 9,953m, which was within the updated guid- ance range of EUR 9.5bn-10.25bn announced on 9 November 2017.  Revenue reflects high activity levels, although representing a 3 percent  decline compared to record-high revenue in 2016. Revenue in 2017  was impacted by a negative currency effect of EUR 161m, primarily  driven by the EUR/USD development. Revenue mEUR   0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 10,000 12,000 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Power solutions Service EUR 10bn Vestas maintained  a solid business  performance in 2017  despite a changing  market environment,  reporting revenue in  the higher end of the  updated guidance  range.  Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) accounted for 49 percent  (2016: 45 percent) of revenue, while Americas and Asia Pacific  accounted for 42 percent (2016: 47 percent) and 9 percent (2016:  8percent), respectively.  Distribution of revenue mEUR 2017 2016 Europe, Middle East, and Africa 4,859 4,641 Americas 4,175 4,823 Asia Pacific 919 773 Total 9,953 10,237 – of which service revenue 1,522 1,309 Gross profit Gross profit amounted to EUR 1,963m, corresponding to a gross  margin of 19.7 percent – a 1.1 percentage point decrease relative to  2016. The gross profit decrease was mainly driven by lower volumes,  combined with lower average project margins in the Power solutions  segment, but partly offset by improved performance within the Service  segment. Research and development costs Research and development costs recognised in the income statement  amounted to EUR 235m, which was slightly higher compared to EUR  227m in 2016. The total R&D expenditure prior to capitalisation and  amortisation increased to EUR 225m in 2017, against EUR 198m in  2016, due to continued research activities and improvement initia- tives as part of bringing new technology to the market as a response to  market demands. Distribution costs Distribution costs amounted to EUR 229m in 2017, equivalent to  an increase of 0.4 percentage points of revenue compared to 2016,  driven by additional execution costs and allowances for doubtful  receivables combined with increased sales and marketing costs. Administration costs Administration costs constituted 2.7 percent of revenue in 2017, com- pared to 2.8 percent in 2016. Operating profit (EBIT)  EBIT amounted to EUR 1,230m in 2017, equivalent to an EBIT margin  of 12.4 percent, which is within the updated guidance range of 12-13  percent disclosed on 9 November 2017. The EBIT margin decreased by  1.5 percentage points mainly driven by the decreased gross profit due  to increased price pressure and competitive environment, combined  with additional execution costs. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment amounted to EUR 421m in  2017, compared to EUR 405m in 2016. The increase was due to reas- sessment of useful life of certain assets as well as impairment losses  and reversal of impairment losses on assets.

Income from investments in joint ventures Result from investments in joint ventures amounted to a loss of EUR  40m in 2017, compared to a loss of EUR 101m in 2016. The improve- ment was mainly attributable to Vestas share of loss in MHI Vestas  Offshore Wind on a standalone basis being reduced during 2017,  combined with timing difference in elimination of proportional profit on  deliveries from the Group to MHI Vestas Offshore Wind.  Income tax  Income tax amounted to EUR 298m, equivalent to an effective tax rate  of 25 percent. Effective tax rate is unchanged compared to 2016. Profit for the year Profit for the year amounted to EUR 894m in 2017, which was a  decrease of 7 percent compared to 2016. The decline in profit for the  year is mainly a result of the decreased gross profit and EBIT. As the targets for bonus payout were achieved in 2017, a global bonus  of EUR 112m will be paid out to all employees (cash effect 2018),  compared to EUR 120m in 2016 (cash effect 2017).  019  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance Balance sheet Working capital Net working capital amounted to a net liability of EUR 2.0bn at the  end of 2017, which is on par with last year. The level was impacted by  inventory build-up, offset by increasing trade payables, whereas the  level last year was impacted by high prepayments from customers in  relation to Production Tax Credit (PTC) projects in the USA. Net working capital mEUR   (2,500) (2,000) (1,500) (1,000) (500) 0 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 A four-year  improvement of  EUR 1,388m Vestas is managing  the balance sheet  closely and keeps a very  favourable position on  net working capital. Capital structure and financing items Equity As at 31 December 2017, total equity amounted to EUR 3,112m; a  2percent reduction from EUR 3,190m end of 2016. Equity was main- tained at the 2016 level, despite dividend payout and share buy-back  programmes of a combined value of EUR 975m. To adjust the capital structure and to meet the obligations arising  from employee share option programmes, Vestas bought 10,503,515  shares under the two share buy-back programmes active during 2017. The strength of the balance sheet combined with the results achieved  in 2017 has led the Board of Directors to recommend a dividend of  DKK 9.23 (EUR 1.24) per share, equivalent to 29.9 percent of the net  result for the year after tax. Earnings per share Earnings per share amounted to EUR 4.2 in 2017, a decrease of EUR  0.2 compared to EUR 4.4 in 2016, mainly driven by lower net profit but  partly offset by cancellation of treasury shares. Net interest-bearing position and cash position At the end of 2017, the net interest-bearing position was positive of  EUR 3,359m, an improvement of EUR 104m, compared to the end of  2016 with a positive net interest-bearing position of EUR 3,255m.  The ratio net interest-bearing debt/EBITDA of (2.0) by the end of 2017  was comparable to (1.8) in 2016 driven by the high cash balance main- tained throughout the year. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 3,653m in 2017, up 3  percent from EUR 3,550m in 2016. The cash position was maintained  at the record-high level from last year, significantly impacted by cash  flow from operating activities and a well-executed working capital  management strategy. Solvency ratio At the end of December 2017, the solvency ratio was 28.6 percent,  which was a decline of 3.5 percentage points from 2016. The solvency  ratio is below the target of 30-35 percent as a result of the high bal- ance sheet combined with dividend payout and share buy-backs made  during 2017. Return on equity Return on equity was 28.1 percent in 2017, which was a decrease of  4.5 percentage points compared to 2016. The decrease was a result of  the lower net profit, partly offset by the decrease in equity. Cash flow Operating activities Cash flow from operating activities was EUR 1,625m in 2017, which  was a decrease of 26 percent compared to last year. The decrease was  a result of lower profit for the year, lower non-cash adjustments and  lower change in net working capital. Net investments Cash flow used for investing activities amounted to EUR 407m in  2017, which was in line with the updated guidance of approx. EUR  400m announced on 9 November 2017. Investments were mainly  driven by tangible blade investments as well as capitalised R&D pro- jects, but also impacted by the sale of office buildings.

Vestas total installed onshore capacity increased from almost 79 GW in 2016 to 88 GW in 2017  – an increase of 11 percent. In a rapidly changing market, Vestas achieved an increase in order intake compared to 2016, with  a record-high 11,176 MW. This also resulted in an order backlog of 11,492 MW. Activity levels  remained at a high level with more than 11,237 MW produced and shipped and 8,779 MW deliv- ered to the customers.  Revenue from Power solutions decreased by 6 percent to EUR 8,431m. The EBIT margin for the area  was 13.5 percent in 2017, down 2.4 percentage points from 15.9 percent in 2016.  As a result of an improved economics of wind power, several markets adopted auctions in 2017,  and the trend is expected to continue.  The transition towards market-based solutions has increased the competitive pressure, but is a  long-term positive for the industry, and the ability for wind power to compete directly with other  sources of energy is what the industry has been striving for all along.  The ability to continue to grow faster than the market requires a constant development of more  efficient wind turbines as well as a continuous optimisation of the manufacturing setup.  During the year, several upgrades were made to Vestas product portfolio. New rotor sizes were  introduced to both turbine platforms in the portfolio. The 3 MW platform was upgraded to 4 MW  with the introduction of three new variants, including the V150-4.2 MW, Vestas largest onshore  wind turbine, offering an increase of up to 56 percent in annual energy production since the plat- forms launch in 2010.1)  A lean and scalable manufacturing setup remains a top priority for Vestas in order to meet the  requirements of a market environment in constant change. In 2017, Vestas expanded its global  footprint with the opening of the blade factory in India. Besides supporting a stronger presence in  the Indian market, the factory will be utilised in the entire Asia Pacific region.

November 2017. 021  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance Financial performance Result for the period Compared to 2016, revenue from Power solutions in 2017 decreased  by 6 percent to EUR 8,431m. The decrease was primarily driven by a  decrease in deliveries to customers, as well as negative impacts from  currency rate developments. EBIT decreased by 20 percent to EUR 1,142m in 2017, relative to  2016. Consequently, the EBIT margin from Power solutions was 13.5  percent in 2017, down 2.4 percentage points from 15.9 percent in  2016. The decrease was mainly a consequence of lower volumes, com- bined with lower average project margins. Notwithstanding the competitive markets, it should be emphasised  that project margins depend on a variety of factors, i.e. wind turbine  type, geography, scope, and uniqueness of the offering.

Level of activity Vestas had a busy year with a high activity level in its factories. In  2017, Vestas produced and shipped wind turbines with an aggregate  output of 11,237 MW against 9,957 MW in 2016.  Deliveries to customers amounted to 8,779 MW – a decrease of 9 per- cent compared to 2016. The decrease was driven by Americas due to  high deliveries in 2016. By the end of 2017, Vestas had installed a total of 88 GW onshore  capacity in 77 countries, including its first-ever deliveries in Honduras  and Mongolia. Order intake In 2017, order intake amounted to 11,176 MW, corresponding to EUR  8.9bn. Compared to 2016, order intake in MW for the year increased by  6 percent while the monetary value decreased by EUR 0.6bn. Europe, Middle East, and Africa accounted for 40 percent (2016: 49  percent), Americas for 45 percent (2016: 41 percent), and Asia Pacific  for 15 percent (2016: 10 percent) of the order intake in 2017 in MW.  In 2017, 75 percent of total orders were announced.

Order backlog At the end of the year, the order backlog amounted to 11,492 MW,  equalling EUR 8.8bn. Compared to last year, the order backlog in MW  increased by 21 percent equivalent to EUR 0.3bn. Despite the increase  in delivery of wind turbines, the order backlog has developed positively  due to strong order intake. Global trends in the onshore wind energy market  The volume of annual installed onshore wind power capacity globally  in 2017 is expected to have declined to 51 GW compared to 53 GW in  2016.2) The deterioration is mainly driven by a continued normalisation  of the Chinese market, where annual onshore wind power installations  declined to 15 GW in 2017, compared to 22 GW the year before.3) As  expected, the US market declined in 2017, with onshore installations  of 7 GW compared to more than 8GW in 2016.4) This decline is inter- preted mainly as a result of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) structure  allowing a four-year construction window to the projects qualified in  2016.  Excluding the Chinese market, global onshore installations for the  year are forecast to have reached 32 GW2), which is a slight increase  compared to 2016. More importantly, however, wind energy continues  to increase the penetration compared to most other energy sources.  In 2016, wind power only constituted approx. 7 percent of the total  electricity capacity, while this share is expected to grow significantly  towards 2040.5)  Movement towards auctions There is no doubt that auctions and competitive tenders are the future  of the wind power industry, see also Vestas strategy, page 010. In  2017, several countries introduced auctions, and Vestas anticipates  this trend to continue.  This is a long-term positive transformation for the industry, as auctions  and competitive tenders have proven the competitiveness of wind  power, and put it on a level playing field with other energy sources,  thereby increasing the future potential market. In the short-term, how- ever the industry transition is causing accelerated competition and, to  some extent, changes in the market dynamics. The value-adding role that wind turbine manufacturers play in auctions,  and a key differentiator for Vestas, is the ability to optimise the busi- ness case of each individual wind power project site.   6)  Source: Bloomberg New Energy Finance: New Energy Outlook: Wind. June 2017.  022  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance In response to more auctions and tenders, Vestas customers are seek- ing greater collaboration. Early engagement with customers to build  capabilities to jointly win auctions and tenders will be increasingly criti- cal in the future for every wind turbine manufacturer, and this approach  has helped Vestas to success in many of the conducted auctions.  As the market is transforming, the importance of scale and full under- standing of every element in the value chain will define the winners of  the industry. Vestas finds itself well-positioned to reap the benefits  from these developments due to its experience and knowledge built  on over 30 years of innovation and optimisation across the entire wind  energy value chain. Repowering  The fleet of installed wind turbines is ageing, unlocking new opportu- nities to replace old wind turbines with newer ones, and reaping the  advantage of more efficient and productive turbines on high-quality  project sites. In the coming years, the majority of the repowering mar- ket will centre around the pioneering markets of the wind power indus- try in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).  With a designed lifespan of 20 years for a wind turbine, the repower- ing market is expected to grow rapidly from 10 GW in 2020 and reach  37 GW already in 2025.6) After 2025, the addressable market for  repowering is anticipated to expand outside EMEA, and be more evenly  distributed among the major regions.  Favourable wind sites and an improvement in technology is expected to  make repowering attractive for Vestas customers. In the future, repow- ering is expected to provide the wind power industry with the stability  known from more mature industries. Having the largest installed fleet  and more understanding of wind than any other competitor, Vestas has  confidence in its opportunities within the repowering market.

June 2017. 023  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance Combining wind, solar, and battery energy storage, the Kennedy Energy  Park located in Queensland, Australia, will be the renewable energy  industrys first on-grid, utility-scale hybrid solution. With Vestas sup- plying the projects wind turbines and the control system that inte- grates the turbines, solar panels and battery storage, Kennedy illus- trates Vestas capacity to provide market-leading sustainable energy  solutions.  Vestas expects the demand for such hybrid solutions to become an  important part of the future energy mix, and having showcased the  capability to operate the first utility-scale project, Vestas is confident  that it can achieve its strategy to be the global leader in sustainable  energy solutions. Vestas market development in 2017 To be global leader in the wind power plant solutions market – one of the  four strategic objectives in Vestas strategy – in 2017, the sales organi- sation had focus on profitable growth in both mature and emerging  markets and on partnering more closely with its customers.  With deliveries across 30 countries in 2017, Vestas wide geographic  diversification remains a key strategic strength, allowing it to balance  out the inevitable ups and downs in any given market.  Vestas increasing efforts to build closer customer relationships,  expand existing customer relationships, and partner with new cus- tomers in both mature and new wind power markets, led to Vestas  experiencing order intake growth across two out of three regions and  signing orders in a total of 33 countries in 2017. This also underlines  Vestas aim to earn the right to be its customers preferred partner  – as articulated in the companys vision, see Vestas strategy, page  010.  Demand for wind turbines from Vestas 2 MW and 4 MW plat- forms remains strong. In 2017, approx. two-thirds of the order intake  was based on the 4 MW platform, while the remaining one-third related  to the 2 MW platform. Europe, Middle East, and Africa The European onshore wind energy market was stable in 2017, adding  an estimated 12 GW of new installations, similar to 2016.7)  The stable market development in Europe is founded on long-term tar- gets and policy stability for renewable energy. The EU has committed  to a 20 percent share of energy consumption from renewable sources  by 2020, and the target is distributed between the EU member states  with national action plans. Furthermore, the current target for 2030 of  27 percent has recently been proposed raised to 35 percent, though  no agreement on this has been reached yet. Northern Europe As part of Vestas goal to grow faster than increasingly competitive  markets in Northern Europe, in December of 2017, Vestas announced  the merge of its Northern European and Central European sales busi- ness units, in order to streamline the organisation and allow it to be  more competitive.  The German market continues to display its importance as Vestas sec- ond largest market overall, and the largest European market in terms  of deliveries. Other markets, such as the UK, Sweden, and Finland sup- ported Vestas performance in 2017.  Germany saw another year with high activity levels in 2017, where  installations reached more than 5 GW, an increase of 1 GW compared  to 2016.8) Vestas continues to be a key player in the German market  with 1,336 MW installed in 2017, bringing the total installed capacity  to more than 13 GW. In 2017, Germany completed the first three rounds of onshore wind  power auctions with a total volume of 2.8 GW.9) Citizen-owned wind  parks secured the vast majority of the allocated capacity. These pro- jects could enter into the auctions without a building permit, effectively  granting two additional years on top of the two-year construction win- dow to mature the projects. The permit exemption of the citizen-owned  wind parks has been revised for the first two auction rounds in 2018  and will then be analysed for future rounds, but a permanent solution  requesting a permit as pre-qualification seems likely going forward.  For the coming years, the wind power auctioning volume (including  repowering) in Germany is planned to 2.8 GW annually, split over three to  four rounds until 2019 and at 2.9 GW annually from 2020 onwards.10)  Southern Europe On one hand, electricity demand and economic conditions continue to  dampen installation levels across the countries in Southern Europe. On  the other hand, the majority of the countries remain committed to their  renewable energy targets, and have been key players in the adoption of  auctions during 2017.  Spain completed two rounds of auctions with a total of 8 GW allocated  to renewable energy. Wind energy won 4 GW of capacity that is to be  installed towards 2020, and the Spanish market is expected to be a  key market in the mid- and long term.  With expected installations of 1.2 GW in 2017, France experienced  a good year, albeit on a lower level than 2016, where installations  amounted to 1.6 GW.7) Vestas delivered 568 MW in France in 2017,  and maintains its leading position in the market. In the fourth quarter  of 2017, France also completed its first renewable energy auction of  500 MW, and is further expected to auction 1 GW throughout 2018.  In parallel, the former Feed-in-Tariff system is still in place for smaller  wind farms.11) One of the first-movers towards auctions in Europe, Italy, saw projects  continuing to materialise. With installed capacity in 2017 expected  around 250 MW7), Italy has been a stable market throughout the last  couple of years. Vestas has received orders of more than 800 MW in  total from Italian auctions. Eastern Europe One of the highlights in Eastern Europe in 2017 was the much- anticipated third round of the first renewable energy auction in Russia.  1.65 GW was awarded to wind power, and more importantly, Russia is  expected to continue to display a promising market for wind power in  the future.12) Vestas entered into a frame agreement with OOO Fortum Energy, a  joint venture between Fortum Russia and RUSNANO, to supply wind  turbines for capacity allocated in the auction. Close collaboration  between Vestas and OOO Fortum Energy led to success in the auction  and marks an important start to the promising Russian market.  Despite long-term growth potential, regulatory uncertainty continues  to take its toll on the markets in Eastern Europe. Even though several  smaller markets are experiencing steadily increasing support for  renewables, it has not been enough to compensate for the shortfall in  activity that is affecting markets such as Poland, Romania, and Ukraine. Africa and the Middle East Africa and the Middle East continue to offer growth potential, although  from a low base. In 2017, annual installed capacity is expected to have  reached 1.2GW7), which is a significant increase compared to 500 MW  in 2016.   024  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance 2017 by the numbers - Power solutions Americas Europe, Middle East,   and Africa Asia Pacific Order intake, firm and  unconditional orders 5,006 MW 4,476 MW 1,694 MW Produced and shipped   wind turbines 5,479 MW 4,135 MW 1,623 MW Under completion,  31December 2017 2,509 MW 1,279 MW 913 MW Order backlog   - wind turbines 4,504 MW 5,237 MW 1,751 MW Largest wind site completed  (take-over completed) 400 MW 110 MW 126 MW In total, 8,779 MW   delivered to customers in 8 countries 16 countries 6 countries USA 2,988MW Brazil 448MW China  578MW Japan  22MW Mongolia  50MW India 94MW Honduras  46 MW Canada 224 MW Northern Europe Germany 1,336 MW UK 499MW Denmark 304MW Finland 303MW Sweden 186MW Ireland 111MW Belgium 97MW Norway 73MW Southern  Europe France 568MW Turkey 136MW Greece 128MW Italy 35MW  Spain 22MW Uruguay  57MW Argentina  26 MW Eastern Europe Austria 83MW Ukraine 62MW Mexico  50MW Morocco  120MW 2017 deliveries worldwide Europe, Middle East, and Africa – total: 4,063MW Americas – total: 3,856MW Asia Pacific – total: 860MW Australia 70MW South Korea 46MW Curacao  17 MW  13)  Source: American Wind Energy Association: US Wind Industry Fourth Quarter 2017 Market Report.

Vestas has now installed all wind turbines for the Lake Turkana wind  power project in Kenya. Once connected to the grid, the project will  cover approx. 15 percent of Kenyas total electricity consumption.  Americas North America After a busy year-end in 2016 in the USA with customers qualifying  their projects for the maximum Production Tax Credit (PTC), 2017 was  the first year in a four-year construction window where these projects  could materialise. As a consequence, 2017 is expected to be the  softest of the four years towards 2020 in terms of installations. The  installed capacity in 2017 in the USA amounted to 7 GW.13) Among  this, Vestas delivered 2,988 MW, maintaining its leadership position in  the US market.  In December 2017, the USA reached an agreement on a tax bill. The  final version of the tax bill preserves the original terms of the biparti- san PATH act, and leaves in place the phase-down schedule and value  of the PTC. While the full impacts of the tax bill will take some time to  understand, Vestas believes the bill will enable the further growth of  the US wind energy industry. In 2017, Vestas secured orders of more than 3,500 MW in North  America, where component orders that enable future project pipeline in  the USA constituted 266 MW – most of which is expected to material- ise in 2021. Latin America  Following the introduction of auctions in several countries, the potential  for the Latin American markets remains strong. The demand for energy  security and a diversity of supply has been driving the transition towards  auctions. Countries such as Mexico and Argentina carried out their first  power auctions in 2016, and a substantial part of the new electricity  contracts were allocated to wind power. Vestas was very active with its  customers in these auctions. With more than 1.3 GW of orders in 2017  from these two markets alone, Vestas showcased its reignited efforts in  Latin America in accordance with its local strategic plan.  Brazil continued to drive installations in Latin America, albeit at a lower  level compared to the previous years. After a last-minute cancellation  of the auction in 2016, the announced auctions in 2017 were much  anticipated. Vestas delivered 644 MW to the markets in Latin America in 2017,  compared to 873 MW in 2016.  Asia Pacific Asia Pacific is expected to see an overall decline in market installations  in 2017 compared to 2016.14) An expected increased activity in the  rest of Asia will not compensate for the normalising Chinese market  and the decline in India.  The Chinese market remained the largest global wind energy market  in 2017, but annual installations declined in 2017 to 15 GW from 22  GW in 2016.15) This development is partly a consequence of a gradual  reduction of the feed-in tariff scheme started in 2016, and partly  a result of grid curtailment issues being addressed by the Chinese  authorities. China is expected to continue as the largest market for onshore wind  power. To strengthen Vestas market position in the Chinese market, the  Asia Pacific sales organisation was reorganised into two independent  sales organisations, with one focusing solely on China, and one with a  continued strong focus on the remaining Asia Pacific markets. In 2017, Vestas secured orders of 700 MW in China, compared to  490MW in 2016. Thus, Vestas continues to show commitment to the  Chinese market, and remains confident to grow its position in the market.  Indias energy sector continues its transformation towards greater  deployment of renewable energy, and remains committed to its ambi- tious target of 60 GW by 2022.16) During 2017, India introduced auc- tions for wind power, held on federal and state level. 2 GW of capacity  was auctioned. However, there were some delays in the execution of the  auctioned volume, leading to a slowdown in installations. The Indian  authorities have announced a plan for annual wind energy tendering of  10 GW for the next two financial years, 2018 and 2019, respectively,  in order to reach its renewable energy targets.17) Highlighted by the inauguration of the blade factory in 2017, the  Indian market is a strategic focus market for Vestas. In 2017, Vestas  also showcased its expanded capabilities with 350 MW of turnkey pro- jects in the country and with more than 600 MW of additional orders  announced, 2017 was a good year for Vestas in India. The rest of the Asia Pacific holds a promising long-term outlook. An  increasing demand for energy and renewable targets in place in most  countries is expected to ensure a solid future in the broader Asia  Pacific region.  Customer relations Vestas has broad access to all relevant segments and markets and  serves, directly or indirectly, a broad base of customers, including utili- ties, developers, independent power producers, pension funds, large  corporations, and others. Customer segmentation based on order intake 2017 Percent   Utilities (19%) Other (28%) IPPs* (24%) Developers (29%) 29% Representing 29 percent of  Vestas customers, developers  constitute Vestas largest  customer group, based on orders  placed in 2017. * IPPs (Independent Power Producers) include community wind power plant customers. A crucial part of Vestas strategy process is obtaining customer  insights and evaluation of the company. Vestas carries out a customer  satisfaction survey each year to understand customers priorities,  focus areas, their view on future trends and how they evaluate Vestas  competitiveness. The results are used to develop and validate Vestas  strategic priorities.   026  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance The 2017 customer survey was carried out in November, and included  820 respondents in 63 countries, representing more than 66 percent  of Vestas customers.  For the power solutions area, customers were asked to give feedback  on what they find important when choosing a wind turbine supplier in  an auction environment, and what they expect from digital services.  The responses will be used to drive discussions regarding Vestas stra- tegic priorities.  The survey results also showed that Vestas customers consider the  company to be competitive in the current environment and the majority  of the customers believe that Vestas will continue to be competitive in  the future.  Technology for the future Lowering the cost of energy remains Vestas single most important  technology objective and is the driving force for its product develop- ment and technology roadmap.  With the largest research and development investments in the indus- try, Vestas ambition is to remain the technology leader in the industry  and reduce levelised cost of energy faster than market average. To further strengthen research and development capabilities, in 2017,  Vestas established a new engineering design centre in Porto, Portugal,  which supplements sites in the UK, Germany, India, and Denmark. A  dedicated workforce of Vestas employees work at these centres with  the development of new technology. Combined with an extensive test  setup, this enables Vestas to continuously reduce levelised cost of  energy and time to market for new products and solutions while keep- ing the reliability of Vestas products at an industry-leading level.  Vestas technology roadmap ensures that it can respond effectively to  market requirements. The modularised and configurable product pro- gram, based on standard building blocks, provides a flexible portfolio of  products. This enables Vestas to offer customers tailored solutions to  match project-specific requirements and wind conditions, while main- taining the benefits of scale to drive out cost of the products. The full value chain perspective to product development also includes  a continued focus on standardisation to reduce complexities across the  value chain. Using fewer and standardised components and systems  enables Vestas to lower the cost associated with sourcing, manufactur- ing, and service, leveraging Vestas scale and global footprint. This approach has allowed Vestas to expand the number of product  variants considerably in past years, while reducing the number of  components used across the product portfolio. It also supports the  use of standardised transport, installation and maintenance solutions,  and allows for a greater level of vertical integration and localisation to  match growing demands for local content. Expanding wind turbine platforms In 2017, Vestas continued the development of its two commercially  successful platforms.  4 MW platform In June, Vestas upgraded the 3 MW platform to 4 MW with the intro- duction of three new variants, including the V150-4.2 MW, Vestas  largest onshore wind turbine. The upgrade strengthens performance  by double-digit gains in annual energy output across low, medium, and  high wind conditions.  The 4 MW platform now includes eight product variants, constituting  the most comprehensive span of products in the market, ranging from  typhoon to ultra-low wind condition, improving the platforms versatility  and customisation to match an even broader range of sites. Combined  with previous evolutionary upgrades, the platform, first launched in  2010, has seen up to 56 percent increase in annual energy production,  depending on wind class.18) 2 MW platform Vestas also carried out the fifth major upgrade to the 2 MW platform  since its first introduction in 2000 with two new turbine variants,  V116-2.0 MW and V120-2.0 MW. The new wind turbines expand  the 2 MW platform to five rotor sizes and strengthens performance in  medium, low, and ultra-low wind. Evolutionary upgrades to the platform  have now yielded up to 40 percent increase in annual energy produc- tion while staying true to the original platform design parameters. In  2017, 17 years after its introduction, the 2 MW platform reached a  significant milestone with the cumulative installation of 20,000 wind  turbines, equalling 38 GW, under the platform. The wind turbines have  been installed across 45 countries on six continents. Building on established platforms means continued leveraging of the  existing well-established global supply base and optimised transporta- tion solutions to reduce project risk and reduce cost of energy.  Expanding the applicability of wind  Vestas develops and offers a range of options that can be added to  wind power plants to suit a projects specific needs, enhance per- formance, or open up new sites to wind power. This includes Vestas  Intelilight, a new version of which was launched in 2017. The aircraft  detection system ensures that aviation lights are only activated when  required, avoiding unnecessary continuous lighting.

Exploring new technologies  Vestas is committed to remaining the technology leader in the wind  power industry in the mid and long term and manages a broad and  strong portfolio of potential new technical solutions to be applied to  future products.  One example is the cable-stayed tower, a technology that explores a  different approach to increasing annual energy production and lower- ing the cost of energy. A demonstrator project was installed in 2017 at  the test centre for large wind turbines at sterild, Denmark, to assess  the technical and commercial feasibility of the concept. Challenging  the conventional scaling rules, the technology allows for higher hub  heights while maintaining a low tower diameter, resulting in less mate- rial use and easier transportation. Vestas continued efforts to innovate and explore new technologies  also include a strong strategic focus on building partnerships with  external technology and innovation partners such as suppliers, cus- tomers, research institutes, universities as well as adjacent industries.  These partnerships provide Vestas with insights and access to new  innovations that support Vestas technology leadership.  Hybrid energy solutions While wind energy is the core of its offerings, Vestas sees a growing  potential for technology that efficiently manages wind in combination  with other energy sources. Hybrid solutions address the significant  challenge of integrating more renewable energy into grid systems,  allowing for a greater uptake of renewable energy. Exploring the oppor- tunities in hybrid power plants is in line with the updated vision: To be  the global leader in sustainable energy solutions, see Corporate strat- egy, page 010.  Combining and managing wind, solar, and storage in one system can  contribute to lowering the levelised cost of energy, facilitate market  entrance, and enable transition to a more sustainable energy mix. Vestas  has well-established competencies within system controls and grid inte- gration to be applied in this field, and has since 2012 participated in a  number of pilot projects installed in Denmark, Spain, and Greece.  In 2017, Vestas announced a partnership with Windlab Limited to  establish Kennedy Energy Park phase 1 in Australia, which will be the  worlds first utility-scale, on-grid wind, solar, and battery energy storage  project. The innovative 60 MW project will help shape a path forward  for how countries can integrate more renewable energy into the energy  mix and address grid stability challenges. Through this and a number of pilot projects, Vestas aims to gain addi- tional knowledge and experience and identify opportunities for com- mercial products and services in the area.  Intellectual Property Rights  Vestas believes that Intellectual Property (IP) assets are important and  valuable assets in the area of renewable energy. Vestas IP strategy is  based on two main principles; freedom to operate in existing and future  markets and protection of the companys IP assets. The IP strategy is  reflected throughout the Vestas value chain, including when Vestas  engages in collaborations and partnerships.  Vestas continues to file a high number of patents and has systems and  policies in place to protect Vestas IP assets, including know-how and  trade secrets. This approach safeguards Vestas technology and opera- tions, thereby safeguarding the companys investment in research and  development.  A scalable manufacturing setup In a volatile market environment, any organisation must be able to  quickly adjust to changes in demand. Vestas utilises its global reach  to generate economies of scale on new projects and to continuously  optimise its manufacturing, transportation, and sourcing costs. The  manufacturing setup of Vestas is lean and scalable – guaranteeing  delivery of high quality products to Vestas customers. This is ensured  by manufacturing of core components in-house and acquiring non-core  components from carefully chosen sub-suppliers. To ensure an optimised and competitive manufacturing and sourcing  setup, it is vital that Vestas manages its suppliers at a global level.  Vestas has secured a strong supplier portfolio by continuing its exten- sive global supplier selection process in 2017. Vestas aims to increase  its competitiveness and flexibility by optimising production and out- sourcing manufacturing where relevant. This was supported by enter- ing several new agreements in 2017 in every region. The year 2017 – continued ramp-up across global footprint 2017 was another busy year at Vestas production facilities. Work  continues in close collaboration with R&D to phase-in the various new  subsystems for the 2 MW and 4 MW platforms at Vestas factories.  In 2017, production of the 4 MW platform was introduced at Vestas  manufacturing complex in China to further support activities in the  region. Furthermore, production of the V136 blade was implemented  at Vestas blade manufacturing facility in Germany. Warranty consumption was EUR 143m in 2017, compared to EUR  90m the year before. The Lost Production Factor remains at a low level  of under 2 percent.

More than 9,500 passionate and dedicated employees are building high- quality wind turbines at Vestas factories globally. While continuously  working to optimise the production and supply chain for the benefit of  Vestas customers, the focus on ensuring high safety and quality stand- ards remains. The company constantly looks for new areas to improve  safety behaviour, with the ultimate goal being a zero-injury culture.  Vestas main safety-related key performance indicator Incidence of  total recordable injuries per one million working hours was 5.3 in  2017, the full-year target for the year being max. 6.0. The injury rate  has decreased by 46 percent in the last five years, see Social and envi- ronmental performance, page 036. Strengthening global footprint and competitiveness In March 2017, Vestas opened a new blade factory in India, the estab- lishment of which supports Vestas commitment to the Indian market.  While supplying blades to the local market, the factory will be utilised  for export purposes as well. In addition, Vestas continues to strengthen  its collaboration with external manufacturers to ensure a flexible sup- ply chain, which is key to ensure a competitive footprint.  In April, Vestas entered an agreement with TPI Composites to start  sourcing of blades in Mexico, adding to the already established third- party blades sourcing in China, Turkey, and Brazil.  028  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance In late 2017, Vestas made agreements with partners to build a manu- facturing supply chain in Russia. Together with local partners, Vestas  will set up a blade factory in the region of Ulyanovsk, providing local  jobs and a strong manufacturing footprint for the new emerging Rus- sian wind power market. In addition, a nacelle assembly factory and a  tower factory will be established by Vestas suppliers. Vestas continues to form close strategic partnerships with large suppli- ers and involve these in the development of products and processes, as  the suppliers often possess many years of knowledge and experience  that can be utilised for the benefit of both parties.  In support of the corporate strategy and vision, cost savings, and  achieving cost leadership within the wind power industry, remain a pri- ority for the company. During 2017, Vestas took a great step forward  with cost-out programmes in all markets, making its cost setup even  more competitive.  Competition remains high in all markets, so further progress on the  cost-out journey will have to continue in coming years.  Vestas continues to work on improving all parameters in the net work- ing capital, which will remain an important focus area. Vestas has manufacturing  facilities in the USA, Brazil,  Spain, Italy, Germany,  Denmark, India, and China.  In 2017, Vestas service business continued to grow its activities with an increased profitability.  In the year, revenue for the service segment reached EUR 1,522m with an EBIT margin of 20.1  percent.  Vestas reputation as a trusted service partner for customers was confirmed by 2017s order  intake. At the end of 2017, Vestas had service agreements in the order backlog with expected  contractual revenue of EUR 12.1bn, an increase of EUR 1.4bn compared to 2016. At the end of  the year, Vestas had a total of 76 GW under service across 64 countries.  Vestas wants to remain the global leader in the wind power service market, and one of the most  important ways of continuing to hold that position is through innovations and new solutions. For  example, the service contract signed with Infigen Energy in June 2017 demonstrates Vestas  competencies in servicing the customers multibrand fleets. Multibrand service is a promising  market segment where Vestas will place more focus in the coming years. An area to be further explored as well is servicing of hybrid power plants, as the Kennedy I energy  power plant in Australia, for which Vestas signed a contract in October 2017. The quality of Vestas operations and maintenance was once again cemented with a Lost Produc- tion Factor below 2.0 percent measured across more than 23,100 wind turbines with performance  guarantee.  As pointed out in Vestas corporate strategy, service growth is key as it provides a predictable  and profitable supplement to Vestas Power solutions business. In an increasingly competitive  environment, Vestas must deliver services at the lowest cost and differentiate by delivering more  value to its customers than its peers.  Vestas remains committed to its financial ambition and aims to grow the service business by  more than 50 percent organically towards 2020 versus 2016 revenue, while at the same time  delivering best-in-class margins. Activities in the Service area 029  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance A look inside the hub of a  V126-3,34 MWTM turbine  on a site in Germany, where  a Vestas service engineer  is checking the hydraulic  pitch manifolds.  030  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance Financial performance Result for the period The service market continues to grow and 2017was an exciting period  for Vestas. The service business generated revenue of EUR 1,522m  in 2017, which equals a year-on-year growth rate of 16 percent. The  increase in service revenue was mainly driven by increased activity, lev- eraging from organic growth. Importantly, the profitability of the service business improved in 2017  with an EBIT margin of 20.1 percent, compared to an EBIT margin of  17.2 percent in 2016; and increase of 2.9 percentage points. A suc- cessful integration of the two independent service providers Availon  Holding GmbH and UpWind Solutions, Inc. partly explains the solid  development in profitability. A reliable performance of the wind tur- bines under service contracts in combination with an efficient cost  management also contributed to the good margin performance for the  service operation.

Level of activity The wind turbine service market is growing faster than the market for  installation of wind turbines, and is becoming more and more important  to Vestas. Vestas service business is expanding, with a base of almost 39,000  wind turbines under service in 64 countries by the end of 2017. There- fore, the activity level has been high. Lost Production Factor Percent   0 1 2 3 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Still below 2% In 2017, the Lost  Production Factor – the  share of the wind not  harvested by Vestas  turbines – was 1.6  percent across 23,100  wind turbines with  performance guarantee. Vestas very low Lost Production Factor below 2.0 percent measured  across more than 23,100 wind turbines with performance guarantees,  combined with the growing scale of Vestas service business, enables  Vestas to offer attractive service solutions to its customers. Order backlog At the end of 2017, Vestas had service agreements in the order back- log with expected contractual revenue of EUR 12.1bn, an increase  of EUR 1.4bn compared to 2016. At the end of the year, the average  duration in the service order backlog was approx. seven years, an  increase from last year. Global trends in the wind power service market  The global wind power service market is underpinned by a strong  growth in the installed fleet of wind turbines. In 2017, the cumulative  installed capacity grew by 10 percent compared to the year before, sur- passing a notable milestone – 500 GW of installed capacity.1) The service market is a vital part of the wind power industry and it is  expected to offer stronger growth relative to the market for new wind  turbine installations. The latest market reports indicate that the ser- vice market is expected to grow by 8-9 percent annually over the next  eightyears.2) Auctions and forward-selling create new dynamics for the service busi- ness. Vestas is adapting to an environment where the ability to forecast  future trends and make decisions today is critical. Making the right pro- jections requires gathering a wide variety of information and insights.  In order to inform accurate decisions, Vestas utilises its unmatched  data processing and analytics capabilities. This allows Vestas service  offerings to become a value enabler when acting in a market with more  auctions and competitive tenders.  Vestas market development in 2017 Vestas accumulated onshore installations now comprise 88 GW. This  provides a unique platform from which to grow. Wind turbines sold with  a warranty are always sold with a service agreement as well, and the  service business is thus set to continue its positive development. For Vestas, the service market is becoming more and more important  as customers shift their focus from capital expenditures to total cost of  ownership. Vestas strategy within service remains largely unchanged  with focus on capturing scale, improving efficiency, and building the  multibrand and data business, supported by strengthening of the sales  organisation.  Leveraging Vestas data processing and analytics expertise to  strengthen its digital capabilities will be key within service, as it can  drive large value shifts for the asset owners, e.g. through lower opera- tion and maintenance costs and better asset performance visibility. One effect of a maturing wind power industry is that customers have  multiple brands of wind turbines in their fleet. In the pursuit of becom- ing a fleetwide lifetime service partner, Vestas has consequently taken  on the task of servicing non-Vestas assets. By growing services on third-party wind turbines along with keeping  renewal rates at a steady high level, Vestas aims to increase the share  of installed capacity that Vestas services. Based on estimates for the  total onshore installations at the end of 2017, Vestas services approx.  15 pct. of the global capacity.3) Financial ambitions  The service strategy is being executed according to plan and through  Vestas multitude of offerings available and increased ability to provide  fleet-wide services, the business outlook is continued growth with  stable margins. Vestas financial ambition for service remains intact: to  grow the service business by more than 50 percent organically towards  1) Source: MAKE Consulting: Installed base database.

Developments in the service business during the year Vestas four-leg service portfolio Vestas offers its customers service solutions covering all areas of the  wind power service business: maintenance partnering, parts & repair  offerings, fleet optimisation solutions, and data & consultancy services.  Maintenance partnering At the core of Vestas service portfolio is the maintenance partner- ing, based on the Active Output Management (AOM) service concept.  Through long-term partnerships, Vestas helps its customers capture  the maximum available wind to ensure the highest energy output at  the lowest cost, benefitting from Vestas scale and cost-effective global  supply-chain.  Service agreements signed with new wind turbine orders* Percent (of MW service order intake) Type of contract 2017 2016 AOM 2000 1.3  2.7 AOM 3000 3.4 4.2 AOM 4000 33.7 47.0 AOM 5000 61.6 46.1 * AOM 1000 not included as it conceptually registers as pay-as-you-go services on demand. The average length of Vestas service agreements is still showing  an upward trend, reflecting the trust that asset managers put in the  companys ability to provide a reliable and predictable return on invest- ment. Of new service contracts sold with wind turbine orders in 2017,  the predominant part – 95 percent – was either AOM 4000 or AOM  5000, the most extensive service packages where Vestas gives a per- formance guarantee. Many of the service partnerships are long-term,  sometimes with a duration of 20 years or more. Parts & repair offerings Supplementary to the operation and maintenance services, Vestas  offers an extensive range of parts & repair services. This includes up- tower repairs of major components, advanced inspection programmes,  and an eCommerce platform for wind turbine spare parts. By the end  of 2017, this digital platform, called Shop Vestas, includes more than  22,000 spare parts, making it the worlds largest wind turbine spare  parts shop.  In addition, Vestas now offers a Parts Loyalty Program, which rewards  customers that wish to have a close partnership with Vestas.  Fleet optimisation Upgrading existing wind turbines with the latest advancements within  wind technology can boost the business case of a wind power plant.  Vestas has many years of expertise within fleet optimisation and offers  a wide variety of Annual Energy Production (AEP) enhancing upgrades  – the PowerPlus series.  In 2017, Vestas added several new aftermarket enhancements to its  portfolio, including a controller upgrade for the V90-3.0 MW turbine.  Furthermore, Vestas now offers vortex generators for non-Vestas tur- bines, which are designed to enable blades to recapture some of the  lost aerodynamic ability that has been compromised to meet structural  requirements. Data & consultancy services Vestas has a data-driven culture, built off expertise from over 35 years  of experience in the wind power industry. By monitoring more than  35,000 wind turbines 24/7 across the globe and having the wind  power industrys largest wind data library, Vestas has unparalleled  insight into global wind and weather conditions.  Multibrand – meeting customers demand for   servicing non-Vestas turbines The typical customer portfolio consists of more than one brand of wind  turbines, and hence, to meet customers demand for a one-stop-shop  that provides an umbrella service solution for a mixed fleet, Vestas has  in recent years successfully expanded its service business to cover a  wide range of non-Vestas wind turbine platforms.  The acquisitions in 2015 and 2016 of UpWind Solutions, Inc. and  Availon Holding GmbH, provided an instant lift to scale and capabilities  and an even stronger service base in North America and Europe. Today,  Vestas is the preferred choice when it comes to servicing multibrand  fleets, with non-Vestas wind turbines representing approx. 10 per- cent of the total MW under service, and Vestas will continue to further  develop its competencies in this area.  Ground-breaking deals in 2017  In 2017, Vestas signed several service deals that serve to underline  the service strategy being on track.  In June 2017, Vestas and Infigen Energy signed a fleet-wide long-term  service agreement across six sites in Australia for 557 MW of Vestas and  Suzlon turbines. With this deal, Vestas will provide service maintenance  to Infigens entire operating fleet until the end of its design life, illustrat- ing the belief among customers in the Vestas multibrand concept.  With the partnership with Windlab Limited in Australia on the 60 MW  Kennedy I project in October 2017, Vestas entered a new era. The Ken- nedy wind park will be the worlds first utility-scale energy power plant,  combining wind, solar, and storage, and Vestas will not only provide  long-term service on the wind turbines, but also scheduled mainte- nance for the solar panels, battery storage, and electrical systems. Service technicians and safety For the more than 5,500 Vestas service technicians, safety always  comes first. Before entering a wind turbine, a Vestas service techni- cian receives basic safety training and hereafter follows a structured  induction, ensuring safety and technical competences to service the  customers assets at highest safety and quality standards.  Vestas provides a global management system, documentation and  testing to all service solutions provided and all technicians are ensured  best practice sharing. Continuous targets are set to drive down the  injury rate and improve the quality of Vestas products and services. Customer relations The customer landscape is changing rapidly, wind assets are chang- ing hands quicker than ever before, and new global and local players  are entering the market. New customer segments in the market are  emerging and curtailing the predominance of the global utilities. These  include large corporations aiming to consume more renewable electric- ity and global investment funds (primarily funded by pension funds)  which see wind energy as a stable investment. To respond to the changing industry dynamics, Vestas is working inten- sively on strengthening partnerships with emerging customer seg- ments by implementing a Service Key Account Management structure. Cases in point would be the strategic partnership, in which Vestas has  supported Allianz Capital Partners GmbH in optimising the perfor- mance on its existing fleet across Europe, or the partnership Vestas has  entered with IKEA, taking over the operation and maintenance respon- sibility of some of its assets in Sweden to support in reducing complex- ity in the operation and maintenance setup.  Further, the strategic partnership, announced in May 2017, with Arise  Windpower AB, which has chosen to outsource the service on its seven  wind power plants in Sweden to Vestas, as well as Infigen Energys trust  in Vestas to handle the operation and maintenance of its entire port- folio, are examples of the results of the intensified work with account  management.  2017 was another eventful year for MHI Vestas Offshore Wind A/S. Several milestones were  reached as the company continued to secure new orders, expand its manufacturing set-up, and  introduce new technology.  The companys financial performance was characterised by increased activity levels, progress on  earnings and a strong order backlog. Short-term earnings are still to be impacted by the expected  expensive ramp-up and large amortisation of the 8 MW platform.  During the year, MHI Vestas Offshore Wind won more than 700 MW of orders in Germany and con- firmed two preferred supplier agreements in the UK. The solid order intake provided conditions for  the steady ramp-up of manufacturing, underlined by a new blade painting and logistics facility in  the UK and recruitment of more than 400 employees in Denmark.  In 2017, MHI Vestas Offshore Wind successfully installed the first V164-8.0 MW turbine, and  also uprated the 8 MW wind turbine platform, enabling it to reach 9.5 MW at specific site conditions. The main priorities for MHI Vestas Offshore Wind in 2018 are focus on continued manufacturing  ramp-up, project execution, and securing profitability. Activities in the  Offshorewindpowerarea 033  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance The offshore Kentish Flats power plant  consists of 30 V90-3.0 MW turbines and  15 V112-3.3 MW turbines. The purpose  of the red marks is to make the blades  more visible when the rotor is parked for  helihoist operations.  034  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance Financial performance and accounting method Founded in April 2014 as a joint venture between Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries, Ltd. and Vestas Wind Systems A/S, MHI Vestas Offshore  Wind has equal ownership status between the two parent companies. The joint venture is accounted for using the equity method, and Vestas  share of MHI Vestas Offshore Winds overall net result for the year is  recognised in the income statement as Income from investments in  joint ventures and associates. For Vestas, the investment amounted to a loss of EUR 40m in 2017,  compared to a loss of EUR 101m in 2016. The improvement was  mainly attributable to Vestas share of loss in the joint venture on a  standalone basis being reduced during 2017, combined with timing  difference in elimination of proportional profit on deliveries from the  Group to MHI Vestas Offshore Wind. For further information about the investment in MHI Vestas Offshore  Wind, see note 3.4 to the Consolidated financial statements, page  087. Global trends in the offshore wind power market Positive outlook Offshore wind power plays an increasingly important role in the over- all energy mix. In 2017, annual installed capacity for offshore wind  power globally is expected to have reached 3 GW, compared to 2 GW in  2016.1) This indicates that offshore wind power is still a fast-growing  renewable energy technology.  This trend is expected to continue, and the outlook for the offshore  wind power industry remains positive. According to MAKE Consulting,  annual global offshore wind power installations are expected to reach  13 GW in 2026, which constitutes a compound annual growth rate of  19 percent from 2016.1) Northern Europe, with Germany and the UK in the lead, continues to be  the most mature offshore wind power markets.  In September, the UK held the second round of the Contract for Dif- ference (CfD) auction with more than 3 GW of offshore wind power  allocated, with delivery of the projects scheduled to begin in 2021. The  third round of the CfD auction is scheduled for 2019, when the unal- located budget from the second round is added to the overall budget  for this round. Germany also completed an auction round during 2017, when  1,490MW of offshore wind power projects were allocated.2) With sig- nificant reductions in bid prices, the auction highlighted the increased  competitiveness of offshore wind energy.  Looking into other European markets, the Federal Government of Bel- gium recently announced a strike price of EUR 79 per MWh for its next  round of projects.3) In the Netherlands, there is currently an open tender  for the Zuid Holland projects. The tender process will conclude in early  2018.3) The USA showed commitment to offshore wind power after the Mas- sachusetts Legislature passed a bill mandating that the states utilities  procure 400 MW of offshore wind power in 2017 – as a step to 6.2 GW  of installed capacity by 2030. It is expected that the USA will commis- sion its first large-scale offshore wind power plant by 2020.3) While China has already established a market for offshore wind power  and has set a 5 GW target by 20203), other countries in Asia are mov- ing in the same direction as well. Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are  expected to have installed large-scale offshore wind power plants by  2020.1) Reduction in the cost of offshore wind power as a key driver 2017 was a milestone year for the offshore wind power industry.  In the first round of the German offshore auction, three projects with a  total capacity of 1,380 MW were awarded with a zero-subsidy bid, and  are hence only reliant on the wholesale power price. The three projects  are planned to be commissioned in 2024, subject to a final invest- ment decision in 2021, and demonstrate that the offshore wind power  industry has made considerable progress in reducing the levelised cost  of energy. More importantly, it also highlights the confidence that the  cost of offshore wind power can be lowered even further.  As the offshore industry grows and technology improves, various play- ers turn to offshore as a realistic solution for deploying large-scale  wind power plants. This is key in order for the positive outlook for the  industry to materialise.  MHI Vestas Offshore Winds market development in  2017 During the year, MHI Vestas Offshore Wind announced two firm and  unconditional orders; its largest order ever of 450 MW for the Borkum  Riffgrund II project in Germany, and a 252 MW order for the Deutsche  Bucht project, also in Germany. Furthermore, the joint venture confirmed that it had been appointed  preferred supplier for both the Triton Knoll (860 MW) and Moray Firth  (950 MW) projects in the UK. Compared to the overall order activity in the market, the joint venture  is satisfied with the amount of orders received, and finds itself well- positioned as one of the leading offshore players.  MHI Vestas Offshore Wind has been a very active participant in the  market, and has generally had a presence in most tenders taking place  since its formation. Developments in the offshore business during the year Further upgrades to the worlds most powerful wind turbine During 2017, MHI Vestas Offshore Wind once again pushed the  boundaries of offshore wind power by launching the V164-9.5 MW  turbine, based on the 8 MW platform originally designed for the V164- 8.0 MW turbine. The increased rating is a result of great offshore  experience and deep understanding of wind turbine technology. It is  furthermore an important step in order to continue the reduction of the  levelised cost of energy for offshore wind power.  The upgrade increases energy production per wind turbine and will add  great value to future offshore projects by reducing the logistical costs,  the amount of foundations, and sub-sea electrical cabling needed.  High activity levels, and still ramping up As a result of a good order intake and a positive outlook for MHI Vestas  Offshore Winds activity levels, the joint venture is ramping up for  future production.  The current manufacturing footprint comprises blade production on  the Isle of Wright, UK and at Nakskov, Denmark, an assembly facility  at Lind, Denmark, plus pre-assembly facilities in the port of Esbjerg,  Denmark. In addition, as announced in November 2017, the company  will establish a blade painting and logistics facility at Fawley in the UK,  which is expected to be operational in April 2018.  During 2017, a state-of-the-art, 5,600 m2 Power Converter Modules  (PCM) manufacturing facility was inaugurated close to the pre-assem- bly facility at the port of Esbjerg. The expansion of the manufacturing  footprint follows a hiring ramp-up at existing production facilities in  Denmark earlier in the year, when more than 400 employees were  recruited to the blade factory and nacelle assembly facility in Denmark.  1)  Source: MAKE Consulting: Market Outlook Update.

December 2017.  035  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance MHI Vestas Offshore Wind completed the installation of 3.45 MW tur- bines for its largest offshore wind park to date, the 400 MW Rampion  project in the Southern UK. Nobelwind in Belgium (165 MW), using the  3.3 MW turbine, was likewise completed during 2017. In October 2017, MHI Vestas Offshore Wind announced a partner- ship with Clemson University in South Carolina, USA. The partnership  entails all testing and verification of the V164-9.5 MW turbines  gearbox and main bearings at Clemson Universitys 15 MW test bench.  Through utilisation of big data from the extensive testing results, the  joint venture can ensure optimum reliability and minimise the fatigue  on components. The partnership further highlights the confidence in  the competitiveness and future position of the V164-9.5 MW turbine  in the US market.  Successful installations of V164-8.0 MW turbines  During the year, MHI Vestas Offshore Wind finalised the installation  and commissioning of the 258 MW Burbo Bank Extension project – the  first large-scale project to use the V164-8 MW turbine. Installation  has also been finalised for Walney Extension in the UK (330 MW), and  Blyth in the UK (42 MW).  Financial guidance MHI Vestas Offshore Wind continues to enjoy success in the market- place and activity levels are expected to continue to increase with  factories ramping up for new installations of projects for the 8 MW plat- form. In the short-term, this will adversely impact earnings. In addition,  large amortisations of the 8 MW platform will likewise impact financial  performance. Accordingly, MHI Vestas Offshore Wind expects to double its revenue  over a three-year period from a base of its completed financial year  2015/2016, while EBITDA is expected to reach break-even by 2018  and pre-tax profit is anticipated to reach break-even by 2019.  The expected development is in line with previous internal expecta- tions, and the strong financial position secured during the first years of  operation is tailored to cope with this expected performance.

This approach strives to achieve  the companys mission of benefitting the planet in delivering best-in-class renewable energy solu- tions for Vestas customers. Vestas acknowledges that producing solutions to harness wind energy makes a small negative  impact on the environment. Together with its suppliers and customers, Vestas is committed to  reducing this impact to the greatest extent possible, and believes that it is a corporate obligation.  Minimising Vestas environmental impacts include those manifested over the operational lifetime  of a wind turbine. Progress was made in 2017, with the product carbon footprint target set for  2020 – a reduction of 5 percent versus 2015 – reached three years ahead of schedule, and a tar- get for further reduction by 2020 has been set.  Vestas continues to increase the share of renewable energy consumption and has joined the  organisation RE100, underlining the commitment to 100 percent renewable electricity. Since  end of 2016, Vestas has increased the share of renewable energy of its total energy consumption  from 52 to 57 percent. Vestas commitments to sustainability are also reflected in the Code of Conduct and supporting  policies on human rights, health, safety and environment. In 2017, the new Code of Conduct was  rolled out to employees and business partners.  To support social sustainability, Vestas conducts Social Due Diligence to ensure social risks are  mitigated and community development opportunities are identified. Such initiatives are right now  ongoing in markets such as India, Mexico, and South Africa.  In 2017, Vestas continued to reduce the number of injuries and managed to stay below the target  rate. Despite a continued reduction in injuries, a Vestas employee and a contractor employee suf- fered fatal injuries. A number of health and safety initiatives were started in 2017, complement- ing existing initiatives that continue to be rolled out. Social and environmental  performance Vestas has a goal of zero injuries and firmly  believes that all injuries can be prevented if every  hazard is managed and the correct behaviour  is in place wherever Vestas employees and  contractors are working around the globe.  1) Read more: www.vestas.com/en/about/sustainability. 2) The Codes of Conduct can be downloaded from vestas.com/en/investor/corporate_governance#!governanceprinciples. 037  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance Sustainability in Vestas Vestas vision is to be the global leader in sustainable energy solutions.  This requires a global approach to sustainability that encapsulates the  three core concepts: environmental, social, and economic sustainabil- ity. For Vestas, the concept of continuous improvements in these areas  forms the baseline for how Vestas works.  In addition to creating sustainable products, Vestas also strives to  produce them in a sustainable way. Key to sustainability at Vestas is  partnerships with customers, suppliers, and local communities. Vestas  believes that in the long term, it is in the best interests of the company,  its employees, and its shareholders to be accountable for Vestas  impact on its surroundings: the environment as well as the local,  national, and global communities. One approach, globally Vestas commitment to sustainability goes beyond producing, install- ing, and servicing wind turbines. The company is a signatory to the  international initiatives in the United Nations Global Compact and  the World Economic Forums Partnering Against Corruption Initiative.  These public commitments form the foundation of Vestas global busi- ness approach and are expressed in the companys Code of Conduct for  employees and business partners. UN Sustainable Development Goals Furthermore, Vestas approach is informed by the current global  agenda: Vestas is committed to supporting the UN Sustainable Devel- opment Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are integrated into Vestas sustain- ability approach, which allows identifying the goals where the company  can add most value.  Six SDGs have been identified, which support the approach on how sus- tainability is powering development for Vestas and for its stakeholders  and the many communities where the company plays a role. With SDG  No. 7, Affordable and clean energy as the overarching goal, the other  five selected SDGs are: Quality education (4); Decent work and eco- nomic growth (8); Responsible consumption & production (12); Climate  action (13); and Partnerships for the goals (17). The selected UN Sustainability Goals that will guide Vestas   sustainability approach. Global certificates Supporting its public commitments, Vestas operations specifically  builds on global certificates for these three standards: ISO 9001 for  Quality, ISO 14001 for Environment, and OHSAS 18001 for Health  and Safety.  In committing to, and implementing, international sustainability ini- tiatives, standards, and goals spanning the sustainability spectrum,  Vestas is able to back its intent to power sustainability, both within the  organisation and beyond. Communication on Progress (COP) Combined with additional information about Vestas sustainability  initiatives at vestas.com, this annual report constitutes Vestas Com- munication on Progress (COP)1) under the UN Global Compact. In this  way, Vestas applies the option stipulated in section 99a of the  Danish  Financial Statements Act concerning the statutory duty of large  enterprises to report non-financial information by referring to the COP  report. The principal sustainability risks and opportunities related to Vestas  operations are identified as: occupational injuries of employees and  contractors; carbon footprint of wind turbines, and impacts on human  rights in communities where Vestas operates. Policies and associated  due diligence address these risks and opportunities. Code of Conduct Vestas commitment to social sustainability is also reflected in the way  that the company works. The Vestas Employee Code of Conduct and  Business Partner Code of Conduct outline the rules and principles by  which Vestas expects its employees and business partners to behave.  These rules and principles are based on international rules and princi- ples and cover the areas of health and safety, human rights, bribery and  corruption, environment, and protection of company assets, informa- tion and reputation.2) With the launch of the new Employee and Business Partner Code of  Conducts in the fourth quarter of 2016, Vestas has been focused on  rolling out the new codes throughout 2017.  Salaried employees were introduced to the Code of Conduct in late  2016, and in 2017, the roll-out continued to include hourly-paid  employees, with a focus on increasing awareness of Vestas global  standards. As part of their introduction to the new Employee Code  of Conduct, hourly-paid employees were invited to participate in  case dilemmas and discuss issues within their teams. All new sala- ried employees are required to complete the new Employee Code of  Conduct e-learning as part of their on-boarding. High-risk employees  receive tailored face-to-face training, in conjunction with the business  ethics training. Key suppliers have been introduced to the Business Partner Code of  Conduct at supplier days, and it has been implemented in all contracts.  Business ethics Vestas compliance initiatives and processes aim to address the risks  arising from changing legal and market conditions. Development of  new initiatives as well as modification of existing initiatives works to  ensure a risk-based and adequate compliance setup. These initiatives  support an ethical behaviour among Vestas employees and business  partners by ensuring that they are familiar with its business ethical  standards. Sanction screenings and Integrity Due Diligence continue to  be an integrated part of the business.  In 2017, the main activities have been aimed at:    Increasing transparency through a company-wide web-based Gifts  and Business Entertainment Register    Ensuring risk-based screening and due diligence of business partners   Ensuring easy access for employees to information about guidelines  and contact information online for the areas covered in the Vestas  Employee Code of Conduct activities   Strengthening awareness through mandatory Code of Conduct sign- off (and associated guidelines) for all salaried employees   038  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance EthicsLine Vestas works to ensure that compliance violations are always brought  forward and dealt with accordingly. The Employee Code of Conduct  makes it mandatory for managers to report compliance violations to  EthicsLine and employees are strongly encouraged to report compli- ance violations to their managers or via EthicsLine.  Vestas continued to raise awareness of EthicsLine in 2017. Vestas  employees, business partners, and stakeholders should always feel  empowered to report unethical behaviour – anonymously or openly.  Vestas received a total of 138 cases/reports through EthicsLine in  2017, compared to 111 in 2016. EthicsLine cases Number 2017 2016 Questions submitted to EthicsLine 14 8 Compliance cases reported 105 87 – hereof substantiated 31 19 – hereof non-substantiated 74 68 Cases under investigation end of year 19 16 The substantiated cases closed in 2017, including cases opened in  2016, have led to various disciplinary actions such as 22 warnings and  14 dismissals. Human impact Vestas considers its employees to be its most important asset. There- fore, health and safety are consistently given highest priority to provide  and maintain a safe and secure workplace for all employees. Vestas is  strongly committed to human rights and employees rights, as stated in  the International Bill of Human Rights and the eight core conventions  of the International Labour Organization.  Employees Throughout 2017, Vestas has experienced an increase in activity level  within the service area. As a result, Vestas has increased its number of  employees with 1,479, compared to 2016.  Vestas employees as at 31 December 2017 FTE Europe, Middle  East, and  Africa Americas Asia   Pacific Total Power solutions 5,699 3,039 3,354 12,092 Service 5,050 2,134 1,268 8,452 Others 1,646 344 769 2,759 Total 12,395 5,517 5,391 23,303 Employee satisfaction Each year, Vestas conducts an employee engagement/satisfaction sur- vey to measure how Vestas employees perceive their daily workplace,  and subsequently finds areas where Vestas can become an even better  place to work. Vestas conducted the annual employee satisfaction sur- vey in September 2017, and the response rate was 95 percent – the  same as in 2016, which is a very satisfactory level.  The result of the overall satisfaction and motivation index was 71 in  the 2017 survey, compared to 72 in 2016. Although a small decrease  on the main satisfaction score, there is an increase in three out of eight  drivers, the rest remain the same as in 2016.  The drivers are important in working with how to improve engage- ment with employees, and the results are used as a guide for follow-up  actions. Global bonus programme All employees contribute to the same value creation and provide  support to the same customers, regardless of whether they work in  a support function or in developing, manufacturing, marketing, sell- ing, installing, or servicing wind turbines. As such, all employees are  rewarded when Vestas achieves a set of KPIs, which measure progress  on Vestas strategic goals. As the targets for bonus pay-out were achieved in 2017, a global  bonus of EUR 112m will be paid out to all employees (cash effect  2018), compared to EUR 120m in 2016 (cash effect 2017). Health and safety In 2017, Vestas reduced the incidence of total recordable injuries per  one million working hours to 5.3, compared to 6.9 in 2016, keeping  below the target of max. 6.0. A new target of max 4.8 has been set for  2018. For the more narrow category of lost time injuries, the incidence  rate was 2.0. Incidence of injuries Per one million working hours 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Lost time injury rate Total recordable injury rate 46% Through the dedicated  effort of Vestas  employees and  supervised contractors,  Vestas has managed  to reduce the total  recordable injury rate by  46 percent from 2013  to 2017. The significant improvement of total recordable injuries in manufac- turing is in part attributable to the Vestas Behavioural Change (VBC)  programme, which is now firmly implemented in 13 factories, plus at all  service sites in New Zealand and Australia. The VBC programme, which  is to be rolled out to all Vestas factories and service sites, depending  on local safety maturity, is an employee-led observation programme,  which identifies safe and at-risk behaviours with the opportunity of  immediate remedial action to prevent injuries. The VBC programme  also encourages safety dialogues between employees at every level of  the organisation. While the overall incidence rate on injuries was kept at a satisfactory  low level, a fatal incident tragically occurred in 2017, when a Vestas  service technician fell from the nacelle of a wind turbine. Investigations  by the authorities have not yet been concluded, but the incident is  nevertheless a reminder of the dangers of working at heights and the  importance of following Vestas safety procedures at all times.  In addition, in March a tragic accident occurred in India at a wind power  plant when an employee of a service contractor moved beyond the  lockout-tagout electrical isolation boundaries. He received an electric  shock and later died of his injuries. The root cause of the incident has  been identified and appropriate remedial actions implemented. Safety initiatives With the implementation of safety initiatives, Vestas contributes to  SDG No. 8, Decent work and economic growth.   3)  Return on energy varies, depending on e.g. wind turbine and wind power plant configuration, including factors such as plant siting, site-specific wind conditions (i.e. low, medium, or high  IEC wind), blade-swept area, wind turbine generator rating, and wind turbine hub height.  039  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance A key behavioural safety training programme has been developed  which, when implemented, will support the development and matu- rity of the Vestas safety culture. The programme, called My Team My  Responsibility (MTMR), complements existing Vestas safety tools and  will eventually cover all Vestas employees, customised to particular  environments and job roles. Vestas contractors will likewise be intro- duced to the programme. MTMR introductory pilots have been successfully conducted in  Northern Europe and several factories globally. A full internal MTMR  implementation roll-out plan, dependent on the safety maturity of each  region, will be identified. MTMR contractor safety workshops have also  been held in Europe, China, Australia, India, and the USA. The intention  is to carry out workshops on an annual basis. An occupational health and safety strategy was launched in 2017. The  overall ambition of the strategy is to raise the profile of occupational  health and establish and implement a baseline standard. The ultimate  goal is that when employees leave or retire from Vestas they should  be able to reflect on their career and consider that their physical and  mental wellbeing has been enhanced due to the conscientious focus  Vestas places on occupational health and safety. The first phase of this  strategy, which was to conduct a global mapping of occupational health  practices, has been completed. A white paper giving guidance to the  business will be produced and communicated.  In 2017, absence due to illness increased by 0.1 percentage points for  hourly-paid and remained stable for salaried employees compared to  2016. Social sustainability Vestas has actively integrated social sustainability into its business.  Building on its established sustainability approach, there is a natural  link to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The social sus- tainability work contributes in particular to SDG No. 4: Quality educa- tion, and SDG No. 8: Decent work and economic growth. Vestas recognises its responsibility to respect human rights as set out  in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This com- mitment, which includes its expectations for Vestas business partners,  is outlined in the Vestas Human Rights Policy and implemented across  the organisation. Vestas responsibility to respect human rights forms  the foundation of the social sustainability approach.  Social Due Diligence To support Vestas emerging markets entry strategy and ensure that  Vestas obtains the social license to operate, Vestas has developed  a Social Due Diligence (SDD) methodology. The SDD is targeted at  ensuring that social risks and impacts are identified, prevented and  mitigated in Vestas wind power plant projects.  For projects in scope, Vestas conducts an assessment of the project  and the affected local communities. The SDD enables, for example,  identification of local community development projects. The clear strat- egy to work with the SDGs therefore enables prioritisation of which  local community development projects to initiate. Vestas strives to work closely with customers to assist them in secur- ing and maintaining the social license to operate during construction  and operation of projects, according to international standards. Vestas  SDD process plays a central role in informing the dialogue with the  customer concerning its social license to operate in the particular pro- ject. In addition to the ongoing dialogue with relevant stakeholders,  the establishment of project-level grievance mechanisms available to  workers, affected local communities, and other stakeholders play a vital  role. Overall, Vestas approach contributes to lowering the societal risks  associated with a project. Local community development Vestas understands the importance of sustainably investing in local  communities. When Vestas enters new markets, builds wind power  plants, sets up new factories, or expands its existing presence, the com- pany seeks opportunities to sustainably support the local communities  in which Vestas is present, with a long-term mindset. In order to identify and prioritise opportunities, Vestas primarily  focuses on education, training, and job possibilities (SDGs Nos 4 and  8) in the local area. Examples of this work include initiatives in Mexico,  India, and South Africa, as described below.  In Tamaulipas, Mexico, Vestas has made an agreement with 16 univer- sities on education and training in the field of wind energy. In coopera- tion with the states Ministry of Education, Vestas will be offering the  training, including onsite learning, to prepare the local labour market  for the future demands in the wind power industry. In India, Vestas community development and engagement projects  relate to manufacturing facilities and service sites, as well as wind  power plants under construction, and education is a major priority area.  One ongoing initiative near Vestas new blade factory, inaugurated  in March 2017, involves training of 200 school teachers in science,  math, and environmental issues. Eventually, the aim is to reach around  20,000 primary and high school students in the Indian state of Gujarat. Similar projects have been initiated in 2017, which will benefit more  than 1,700 rural school children near the EPC project site in Karnataka  state and 250 school children in two villages near a service site in  the Maharashtra state, through technology-aided learning and a safe  school campus. The initiatives are planned to continue throughout  2018.  Apart from initiatives focused on education, in India Vestas is also  working to improve sanitation in rural communities and will reach out to  2,000 children on sanitation awareness and behavioural change. This  project includes the plan to provide around 800 rural households near  Vestas new blade factory with clean water in 2018. In South Africa, Vestas complies with the Broad-Based Black Economic  Empowerment (B-BBEE) legislation via initiatives that are aligned with  Vestas local community development approach and focus on educa- tion. Vestas works actively to improve educational outcomes in primary  school learners, increasing capacity of teachers and principals of part- ner schools, and partnering with local organisations to address the con- textual issues that hinder educational advancement. These initiatives  target primary education as a foundation that enables broad-based  economic empowerment. Environmental impact A single Vestas wind turbine:    will generate around 30 to 50 times3) more energy than it uses in its  entire lifecycle and   over its entire lifecycle only emits around 1 percent of carbon dioxide  per kWh when compared to a coal power plant.  As the wind power industry is expected to account for a growing share  of the future energy mix, it is important that Vestas acknowledges that  when producing solutions to harness wind energy, a small negative  impact on the environment is made.  Vestas is committed to reducing this impact to the extent possible,  together with its suppliers and customers, and believes that it is a  prerequisite for Vestas continued development. Improvement in wind   turbine efficiency and reduction in environmental impact both contrib- ute to SDG No. 7, Affordable and clean energy.  4)  Results are based on the ISO LCA reports published in July 2017 for the V112-3.45 MW (IEC1a), V126-3.45 MW (IEC2a) and V136-3.45 MW (IEC3a). 5)  AEP was calculated for 1 year rather than over the 20-year lifetime, giving a figure for grams waste per kWh as twenty times higher than should have been for the 2015 baseline.  040  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance A wind turbine in operation saves CO2 emissions. The CO2 savings  over the lifetime for the MW produced and shipped in 2017 were 317  million tonnes, an increase of 23 percent compared to 2016, due to a  higher amount of MW produced and shipped in 2017. Life cycle assessment In 2017, 99 percent of the MW delivered by Vestas was covered by a  publicly available, full ISO 14040/44 Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).  The LCA is used to identify and evaluate the environmental impact  throughout the lifetime of a wind power plant. Based on the LCA,  informed decisions are made to reduce overall environmental impacts. Carbon footprint The target for reduction in product carbon footprint of 5 percent by  2020 – from a baseline of 6.9 grams CO2 per kWh in 2015 – was met  in 2017. Carbon footprint has been reduced by 7.1 percent4) on wind  turbines on the 4 MW platform. This is primarily due to significantly  increased energy production in all wind classes and optimised wind tur- bine design, leading to lower material requirement per kWh. A new target has been defined, which is a reduction of carbon footprint  by 10 percent by 2020 from a baseline of 6.60 grams CO2 per kWh in  2017. The carbon footprint performance has been adjusted from the  2015 baseline, which shows a slight increase in the reported CO2 emis- sions due to these accounting changes.  Product waste Vestas target for product waste has been met and significantly  exceeded, achieving an improvement of 12.5 percent, compared to a  target of at least 3 percent versus a 2015 baseline. This is primarily  driven by advanced blade design and construction, increasing wind  turbine energy production without increasing product waste in all wind  classes.  A new target for product waste is adjusted to reflect the same scope as  carbon footprint, with a target of 7 percent reductions by 2020 versus  a baseline of 0.178 grams waste per kWh in 2017. It should be noted  that a calculation correction is made for product waste, where previ- ously the annual energy production (AEP) was calculated for one year  rather than the 20-year design life.5) The majority of a Vestas turbine is recyclable. On the road to achieving  100 percent recyclability, the composite materials of the blades com- prise the largest component yet to be made recyclable. To address this  issue, Vestas continues to work in the DreamWind project (Designing  Recyclable Advanced Materials for Wind Energy) that aims at develop- ing new sustainable composite materials for blades. Furthermore, during wind turbine operation and maintenance, Vestas  has developed new advanced repair services which include a compre- hensive offering of up- and down-tower repair solutions for gearboxes,  generators, minor components, and blades. This retains the maximum  value of materials from an environmental and circular economic per- spective. For example, Vestas Life Cycle Assessment is used to deter- mine the environmental benefits of repair, which shows up to 90 per- cent savings in material weight and up to 95 percent saving of carbon  footprint for the repaired item.  Environmental performance For Vestas activities in designing, manufacturing, installing, and  servicing wind turbines, performance is reported in terms of inputs  of resources and outputs of CO2 emissions and waste. Increased  production and service in 2017 compared to 2016 was not to the  same degree reflected in the consumption of water and energy and  emissions of CO2 and waste, which increased relatively less than the  increased production level due to improved efficiency.

From 2014 to 2017,  the water consumption  per MW produced and  shipped decreased  by 32 percent due to  higher efficiency usage. Resource utilisation In 2017, Vestas total energy consumption increased by 0.4 percent.  When index-linked to MW produced and shipped, Vestas energy con- sumption decreased 11 percent compared to 2016.

The share of renewable  energy increased by  5 percentage-points  through compensation  via Vestas-owned wind  power plants. The target for Vestas energy consumption is to reach a 60 percent  share of renewable energy in 2020 from 55 percent in 2015. The non- renewable energy is used in equal share in Power solutions and Service.  To reach the target, Vestas will improve energy efficiency, gradually tran- sition to renewable energy, and compensate with renewable electricity  from Vestas-owned wind power plants. With a combination of these  options, the share of renewable energy in Vestas total energy consump- tion increased from 52 percent in 2016 to 57 percent in 2017.  Vestas has defined a goal that 100 percent of electricity consump- tion in Vestas must come from renewable energy sources, subject to  availability, which continued to be fulfilled in 2017. This was achieved  partly by purchasing renewable electricity where available, and partly  by compensating for the consumption of non-renewable electricity with  Vestas-owned wind power plants. In 2017, Vestas joined the organi- sation RE100, whose members commit to 100 percent renewable  electricity.  041  Vestas annual report 2017  Group performance In 2017, water consumption increased by 6 percent compared to  2016, as production has started at the new blade factory in India.  When index-linked to MW produced and shipped, water consumption  decreased 6 percent compared to 2016. Emissions In 2017, the amount of waste decreased by 5 percent compared to  2016. When index-linked to MW produced and shipped in 2016,  Vestas decreased its amount of waste by 16 percent compared to  2017. In 2017, 55 percent of the total volume of waste was recycled.  The share of recycled waste increased 6 percentage point compared  to the year before due to dedicated efforts at the blade factories in the  USA. In 2017, the share of hazardous waste was 5,274 tonnes com- pared to 5,930 tonnes in 2016.

Suppliers Vestas works very closely with suppliers of components and raw  materials to improve the sustainability of Vestas products and opera- tions. The risk management process spreads over the whole product  life-cycle, starting from supplier selection. The expected conduct of its  suppliers is deployed via the Business Partner Code of Conduct and is  an integral part of purchase agreements. Vestas takes action to ensure  that suppliers comply with its policies by screening significant suppli- ers on compliance with the Code of Conduct, environment, health and  safety through the standards in a supplier assessment tool.  In 2017, monthly supplier scorecards have officially been rolled out to  129 key suppliers with significant focus on safety and other sustain- ability aspects. The suppliers scorecard performance is evaluated as  part of the monthly performance dialogue meetings with suppliers as  well as following up on the agreed development activities.  In 2017, 25 specific third-party Code of Conduct assessments have  been executed. Additionally, 186 suppliers were assessed on site by  Vestas in all regions. Of these, 116 were approved, 16 were rejected,  and 54 are under approval.  Accounting policies Accounting policies for health & safety, employees, resource utilisa- tion, waste disposal, CO2 emissions, local community, and products are  available on page 062.  042  Vestas annual report 2017  Risk management Risk management Business units and   Group Staff Functions Group Risk Management  Committee Group Risk Management Audit Committee Board of Directors Executive Management Identification Response Monitoring and communication Evaluation Enterprise Risk Management at Vestas Being a multinational company and global leader in sustainable energy solutions, Vestas is  exposed to a variety of risks in the daily business.  To create shareholder value and achieve its strategic objectives, Vestas must take risks and at the  same time actively ensure that such risks are understood, monitored, and managed to ensure that  they do not adversely impact the realisation of Vestas strategic and financial targets.  In order to support decision making in the Group, Vestas has integrated a group-wide Enterprise  Risk Management (ERM) framework. The ERM framework is a structured, consistent, and continu- ous approach to managing Vestas risk exposure and covers all types of risks across the entire  organisation. ERM is not only about identification, evaluation, and response to the individual risks,  but also about communication and providing the necessary foundation for making decisions that  are affected by combinations of risks. Enterprise Risk Management governance  Risk management is the responsibility of everyone at Vestas and all parts of the organisation  work with risk management as part of daily operation. According to the Vestas ERM framework  the risk reporting is conducted on a quarterly basis. Relevant risks across all business units and  Group functions are formally identified, assessed and reported to Group Risk Management using  the Vestas Group risk criteria in line with the risk management framework.  Key risks are discussed in the Group Risk Management Committee and mitigation activities are  evaluated for potential implementation. The Committee is chaired by Vestas CFO and includes  other senior management members from relevant parts of the business. On a semi-annual basis, the Executive Management as well as the Board of Directors review the  Groups key risks. These reviews are based on the ongoing work in the Group Risk Management  Committee and focuses on the main risks of the Group.  Financial risks, including risks related to currency, interest rate, tax, credit, and commodity expo- sures are addressed in the notes to the Consolidated financial statements, see page 096.  Enterprise Risk Management In 2017, Vestas produced and shipped 11,237 MW  and delivered 8,779 MW to its customers.  043  Vestas annual report 2017  Risk management Transition to auction-based markets  Description While renewable energy continues gaining  in importance in the global energy mix, this  is increasingly happening through com- petitive bidding and auctions and in some  markets combined with demands for local  content, which in turn is pressuring support  levels down. This increased focus on cost of  energy creates a pressure on the wind power  industry in general to live up to the new  dynamics of the competitive landscape. Impact Auction and tender systems differ from  market to market and can, depending on  their design, create uncertainties in relation  to market size, timing of order intake, and  profitability. While the intensity of competi- tion in countries with market-based policies  varies significantly based on individual  market characteristics, a common feature is  the relentless demand for lowering the cost  of energy. Mitigation Vestas monitors the developments in the  different markets and works closely with  its customers to continuously adapt sales  strategies and product offerings to meet the  different auction criteria. With its strategic  objective to lower the cost of energy faster  than anyone in the wind power industry  by offering high-performing products and  services, Vestas is well prepared to live up to  the new market dynamics. Risk connected with higher share of renewable energy Description With the economics of wind and solar photo- voltaic energy on par or even below the cost  of fossil fuel based technologies in more and  more markets, policy makers start looking at  phasing out subsidies to make renewables  fully compete in merchant power markets. In  parallel, the increasing penetration of renew- able energy in many markets is posing chal- lenges to the current way power systems  and markets are operated. Impact In markets with a high share of wind and  solar in the energy mix, a further increase of  renewables in the longer term will increas- ingly hinge on appropriate market design  and the ability to expand the current cost  focus to increase the value of the produced  electricity and open up new revenue streams  for Vestas customers. On the other hand,  operating in merchant power markets will  significantly lower policy risks through  reducing reliance on support systems.  Merchant competition has furthermore the  potential to open up larger market volumes  as renewable energy is increasingly out- beating fossil energy on costs. Mitigation Vestas is proactively working on turning the  forthcoming challenges into business oppor- tunities. Vestas advanced wind turbine  design and hybrid projects for example allow  not only increasing full load hours (thus  increasing the market value of the produced  electricity) but contribute to easing system  integration by firming power production  compared to classical wind turbines. Fur- thermore, Vestas engages with its partners  to create the future market frameworks to  enable its customers to successfully com- pete in merchant conditions – turning chal- lenges into business opportunities. Main Group risks  The main risks of the Group are:   Transition to auction-based markets    Risk connected with higher share of renewable energy   Cyber risks    Adapting to markets with greater complexity, hereunder sanctions and social performance  044  Vestas annual report 2017  Risk management Cyber risks Description As many other corporations, Vestas depend- ence on its commercial, technical, and opera- tional IT infrastructure is significant and  hence, Vestas is exposed to potential loss or  harm related to this. Impact Risks include economical theft and theft of  intellectual property rights or personal data,  which may result in monetary losses in the  form of lost business opportunities or fines  and penalties from authorities. Malicious hacking activities can in addition  harm the infrastructure and create physical  loss of property and consequential dif- ficulties for Vestas to meet its contractual  obligations. Mitigation Vestas works systematically to educate its  organisation in methods to address expo- sure and is continuously working on improv- ing the technical ability to protect against,  detect and to respond to any attempts to  enter its commercial, technical, and opera- tional IT infrastructure. Adapting to markets with greater complexity, hereunder sanctions and social performance Description A number of the markets in which Vestas is  exploring business opportunities have char- acteristics, that differ from the more mature  markets in Europe and the USA. Some of the  main differing areas and risks to be under- stood and addressed are:    Security in relation to employees and  subcontractors   Corporate social responsibility in relation  to local communities   Corruption in the country or sector   Sanctions and export control according to  international law   Protection of intellectual property rights  Impact The adverse impacts related to risks in  complex markets are many and different  but amongst others, adverse reputational  impact or legal implications may occur if  risks are not mitigated. Risks related to intellectual property rights  may amongst others lead to reductions  in the competitive positioning of Vestas,  whereas other risks may prevent Vestas  from engaging in business relationships or  undertaking projects. Mitigation To prevent and mitigate potential risks  within these areas, Vestas uses a stage  gate-based process to systematically evalu- ate and adapt the project offering during  the contracting, construction, and servicing  phases of the projects.  045  Vestas annual report 2017  Corporate matters Vestas on the capital markets At the Hvsre test centre for wind turbines in Denmark,  Vestas is testing the newest technology before it is  released for sale.

For  further information about the remuneration of the Executive Manage- ment, see Remuneration report, page 055. Corporate green bond On 11 March 2015, Vestas issued a EUR 500m green bond to  finance its general corporate purposes, ref. company announcement  No. 11/2015 of 4 March 2015. The bond will mature on 11 March  2022 and the coupon of the bond is 2.75 percent. The bond is listed  on the Luxembourg Stock Exchanges regulated market – ISIN code  XS1197336263. The green bond benefits from a second party opinion provided by  certification institute DNV GL. The bond allows Vestas to diversify and  optimise its funding structure. Financial management  Vestas management continuously monitors to which extent the compa- nys capital structure, including equity and other financial resources, are  reasonable in consideration of the Groups operations and the stakehold- ers interests, see Capital structure strategy, page 015. Authorisations granted to the Board of Directors  According to article 3 of the Articles of association, the Board of Direc- tors of Vestas Wind Systems A/S is authorised to increase the compa- nys share capital in one or more issues of new shares up to a nominal  value of DKK 22,407,451 (22,407,451 shares). The authorisation is  valid until 1 March 2019.  At the Annual General Meeting in 2017, the shareholders authorised  the Board of Directors to let the company acquire treasury shares in the  period until 31 December 2018 equal to 10 percent of the share capi- tal at the time of the authorisation, provided that the nominal value of  the companys total holding of treasury shares at no time exceeds 10  percent of the companys share capital at the time of the authorisation.  Distribution to shareholders  The Boards general intention is to recommend a dividend of 25-30  percent of the years net result after tax, which will be paid out following  the approval by the annual general meeting. In addition, Vestas may  from time to time supplement with share buy-back programmes. How- ever, any distribution of cash to shareholders will always be decided  with due consideration of capital structure targets and availability of  excess cash. Determining the level of excess cash will always be based  on the companys growth plans and liquidity requirements. Dividend On 6 April 2017, the shareholders approved a dividend of DKK 9.71  per share to be paid out for the financial year 2016. This was equiva- lent to a dividend percentage of 30.0 percent measured against the  net profit for the year.  For the financial year 2017, the Board of Directors proposes a dividend  of DKK 9.23 (EUR 1.24) per share equivalent to 29.9 percent of the  net result for the year after tax.

Share buy-back programmes 2017 On 8 February 2017 and on 17 August 2017, the Board of  Directors  initiated new share buyback programmes. The programmes were  implemented in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation No. 596/2014  of the European Parliament and Council of 16 April 2014.  The main purpose of the share buy-back programmes was to adjust  Vestas capital structure and secondly to meet the obligations arising  from share-based incentive programmes to employees of Vestas. They  were completed on 4 May 2017 and 29 December 2017, respectively.  In total, Vestas paid DKK 5.2bn for 10,503,515 shares. Share capital reduction On 8 May 2017, the company reduced its share capital by a nominal  value of DKK 6.0m. The capital reduction was carried out through the  cancellation of 6,047,780 treasury shares in accordance with the  resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting on 6 April 2017. At Vestas Annual General Meeting in 2018, a resolution will be pro- posed that 9,800,944 shares out of Vestas holding of 11,843,929  treasury shares will be cancelled.  Holding of treasury shares Number Treasury shares as at 31 December 2016 7,770,888 Reduction of the share capital (6,047,780) Bought under the share buy-back programmes +10,503,515 Exercised share options and performance shares (382,694) Total holding of treasury shares as at 31 December 2017 11,843,929 Incentive schemes Members of the Executive Management and other specified senior  management level positions are eligible for participation in a share- based long-term incentive programme. The purpose of the share-based  programme is alignment with shareholders interests and to promote  long-term performance and retention. For further information about the  programme, see Remuneration report, page 055. In May 2017, the Board of Directors authorised the Executive Man- agement to distribute 310,000 restricted performance shares to the  Executive Management and other specified senior management level  positions in accordance with the general guidelines for incentive pay  for employees of Vestas. Open dialogue with the capital market Vestas aims to be visible and accessible to existing and potential  shareholders and bond holders, the financial community, and other  stakeholders with due consideration to legislative requirements and in  order to promote transparency.   047  Vestas annual report 2017  Corporate matters Vestas attaches great value to maintaining an open dialogue with its  stakeholders, therefore the Executive Management and Investor Rela- tions travel extensively to ensure that all investors with a major holding  of Vestas shares and the financial community can meet with the com- pany on a regular basis and other shareholders and potential investors  also have access to the companys Management and Investor Relations.  Furthermore, the Investor Relations team and members of the CSR  team have participated in conferences with a focus on sustainability. Being a listed company, Vestas must make every attempt to give all  stakeholders a true and fair view of Vestas. Therefore, relevant informa- tion is disclosed in a manner which enables fast access and complete,  correct and timely assessment of the information by the public. This  has a high priority for the Board of Directors.  Vestas aims to continuously improve the communication with its  shareholders to inform about Vestas goals and to safeguard long-term  shareholder interests. However, in order to optimise communication, it  is necessary for Vestas to know the identity of its shareholders. Vestas  therefore recommends that its shareholders have their Vestas shares  registered by name in the companys register of shareholders.

This includes how the company is organised, its  governance principles, monitoring mechanisms, and internal and exter- nal controls. The purpose of corporate governance is to support value  creation and accountable management, and thus to contribute to the  long-term success of companies.  Having an open and transparent corporate governance supports a com- pany in being directed and monitored in a responsible manner – and  in management focusing on creating value. Furthermore, it provides  the market with timely, reliable, accurate, and up-to-date information  – which fosters the confidence of investors, the financial markets, cus- tomers, business partners, employees, and the public in general. Management structure The fundamental elements of Vestas Wind Systems A/S corporate  governance system are its two-tier management structure with a clear,  transparent, and effective separation between the Board of Directors  and the Executive Managements responsibilities and tasks in connec- tion with the management of the companys affairs and no one serves  as a member of both. A list of various documents dealing with rules, regulations, and govern- ing principles, that are followed by Vestas are available at vestas.com/ en/investor/corporate_governance#!governanceprinciples. Shareholders Shareholders have ultimate authority over the company and exercise  their rights of co-administration and supervision at general meetings,  which usually take place within the first four months of the business  year. All shareholders are entitled, in compliance with a few formal require- ments, to have access, to submit proposals, attend, vote, and speak at  general meetings, ref. articles 4 and 6 of the Articles of association. Shareholder rights The right of a shareholder to attend a general meeting and to vote is  determined by holding of shares at the record date. The record date is  defined as one week before the general meeting. The number of shares  held by each shareholder at the record date is calculated on the basis  of registration of the shareholders ownership in the register of share- holders (or notifications about ownership received by the company, but  which has not yet been registered in Vestas register of shareholders). Shareholders, who wish to attend a general meeting, must notify  Vestas of their attendance no later than three days before the general  meeting in question. Corporate governance Vestas management structure Chairmanship Technology & Manufacturing Committee  Nomination & Compensation Committee Audit Committee Board of Directors Executive Management Shareholders The MHI Vestas Offshore joint ventures  V164 nacelle assembly facility is located  at the port of Lind, Denmark.  049  Vestas annual report 2017  Corporate matters Vestas has a single class of shares, and no shares carry any special  rights. Each share carries one vote. Proposals put to the vote are  adopted by a simple majority of votes, unless the Danish Companies  Act or the Articles of association prescribe special rules regarding  the adoption. Amendments to the Articles of association, dissolution,  demerger, and merger, which under Danish law must be passed by  the general meeting, can only be passed by a majority of no less than  two-thirds of all votes cast and of the voting capital represented at the  general meeting unless otherwise prescribed by the Danish Companies  Act. For information on the share capital distribution of the Vestas  share, see Vestas on the capital markets, page 045.  Audit Vestas annual report is audited by an independent external audit firm  elected annually by the shareholders at the annual general meeting.  Retiring auditors are eligible for re-election.  The auditor is obligated to act in the interest of the shareholders, as  well as the public. The Board of Directors and Executive Management  grant the auditor access to make any investigations, they find neces- sary, and ensure that the auditor receives the information and the  assistance needed for them to exercise their duties. The Board of Direc- tors maintains a regular dialogue with the auditor, however, it is the  responsibility of the Audit Committee to make arrangements for the  necessary exchange of information. The external auditor attends all meetings of the Audit Committee, as  well as the meeting of the Board of Directors at which the annual report  is adopted. In 2017, the auditor participated in one meeting with the  Board of Directors and in seven meetings with the Audit Committee. The contractual basis and thereby the scope of the auditors work,  including any non-audit related services, is agreed between the com- panys Board of Directors and the auditor based on a recommendation  from the Audit Committee. The Executive Management and the auditor  define the specific scope of the auditors services, and the auditors fee  is agreed with the Board of Directors, see note 6.1 to the Consolidated  financial statements, page 110.  For the Independent Auditors Report and the Independent Auditors  Limited Assurance Report regarding this annual report, see pages  123 and 126. Appointment of the auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers has been the auditor of Vestas since 1998.  The last public call to tender was made to all auditors for the audit of  the 2009 consolidated financial statement, in line with the EU regula- tion 537/2014 of 16 April 2014. Based on the results of the tender- ing process, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Direc- tors that it proposed PricewaterhouseCoopers for election in 2010.  After completing the tendering process, PricewaterhouseCoopers can  therefore be proposed for election at the annual general meeting as  Vestas auditor without further tendering processes up to and including  the business year 2023. In April 2017, the Annual General Meeting re-elected Pricewater- houseCoopers as Vestas external auditor for the financial year 2017.  Kim Fchsel has been the signing partner for the annual reports 2016  and 2017 and Kim Tromholt for the annual reports 2015, 2016, and  2017. Policy for audit services and non-audit services One area of particular focus in corporate governance is the independ- ence of the auditor. The Vestas Groups auditor can, within certain limits,  be used for certain non-audit services and may be the preferable choice  due to business knowledge, confidentiality, and cost considerations.  Vestas has a policy for non-audit services ensuring that the provision of  non-audit services to the Group does not impair the auditors independ- ence or objectivity. The Audit Committee is responsible for the develop- ment and maintenance of this policy and monitors compliance.  During 2017, audit and non-audit services provided by the Group audi- tors globally totalled EUR 6m, of which 56 percent is audit related ser- vices – the ratios have been calculated in accordance with guidelines  worked out by certain proxy advisors. Excluding significant projects  considered one-off in nature, audit related services accounted for 61  percent of audit and non-audit services provided by the Group auditor  globally.  Internal audit Once a year, the Audit Committee assesses the need for an internal  audit function. The committee found that it was not necessary to estab- lish an internal audit function in 2017. Board of Directors Pursuant to the companys Articles of association, the company is man- aged by a Board of Directors composed of five to 10 members elected  by the general meeting and a number of representatives elected by the  employees.  Composition of the Board The Board of Directors currently consists of 12 members, of which  eight are elected by the general meeting and four are elected by and  among the employees. For further information about the members of  the Board of Directors of Vestas Wind Systems A/S, see pages 054  and 060.  In 2017, the Annual General Meeting re-elected all members of the  Board of Directors. After the Annual General Meeting, the Board of  Directors held a statutory board meeting. At the meeting, Bert Nord- berg was re-elected as Chairman of the Board and Lars Josefsson was  re-elected as Deputy Chairman of the Board. Election of Board members Board members elected by the general meeting may be recommended  for election by the shareholders or by the Board of Directors, serve a  one-year term, and may be re-elected. When proposing candidates for Board membership, the Board of Direc- tors seeks to ensure that it is possible for the general meeting to elect a  continuing Board of Directors that:   is able to act independently of special interests;   represents a balance between continuity and renewal;   matches the companys situation;   is knowledgeable of the industry and has the business and financial  competencies necessary to ensure that the Board of Directors can  perform its duties in the best way possible; and,   reflects the competencies and experience required in order to manage  a company with shares registered for trade on a stock exchange and  fulfils its obligations as a listed company. When proposing new Board candidates, the Board of Directors pursues  the goal of having several nationalities of both genders represented.  In addition, the Board of Directors focuses on having a diverse age dis- tribution, see the statutory report on gender distribution, page 051.  However, these goals must not compromise the other recruitment  criteria.  The Boards responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for the overall operation of  the Group and, through the independent oversight of management,  accountable to shareholders for the performance of the business. They  also deal with the overall and strategic management of the company,  including:   appointing the Executive Management;   laying down guidelines for and exercising control of the work  performed by the Executive Management;   ensuring responsible organisation of the companys business;   defining the companys business concept and strategy;   ensuring satisfactory bookkeeping and financial reporting;   ensuring the necessary procedures for risk management and internal  controls; and  050  Vestas annual report 2017  Corporate matters   ensuring that an adequate capital contingency programme is in place  at all times. In cooperation with the Executive Management, the Board of Directors  establishes and approves overall policies, procedures and controls in  key areas, not least in relation to the financial reporting. This requires  a well-defined organisational structure, unambiguous reporting lines,  authorisation and certification procedures, and adequate segregation  of duties. Board committees The purpose of Vestas Board committees is to prepare decisions and  recommendations for consideration and approval by the entire Board  of Directors. The committees are not authorised to make independent  decisions; instead they report and make recommendations to the entire  Board of Directors. Vestas has established three permanent Board committees and all  members of the committees are elected by the Board of Directors from  among its members. Information about the members of each commit- tee, charters, and an overview of their activities in 2017 are available  at vestas.com/investor/corporate_governance. Duties of the board committees Audit Committee – supports the Board of Directors in assessments  and controls relating to auditing, accounting policies, systems of inter- nal controls, financial reporting, procedures for handling complaints  regarding accounting and auditing, the need for an internal audit func- tion, and Vestas ethics and anticorruption programmes.  The Nomination & Compensation Committee – supports the Board  of Directors in evaluation of the performance and achievement of  the Board of Directors and Executive Management and overall staff- related topics, including assessments of remuneration. The Technology & Manufacturing Committee – assists the Board of  Directors in assessing technological matters, IPR strategy, and product  development plans. The committee also supports the Board in matters  concerning production, monitors and evaluates the short- and long- term manufacturing footprint, evaluates sustainability performance,  and gives support to forums such as Vestas Product Portfolio Council,  Product Value Chain Board, and Product Portfolio Board, which also  handle prioritisation of and investments in innovation and concept  development. Meeting attendance Members Meetings Board of Directors Seven of the nine meetings were attended by all  members, whereas three members were excused from  one meeting each. 12 9 Audit Committee Six of the seven meetings, were attended by all  members, whereas one member was excused from  one of the meetings. 3 7 The Nomination & Compensation Committee All members attended the four meetings. 4 4 The Technology & Manufacturing Committee All members attended the four meetings. 4 4 Assessment of the work performed by the Board of Directors Once a year, the Board of Directors evaluates its working methods and  the results of its work, the skills of its members, including whether each  Board member participates actively in board discussions and contrib- utes with independent judgement.  In October and November 2017, the three Board committees evalu- ated their performance for 2017. The evaluations were conducted as  an open dialogue among the members of the committees and facili- tated internally by the chairmen. An evaluation form was made avail- able to guide the members of the committees in their preparation and  to make sure that all relevant issues were touched upon in connection  with the evaluations. The assessment included an evaluation of: the  working climate and cooperation, competence, board work, and role of  the chairman. The self-assessment revealed a good collaboration in  each of the committees and between the committees and the Execu- tive Management.  The same procedure was used when the Board of Directors conducted  its evaluation in November 2017. The evaluations did not result in any  significant changes. An evaluation report is prepared for the three committees and the  Board of Directors – comprising the result of the assessments. These  reports are used by the Nomination & Compensation Committee when  they propose nomination of members to the Board of Directors and  members of the Board Committees. Remuneration The remuneration of the Board of Directors is approved each year at  the annual general meeting. For further information, see Remuneration  report, page 055. Executive Management The Executive Management of Vestas Wind Systems A/S is appointed  by the companys Board of Directors and among the members of the  Executive Management they have appointed a Chief Executive Officer  who is the manager of the day-to-day work of the Executive Manage- ment. Their remuneration is determined by the Board of Directors.  The remuneration report for the financial year 2017 is available on  page058. Moreover, the Board of Directors lays down the distribution of compe- tences among the members of the Executive Management. Executive  Management meets at least once a month and often more frequently. In 2017, the Board of Directors has not made any changes to the com- position of the Executive Management. For further information about the  members of the Executive Management, see pages 054 and 061.  The Executive Managements responsibilities  Executive Management is responsible for the day-to-day management  of the company, observing the guidelines and recommendations issued  by the Board of Directors. The Executive Management is also responsi- ble for presenting proposals for the companys overall objectives, strat- egies, and action plans as well as proposals for the overall operating,  investment, financing, and liquidity budgets to the Board of Directors.  Furthermore, they monitor compliance with relevant legislation and  other financial reporting regulations and provisions. Assessment of the work of the Executive Management The Nomination & Compensation Committee has the responsibility of  conducting an annual evaluation of the contributions and results of the  individual members of the Executive Management – and the combined  Executive Management; and the co-operation between the Board of  Directors and the Executive Management. The result of the assessment conducted in 2017 revealed good col- laboration between the Board of Directors and Executive Management.  Remuneration For information about the remuneration of the Executive Management,  see Remuneration report, page 055. Corporate governance principles Corporate governance, defined as the system used to manage and  control a business, is to a wide extent reflected in the provisions con- cerning the Board of Directors set out in the Danish Companies Act. What is corporate governance for Vestas? To the Board of Directors of Vestas Wind Systems A/S, corporate gov- ernance is not just a set of rules but a constant process. Consequently,   051  Vestas annual report 2017  Corporate matters the Board of Directors continuously addresses the guidelines and pro- cesses for the overall management of the Vestas Group. This ensures  that the management is at any time able to conduct its managerial  tasks professionally and in due consideration of applicable law, prac- tices, and recommendations. Clear guidelines provide a true and fair view The evaluation of the guidelines and processes includes a review of  the companys business model, strategy, business processes, goals,  organisation, capital position, stakeholder relations and risks as well as  exercise of the necessary control. The Board of Directors finds that clear guidelines on how to manage  and communicate at Vestas help provide a true and fair view of the  Group to the world. A clear and well-considered management and com- munication strategy is of special importance in light of the challenges  Vestas faces in a market characterised by fierce competition, expected  consolidation, and ever-increasing quality requirements. Financial reporting risks Based on Vestas financial risk management policy, the Group Finance  function prepares a description of the key risks relating to financial  reporting and measures taken to control such risks. Group Finance works actively with anchoring financial risk manage- ment throughout the organisation, including ensuring systematic  identification and management of all relevant risks relating to financial  reporting. As part of the financial risk assessment, the Board of Directors and  Executive Management annually assess the risk of fraud and the  measures to be taken to reduce and/or eliminate such risks, includ- ing assessing any possibility of the general management overriding  controls and affecting the financial reporting. Read more about risk  management on page 042. Control activities Group Financial Compliance is responsible for the implementation,  monitoring, and reporting of Vestas global financial processes and the  internal control framework. This helps to ensure a uniform design and  structure of the Groups internal controls. The objective of the Groups  control activities is to ensure financial compliance with the targets, pol- icies, manuals, procedures, etc. defined by the Executive Management. Furthermore, the activities must help ensure that any errors, devia- tions, and shortcomings are prevented, discovered, and rectified. Vestas continuously adjusts and implements global financial pro- cesses and controls for all units and functions aimed at further mitigat- ing the risk of incorrect financial reporting. Information and communication Vestas policies, adopted by the Board of Directors, lay down, among  other things, overall requirements on financial reporting and external  financial reporting in accordance with current legislation and applica- ble regulations. The information systems are designed to identify, collect, and commu- nicate relevant information, reports, etc. on an ongoing basis and on all  levels to facilitate an effective, reliable workflow and the performance  of controls. This is done in due consideration of the confidentiality  required as a listed company. Statutory report on corporate governance Pursuant to section 107b of the Danish Financial Statements Act and  clause 4.3 of Rules for Issuers of Shares – Nasdaq Copenhagen, listed  companies shall give a statement on how they address the recommen- dations on corporate governance issued by the Danish Committee on  Corporate Governance. The recommendations of the report specify that  the circumstances of each company will govern the extent to which the  recommendations are complied with or not, as the key issue is to create  transparency in corporate governance matters.  Vestas statutory report, which is part of the annual report, is available  at vestas.com/investor/corporate_governance#!statutoryreports.  Vestas follows all recommendations of the Danish Corporate Govern- ance recommendations except from three recommendations which  Vestas partly complies with. Danish recommendation regarding corporate governance Number 2017 2016 Complies with the recommendation 44 43 Partly complies with the recommendation 3 4 Does not comply with the recommendation 0 0 Number of recommendations 47 47 Statutory report on gender distribution As required in section 99b of the Danish Financial Statements Act,  Vestas has a policy to offer all employees equal opportunities and aims  for a more equal distribution of gender among employees in leadership  positions. But, Vestas does not compromise on qualifications and will  continue to employ the most qualified candidate regardless of gender,  political, religious, or personal orientation. Vestas has a global organisation and the employee base is becoming  more and more diverse. The management believes that having employ- ees with many different skills, backgrounds, and experiences benefits  the Group and equips Vestas to more effectively address the global  challenges ahead. In general, men are over-represented in Vestas. This is not unusual in  the industry, which traditionally has more job roles attracting men than  women. These are primarily technical and manufacturing roles such as  engineers, technicians, and industrial workers.  Follow-up and reporting In January, Executive Management receives a report which describes  the development of the share of women and men at the various man- agement levels. If the share of either women or men at management  level is below 40 percent, Executive Management evaluates the need  for further actions. Once a year, the Nomination and Compensation Committee discusses  the status of diversity and the strategy for the diversity area in Vestas  for the coming year – and the Board of Directors discusses the overall  principles regarding diversity. In the annual report, Vestas will report on the progress against the tar- get setting in accordance with ref. section 99b of the Financial State- ments Act. The Board of Directors of Vestas Wind Systems A/S The Board of Directors believes that its members should be chosen  for their overall competences, yet it also recognises the benefits of a  diverse board in respect of culture, gender, and other factors. The Board of Directors pursues the goal of having members represent- ing multiple nationalities as well as both genders. In addition, the Board  of Directors focuses on having a diverse age distribution. However,  these goals must not compromise the other recruitment criteria. In compliance with legislation, Vestas has set a target for the under- represented gender in the Board of Directors. The target has been  reached, as the number of the under-represented gender has increased  in the period from one to two. Further information about the composi- tion of the Board of Directors is available at vestas.com/investor/ corporate_governance.  1)  According to the Danish Business Authorities definition, see Danish Business Authorities: Guidelines on target figures, policies and reporting on gender composition of management.  March 2016.  052  Vestas annual report 2017  Corporate matters Vestas will continue working on expanding the under-represented  gender in the Board of Directors and has adjusted the target that is  expected to be reached no later than end 2021. The target is to reach  equal gender distribution1) among the members of the Board of Direc- tors of Vestas Wind Systems A/S elected by the general meeting within  four years.   Development in gender distribution in the Board of  Directors of Vestas Wind Systems A/S Percent 0 20 40 60 80 100 2013 Target 2021 2017 12 78 25 75 37.5 62.5 Female Male New target The new target set in  2017 is to reach equal  gender distribution  within four years. The Board of Directors of Vestas subsidiaries  Among the Groups Danish subsidiaries, five companies are subject to  the reporting requirement for the under-represented gender according  to section 99b in the Danish Financial Statements Act. The directors in the boards of the subsidiaries are appointed based on  key positions in Vestas Wind Systems A/S, and the current constitution  of the boards is therefore reflecting who is currently holding these posi- tions within Vestas Wind Systems A/S. In 2013, the five subsidiaries set a target to reach equal gender dis- tribution no later than 31 December 2017. During the period, all five  subsidiaries have reached the target – which means that all five sub- sidiaries have an equal gender distribution in their boards among the  members elected by the general meeting. Therefore, a new target will  not be set. Vestas policy on gender distribution The purpose of Vestas gender dis- tribution policy is to describe and support the on-going work at Vestas  on increasing the number of the under-represented gender in manage- ment positions in Vestas and by that enhance a more equal distribution  of the number of men and women.  In that respect, Vestas strategic objectives also comprise that Vestas  obtains a more equal distribution of men and women in management,  and that the composition of managers reflects the distribution of  women and men in the labour market in the longer run, however, always  considering competencies when deciding who are the best qualified  persons for the job. Processes Each year a People Review process is carried out, where the major- ity of employees are being evaluated. In this process the employees  manager, the manager of the latter and colleagues and a representa- tive from People & Culture participate. Based on the results, a profile  description is worked out including a description of management capa- bilities and potential of the employee and the potential for promoting  the employee. Based on the People Review evaluations, Vestas obtains  a tool to support that recruitment of managers internally and promo- tions are carried out in consideration of Vestas objectives to ensure  everyone equal career opportunities.  Naturally, the distribution of men and women in management positions  is considered in that connection. In continuation hereof, Vestas will not  accept any kind of differential treatment and is therefore obliged to let  qualifications be the only deciding factor in all aspects of employment,  including recruitment, development, and promotion.  Activities in 2017 In November 2017, the Nomination & Compensation Committee dis- cussed the status of diversity and the strategy for the diversity area  in Vestas for the coming year – and in November 2017, the Board of  Directors discussed the overall principles regarding diversity.  Vestas is working with several activities to ensure relevant diversity at  management levels, such as:   Assuring that both genders are represented in the search process –  and in the last process of the selection of the new employee.   Improve the terms for maternity and paternity to become more  attractive to young professionals in Denmark.    Exposing the engineering opportunities to women, including specific  events for female engineering candidates.   Hosted events for female engineering students at Vestas technology  centre.   Participated in events aimed at female business students. Vestas initiatives related to gender focus on building a pipeline of  female talents both outside and inside Vestas through the internal  talent and development programmes, such as situational leadership  training and leadership transition programmes. These programmes are  offered to all leaders in Vestas, giving all equal opportunity.  Women at management level Percent 0 5 10 15 20 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 +2%-points During a period of four  years, the share of  women at management  level has increased by 2  percentage points. In 2017, the share of women at management level within Vestas was  19 percent, which means that from the implementation of the policy  regarding gender distribution and until 2017 the share of women both  in the Board of Directors and at management level has increased by 13  percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively.  053  Vestas annual report 2017  Corporate matters The Annual General Meeting of Vestas Wind Systems A/S will be held on  3 April 2018 at 1:00 pm (CET) at the Concert Hall in Aarhus, Denmark.

March 2017. 055  Vestas annual report 2017  Corporate matters Any management which defines an ambitious strategy – and sets  short- and long-term targets – needs a dedicated management team  with the right competences and visions to succeed. In order to attract and retain a talented management it is important  that an attractive compensation is granted while safeguarding the  companys interests through long-term targets, which is in the interest  of the shareholders. With Vestas strategy – Profitable Growth for Vestas, the Board of Direc- tors has clearly shown in which direction it wants to take the company –  and it is up to the Executive Management to execute on the strategy. During the last four years, Vestas Executive Management has man- aged to guide more than 23,000 employees through the turnaround  and has executed on the Profitable Growth strategy, which the figures  for the period shows. It has been a challenge – and will also be a challenge in the future – but  with the right composition of the Board of Directors, the right members  of the Executive Management, and a committed group of employees,  Vestas will perform for the benefit of the shareholders but also for the  benefit of the environment. The shareholders have approved overall guidelines for how the Board  of Directors and the Executive Management of Vestas Wind Systems  A/S should be compensated for their management of the Group. The  guidelines are laid down in Vestas remuneration policy and the general  guidelines for incentive pay, which most recently was approved by the  shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2016. The remuneration policy and the general guidelines for incen- tive pay are available at vestas.com/en/investor/corporate_ governance#!corporate-documents. Remuneration policy The remuneration policy for members of the Board of Directors and  the Executive Management1) of Vestas Wind Systems A/S reflects  the interests of the shareholders and the company, taking into con- sideration the assignments and the responsibility undertaken by such  members. The remuneration policy promotes performance and aims  at attracting and retaining talented executives while safeguarding the  companys interests through long-term targets. General guidelines for incentive pay Pursuant to section 139 of the Danish Companies Act, the Board of  Directors is required to establish general guidelines for incentive pay  before entering into incentive pay agreements with members of the  companys Board of Directors and Executive Management. The objective of the guidelines is to lay down the framework for the  variable portion of the salary considering the companys short and  long-term targets, and to ensure that the pay system does not lead to  imprudence, unreasonable behaviour, or risk acceptance. Remuneration of the Board of Directors Efforts are made to ensure that the remuneration of the Board of Direc- tors matches the level in comparable companies, whilst also taking  into consideration Board members required competencies, efforts and  the scope of the Board work, including the number of meetings. Board  members elected by the employees receive the same remuneration as  the Board members elected by the general meeting. On any takeover  event, retiring Board members will not receive any compensation for  their lost board remuneration and similar benefits. Remuneration report +64%  Revenue is one of the four elements in  Vestas guidance for the year. From 2013  to 2017 revenue increased from EUR  6bn to EUR 10bn – equal to 64percent.  In the same period, Vestas market share  increased by 2 percentage-points.2) +11%-points Another guidance element is operating  profit (EBIT). Since 2013, EBIT has  increased from EUR 211m to EUR  1,230m – an EBIT margin increase of  11percentage-points. Return to  shareholders Since 2013, Vestas has completed four  share buy-back programmes – bought  back 19,081,091 Vestas shares (DKK  9.2bn) – and cancelled 8,577,566 Vestas  shares – and has paid out EUR 599m  in dividend. Furthermore, at the Annual  General Meeting 2018, the Board of  Directors will propose cancellation of  9.8 million Vestas shares and a dividend  payout of DKK 9.23 (EUR 1.24) per share. +21% Vestas is generating significantly more  cash flow from the underlying business.

All members of the Executive Management are employed under execu- tive service contracts, and the Board of Directors sets the terms within  the frames of the contracts. The Nomination & Compensation Committee submits proposals con- cerning the remuneration of the Executive Management and ensures  that the remuneration is in line with the conditions in comparable com- panies. The proposals are submitted for approval at a Board meeting. The remuneration of the Executive Management consists of four ele- ments: fixed salary, cash bonus, share-based incentives, and personal  benefits. The Executive Management is not covered by Vestas employer admin- istered pension plan or a defined benefit pension scheme, nor do  members of Executive Management receive remuneration for ad hoc  tasks or receive any remuneration for directorships held in Vestas Wind  Systems A/S subsidiaries or its joint ventures.

Fixed salary The fixed salary is based on market level and is continuously reviewed  by the Nomination & Compensation Committee against comparable  positions.  Cash bonus Members of the Executive Management participate in a bonus scheme  based on the results for the year. The bonus is paid out annually after  adoption of the annual report for the relevant financial year; ref. the  general guidelines for incentive pay. The bonus pay-out-level is defined by a weighted target achievement  and is capped at a certain percentage of the fixed salary with the target  and maximum pay-out levels set at 50 percent and 75 percent of the  annual base salary, respectively. The bonus scheme is based on target achievement on a number of  parameters, including financial key performance indicators (KPIs) like  EBIT, as well as any other targets approved by the Board of Directors.  No pay-out will be made if the target for EBIT is not met at the defined  minimum acceptable performance level. Share-based incentives The focus of the share-based programme is to retain and create long- term shareholder value.  The intention of the grants is to ensure value creation and fulfilment  of the companys long-term goals, and the scheme contains elements  of both short and long-term performance. The scheme is based on  restricted performance shares. The programme is disclosed following  the annual general meeting and will be conditional upon continued  employment at the time of grant. For any single financial year, the Executive Management may be  granted restricted performance shares based on achievement of cer- tain targets approved by the Board of Directors. The targets may be  based on financial KPIs as well as the Groups market share as defined  by the Board of Directors.  Share-based incentive programme 2017 In May 2017, the Board of Directors announced that it had decided  to continue the share-based incentive programme for all participants,  including the Executive Management, and launch a new programme for  2017 based on the terms and conditions governing the restricted per- formance share programme for the year 2016, ref. Vestas remunera- tion policy and general guidelines for incentive pay. Number of shares The number of shares to be granted is based on a defined target level  for each position. No payments for any grants are made by the partici- pants. If all KPIs are reached on target level, a total of 310,000 shares  will be granted from the programme with a total present value calcu- lated based on the current share price amounting to EUR 24.5m (value  at close of Nasdaq Copenhagen on 2 May, 2017).

All KPIs and targets are defined by the Board of Directors. Conditions The restricted performance shares are governed by the specific terms  and conditions of the programme and subject to mandatory law. If a  participant chooses to leave Vestas before the time of grant, the par- ticipants rights to receive shares will generally lapse. Adjustments to the programme The number of shares available for grant and the calculation of the  KPIs may be adjusted in the event of certain changes in Vestas capital  structure. In addition, calculation of the KPIs may be adjusted for cer- tain non-operational events. Further, in the event of a change of control,  merger, winding-up or demerger of Vestas, an accelerated grant may  extraordinarily take place. In the event of certain transfers of activities  or changes in ownership interests within the Vestas Group, adjustment,  replacement of the programme and/or settlement in cash of the pro- gramme entirely or partly may also take place. Personal benefits Members of the Executive Management have access to a number of  work-related benefits, including company car, free telephony, broad- band at home, and work-related newspapers and magazines.

The below description of accounting policies of social and environmen- tal performance refers to the social and environmental key figures and  indicators presented on page 009 of the annual report. All Vestas wholly owned companies are covered by the report. Newly  established companies are included from the time of production start  and for acquired companies from the time when coming under Vestas  control. Companies are excluded from the reporting from the time when  they leave Vestas control. Defining materiality Vestas bases its materiality assessment on an analysis of significant  economic, environmental, and social impacts of the Groups activities.  The analysis is based on internal priorities as well as experience from  dialogue with and direct involvement of customers, investors, policy  makers, employees, and media. The result of the analysis is incorpo- rated in Vestas COP. Vestas has previously selected a number of social and environmen- tal key figures that are relevant to understand Vestas development,  results and financial position. These key figures have been maintained  after the materiality assessment. The status of the key figures is moni- tored closely and for relevant key indicators specific targets have been  defined. Change in accounting policies The same measurement and calculation methods are applied at all  Vestas sites. A minor change from previous reporting periods is that only  100 percent renewable electricity is counted as renewable electricity. Social performance Occupational health and safety Occupational health & safety is measured for all activities under the  organisational structure. Lost time injuries of all employees are stated  on the basis of registration of incidents that have caused at least one  workday of absence after the day of the injury. Total recordable injuries  include Lost time injuries, Restricted work injuries, and Medical treat- ment injuries. Injuries and working hours for external supervised employees are also  included. The incidence of injuries is defined as the number of lost time  injuries including fatalities per one million working hours. The number  of working hours is measured on the basis of daily time cards regis- tered in the payroll system for hourly-paid employees and prescribed  working hours for salaried employees. For external supervised employ- ees, the injuries are reported by Vestas, and working hours are reported  by the external suppliers. Absence due to illness does not include absence caused by lost time  injuries, maternity leave, and childs illness leave. Absence due to ill- ness is measured by means of registrations in the payroll system based  on daily time cards for hourly-paid employees and absence records for  salaried employees, respectively. Employees The number of employees is calculated as the number of full-time  equivalents (FTEs) with a direct contract with Vestas. Employee infor- mation is determined on the basis of extracts from the companys  ordinary registration systems with specification of nationality, gender  and IPE level (Mercers International Position Evaluation). Employee  indicators are calculated based on head counts. Environmental performance Energy consumption, water consumption, waste generation and CO2  emission are reported on the basis of significance. All production  facilities are included as well as larger offices, warehouses, and other  facilities ensuring a comprehensive and sufficient statement of these  environmental aspects.  Utilisation of resources Electricity, gas, and district heating are measured on the basis of quan- tities consumed according to direct meter readings per site including  related administration. Consumption of electricity comprises electricity  purchased externally and consumption of production from own wind  turbines. Oil for heating is stated on the basis of external purchases  adjusted for inventories at the beginning and at the end of the period.  Fuel for transport has been recognised on the basis of supplier state- ments. Electricity from renewable energy sources is calculated on the  basis of supplier statements. Renewable energy is energy generated from natural resources, which  are all naturally replenished – such as wind, sunlight, water, and geo- thermal heat. Nuclear power is not considered to be renewable energy.  Consumption of electricity from non-renewable sources purchased as a  result of not being able to purchase renewable electricity at some loca- tions, is in the Group statement balanced with renewable electricity pro- duced by wind power plants owned by Vestas and sold to the local grid. The consumption of water is stated as measured consumption of fresh  water. Cooling water from streams, rivers, lakes, etc. that is solely used  for cooling and released to the stream after use without further con- tamination than a higher temperature, is not included. Waste disposal Waste is stated on the basis of weight slips received from the waste  recipients for deliveries affected in the accounting period, apart from  a few types of waste and non-significant volumes which are estimated  on the basis of subscription arrangement and load. Waste disposal is  based on supplier statements. Emissions of CO2 Direct emission of CO2 is calculated on the basis of determined  amounts of fuel for own transport and the direct consumption of oil and  gas, with the usage of standard factors published by the UK Depart- ment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs. Indirect emission of CO2 is  calculated on the basis of direct consumption of electricity and district  heating, with the usage of national grid emissions factors published by  International Energy Agency. Indirect CO2 emissions from electricity  consumption based on non-renewable sources is balanced out by CO2  emission savings in the production and sale to the grid from Vestas  owned wind turbines. Local community Environmental accidents are accidental releases of substance and  chemicals which are considered by Vestas to have a significant impact  on the environment. Breaches of internal inspection conditions are  stated as the conditions for which measurements are required, and  where measurements show breaches of stated conditions. Products CO2 savings from the produced and shipped MW are calculated on the  basis of a capacity factor of 30 per cent of the produced and shipped  MW, an expected lifetime of 20 years of the produced and shipped MW,  and the latest updated standard factor from the International Energy  Agency of average CO2 emission for electricity in the world, at present  536 grams of CO2 per kWh.  063  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements Consolidated  financial statements 064  Income statement 065  Statement of comprehensive income 066  Balance sheet 067  Statement of changes in equity 068  Statement of cash flows 069  Overview of notes 070  Note 1  Result for the year 077  Note 2  Working capital 082  Note 3  Other operating assets and liabilities 093  Note 4  Capital structure and financing items 106  Note 5  Tax 110  Note 6  Other disclosures 117  Note 7  Basis for preparation During the construction phase, the wind  power plant is built and connected to the  grid.

Result for the year 1.1 Segment information Reportable segments Vestas operates in the two business segments, Power solutions and Service. In 2017, the operating and reportable segment Projects was renamed Power solutions. The change did not have any impact on  the corporate structure nor internal reporting. Consequently, no change to the segment information has occurred.   Segments Power solutions Service Primary activity The Power solutions segment contains sale of wind  power plants, wind turbines, etc.  The Service segment contains sale of service  contracts, spare parts and related activities. Group accounting policies The reportable segments are determined based on the Groups management structures and the consequent reporting to the  Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), which is defined as the Executive Management. The total external revenue is derived  from the two operating and reportable segments and comprise sale of wind turbines and associated service activities, respec- tively Power solutions and Service. Certain income and costs relating to group functions, investing activities, tax, special items,  etc. are managed on group level. These items are not included in the reportable segments, and therefore, presented as Not allo- cated. The measure of revenue, costs and EBIT included in the segment reporting are the same as those used in the consolidated  financial statements. No segment information is provided to CODM on a regular basis for assets and liabilities and the measures  below EBIT. Income and costs included in profit for the year are allocated to the extent that they can be directly or indirectly attributed to the  segments on a reliable basis. Costs allocated as either directly or indirectly attributable comprise production costs, research and  development costs, distribution costs, and administration costs. The income and costs allocated, including depreciation and amortisation, as indirectly attributable to the segments, are allo- cated by means of allocation keys determined on the basis of the utilisation of key resources in the segment.  071  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 1.1 Segment information (continued)  2017 mEUR Power solutions Service Not allocated Total Group Revenue 8,431 1,522 - 9,953 Total revenue  8,431 1,522 - 9,953 Total costs  (7,289) (1,216) (218) (8,723) Operating profit (EBIT) 1,142 306 (218) 1,230 Income/(loss) from investments in joint ventures and associates, ref. note 3.4 (40) (40) Financial income 45 45 Financial costs (43) (43) Profit before tax (1,192) Amortisation and depreciation included in total costs, ref. note 1.4 (335) (33) (30) (398) Investments in joint ventures and associates, ref. note 3.4 150 In 2017, impairment loss of EUR 23m has negatively impacted the Groups EBIT, of which the largest contributors is EUR  31m related to R&D activites. However, this was partially offset by reversal of EUR 8m under production facilities. Both the  impairment and the reversal are impacting the Power solutions segment.  2016 mEUR Power solutions Service Not allocated Total Group Revenue 8,928 1,309 - 10,237 Total revenue  8,928 1,309 - 10,237 Total costs  (7,505) (1,084) (227) (8,816) Operating profit (EBIT) 1,423 225 (227) 1,421 Loss from investments in joint ventures and associates, ref. note 3.4 (101) (101) Financial income 56 56 Financial costs (89) (89) Profit before tax 1,287 Amortisation and depreciation included in total costs, ref. note 1.4 (320) (28) (29) (377) Investments in joint ventures and associates, ref. note 3.4 201 In 2016, impairment loss of EUR 28m has negatively impacted the Groups EBIT, of which the largest contributors are EUR  11m related to R&D activities and EUR 11m related to production equipment, both impacting the Power solutions segment.  Furthermore, EUR 5m impairment loss from properties held for sale where impact is not allocated. Write-down of inventory relating to development and construction activities in prior years of EUR 54m, has been recognised and  consequently negatively impacted the Power solutions EBIT.  072  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 1.1 Segment information (continued)  Revenue specified by country mEUR 2017 2016 USA 2,968 3,882 Germany 1,691 1,447 Denmark 380 301 Other countries 4,914 4,607 Total 9,953 10,237 Revenue is broken down based on geographical supply point.

Sale of individual wind turbines and small wind power plants based on standard solutions (supply-only and supply-and- installation projects) are recognised in the income statement, provided that risk has been transferred to the buyer in the  reporting period, and provided that the income can be measured reliably and is expected to be received. Revenue from contracts  to deliver wind power plants with a high degree of customisation are recognised as the wind power plants are constructed based  on the stage of completion of the individual contracts (turnkey projects). Where the profit from a contract cannot be estimated  reliably, revenue is only recognised equalling the cost incurred to the extent that it is probable that the costs will be recovered. Service sales, comprising service and maintenance agreements as well as extended warranties regarding wind turbines and wind  power plants sold, are recognised as revenue over the term of the agreement as the services are provided. Spare parts sales are  recognised in the income statement provided that risk has been transferred to the buyer in the reporting period, and provided  that the income can be measured reliably and is expected to be received. Key accounting estimates and judgements Recognition of contract elements Management performs significant accounting estimates in connection with determining the appropriate income recognition  of contract elements. In particular Supply-only projects, which in certain situations, contains elements that in nature are  associated with a high degree of estimations regarding timing of contribution margin as a result of future events. Provided that  the wind power plants are customised to a high degree, revenue from projects in progress is recognised under the percentage- of-completion method, corresponding to the selling price of the assessed work performed based on the stage of completion  (turnkey projects). Revenue from service contracts is also recognised under the percentage-of-completion method. Where  projects do not qualify for recognition under the percentage-of-completion method, total revenue is, to the extent applicable,  recognised based on an assessment of the point in time when the risk is transferred to the customer (supply-only and supply- and-installation projects).

The cost of raw materials and service stock comprise purchase price of materials, consumables, duties, and transportation costs. The cost of work in progress and finished goods comprises the cost of raw materials, consumables, direct labour, and indirect  production costs. Indirect production costs comprise materials and labour costs as well as maintenance and depreciation of the  machinery, factory buildings, and equipment used in the manufacturing process together with costs of factory administration  and management.         The NRV of inventories is measured at sales price less costs of completion and selling costs. NRV is determined taking into  account marketability, obsolescence, and development in the expected selling price. Key accounting estimate Estimate of net realisable value The Group estimates the net realisable value at the amount at which inventories are expected to be sold. Inventories are written  down to net realisable value when the cost of inventories is not estimated to be recoverable due to obsolescence, damage  or declining selling prices. Estimates are used when accounting for or measuring inventory provisions, and these estimates  depend upon subjective and complex judgements about certain circumstances, taking into account fluctuations in prices, excess  quantities, condition of the inventory, nature of the inventory, and the estimated variable costs necessary to make the sale.  1) Sales business units (SBU) 2)  Production business units (PBU) mEUR 2017 2016 Inventories consumed Inventories consumed for the year, which are included in production costs 6,630 6,661 Write down inventories Write-downs of inventories in the year1)  24 68 Utilised write-downs in the year (7) (25) Reversal of write-downs in the year2) (2) (6) 1)  Includes write-down of EUR 0m (2016: EUR 54m) relating to development and construction activities in prior years. 2) The reversal of write-downs in the year are due to goods previously written down being used or sold at or above original cost.

Construction contracts in progress are measured at the selling price of the work performed based on the stage of completion  less progress billing and expected losses. The stage of completion is measured by the proportion that the contract costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total  contract costs. Where it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total revenue from a contract, the expected loss is  recognised immediately as a cost and an obligation. The value of self-constructed components is recognised as construction contracts in progress upon delivery of the components  to the specific wind power plants construction site. Prepayments from customers are recognised as liabilities.  Prepayments from customers recognised in liabilities are measured  at cost and comprise prepayments received for wind power plants ordered but not yet delivered and service prepayments  received in respect of service on wind turbines and wind power plants to be delivered. A construction contract in progress for which the selling price of the work performed exceeds progress billings and expected  losses is recognised as an asset. Construction contracts in progress for which interim billings and expected losses exceed the  selling price are recognised as a liability. Costs relating to sales work and the securing of contracts are recognised in the income statement as incurred. mEUR 2017 2016 Sales value of construction contracts in progress 825 605 Progress billings  (902) (659) (77) (54) Specified as follows: Construction contracts in progress (assets) 82 19 Construction contracts in progress (liabilities) (159) (73) (77) (54) All receivables relating to construction contracts in progress are expected to be received within 12 months.  081  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 2.5 Other receivables Group accounting policies  Other receivables are measured at amortised cost or net realisable value equivalent to nominal value less allowances for  doubtful receivables, whichever is lower.

Key accounting judgement Judgement of allowance for doubtful VAT receivables Management makes allowance for doubtful VAT receivables in anticipation of estimated future receipt of payments. If certain  circumstances result in lack of receipt of payments, an additional allowance could be required. When evaluating the adequacy  of the allowance for doubtful VAT receivables, Management analyses the nature of the individual VAT receivables and takes into  account any relevant historical information that is applicable to the certain circumstance.  mEUR 2017 2016 Prepayments 37 30 Supplier claims 11 4 VAT1)  138 130 Derivative financial instruments 116 51 Other receivables2)  141 162 443 377 Specified as follows: 0–1 years 371 322 > 1 year 72 55 443 377 1) Includes write-downs of VAT receivables of EUR 78m as at 31 December 2017 (2016: EUR 100m). 2) Other receivables mainly comprise interest receivables, indirect taxes, financial receivables and government grants. 2.6 Other liabilities Group accounting policies Other liabilities are measured at amortised cost.

Other operating assets and liabilities Intangible assets Group accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill is initially recognised in the balance sheet as described under con- solidated financial statements and business combinations, ref. note 7.1. Sub- sequently, goodwill is measured at this value less accumulated impairment  losses. Goodwill is not amortised. The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the Groups operating seg- ments; Power solutions and Service. Identification of operating segments is  based on management structure and internal financial reporting.  The carrying amount of goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment,  together with the other non-current assets of the operating segment to which  goodwill has been allocated. If the recoverable amount is lower than the car- rying amount of the operating segment, goodwill is written down to its lower  recoverable amount in the income statement. The recoverable amount is usually calculated as the net present value of  expected future net cash flows from the operating segments to which the  goodwill has been allocated. Alternatively, the recoverable amount is calcu- lated as fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on goodwill are recog- nised in a separate line in the income statement, either in production costs,  research and development costs, distribution costs or administration costs. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Development projects Projects for the development and testing of new wind turbines that are clearly  defined, identifiable, and for which technical feasibility, sufficient resources  and a potential future market or application in the enterprise can be demon- strated, and where it is the intention to manufacture, market or use the pro- ject, are recognised as intangible assets. This applies if cost can be measured  reliably and sufficient certainty exists that future earnings or the net selling  price can cover production costs, distribution costs, and administration costs  as well as research and development costs. At Vestas this is underpinned by  a gate process, where these judgements are made at specific gates. Other  development costs are recognised in the income statement and incurred as  research and development costs. Capitalised development costs are measured at cost less accumulated amor- tisation and impairment losses. Development costs comprise salaries, amorti- sation, and other costs attributable to the Groups development activities. Following completion of the development work, development projects are  amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The amor- tisation period is three to five years. The basis of amortisation is calculated  net of any impairment losses.  The carrying amount of development projects in progress is tested for impair- ment at least annually, and where the carrying amount exceeds the net pre- sent value of the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the devel- opment project, the project is written down to its recoverable amount in the  income statement. Finished development projects are tested for impairment if  there is indication of impairment from the annual review. Patents and licences included in development projects are measured at cost  less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Patents and licences  are amortised over the patent period or term of agreement, the life of the  development project or the estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. The  basis of amortisation is calculated net of any impairment losses.  Software Acquired software licences and internally developed software is measured  at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Cost includes  both direct internal and external costs. Software is amortised on a straight- line basis over three to five years. The basis of amortisation is calculated net  of any impairment losses. Other intangible assets Customer relationship, knowhow and trademarks with a finite useful life  acquired from third parties either separately or as part of the business combi- nation are capitalised at cost and amortised over their remaining useful lives.  Other intangible assets that are not Customer relationship, knowhow and  trademarks are measured at cost less amortisation and impairment losses. 3.1  083  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 3.1 Intangible assets (continued) 2017 mEUR Goodwill Completed  development  projects Software Other intangible assets Projects in   progress Total Cost as at 1 January 412 1,410 263 64 85 2,234 Reclassification - (2) - 10 10 18 Exchange rate adjustments (5) (2) - - - (7) Additions - - 10 - 213 223 Disposals - - (1) - - (1) Transfers - 129 35 - (164) - Cost as at 31 December 407 1,535 307 74 144 2,467 Amortisation and impairment losses as at 1 January 103 1,110 183 10 - 1,406 Reclassification - - - 5 - 5 Exchange rate adjustments - (2) - - - (2) Amortisation for the year - 115 30 10 - 155 Reversal of amortisation of disposals in the year - - (1) - - (1) Impairment losses for the year - 3 - - - 3 Amortisation and impairment losses as at   31 December 103 1,226 212 25 - 1,566 Carrying amount as at 31 December 304 309 95 49 144 901 Internally generated assets included above - 309 72 - 144 525 Amortisation period 2–5 years 3–5 years 3–7 years 2016 mEUR Goodwill Completed  development  projects Software Other intangible assets Projects in   progress Total Cost as at 1 January 354 1,239 221 20 93 1,927 Reclassification - - - 8 (3) 5 Exchange rate adjustments 2 4 1 - - 7 Additions - - 11 - 191 202 Additions from business combination 56 - - 37 - 93 Transfers - 167 30 (1) (196) - Cost as at 31 December 412 1,410 263 64 85 2,234 Amortisation and impairment losses as at 1 January 102 978 160 - - 1,240 Exchange rate adjustments 1 2 1 - - 4 Amortisation for the year - 130 22 10 - 162 Amortisation and impairment losses as at   31 December 103 1,110 183 10 - 1,406 Carrying amount as at 31 December 309 300 80 54 85 828 Internally generated assets included above - 300 55 - 85 440 Amortisation period 3–5 years 3–5 years 3–7 years  084  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements Property, plant and equipment Group accounting policies Land and buildings, plant and machinery as well as other fixtures and fittings,  tools and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and  impairment losses. Cost comprises the cost of acquisition and costs directly related to the  acquisition up until the time when the asset is ready for use. In the case of  construction of own assets, cost comprises direct and indirect costs for mate- rials, components, sub-suppliers, and labour. Estimated costs for dismantling  and disposing of the asset and for re-establishment are added to cost to the  extent that they are recognised as a provision. Where individual components  of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, the  cost of the item is broken down into separate components which are depreci- ated separately. Subsequent costs, e.g. in connection with the replacement of components  of an item of property, plant and equipment, are recognised in the  carrying  amount of the asset in question when it is probable that the costs incurred will  result in future economic benefits to the Group. The carrying amount of the  replaced components is derecognised in the balance sheet and recognised  as costs in the income statement. All other costs incurred for ordinary repairs  and maintenance are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful  lives of the assets, which are: Buildings (including installations) .......................................................................15–40 years Plant and machinery .........................................................................................................3–10 years  Other fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment .............................................3–5 years Land is not depreciated. The basis of depreciation is calculated taking into account the residual value  of the asset less any impairment losses. The residual value is determined at  the time of acquisition and is reassessed annually. Where the residual value  exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, depreciation is discontinued. The depreciation periods are determined based on estimates of the expected  useful lives and future residual value of the assets. The estimates are based  on historical experience. A reassessment is made once a year to ascertain  that the depreciation basis reflects the expected life and future residual val- ues of the assets. If the depreciation period or the residual value has changed, the effect on  depreciation is recognised prospectively as a change of accounting estimate. Depreciation is recognised in the income statement as either production  costs, research and development costs, distribution costs or administration  costs to the extent that depreciation is not included in the cost of assets of  own construction. The carrying amounts of non-current assets are reviewed on an annual basis  to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If so, the recovera- ble amount of the asset is calculated. The recoverable amount is the higher of  the fair value of the asset less estimated costs to sell and value in use.  Value in use is calculated as the net present value of expected future net cash  flows from the asset or a group of assets. An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying amount of an asset  exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are reversed only to the extent of changes in the assump- tions and estimates underlying the impairment calculation. Impairment losses are reversed only to the extent that the new carrying  amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount of the asset after  depreciation/amortisation had the asset not been impaired. 3.2  085  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 3.2 Property, plant and equipment (continued) 2017 mEUR Land and   buildings Plant and   machinery Other fixtures  and fittings,  tools and  equipment Property,   plant and  equipment in  progress Total Cost as at 1 January 1,229 765 1,044 108 3,146 Reclassification - - - (10) (10) Exchange rate adjustments (72) (29) (54) (5) (160) Additions 20 49 85 114 268 Disposals - (48) (53) (4) (105) Transfers 34 65 31 (130) - Cost as at 31 December 1,211 802 1,053 73 3,139 Depreciation and impairment losses as at 1 January 462 532 823 - 1,817 Exchange rate adjustments (21) (22) (44) - (87) Depreciation for the year 46 92 105 - 243 Impairment losses for the year 28 - - - 28 Reversal of depreciation of disposals in the year - (48) (53) - (101) Reversal of impairment (8) - - - (8) Depreciation and impairment losses as at 31 December 507 554 831 - 1,892 Carrying amount as at 31 December 704 248 222 73 1,247 Depreciation period 15–40 years 3–10 years 3–5 years 2016 mEUR Land and   buildings Plant and   machinery Other fixtures  and fittings,  tools and  equipment Property,   plant and  equipment in  progress Total Cost as at 1 January 1,200 699 933 106 2,938 Reclassification (8) - 3 - (5) Exchange rate adjustments (5) (1) 9 6 9 Additions 69 35 93 107 304 Additions from business combination - - 3 - 3 Disposals (42) (12) (27) (14) (95) Transfers 23 44 30 (97) - Transfers to assets held for sale (8) - - - (8) Cost as at 31 December 1,229 765 1,044 108 3,146 Depreciation and impairment losses as at 1 January 437 480 742 - 1,659 Exchange rate adjustments (2) 5 7 - 10 Depreciation for the year 54 70 91 - 215 Impairment losses for the year 8 18 2 - 28 Reversal of depreciation of disposals in the year (40) (12) (27) - (79) Transfers 21 (29) 8 - - Transfers to assets held for sale (16) - - - (16) Depreciation and impairment losses as at 31 December 462 532 823 - 1,817 Carrying amount as at 31 December 767 233 221 108 1,329 Depreciation period 15–40 years 3–10 years 3–5 years  086  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 3.3 Impairment Valuation of goodwill As at 31 December 2017, Management performed the annual impairment test of the carrying amount of goodwill. No basis for impairment was found for 2017 (2016: EUR 0m). In the impairment tests, the carrying amount of the assets is compared to the  discounted value of future expected cash flows. The annual test of goodwill was performed on the two operating segments: Power solutions and Service, these being the lowest  level of cash-generating units as defined by Management. The main part of the carrying amount of goodwill in the Group arose in connection with the acquisition of NEG Micon A/S in  2004, and the goodwill is allocated to the Groups two operating segments Power solutions (EUR 180m) and Service (EUR  35m). In relation to the acquisition of UpWind Solutions, Inc. in 2015, the Group has recognised goodwill of EUR 33m, which  is allocated to the Service segment. With the acquisition of Availon GmbH in 2016, the Group has recognised goodwill of EUR  56m, which is also allocated to the Service segment. Assumptions underpinning impairment test of goodwill Budgets and business plans for the next three years are based on  the Groups investments in progress and contracted  investments, and the risks relating to the key parameters have been assessed and incorporated in the expected future cash  flows underpinning the impairment test of goodwill. In addition, the budgets and business plans are based on managements  expectations of the current market conditions and future growth expectations. Projections for year four and onwards are based  on general market expectations and risks. More specifically, the following main information is used in determining revenue,  hence EBIT and capital expenditure: Power solutions Service Power solutions order backlog of EUR 8.8bn as at 31  December 2017 Service order backlog of EUR 12.1bn as at 31 December 2017 Expectations on changing market environment, including  future market prices and future development in cost  reductions Expectations on changing market environment, including future  market prices and future development in cost reductions Expectations on future orders received, among other things  based on expected market share of the global market  outlook Expectations on continuing servicing the existing installed base  of wind turbines as well as future service contracts received,  among other things based on expected market share of the  global market for all major wind turbine technologies Expectations on continuing developments in mature and  emerging markets Capture full potential and accelerate profitable growth strategy  from acquisition of UpWind Solution, Inc. and Availon GmbH Expectations on support schemes in both mature and  emerging markets Growth supported by market developments and organic growth Recoverable amount The terminal value beyond the projections is determined taking into account general growth expectations for the segments in  question.

Under the equity method, interests in joint ventures are initially  recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Groups share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and  movements in other comprehensive income. When the Groups share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in  the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the joint  ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint  ventures. Timing in revenue recognition may be different between the Group and joint ventures where the Group recognises revenue when  control of the wind turbines have been transferred to joint ventures but joint ventures does not recognise revenue until they have  transferred the risk of the same wind turbines to the end customer. Such timing difference results in 50 percent of the Groups  profit from wind turbines delivered being eliminated in the net result from joint ventures, until joint ventures has recognised their  revenue. This timing difference may vary between quarters and year end, but will even-out over time. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest  in the joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the  asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the  policies adopted by the Group.

The share of loss from the joint venture on a standalone basis amounts to EUR 50m (2016: EUR 69m). MHI Vestas  Offshore Wind is a private company and there is no quoted market prices available for its shares.  With reference to page 035, MVOW has through the 8 MW platform achieved solid order intake in a changing market  environment with price pressure. With the increased activity level and strong order backlog, the expected performance continues  to be in line with previous expected performance.   The carrying amount of the investment in MVOW mainly comprise the development project of the 8 MW platform. Any change to such  future expectation on future performance may in nature result in impairment of the carrying amount of the investment in MVOW. Roaring Fork Wind, LLC The Group has through its wholly owned subsidiary Steelhead Wind 1, LLC a strategic co-development partnership with  RES America Developments Inc. (RES) forming the equally shared ownership in Roaring Fork Wind, LLC. The purpose of the  partnership is development of wind power plants. In 2017, the Group has transferred additional EUR 15m in cash as capital. The  share of profit/(loss) from the joint venture on a standalone basis amounts to EUR 0m (2016: EUR 0m).

Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the costs required  to settle the obligation. Discounting is applied where relevant. The Group accrues for the estimated cost of the warranty upon recognition  of the sale of the product. The costs are estimated based on actual historical  costs incurred and on estimated future costs related to current sales, and are  updated periodically. Actual warranty costs are charged against the provision  for warranty. Restructuring costs are recognised as liabilities when a detailed, formal  restructuring plan has been announced to those affected no later than the  balance sheet date.  A provision for loss-making contracts is made where the expected benefits to  the Group from the contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting  obligations under the contract. Expected losses on construction contracts in progress are, however, recognised in construction contracts in progress. Provision for legal disputes are recognised where a legal or constructive obli- gation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is possible that there  will be an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated. In this case, the  Group arrives at an estimate on the basis of an evaluation of the most likely  outcome. Disputes for which no reliable estimate can be made are disclosed  as contingent liabilities, ref. note 3.6. Key accounting estimates Provisions for warranties The product warranties, which in the great majority of cases includes com- ponent defects, functional errors and any financial losses suffered by the  customer in connection with unplanned suspension of operations, are usually  granted for a two-year period from delivery of the wind turbine. In certain  cases, a warranty of up to five years is granted. For the customer, the specific  warranty period and the specific warranty terms are part of the basis of the  individual contract. Warranty provisions include only standard warranty, whereas services  purchased in addition to the standard warranty are included in the service  contracts.  In addition to the above, provisions are made for upgrades of wind turbines  sold due to type faults, etc. Such provisions will also include wind turbines  sold in prior years, but where type faults, etc. are identified later. Moreover,  it should be emphasised that the complexity of some of the type faults, etc.  identified may lead to adjustments of previous estimates, upwards as well as  downwards, in the light of factual information about population size, costs of  repair and the timing of such repairs. It is estimated that 5-10 percent of the warranty provisions made for the year  relate to adjustments of previous years estimates of provisions for serial  faults, etc. Included in this, is the cost of upgrades of wind turbines sold in pre- vious year, commercial settlements and proactive upgrading as well as new  information about the serial type faults in question. Total warranty provisions of EUR 185m have been made in 2017 (2016:  EUR 228m), corresponding to 1.9 percent (2016: 2.2 percent) of the Groups  revenue. Management assesses the likely outcome of pending and future negotiations  with sub-suppliers for compensation. Compensation from sub-suppliers may  be recognised only when it is virtually certain that we will receive compensa- tion from the sub-suppliers. The carrying amount of warranty provisions was EUR566m as at 31 Decem- ber 2017 (2016: EUR 524m). 3.5 3.4 Investments in joint ventures and associates (continued) Reconciliation of summarised financial information 1 January - 31 December Reconciliation of the summarised financial information presented to the carrying amount of its interest in the joint ventures.

Product risks Lack of reliability in several of Vestas products has previously led to major warranty provisions. In recent years, Vestas has  invested significant resources in improving the products and increasing their reliability to mitigate major warranty provisions.  This work comprises design, production, installation, and continuous maintenance.  The goal of these initiatives is to reduce Vestas warranty costs, to secure customer returns, to increase the com peti tiveness of  the products, and to improve customer earnings.

Contingent liabilities On 31 July 2017, General Electric (GE) filed a complaint against Vestas Wind System A/S and Vestas-American Wind  Technology, Inc. (Vestas) in the US federal court in Los Angeles, California. GE claims infringement of its U.S. Patents No.  7,629,705 and No. 6,921,985 (the 705 Patent and the 985 Patent). The 705 Patent addresses Zero Voltage Ride Through  technology. The 985 Patent addresses techniques to maintain functioning of the blade pitch system during low voltage events.  Vestas answered and counterclaimed on 15 December, 2017. As set forth in its counterclaims, it is Vestas assessment that GEs  patents are invalid and unenforceable, and that Vestas does not infringe. Consequently, Vestas has made no provision to cover  the complaint. However, in the event that Vestas is not successful in its defense in this case, and GE prevails, this case could  potentially have significant financial impact on Vestas. As GE has not claimed any specific amount from Vestas, it is not possible  for Vestas to estimate such financial impact any further at this point in time. The Group is involved in some other litigation proceedings. However, it is Managements opinion that settlement or continuation  of these proceedings will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Group. Ref. note. 5.2 concerning contingent liabilities on transfer pricing. Contingent assets The Group has made supplier claims for faulty deliveries. However, it is managements opinion that settlement of these are not  virtually certain, and therefore not recognised in the financial position of the Group, except for supplier claims accounted for as  other receivables, ref. note 2.5.  093  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 4.

Dividend A proposed dividend is recognised as a liability at the time of adoption at the Annual General Meeting (declaration date).  The proposed dividend for the year is included in retained earnings. For the financial year 2017, Vestas Wind Systems A/S proposes to distribute a dividend of DKK 9.23 (EUR 1.24) per share,  corresponding to total EUR 267m. Dividends of EUR 278m, net of treasury shares, have been paid in 2017, relating to the  financial year 2016.

It was completed on 4 May 2017. Further, pursuant to authorisation granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting on 6 April 2017, which  authorised Vestas to acquire treasury shares at a nominal value not exceeding 10 per cent of the share capital at the time of  authorisation, Vestas initiated a second share buy-back programme during 2017 on 17 August 2017. It was completed on  29December 2017. The purpose of both share buy back programmes was to adjust Vestas share capital and to meet obligations arising from the  share based incentive programmes to employees of Vestas. At Vestas Annual General Meeting on 3 April 2018, a resolution will be proposed that shares acquired, which are not used for  hedging purposes of share-based incentive programmes, will be cancelled.  094  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 4.1 Share capital (continued) Vestas Wind Systems A/S has acquired treasury shares as follows: 2017 2016 Average share price, purchases (DKK) 492 491 Average share price, sales (DKK) 58 455 Purchase amount (mEUR) 694 419 Sales amount (mEUR) (1) (11) Treasury shares are acquired to cover grants/issues of shares under the Groups incentive programmes or as part of its capital  structure strategy.

Financial risks are managed centrally and the overall objectives and policies for the Groups financial risk management are  outlined in the Treasury Policy. The Treasury Policy is approved by the Board of Directors, and revised on a continuous basis to  adapt to the changing financial risks and market situation. The Treasury Policy sets the limits for the various financial risks and  includes policies for managing liquidity risks, credit risks, foreign currency risks, interest rate risks, and commodity risks.  It is the Groups policy only to hedge commercial exposures and not enter into any speculative transactions.  Information on financial and capital structure strategy, ref. page 015. Liquidity risks The Group manages the liquidity risks according to the Treasury Policy. The Group ensures to have sufficient financial resources  to service its financial obligations. The Groups financial resources are managed through a combination of cash on bank  account and money market deposits, committed credit facilities, highly rated money market funds and marketable securities.  The liquidity is managed and optimised centrally by using cash pools and in-house bank solutions. The Groups main credit facility has been refinanced in June 2017. The facility now has a five-year duration with an option, at  the lenders discretion, to extent the maturity for up to two additional years. The facility consists of a EUR 1,150m revolving  credit facility. The facility has a sublimit of EUR 550m for cash drawings, while the total of EUR 1,150m is available for  guarantees. The revolving credit facility is subject to a change of control clause resulting in repayment of the credit facility  in the event of change in control. The revolving credit facility is subject to covenants and no breaches has been encountered  throughout the year. In 2015, Vestas issued a green corporate eurobond with a nominal value of EUR 500m at a fixed interest rate of 2.75 percent.  The green corporate eurobond will mature in 2022. Considering the Groups strong liquidity position and available credit facilities, the Groups liquidity risk is assessed to be low.  The available financial resources of the Group are shown below. mEUR 2017 2016 Main credit facility 550 500 Other credit facilities 27 10 Marketable securities 203 201 Cash and cash equivalents 3,653 3,550 Total available financial resources 4,433 4,261  097  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 4.5 Financial risks (continued) Financial assets by maturity and category 2017 mEUR Carrying  amount Fair   value Total   cash flow,  including  interests 0-1 year 1-2 years >2 years Cash flow hedges 106 106 106 74 19 13 Hedging instruments assets (hedge accounting) 106 106 106 74 19 13 Fair value hedges 10 10 10 10 - - Marketable securities 203 203 264 9 40 215 Fair value through profit or loss  213 213 274 19 40 215 Trade receivables 1,144 1,144 1,144 1,144 - - Construction contracts in progress 82 82 82 82 - - Other receivables 290 290 290 185 40 65 Cash and cash equivalents 3,653 3,653 3,653 3,653 - - Loans and receivables 5,169 5,169 5,169 5,064 40 65 Total financial assets 5,488 5,488 5,549 5,157 99 293 2016 mEUR Carrying  amount Fair   value Total   cash flow,  including  interests 0-1 year 1-2 years >2 years Cash flow hedges 41 41 41 36 5 - Hedging instruments assets (hedge accounting) 41 41 41 36 5 - Fair value hedges 10 10 10 10 - - Marketable securities 201 201 262 13 61 188 Fair value through profit or loss  211 211 272 23 61 188 Trade receivables 1,038 1,038 1,038 1,038 - - Construction contracts in progress 19 19 19 19 - - Other receivables 296 296 296 246 15 35 Cash and cash equivalents 3,550 3,550 3,550 3,550 - - Loans and receivables 4,903 4,903 4,903 4,853 15 35 Total financial assets 5,155 5,155 5,216 4,912 81 223  098  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 4.5 Financial risks (continued) Financial liabilities by maturity and category 2017 mEUR Carrying  amount Fair   value Total   cash flow,  including  interests 0-1 year 1-2 years >2 years Cash flow hedges 27 27 27 16 6 5 Hedging instruments liabilities (hedge accounting)  27 27 27 16 6 5 Fair value hedges 2 2 2 2 - - Fair value through profit or loss 2 2 2 2 - - Green corporate eurobond 497 533 569 14 14 541 Trade payables 2,660 2,660 2,660 2,660 - - Other liabilities 524 524 524 517 4 3 Financial guarantee contracts* - 268 - - - - Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 3,681 3,985 3,753 3,191 18 544 Total financial liabilities 3,710 4,014 3,782 3,209 24 549 2016 mEUR Carrying  amount Fair   value Total   cash flow,  including  interests 0-1 year 1-2 years >2 years Cash flow hedges 120 120 120 41 25 54 Hedging instruments liabilities (hedge accounting)  120 120 120 41 25 54 Fair value hedges 19 19 19 19 - - Fair value through profit or loss 19 19 19 19 - - Green corporate eurobond 496 526 583 14 14 555 Trade payables 1,666 1,666 1,666 1,666 - - Other liabilities 515 515 515 504 5 6 Financial guarantee contracts* - 309 - - - - Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 2,677 3,016 2,764 2,184 19 561 Total financial liabilities 2,816 3,155 2,903 2,244 44 615 *For additional information regarding issued financial guarantee contracts, ref. note 3.6.  099  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 4.5 Financial risks (continued) Credit risks The Group ensures that the credit risks are managed according to the Treasury Policy. The Group is exposed to credit risks  arising from especially cash and cash equivalents, including money market deposits and money market funds, investments in  marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and trade and other receivables. The Treasury Policy sets forth limits for  the credit risk exposure based on the counterpartys credit rating for financial institution counterparties and mitigating actions  for other counterparties.  Vestas has entered into netting agreements with all financial institution counterparties used for trading of derivative financial  instruments, which mean that the Groups credit risk is limited to the net assets per counterparty. Other counterparties mainly consist of companies within the energy sector. The credit risk is among other things dependent on  the develop ment within this sector.  In 2017, the Group has continiued its investments in marketable securities that comprise highly liquid, mainly AAA-rated  (minimum AA-rated) Danish mortgage and sovereign bonds. As at 31 December 2017, the Group considers the maximum credit risk to financial institution counterparties to be EUR  3,972m (2016: EUR 3,759m). The total credit risk is considered to be EUR 5,495m (2016: 5,112m). The commercial credit risk relating to the outstanding trade receivables balance as of 31 December was mitigated by  EUR57m (2016: EUR 347m) received as security, ref. note 2.3. Historically, the Group has not incurred significant losses on  trade receivables. Considering the Groups management of credit risk exposure, the total credit risks are assessed to be low.  The overview below shows the Groups risk exposure for financial institutions based on the credit rating.

The foreign currency  exposure arises primarily from purchase and sale of goods and services outside the eurozone. The foreign currency risks are  reduced by balancing the different currencies to the largest extent possible and by hedging the net exposure in each individual  currency according to the Treasury Policy. Foreign currency risks are primarily hedged through foreign currency forward  contracts. The Group is objective when managing foreign currency risks is to reduce the short-term fluctuations in the income statement  and to increase the predictability of the financial results. Foreign currency risks related to long-term investments are not  hedged based on an overall risk, liquidity, and cost perspective. The Group is to a large extent exposed to USD, due to the significant business activities in this region. The project nature of the  business changes the foreign currency risk picture towards specific currencies from one year to another, depending on in which  geographical areas the group has activity. Considering the international business activities and the Groups management of  foreign currency risks exposure, the total foreign currency risk is assessed to be medium. The sensitivity analysis shows the gain/(loss) on net profit for the year and other comprehensive income of a 10 percent  increase in the specified currencies towards EUR. The analysis includes the impact from hedging instruments. The below  analysis is based on the assumption that all other variables, interest rates in particular, remain constant. 2017 mEUR Change Net profit/ (loss) for the  year Other  comprehensive  income USD 10% (35) (116) SEK 10% (2) (107) NOK 10% (0) (99) GBP 10% (2) (38) CNY 10% 2 54 2016 mEUR Change Net profit/ (loss) for the  year Other  comprehensive  income USD 10% (74) 29 SEK 10% (6) (38) NOK 10% (6) (87) GBP 10% (4) (29) CAD 10% 14 (13)  101  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 4.5 Financial risks (continued) Interest rate risk The Group ensures that the interest rate risk is managed according to the Treasury Policy. The Group is exposed to inverse  interest rate risks on cash flows from interest-bearing short-term investments in cash and cash equivalents as well as from  marketable securities with floating interest. The Group is also exposed to inverse interest rate risks on fair value of investments  in marketable securities with fixed interest.  The Group has no outstanding interest-bearing debt with floating interest. The interest coupon on the Groups EUR 500m green  corporate eurobond is fixed until maturity in 2022. It is assessed that the Groups interest rate risk is low. 2017 Carrying  amount Interest   rate Nominal   interest  rate % Effective interest  rate % Expiry of  current  interest terms Main credit facilities 0 Floating - - - Other credit facilities 0 Floating - - - Green corporate eurobond 497 Fixed 2.75 2.88 2022 Total credit facilities 2016 Carrying  amount Interest   rate Nominal   interest  rate % Effective interest  rate % Expiry of  current  interest terms Main credit facilities 0 Floating - - - Other credit facilities 0 Floating - - - Green corporate eurobond 496 Fixed 2.75 2.88 2022 Total credit facilities  102  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 4.6 Derivative financial instruments Group accounting policies On initial recognition derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value and subsequently re- measured at fair value.  In case of changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments designated as a cash flow hedge the effective part of any  gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income. Any ineffective portions of the cash flow hedges are recognised in  the income statement as financial items. Gains or losses on cash flow hedges are upon realisation transferred from the equity  hedging reserve into the income statement in the same item as the hedged item. Any changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are recognised in the income  statement as financial items. Fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated using valuation techniques which use observable market data  such as exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and volatilities. Agreements with derivative counterparties are based on an  ISDA Master Agreement. Under the terms of these arrangements, Vestas does not presently have a legally enforceable right of  set-off. In some sales agreements, a foreign currency element is incorporated. In cases where the sales currency is not closely related  to the functional currency nor a commonly used currency in the country in which the sales takes place, the foreign currency  element is treated as an embedded financial derivative. The embedded financial derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge.

Fair value of the derivative financial instruments is measured as level 2, as the fair value can be established directly based on  exchange rates published and forward interest rates and prices specified at the balance sheet date.    The Group has a commitment in the USA to purchase Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in 2023 and 10 years beyond  based on production of MW in this period at a fixed price. It has been assessed that the contract qualifies as a financial  instrument. The fair value measurement is based on level 3 input. The maximum nominal commitment under the contract is  estimated at EUR 42m (2016: EUR 48m). Currently RECs are trading at a higher price than the Groups agreed purchase price.  Given the uncertainties underpinning the future market for selling RECs, Management has determined that the best evidence  of fair value of the RECs is the transaction price. Consequently, the net fair value of the contract has been measured at EUR 0.  Had the estimated market price of the RECs been EUR 19/MWh (2016: EUR 18/MWh) in average, the contract would have had  a positive value of EUR 42m (2016: EUR 30m) as of 31 December 2017. Had the estimated market price of the RECs been  EUR 0 (2016: EUR 0), the contract would have had a negative value of EUR 33m (2016: EUR 35m) as at 31 December 2017. There have been no changes in fair values of recurring assets and there have been no transfers between levels in 2017.  106  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 5. Tax 5.1 Income tax Group accounting policies Tax for the year consists of current tax and deferred tax for the year including adjustments to previous years and changes in provision for uncertain tax positions. The tax attributable to the profit for the year is recognised in the income statement, whereas the tax attributable to equity transactions is recognised directly in equity. The tax expense relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income. Following developments in ongoing tax disputes primarily related to transfer pricing cases, uncertain tax positions are presented individually as part of deferred tax assets, non-current tax receivables and non-current tax payables. Current tax liabilities and receivables are recognised in the balance sheet at the amounts calculated on the taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on taxable incomes for prior years and for taxes paid on account. Key accounting estimates Income taxes and uncertain tax position The Group continuously wants to be a compliant corporate tax citizen in collaboration with Vestas operations and stakeholders and to support shareholder interest and its reputation. To ensure compliance, national and international tax laws as well as the  OECD Guidelines are acknowledged and followed throughout the world.  The Group is subject to income taxes around the world and therefore recognises that significant judgement is required in  determining the worldwide accrual for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and provision for uncertain tax  positions.  The global business implies that the Group may be subject to disputes on allocation of profits between different jurisdictions.  Management judgement is applied to assess the expected outcome of such tax disputes which is provided for in provision for  uncertain tax positions. Management believes that provisions made for uncertain tax positions not yet settled with local tax  authorities at year end is adequate. However, the actual obligation may deviate and is dependent on the result of litigations and  settlements with the relevant tax authorities. mEUR 2017 2016 Current tax on profit for the year 248 371 Deferred tax on profit for the year 19 (44) Tax on profit for the year 267 327 Change in income tax rate 33 1 Adjustments relating to previous years (net) (2) (6) Income tax for the year recognised in the income statement, expense 298 322 Deferred tax on other comprehensive income for the year 37 (33) Tax recognised in other comprehensive income, expense/(income) 37 (33) Deferred tax on equity transactions (5) - Tax recognised in equity (5) - Total income taxes for the year, expense 330 289  107  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 5.1 Income tax (continued) mEUR 2017 2016 Income tax as at 1 January, net assets (154) (22) Exchange rate adjustments (2) 2 Income tax for the year (248) (371) Adjustments relating to previous years - 40 Non-current income tax (65) (15) Settlements against VAT receivables 37 - Income tax paid in the year 262 212 Income tax as at 31 December, net assets/(liabilities) (170) (154) Receivables specified as follows: 0-1 year 53 25 > 1 year 51 49 Income tax receivables 104 74 Liabilities specified as follows: 0-1 year (108) (191) > 1 year (166) (37) Income tax liabilities (274) (228) Computation of effective tax rate 2017  percent 0 10 20 30 Income tax rate in Denmark Income and expenses non-taxable Write-down of tax assets Income/(loss) from investments in  joint ventures Change of income tax rate 1) Effective tax rate Deviation in foreign subsidiaries' tax rates  compared to the Danish tax rate (net) 22 1 1 (3) 1 3 25 Computation of effective tax rate 2016  percent 0 10 20 30 Income tax rate in Denmark Income and expenses non-taxable Write-down of tax assets Income/(loss) from investments in  joint ventures Change of income tax rate Effective tax rate Deviation in foreign subsidiaries' tax rates  compared to the Danish tax rate (net) 22 3 0 (2) 2 0 25 1) Change of income tax rate mainly relates to the reduction of tax rate in USA.  108  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 5.2 Deferred tax Group accounting policies Deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method in respect of all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is, however, not recognised in respect of temporary differences on initial recognition of goodwill and other items, apart from business acquisitions, where temporary differences have arisen at the time of acquisition without affecting the profit for the year or the taxable income. In cases where the computation of the tax base may be made according to different tax rules, deferred tax is measured on the basis of managements intended use of the asset and settlement of the liability, respectively. Deferred tax assets, including the tax base of tax loss carry-forwards, are recognised in other non-current assets at the value at which the asset is expected to be realised, either by elimination of tax on future earnings or by set-off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets are reviewed on an annual basis and are only recognised when it is probable that they will be utilised in future periods. Adjustments are made to deferred tax to take account of the elimination of unrealised inter-company profits and losses. Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates of the respective countries that will be effective when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax based on the legislation at the balance sheet date. Changes to deferred tax due to changes to tax rates are recognised in the income statement except for items recognised directly in equity. Key accounting estimates Valuation of deferred tax assets The Group recognises deferred tax assets, including the tax value of tax loss carry-forwards, where Management assesses that the tax assets may be utilised in the foreseeable future for set-off against positive taxable income. The assessment is made on an annual basis and is based on the budgets and business plans for future years, including planned business initiatives. Key parameters are expected revenue and EBIT development considering expected allocation of future taxable income based on the transfer pricing policy in place. Due to the uncertainties relating to allocation of profits Management has limited the forecast  period used to determine the utilisation to three years. Of the total tax loss carry-forwards, EUR 18m (2016: EUR 43m) is expected to be realised within 12 months, and EUR 18m  (2015: EUR 33m) is expected to be realised later than 12 months after the balance sheet date. The assessment in 2017 resulted in the reversal of write-down of deferred tax assets by EUR 33m (2016: EUR 22m  write-down) primarily due to the fact that the tax losses are expected to be utilised in the foreseeable future. As at 31 December 2017, the value of recognised deferred tax assets amounted to EUR 218m (2016: EUR 208m), of which  EUR 36m (2016: EUR 76m) relates to tax loss carry-forwards. The value of non-recognised tax assets totals EUR 102m  (2016: EUR 250m), of which EUR 102m (2016: EUR 135m) relating to write-downs that are not expected to be utilised in the  foreseeable future.  109  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 5.2 Deferred tax (continued) mEUR 2017 2016 Deferred tax as at 1 January, net assets 174 129 Deferred tax on profit for the year (19) 44 Adjustment relating to previous years 2 (34) Changes in income tax rate (33) (1) Transferred to non-current tax receivables/payables 65 15 Deferred tax on equity transactions 5 - Acquisitions as part of business combinations - (12) Tax on other comprehensive income (37) 33 Deferred tax as at 31 December, net assets 157 174 Deferred tax assets specified as follows: Tax value of tax loss carry-forwards (net) 36 76 Intangible assets (1) (96) Property, plant and equipment 19 77 Current assets 175 268 Provisions 39 134 Uncertain tax position - (115) Write-down of tax assets (102) (135) Other 1) 52 (1) Deferred tax assets 218 208 Deferred tax provisions specified as follows: Intangible assets 104 19 Property, plant and equipment (15) 11 Current assets 40 4 Provisions (93) - Other 25 - Deferred tax provisions 61 34 1)  Other mainly relates to deferred revenue and share-based payment. No provision is made for deferred tax regarding undistributed earnings in subsidiaries, as the Group controls the release of the obligation. Deferred tax recognised on tax losses is mainly in jurisdictions where there are no expiry limits. Out of total tax losses recognised  EUR 11m (2016: EUR 9m) are subject to expiry limits of which EUR 0m (2016: EUR 0m) is recognised in jurisdictions with  subsequent losses. Following the Group transfer pricing policy these losses are expected to be utilised within the foreseeable  future. Of the total deferred tax relating to tax loss carry-forwards written down, EUR 0m (2016: EUR 0m) relates to Denmark. The  recognised loss carry-forward relating to Denmark amounts to EUR 0m (2016: EUR 0m). As many other multinational businesses, the Group recognises the increased focus on the transfer pricing and the consequent  allocation of profits to the relevant countries. Even though the Groups subsidiaries pay corporate tax in the countries in which  they operate, the group is still part of a number of tax audits on different locations. Some of these disputes concern significant  amounts and uncertainties. The Group believes that the provisions made for uncertain tax positions not yet settled with the  local tax authorities is adequate. However, the actual obligation may differ and is subject to the result of the litigations and  settlements with the relevant tax authorities.  110  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 6.

Non-audit services / (Audit fees + Assurance engagements + Tax compliance and  preparation fees) is 44 percent (2016: 70 percent). Excluding significant one-time capital structure events is 39 percent (2016: 41 percent). Vestas' auditors can be used, within certain parameters, for certain non-audit services and may often be the preferable choice  due to business knowledge, confidentiality, and cost considerations. Vestas has a policy for non-audit services ensuring that the  provision of non-audit services to the Group does not impair the auditors'  independence or objectivity. The Audit Committee is  responsible for the development and maintenance of this  policy and monitors compliance.   Fee for other services than statutory audit services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers Statsautoriseret Revisionspartner- selskab (PwC Denmark) to the Group amounts to EUR 2m and consists mainly of transfer pricing tax advisory services and other  advisory services. 6.2 Managements incentive programmes Group accounting policies The Group operates a number of share-based compensation schemes (share options and restricted share programmes) under  which it awards Vestas shares and share options to members of the Executive Management and certain key employees in Vestas  Wind Systems A/S or its subsidiaries. The value of the services received in exchange for the granting of options and issuance of shares is measured at the fair value of  the options/shares.  Equity settled share options granted and restricted shares issued to employees are measured at fair value at the time of  granting and are recognised in staff expenses in the income statement over the vesting period. The opposite entry is recognised  directly in equity.  On initial recognition of the share options/restricted shares, the number of options/shares expected to vest is estimated.  Subsequently, the estimate is revised so that the total expense recognised is based on the actual number of options granted and  shares vested.  The fair value of the options granted is estimated using an option pricing model (Black-Scholes). In determining fair value,  the terms and conditions relating to the share options granted are taken into account. The fair value of restricted shares is  determined based on Vestas quoted share price at grant adjusted for expected dividend payout (based on historic dividend  payout ratio). Share option programme A share option programme was established in 2006 and has since been expanded with new options granted year on year until  2012. Since 2012 there have not been awarded new share option programmes.  The members may exercise their options in specified periods and choose to purchase the companys shares at the determined  strike price according to the terms of the programme. Exercise of the options can only occur in the periods during which  executives are allowed to trade shares in accordance with the Groups internal rules, being within the four weeks following the  companys announcement of the annual report and interim financial reports. The members of the scheme lose the right to the  options if they terminate their employment before the end of the vesting period.  Options are allotted to members when the Board of Directors approves the final annual report relating to the year of grant.   111  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 6.2 Managements incentive programmes (continued) For 2010 onwards, only the Executive Management, Presidents (former), and Group Senior Vice Presidents reporting directly  to the Executive Management must for a period of three years after exercise of the options, hold shares in the company  corresponding to 50 percent of the gains, after tax, they have earned on the options. The share options were exercisable three years after the issue date and will expire after five years. Options granted in 2009 (expansion of 2007 programme) and 2010 could be exercised in 2015 and options granted in 2011  and 2012 could be exercised in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017, respectively.  The options are valued on the date of grant, based on the Black-Scholes valuation model. The share prices and the exercise  prices are based on the closing share prices obtained from Bloomberg Financial Markets on the day the options were granted.  The risk free interest rate is estimated as the effective interest rate on a Danish government bond with the same economic  life, in this case two, five, six, and seven-year bonds. The future volatility, which means fluctuations in the shares total yield, is  calculated based on historic weekly closing share prices for a period corresponding to time to maturity of the options.

Average share price for the exercised share options in 2017 was DKK 510 (2016:  DKK455). During 2017, 176,373 shares were exercised at an exercise price of DKK 58. Restricted performance share programme  In March 2013, the share-based incentive programme was revised and after this, the share-based incentive programme is  based on restricted performance shares instead of share options which were used in previous programmes. The purpose of the  restricted performance shares is to ensure common goals for management, certain key employees, and shareholders. The number of shares available for grant may be adjusted in the event of changes in Vestas capital structure. Further, in the  event of a change of control, merger, winding-up or demerger of Vestas, an accelerated grant may extraordinarily take place. In  the event of certain transfers of activities or changes in ownership interests within the Vestas Group, adjustment, replacement of  the programme and/or settlement in cash of the programme entirely or partly may also take place. In May 2017, the Board of Directors launched a new restricted performance share programme. The share-based incentive  programme follows the structure of the previous programme from 2016 and will still be based on restricted performance shares.  The programme has a performance period of three years and a performance measurement based on financial key performance  indicators as well as the Vestas Groups market share as defined by the Board of Directors.  112  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 6.2 Managements incentive programmes (continued) The terms and conditions governing the restricted performance share programme are as follows:   Only participants employed by the Group at the time of announcement of the programme or later in the financial year are  eligible for participation in the restricted performance share programme.   The number of restricted performance shares available for distribution depends on Vestas performance as per table below.   Depending on the performance, the total number of shares to be granted will range between 0 percent and 150 percent of the  target level and is determined by Vestas performance in the financial year. 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Year awarded: May 2017 April 2016 April 2015 March 2014 March 2013 Performance year: 1) 2017-2019 2016-2018 2015-2017 2014 2013 Vesting conditions (KPIs): EPS, ROCE,   Market share EPS, ROCE   Market share EPS, ROCE,   Market share EBIT margin,   Free cash flow,   Business area  specific KPIs EBIT margin,   Free cash flow,   Business area  specific KPIs Vesting years: 2020/2022 2019/2021 2018/2020 2017/2019 2016/2018 1)  Performance years defined as the Groups financial year.

Non-current assets held for sale are presented separately on the balance sheet. Immediately before the initial classification  of the assets as held for sale, the carrying amounts of the assets are measured in accordance with their applicable accounting  policy. Non-current assets held for sale are subsequently measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost  to sell. Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated. Properties In the first quarter of 2017, the Group sold office buildings as a sale and leaseback agreement. The Group received EUR 99m  in cash for the office buildings, and less cost to sell this was equivalent to the carrying amount of EUR 95m. As such, the sale  impacts the income statement by EUR 0m. At the same time, Vestas has entered into an irrevocable operating lease agreement  for 10 years. The minimum lease obligations relating to the operating lease amounts to EUR 32m. The lease obligation is  included in the total minimum lease obligation in note 6.3 Contractual obligations. mEUR 2017 2016 Non-current assets classified as held for sale: Property, plant and equipment - 95 6.7 Subsequent events Acquisition of Utopus On 2 February 2018, the Group has entered into an agreement for the acquisition of Utopus Insights, Inc.

Basis for preparation 7.1 General accounting policies The annual report of Vestas Wind Systems A/S comprises the consolidated  financial statements of Vestas Wind Systems A/S and its subsidiaries and sep- arate financial statements of the parent company, Vestas Wind Systems A/S.  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance  with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the  European Union and the additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed  companies, cf. the Danish Statutory Order on Adoption of IFRS issued pursu- ant to the Danish Financial Statements Act.  Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the histori- cal cost method, except for the derivative financial instruments and marke- able securities, which are measured at fair value and non-current assets held  for sale, which are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value  less costs to sell. The accounting policies remain unchanged for the consolidated financial  statements compared to 2016. The consolidated financial statements are presented in million euro. This note describes the general accounting policies. Other accounting policies  are described in the separate notes to the consolidated financial statements.  Materiality in the financial reporting For the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the Group dis- closes the information required according to IFRS, unless such information is  deemed immaterial or irrelevant. A judgement is made of whether more detailed specifications are necessary  in the presentation of the Groups assets, liabilities, financial position, and  results. All judgements are made with due consideration of legislation and the  consolidated financial statements as a whole presenting a true and fair view. Consolidated financial statements The consolidated financial statements comprise  Vestas Wind Systems A/S  (the parent company) and the subsidiaries over which  Vestas Wind Systems  A/S exercises control.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S and its subsidiaries together  are referred to as the Group. Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures  depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The  Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined  them to be joint ventures. An overview of Group legal entities is provided on pages 115-116. The consolidated financial statements are prepared from the financial state- ments of the parent company and subsidiaries by combining accounting items  of a uniform nature, with subsequent elimination of intercompany income and  expenses, shareholdings, intercompany balances and dividends as well as  unrealised profits and losses on transactions between consolidated entities. The consolidated financial statements are based on financial statements pre- pared under the accounting policies of the Group. Business combinations Newly acquired or newly founded subsidiaries are recognised from the date  of obtaining control. Upon acquisition of subsidiaries, the acquisition method  is applied.  Cost is stated as the fair value of the assets transferred, obligations under- taken and shares issued. Cost includes the fair value of any earn-outs.  Expenses related to the acquisition are recognised in the income statement  in the period in which they are incurred. Identifiable assets, liabilities and con- tingent liabilities (net assets) relating to the entity acquired are recognised  at the fair value at the date of acquisition calculated in accordance with the  Group accounting policies.  In connection with every acquisition, goodwill and a non-controlling interest  (minority) are recognised according to one of the following methods:  1)  Goodwill relating to the entity acquired comprises a positive difference, if  any, between the total fair value of the entity acquired and the fair value of  the total net assets for accounting purposes. The non-controlling interest  is recognised at the share of the total fair value of the entity acquired (full  goodwill).  2)  Goodwill relating to the entity acquired comprises a positive difference,  if any, between the cost and the fair value of the Groups share of the net  assets for accounting purposes of the acquired enterprise at the date of  acquisition. The non-controlling interest is recognised at the proportion- ate share of the net assets acquired (proportionate goodwill).  Goodwill is recognised in intangible assets. It is not amortised, but reviewed  for impairment once a year and also if events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. If impairment is established,  the goodwill is written down to its lower recoverable amount.  Sold or liquidated entities are recognised up to the date of disposal. Any gain  or loss compared to the carrying amount at the date of disposal is recognised  in the income statement to the extent the control of the subsidiary is also  transferred. Translation policies Functional currency and presentation currency Assets, liabilities and transactions of each of the reporting entities of the  Group are measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in  which the entity operates (the functional currency). Transactions in currencies  other than the functional currency are transactions in foreign currencies. The  functional currency of the parent company is Danish kroner (DKK); however,  due to the Groups international relations, the consolidated financial state- ments are presented in Euro (EUR). Translation into presentation currency The balance sheet is translated into the presentation currency at the EUR rate  at the balance sheet date. In the income statement the transaction date rates  are based on average rates for the individual months to the extent that this  does not materially distort the presentation of the underlying transactions. Translation of transactions and amounts  Transactions in foreign currencies are initially translated into the functional  currency at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Exchange adjust- ments arising due to differences between the transaction date rates and the  rates at the dates of payment are recognised as financial income or financial  costs in the income statement. Receivables, payables and other monetary  items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are trans- lated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Exchange adjustments  arising due to differences between the rates at the balance sheet date and the  transaction date rates are recognised as financial income or financial costs in  the income statement. Translation of Group entities On recognition in the consolidated financial statements of foreign entities with  a functional currency that differs from the presentation currency of the Group,  income statements are translated at transaction date rates, and balance sheet  items are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The trans- action date rates are based on average rates for the individual months to the  extent that this does not materially distort the presentation of the underlying  transaction. Exchange adjustments arising on the translation of the opening  equity of foreign entities at exchange rates at the balance sheet date and on  the translation of income statements from transaction date rates to exchange  rates at the balance sheet date are recognised in other comprehensive income. Exchange adjustments of balances with foreign entities that are treated as   118  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements part of the total net investment in the entity in question are recognised in  other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements.  On recognition in the consolidated financial statements of investments  accounted for using the equity method with functional currencies that differ  from the presentation currency of the Group, the shares of results for the year  are translated at average exchange rates, and the shares of equity including  goodwill are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Exchange adjustments arising on the translation of the share of the open- ing equity of foreign investments accounted for using the equity method at  exchange rates at the balance sheet date and on the translation of the share  of results for the year from average exchange rates to exchange rates at the  balance sheet date are recognised in other comprehensive income. On full or partial disposal of foreign entities, resulting in a loss of control or  on repayment of balances treated as part of the net investment, the share of  the accumulated exchange adjustments recognised in other comprehensive  income, is recognised in the income statement at the same time as any profit  or loss on the disposal. Income statement Special items Special items comprise costs and income of a special or non-recurring nature  in relation to the main activities of the Group. This includes costs related to  significant organisational restructuring and adjustments to production capac- ity and the product programme. The costs include the write-down of tangible  assets as well as provisions for reorganisations and any reversal/ adjustments thereof. Leases For accounting purposes, lease contracts are classified as either finance or  operating lease obligations. A lease is classified as a finance lease when it transfers substantially all risks  and rewards of the leased asset as if the asset had been owned. Other leases  are classified as operating leases. Finance lease assets are capitalised under property, plant and equipment and  are depreciated over their expected useful lives. The corresponding finance  lease obligations are recognised in liabilities. Operating lease expenses are  recognised on a straight line basis in the income statement over the lease term. Marketable securities On initial recognition marketable securities are recognised in the balance  sheet at fair value and subsequently re-measured at fair value through  profit or loss. Any changes in the fair values of the marketable securities are  recognised in the income statement as financial items. Equity Translation reserve The translation reserve in the consolidated financial statements comprises  exchange rate adjustments arising on the translation of the financial  statements of foreign entities from their functional currencies into the  presentation currency of the Group (EUR). Upon full or part realisation of the net investment in foreign entities, exchange  adjustments are recognised in the income statement. Cash flow hedging reserve The cash flow hedging reserve in the consolidated financial statements  comprises gains and losses on fair value adjustments of forward exchange  contracts concerning future transactions as well as hedging in connection  with commodities. Cash flow statement The cash flow statement shows the Groups cash flows for the year, broken  down by operating, investing and financing activities, changes for the year in  cash and cash equivalents as well as the Groups cash and cash equivalents  at the beginning and end of the year. Cash flows relating to acquired entities  are recognised from the date of acquisition. Cash flows relating to entities  disposed of are recognised until the date of disposal. Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows from operating activities are calculated as the net profit/loss for  the year adjusted for non-cash operating items such as depreciation, amor- tisation and impairment losses, provisions and changes in working capital,  interest received and paid and income tax paid. Working capital comprises  current assets less short-term debt, which does not include current bank  loans.   Cash flows from investing activities Cash flows from investing activities comprise cash flows from business  acquisitions and disposals and from acquisitions and disposals of intangible  assets, property, plant and equipment, purchase of marketable securities, as  well as other non-current assets. The cash flow effect of business acquisitions  and sales is shown separately. The establishment of finance leases is treated  as non-cash transactions. Cash flows from financing activities Cash flows from financing activities comprise changes to the amount or  composition of the Groups share capital and related expenses as well as the  raising of loans, repayment of interest-bearing debt, acquisition and sale of  treasury shares together with distribution of dividends to shareholders. Cash  flows from finance lease assets are recognised as interest payments and  repayments of debts. 7.1 General accounting policies (continued)  119  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements Key accounting estimates and judgements When preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Group, Manage- ment makes a number of accounting estimates and assumptions, which form  the basis of recognition and measurement of the Groups assets and liabili- ties. The Groups accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements. Critical judgements and estimates The calculation of the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities  requires judgements, estimates and assumptions relating to future events. The estimates and assumptions made are based on experience and other  factors that management considers reasonable in the circumstances, but that  are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. The assumptions may be incom- plete or inaccurate and unexpected events or circumstances may arise. Fur- thermore, the company is subject to risks and uncertainties which may result  in actual amounts deviating from these estimates. Key risks of the Group have  been described on pages 043-044 of the Management report, and in the  individual notes to the consolidated financial statements. It may be necessary to change estimates made previously due to changes in  the assumptions on which the previous estimates were based or due to new  knowledge or subsequent events. The areas involving a high degree of judgement and estimation that are sig- nificant to the consolidated financial statements are described in more detail  in the related notes. 7.2 Group accounting policies Critical accounting judgements and estimates Note Page Revenue Recognition of contract elements 1.2 073 Provisions Estimates for warranty provisions 3.5 090 Income tax Assumptions included in income tax assessment and uncertain tax position 5.1 106 Deferred tax Estimate of deferred tax assets valuation 5.2 108 Inventories Estimates of net realisable value  2.2 078 Other receivables Judgement of allowance for doubtful VAT receivables 2.5 081  120  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements Impact of new accounting standards The Group has implemented all new or amended accounting standards and  interpretations as adopted by the EU and applicable for the 2017 financial  year, including:   Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 (effective date 1 January 2017) None of these new or amended accounting standards and interpretations  resulted in any changes to the accounting policies for the Group or had signifi- cant impact on recognition, measurement or disclosures in the consolidated  financial statements in 2017. Management does not anticipate any signifi- cant impact on future periods from the adoption of these new or amended  accounting standards and interpretations. New accounting standards not yet adopted The IASB has issued a number of new accounting standards and interpreta- tions with effective date after 31 December 2017. The Group will implement  the following new accounting standards and interpretations when they  become mandatory:      IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (effective date 1 January 2018)   IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective date 1 January  2018)   Clarifications to IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective  date 1 January 2018)    IFRS 16, Leases (effective date 1 January 2019)  IFRS 9, Financial Instruments IFRS 9 will be implemented in our consolidated financial statements for the  financial year beginning on 1 January 2018. A new model for classification and measurement of financial assets and lia- bilities has been introduced. The new model will not drive significant changes  for the Group. Further to this a new impairment model has been introduced based on  expected losses. The Group will not be impacted by the new expected credit  loss model to a significant degree. Moreover, a new hedge accounting model has been introduced which will align  the way that the Group undertakes risk management activities with the hedge  accounting qualification criteria. The changed hedge accounting model will  not have significant impact to the consolidated financial statements. However IFRS 9, Financial Instruments will require additional disclosures. IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and Clarifications to  IFRS 15  IFRS 15 will be implemented in our consolidated financial statements for the  financial year beginning on 1 January 2018. The Group will apply IFRS 15  using modified retrospective application, with the cumulative effect of initially  applying the standard to be adjusted to the opening balance of retained earn- ings 2018. Consequently, 2017 comparative figures will be reported accord- ing to IAS 11/IAS 18 and will not be restated to reflect the numbers according  to IFRS 15. Note disclosures will be available stating 2018 numbers accord- ing to both IFRS 15 and IAS 11/IAS 18, to provide comparability between  2017 and 2018 and to disclose the effect from the changed regulation. Under current IAS 11/IAS 18 regulation, timing of revenue recognition is  primarily dependent on the transfer of risks and rewards to the customer of  the goods and services. Under IFRS 15 regulation, timing of revenue recogni- tion is primarily dependent on the transfer of control to the customer for the  relevant performance obligations in a contract. IFRS 15 does not change the underlying principles of how the Group  accounts for the main revenue streams. Total revenue of a contract will remain  unchanged, however the timing of the revenue recognition will be deferred for  supply-only and turnkey contracts. IFRS 15 does not impact the cash flows for the Group. The Group expects an impact the note disclosures, due to the IFRS 15 disclo- sure requirements.  We have finalised our estimate made on the transition impact and the open- ing equity will be impacted negatively by approx. EUR 60m as at 1 January  2018. IFRS 16, Leases The Group is in the process of preparing for the implementation of IFRS 16,  which becomes effective 1 January 2019. The Group is still in the process of  making an assessment of the balance sheet impact of the standard. Based on  the preliminary assessment made, the change in lease accounting requires  capitalisation of operating lease contracts with an immaterial amount com- pared to the total assets. The lease expenses will according to the new accounting regulation be split  into two elements; depreciation and interest expenses as opposed to cur- rently being recognised as operating expenses.  We expect to implement the standard based on the simplified transition  method where the Group will not restate comparative information, but recog- nise the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 as an adjustment to  opening equity at the date of initial application. 7.3 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures  121  Vestas annual report 2017  Consolidated financial statements 7.4 Financial definitions FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Investments: Investments equal Cash flow from  investing activities.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and  additional requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act. The financial statements of Vestas Wind Systems A/S have been prepared in accor- dance with the Danish Financial Statements Act. The management report is also prepared in accordance with the Danish disclosure requirements for  listed companies. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and the  company as at 31 December 2017 and of the results of the Group and companys operations and consolidated cash flows for the financial year 1 Janu- ary – 31 December 2017. In our opinion, the management report includes a fair review of the development in the operations and financial circumstances of the Group and the  company, of the results for the year and of the financial position of the Group and the company as well as a description of the most significant risks and  elements of uncertainty facing the Group and the company. In our opinion, the social and environmental statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies applied. They give a fair review  of the Groups social and environment performance. We recommend that the Annual General Meeting approve the annual report. Aarhus, 7 February 2018 Executive Management Anders Runevad Group President & CEO Marika Fredriksson Executive Vice President & CFO Board of Directors Bert Nordberg Chairman Lars Josefsson Deputy chairman Eija Pitknen Henrik Andersen Carsten Bjerg Lykke Friis Kim Hvid Thomsen Torben Ballegaard Srensen Sussie Dvinge Agerbo Peter Lindholst Michael Abildgaard Lisbjerg Henry Stnson Jean-Marc Lechne Executive Vice President & COO Juan Araluce Executive Vice President & CSO Anders Vedel  Executive Vice President & CTO Statements  123  Vestas annual report 2017  Statements Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Revenue recognition Recognition of the Groups revenue is complex due to  several types of customer contracts utilised, including  sale of wind turbines and power plants (supply-only,  supply-and-installation and turnkey), service contracts  and sale of spare parts.  We focused on this area as recognition of revenue  involves significant judgement made by Management  including, whether contracts contain deliverables  which should be separated for revenue recognition  purposes and the most appropriate revenue  recognition methodology for each of those elements,  determining the allocation of consideration on a fair  value basis between components of multi-element  contracts as noted above, assessing when transfer  of risk has occurred regarding sale of wind turbines  (supply-only and supply-and-installation) and sale of  spare parts, and assessing the degree of completion of  project and service contracts which are accounted for  on a percentage of completion basis. Refer to Note 1.2 and Note 2.4. We tested the relevant internal controls used to ensure the completeness, accuracy and timing of  revenue recognized, including controls over the degree of completion of turnkey and service contracts  at year-end.  We read a sample of both project and service contracts to assess whether the revenue recognition  methodology was relevant and consistent with accounting standards, and had been applied  consistently. We focused on contract classification, allocation of income and cost to the individual  parts of the contracts and timing of transfer of risk. Where a contract contained multiple elements,  we considered Managements judgements as to whether there were elements that should be  accounted for separately, and, in such cases, challenged the judgements made in the allocation of the  consideration to each element. We evaluated and challenged the significant judgements and estimates made by Management  in applying Vestas accounting policy to a sample of specific contracts and separable elements of  contracts, and we obtained evidence to support them, including details of contractual agreements,  delivery records, cash receipts and project plans. For the contracts selected, we inspected original  signed contracts and agreed the revenue recognised to the underlying accounting records.  We obtained a sample of Managements calculations of the degree of completion of turnkey and  service contracts at year-end. We matched a sample of source data used in Managements calculation  to supporting evidence, and evaluated the judgements applied. We also considered the historical  outturns of judgements used in prior periods.  We applied Computer Assisted Audit Techniques to establish, whether any revenue had been recognised  where no corresponding accounts receivable or cash item had been recorded in the general ledger. The independent auditors report To the Shareholders of Vestas Wind Systems A/S Our opinion In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and  fair view of the Groups financial position at 31 December 2017 and  of the results of the Groups operations and cash flows for the financial  year 1 January to 31 December 2017 in accordance with International  Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further  requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act. Moreover, in our opinion, the Parent Company Financial Statements  give a true and fair view of the Parent Companys financial position at  31 December 2017 and of the results of the Parent Companys opera- tions for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2017 in accord- ance with the Danish Financial Statements Act. Our opinion is consistent with our Auditors Long-form Report to the  Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. What we have audited The Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company  Financial Statements of Vestas Wind Systems A/S for the financial  year 1 January to 31 December 2017 comprise income statement,  balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and notes, including  summary of significant accounting policies for the Group as well as for  the Parent Company and statement of comprehensive income and cash  flow statement for the Group. Collectively referred to as the Financial  Statements. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards  on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Den- mark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are  further described in the Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the  Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Independence We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International  Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Profes- sional Accountants (IESBA Code) and with the additional requirements  applicable in Denmark. We have also fulfilled our other ethical respon- sibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. To the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services  referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 were not  provided. Appointment Following the admission of the shares of Vestas Wind Systems A/S  for listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen, we were first appointed auditors of  Vestas Wind Systems A/S on 5 May 1999. We have been reappointed  annually by shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted  engagement of 19 years including the financial year 2017. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judge- ment, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial State- ments for 2017. These matters were addressed in the context of our  audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opin- ion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  124  Vestas annual report 2017  Statements Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Tax risks The Group operates in a complex multinational tax  environment and the Group is part in tax cases with  domestic and foreign tax authorities. We focused on this area as the amounts involved are  material and as the valuation of the provision and  deferred tax assets is associated with a high degree of  judgement. At 31 December 2017, the Group has recognised  provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions. Furthermore, the Group has recognised write-downs  on deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 5.1 and 5.2. We evaluated relevant internal controls regarding completeness of records of uncertain tax positions  and Managements procedure for estimating the provision for uncertain tax provisions and write-down  of deferred tax assets.  In understanding and evaluating Managements judgements, we considered the status of recent and  current tax authority audits and enquiries, the outcome of previous claims, judgemental positions  taken in tax returns and current estimates and developments in the tax environment. In addition, we used PwC local and international tax specialists to evaluate and challenge the  adequacy of Managements key assumptions and read correspondence with tax authorities to assess  Managements estimates. We evaluated the Groups model for valuation of deferred tax assets, including the forecasts used to  estimate the expected future taxable income. Warranty provisions The Groups product warranties primarily cover  expected costs to repair or replace components  with defects or functional errors and financial losses  suffered by the Groups customers in connection with  unplanned suspension of operations. Warranties are  usually granted for a two-year period from delivery of  the turbine, however, in certain cases, a warranty of up  to five years is granted. Additionally, provisions are  also made for turbines sold with serial errors.  We focused on this area as the completeness and  valuation of the expected outcome of warranty  provisions requires a high degree of Management  judgement and the use of estimates giving rise to  inherent uncertainty in the amounts recorded in the  financial statements. Refer to Note 3.5. We tested the relevant internal controls regarding completeness of warranty provisions and how  Management assesses valuation of provisions. We challenged the assumptions underlying the valuation of provisions by checking and corroborating  the inputs used to calculate the provisions, including interviewing project managers, cost controllers  and Management regarding individual cases. We assessed specific warranty provisions held for  individual cases to evaluate whether the warranty provisions were sufficient to cover expected costs  at year-end. Further, we assessed the level of historical warranty claims to assess whether the total warranty  provisions held at year-end were sufficient to cover expected costs in light of known and expected  cases and standard warranty periods provided. Inventory valuation The valuation of inventory across the Group is  dependent on establishing appropriate valuation  controls.  We focused on this area as Management judgement  is applied to estimate the appropriate write-down for  obsolete inventories and the indirect production costs  manually capitalised as inventory. These judgements  are key elements in the valuation of inventories. Refer to Note 2.2. We tested relevant internal controls that the Group uses to ensure proper valuation of inventory,  including the procedures for write-down of obsolete inventory and the indirect production costs  manually capitalised as inventory.  We tested the adequacy of write-downs for excess and/or obsolete inventory by verifying future  demand data, historical usage, historical accuracy of write-downs and Managements plans to utilise  the inventory.  We evaluated and challenged the significant judgements and estimates made by Management in  applying Vestas accounting policy in relation to indirect production costs. Statement on Managements Review Management is responsible for Managements Review. Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover Managements  Review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion  thereon. In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibil- ity is to read Managements Review and, in doing so, consider whether  Managements Review is materially inconsistent with the Financial State- ments or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be  materially misstated.  Moreover, we considered whether the Managements Review includes  the disclosures required by the Danish Financial Statements Act.  Based on the work we have performed, in our view, Managements  Review is in accordance with the Consolidated Financial Statements  and Parent Company Financial Statements and has been prepared in  accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not iden- tify any material misstatement in Managements Review. Managements responsibilities for the Financial  Statements Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated finan- cial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Inter- national Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and fur- ther requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act and for the  preparation of parent company financial statements that give a true  and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act,  and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary   125  Vestas annual report 2017  Statements Kim Tromholt State Authorised   Public Accountant mne33251 Kim Fchsel State Authorised   Public Accountant mne9291 Hellerup, 7 February 2018 PricewaterhouseCoopers Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab Company Reg. No.: 33771231 to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the Financial Statements, Management is responsible for  assessing the Groups and Parent Companys ability to continue as a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going con- cern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Manage- ment either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to  cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditors responsibilities for the audit of the Financial  Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assur- ance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance  with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will  always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence  the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial  Statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional require- ments applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and  maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:   Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the  Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and  perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit  evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may  involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,  or the override of internal control.   Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit  in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on  the effectiveness of the Groups and the Parent Companys internal  control.   Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by Management.   Conclude on the appropriateness of Managements use of the  going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence  obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Groups and  the Parent Companys ability to continue as a going concern. If  we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to  draw attention in our auditors report to the related disclosures in  the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to  modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence  obtained up to the date of our auditors report. However, future events  or conditions may cause the Group or the Parent Company to cease to  continue as a going concern.   Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the  Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the  Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and  events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.   Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial  information of the entities or business activities within the Group to  express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We  are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the  group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding,  among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and  significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in inter- nal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that  we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding inde- pendence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,  and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance,  we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit  of the Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the  key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors report  unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter  or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter  should not be communicated in our report because the adverse con- sequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the  public interest benefits of such communication.  126  Vestas annual report 2017  Statements Independent assurance report  To the Stakeholders of Vestas Wind Systems A/S Vestas Wind Systems A/S engaged us to provide limited assurance on  the consolidated social and environmental key figures and indicators  for the year ended 31 December 2017. Our conclusion Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we  have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to  believe that the consolidated social and environmental key figures  and indicators as stated on page 009 in the 2017 Annual Report  has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the  accounting policies as stated on page 062 of the 2017 Vestas Wind  SystemsA/S Annual Report. This conclusion is to be read in the context of what we say in the  remainder of our report. What we are assuring  The scope of our work was limited to assurance over consolidated  social and environmental key figures and indicators as stated on page  009 in the 2017 Vestas Wind Systems A/S Annual Report. Professional standards applied and level of assurance We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with  International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised)  Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical  Financial Information. A limited assurance engagement is substantially  less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation  to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding  of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the  assessed risks; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a lim- ited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance  that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engage- ment been performed. Our independence and quality control We have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants  issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants,  which includes independence and other ethical requirements founded  on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional com- petence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. The  firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accord- ingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including  documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethi- cal requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and  regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an independent  multidisciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and  assurance. Understanding reporting and measurement  methodologies Data and information need to be read and understood together with  the accounting principles (page 062 of the 2017 Vestas Wind   Systems A/S Annual Report), which Management is solely responsible  for selecting and applying. The absence of a significant body of estab- lished practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial  information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement tech- niques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.  Work performed We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the  risk of material misstatement of the data. In doing so and based on our  professional judgement, we:   Obtained an understanding of Vestas Wind Systems A/S control  environment and information systems relevant to quantification and  reporting of social and environmental data, through inquiries;   Made site visits in Denmark, India and Sweden to assess the  completeness of social and environmental data sources, data  collection methods, source data and relevant assumptions applicable  to the sites. The sites selected for testing were chosen taking into  consideration their size and sites selected in prior periods. Our  procedures included testing to underlying documentation as well as  input data controls performed at these sites;   Conducted interviews and show-me meetings with Group functions  to assess consolidation processes, use of company-wide systems  and controls performed at group level as well as test of social  and environmental data prepared at Group level to underlying  documentation;    Conducted analytical review of the data and trend explanations  submitted by all reporting entities for consolidation at Group level;  and   Evaluated internal and external documentation to determine whether  information in the 2017 Social and Environmental Statement are  supported by sufficient evidence. Managements responsibilities Management of Vestas Wind Systems A/S is responsible for:   Designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls over  information relevant to the preparation of the consolidated social and  environmental key figures and indicators that are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;    Establishing objective accounting principles for preparing data; and   Measuring and reporting the consolidated social and environmental  key figures and indicators based on the accounting principles. Our responsibility We are responsible for:   Planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance  about whether the consolidated social and environmental key figures  and indicators as stated on page 009 in the 2017 Annual Report  are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;   Forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we  have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and   Reporting our conclusion to the Stakeholders of Vestas Wind  Systems A/S Kim Tromholt State Authorised   Public Accountant mne33251 Kim Fchsel State Authorised   Public Accountant mne9291 Hellerup, 7 February 2018 PricewaterhouseCoopers Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab Company Reg.

This may result in commercial constructive obligations beyond the specified legally binding  warranty period for the wind turbine being recognised as a warranty obligation. Product risks Lack of reliability in several of Vestas products has previously led to major warranty provisions. In recent years, Vestas has  invested significant resources in improving the products and increasing their reliability. This work comprises design, production,  installation, and continuous maintenance. The goal of these initiatives is to reduce Vestas warranty costs, to secure customer returns, to increase the competitiveness of  the products, and to improve customer earnings. 3.6 Contingent assets and liabilities mEUR 2017 2016 The company has provided guarantee and indemnity for bank and bonding facilities related to MHI Vestas Offshore Wind A/S 267 309 In addition, the company provides parent company guarantees and indemnities to third parties in connection with project  supplies in subsidiaries, and their warranty obligations to customers.

On 31 July 2017 General Electric (GE) filed a complaint against Vestas Wind System A/S and Vestas-American Wind  Technology, Inc. (Vestas) in the US federal court in Los Angeles, California. GE claims infringement of its U.S. Patents No.  7,629,705 and No. 6,921,985 (the 705 Patent and the 985 Patent). The 705 Patent addresses Zero Voltage Ride Through  technology. The 985 Patent addresses techniques to maintain functioning of the blade pitch system during low voltage events.  Vestas answered and counterclaimed on December 15, 2017. As set forth in its counterclaims, it is Vestas assessment that GEs  patents are invalid and unenforceable, and that Vestas does not infringe. Consequently, Vestas has made no provision to cover  the complaint. However, in the event that Vestas is not successful in its defense in this case, and GE prevails, this case could  potentially have significant financial impact on Vestas. As GE has not claimed any specific amount from Vestas, it is not possible  for Vestas to estimate such financial impact any further at this point in time. For pending lawsuits, ref. note 3.6 to the Consolidated financial statements. For disclosure of contingent assets, ref. note 3.6 to  the Consolidated financial statements. The company is jointly taxed with its Danish subsidiaries. As the administrative company for the subsidiaries included in the  joint taxation, the company is liable for the tax obligations of the included subsidiaries.   138  Vestas annual report 2017  Financial statements for Vestas Wind Systems A/S 4.
