We continue to evolve our approach in line  with our stakeholders expectations. This years CSR Report  focuses on core themes that Scotiabank and its stakeholders  consider to be most important to the Bank, providing  highlights of our progress in 2017 on our CSR priorities.  Scotiabank has used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)  framework for CSR reporting since 2005. We have prepared  our 2017 CSR Report in accordance with GRIs Standards  framework, fulfilling the requirements of a Core report.  Scotiabank reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of  the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in the areas  of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption.   This report also constitutes our UNGC Communication  on Progress and describes the actions we are taking to  integrate the Ten Principles into our business strategy,   culture and operations. Fundamental to this commitment  is our global Human Rights Statement and approach. Scope of Reporting  The scope of our reporting for this CSR Report and   associated GRI Index includes information from November 1,  2016, through October 31, 2017, for Scotiabank and its fully  owned or major operating subsidiaries.

The priorities set out in this report were developed to reflect   our commitment to making a real and lasting difference in  communities across our footprint.  Scotiabankers are a critical part of the economic and social fabric   of the countries in which we operate – this is a responsibility that   we take seriously. That is why, in 2017, Scotiabank employees  contributed more than 403,500 hours of volunteering and  fundraising time, and the Bank contributed more than CAD$80  million globally in donations, sponsorships and other forms   of assistance.  The Banks role in the community is about more than philanthropy.  Let me give you four examples of some of our exciting CSR  achievements in 2017:   As part of our commitment to Young People in the Community,  last year, we built soccer fields for children in Peru and Mexico,  and through our sponsorship of soccer leagues, across Latin  America, thousands of young people had the opportunity to play,  make new friends and gain confidence. Here in Canada, we  support hockey at all levels. In 2017, the Bank reached the  important milestone of supporting more than 8,000 hockey  teams and one million kids and counting. Our historic, 20-year  partnership with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE) will  provide us with even more opportunities to give back to our  communities and help young people reach their full potential.   In continuing to support a healthy environment, we were proud   to announce our Greenhouse Gas emissions reduction target was  met one year early in 2016. This year we expanded that target  globally, to cover our entire footprint, and have committed to a  10% GHG reduction by 2021. We set an internal price on carbon  at CAD$15/tonne of CO2 to help advance us towards this goal.   In addition, as part of this environmental commitment, in February  this year Scotiabank pledged its support for the Taskforce for  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).  At the Bank, we are committed to becoming a digital leader in   the financial services industry. Consistent with our aspirations,   our annual technology spend – which includes digital – grew   14% over the last year, and now sits at more than CAD$3 billion.  Digital innovation plays a critical role in how we serve our   24 million customers. For example, we are using digital to increase  access to financial services. Within Canada, we digitized the  process to apply for small business loans, which made access   to capital quicker and more efficient. Outside of Canada, we  introduced self-serve kiosks with biometric authentication, which  helped our customers in countries such as Uruguay access  microfinance loans. We also believe that by investing in digital  technology, we are helping to strengthen the innovation  ecosystem in Canada and across our geographic footprint.   Our investments are helping to create jobs and strengthen   the economies of our key markets over the longer-term.   The world is changing, and, as a significant employer, we are  investing in training and leadership development opportunities that  are relevant for our employees. Modernized learning experiences  are better equipping our employees with the skills they need to  succeed in our increasingly digital world. Further, by ensuring that  our training programs are effective, we are improving performance  through learning. These efforts are helping to position the Bank   for a strong future and create a stronger society.   I want to take this opportunity to thank all of the Scotiabankers for  coming together to help our customers – and each other – during  the past year. Your contributions are making a tremendous impact  and you should be very proud.  This report highlights the role that Scotiabank continues to play   in supporting strong communities, a healthy environment and  economic growth. We will continue to do what we can to deliver   for all of our stakeholders – customers, shareholders, employees   and communities – today and in the years to come.  Brian J. Porter  Tom ONeill Chairman of Scotiabanks  Board of Directors CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY – REPORT 2017 3 APPENDIX INTRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT COMMUNITY CUSTOMERS GOVERNANCE CSR AT SCOTIABANK  EMPLOYEES CHAIRMANS LETTER Dear Stakeholders, To maintain the trust of our many stakeholders, including our  shareholders, customers and employees, we are committed to  enhancing customer protection, lending fairly, balancing stakeholder  interests and operating our Bank with integrity. Acting with integrity  to maintain and uphold our strong reputation requires solid,  strategic governance practices. The Annual Report along with   this CSR Report includes many examples of this in practice. We have made great progress in 2017 and continue to evolve our  governance standards to reflect best-in-class practices. This includes  embracing diversity of leadership, of thought and of gender. This  year, we have reaffirmed this belief by pledging our support to   the Canadian Chapter of the 30% Club, encouraging Canadian  businesses to increase the representation of women on boards.   I am proud to report over 33% of our Board members are women. While the responsibility for CSR resides with the Boards Corporate  Governance Committee, oversight of the Banks economic,  environmental and social impacts and risks is a shared board  responsibility and is overseen by each board committee. As risk  management is complex, our approach must be multi-disciplinary.  As a leading financial services provider and Canadas international  bank, we strive to build the economy of everyone and make a  positive difference around the world that also drives value for   the Bank.  Building the economy of everyone will require long-term investment  for future generations. As we have done for the past 185 years,  Scotiabank will continue to build value for our customers and the  real economy. These pages convey our pride of this in action and we look forward  to continue to sharing our progress.

In particular, conducting ongoing dialogue with  our key stakeholder groups helps us to identifyenvironmental,  social and governance trends, understand peoples  expectations in the diverse countries where we operate,   and seek feedback on our strategy and priorities. We engage  with stakeholders through a variety of methods and channels,  both formal and informal, across the various business  activities of the Bank, as summarized in the table below.

To gain  a deeper understanding of our stakeholders views and  expectations, we strengthened our stakeholder engagement  review process in 2017. We used a dedicated digital platform  to gather information from internal and external stakeholders  worldwide, including employees, customers, investors,  government officials, NGOs, charity partners, industry  associations and universities. In total, we captured 214  completed surveys, both from external stakeholders  and employees. We asked all our stakeholders to rank   the importance of material issues. In addition, we asked  employees to estimate the extent to which Scotiabank   could influence these topics.  Overall, both our external stakeholders and employees  strongly agreed on our most material issues. They highlighted  our governance of operations, transparency, customer service  and notably data privacy and security (which gained in  importance since our last materiality review in 2015) as key  priorities. Many of the high priority material issues related  directly or indirectly to customer experience. In general, most  of the priorities we identified in 2015 are still relevant today.

The Corporate Governance Committee reviews the Banks  CSR strategy and reporting, evaluates our environmental and  social performance and benchmarks our performance against  our industry peers. It also discusses global trends and best  practices in corporate disclosure of non-financial performance  with our CSR management team. In 2017, the Corporate  Governance Committee reviewed the evolution of our CSR  priorities, as well as our integrated human rights strategy.   The Corporate Governance Committee is composed entirely  of independent directors.  The Risk Committee reviews the Banks risk appetite (the level  of risk we are willing to accept). It continuously identifies and  monitors key risks, evaluates our risk policies and oversees  our Risk Management function. Additionally, the committee  may advise the Board on key risks and potential policies  (such as our Environmental Policy and Credit Risk Appetite)   as appropriate.

We require all employees, officers and directors to  acknowledge compliance with our Code on an annual basis.  This process is also reviewed annually by both internal and  independent auditors.  The six guiding principles of the Code are:   Follow the law wherever Scotiabank does business   Avoid putting yourself or Scotiabank in a conflict of interest  Conduct yourself honestly and with integrity   Respect confidentiality, and protect the integrity and  security of assets, communications, information   and transactions   Treat everyone fairly, equitably and professionally   Honour our commitments to the communities   in which we operate To supplement the Code, we have supporting policies and  procedures in place, including on: whistle-blowing, personal  information privacy protection, employee privacy, reputational  risk, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering. We also have  a global Human Rights Statement published in 2016. We deliver training to all relevant employees on key ethical  policies and issues. For example, in 2017, we enhanced our  Advanced Anti-Corruption course to become the Anti-Bribery  and Anti-Corruption course, incorporating content on both  bribery and corruption. Additionally, we stepped up our  employee training on Privacy issues and best practices within  International Banking with our Enterprise Privacy Office (EPO)  offering informative videos on our company-wide intranet.  We also implemented new sales practices training across  Canadian and International Banking.  Data Privacy and Security Our customers data privacy and security is crucial, particularly  with cyber security risks evolving rapidly and becoming ever  more sophisticated. We maintain a strong focus on protecting  customers assets and personal data, and require all our  employees to treat confidential information with the utmost  sensitivity. We continuously raise awareness of the importance  of privacy and information security within our company,  including via our mandatory e-learning program. Any breach  of confidentiality is addressed via our disciplinary procedure,  and can result in termination.  We adapt our strategy in line with evolving security risks,  particularly cyber risks, and invest significantly in leading- edge digital technology to keep our customers data safe.   In 2017 we formed a partnership with Team8, world  renowned cyber security experts from Israel, to work   with us on enhancing our capabilities in cyber security.  We require all employees, officers and directors  to acknowledge compliance with the Code on  an annual basis.  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY – REPORT 2017 1 5 GOVERNANCE INTRODUCTION CSR AT SCOTIABANK  APPENDIX ENVIRONMENT COMMUNITY CUSTOMERS EMPLOYEES Privacy Our Enterprise Privacy Office (EPO) is active in ensuring  compliance with privacy legislation and policies globally.   In 2017, the EPO updated the Scotiabank Privacy Incident   and Breach Management Procedures, which defines how   the Bank responds to Privacy incidents and breaches.   We also developed our enhanced Privacy Impact Assessment  (PIA) process, which helps our teams identify and mitigate  privacy risks related to new initiatives. There is an ongoing  focus on delivering such training globally. In addition,   the recruitment of more local privacy officers will occur   in 2018, in order to help our employees implement the   PIA process effectively. Cyber Security  We continuously strive to remain a step ahead of evolving  cyber security risks. In 2017, we made multiple improvements  to enhance customer protection, including strengthening the  way we verify the identity of employees interacting with our  systems and databases. We stepped up our incident response  processes and training, helping our employees to develop a  consistent, rigorous response to cyber incidents worldwide.  Importantly, we invited an independent third party to assess  the effectiveness of our incident response processes and took  action to further optimize and streamline our approach. To further safeguard our customers assets and enhance their  banking experience, we improved our customer authentication  process. In particular, we enhanced our security questions  and introduced fingerprint authentication. We plan to expand  biometric authentication to include face, eye and voice  recognition in the future.  Human Rights Respect for human rights sits at the heart of our core values  and guides the way we do business. We are committed to  upholding the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human  Rights, which provide a clear framework for businesses to  apply human rights targets. These human rights statements  are outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals, including  SDG 8 on promoting decent work and economic growth.   This goal includes a focus on economic growth and  productivity through diversification, innovation   and technological upgrading, as well as the protection   of the rights of employees and promoting safe and secure  work environments for all workers. We have also developed business practices and procedures   to integrate international and universal labor standards,   such as the International Labor Organizations Declaration   on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We are  committed to ensuring that our businesses and global supply  chain partners adhere to the appropriate international labor  standards, including Conventions No. 87 and No. 98 on  freedom of association and collective bargaining. Our global Human Rights Statement and three-year human  rights strategy are based on the findings of a comprehensive  human rights risk and impact assessment. The strategy  defines the human rights issues that are most salient to our  bank and our stakeholders. We aim to fully integrate human  rights considerations into our lending activities and  operations. Our cross-functional, internal human rights  steering committee oversees our efforts and evaluates   our on-going progress.   In 2017, we finalized an enhanced Global Harassment Policy  to ensure that we had consistent global standards and  processes. In 2018, we will reinforce this to all employees,  bank-wide, through structured and mandatory training.  We began to plan to implement a human rights screening  program, to identify human rights gaps in high-risk countries  and in specific industry sectors when exploring investment in  financial products. We also began planning to conduct an  extensive gap analysis in high-risk markets to identify human  rights filters to be integrated into the due diligence process  through the customer engagement experience in the retail  banking environment.  In addition, we have worked on a pilot project to review the  Employee Workplace Accommodation policies and processes.  We will use our learnings from this pilot project to identify  and resolve gaps in the Workplace Accommodation policies  and processes in each country where we operate. In FY2018, we will also continue to further human rights  principles to human resources approaches affecting our  employees, such as equal pay, discrimination and hours   of work, and to concerns relating to our valued customers,   such as privacy. GOVERNANCE:  MAINTAINING TRUST  THREE-YEAR HUMAN RIGHTS STRATEGY  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY – REPORT 2017 1 6 GOVERNANCE INTRODUCTION CSR AT SCOTIABANK  APPENDIX ENVIRONMENT COMMUNITY CUSTOMERS EMPLOYEES Responsible Procurement As a financial institution, Scotiabanks supply chain focuses  on indirect goods and services by nature. We have more  than 15,000 suppliers worldwide, including both small and  medium enterprises and large corporations, and prioritize  working with suppliers who share our values and culture.  Our approach to raising our suppliers ethical performance  reflects our support of SDG 8. In particular, we require all   our suppliers to uphold our Vendor Code of Conduct, and   we consider social and environmental criteria as part of our  assessment of new suppliers. Our CSR and business teams  use a dedicated supplier management platform to manage  suppliers on an ongoing basis and monitor their performance. We continuously seek to optimize the way we identify and  act on human rights risks in our supply chain. In 2017, we  completed an in-depth review of human rights risks in our  supply chain, identifying high risk categories and markets.  We drew on the findings to strengthen our policies and  procedures surrounding tenders, on-boarding new suppliers  and purchasing. For example, we improved our risk  assessment process for new and existing suppliers, updated  our Vendor Code of Conduct and introduced a new Vendor  Relations Policy. We also developed an enhanced Purchasing  Policy, together with a practical manual to help our buyers  integrate ethical considerations into their purchasing decisions. Customer Experience  In the same way that we seek to uphold high standards in  our supply chain, so we have a longstanding, strategic focus  on optimizing our customers experience. We enable our  employees to support customers effectively, assess their  needs and develop effective financial strategies. We seek  regular feedback from customers and employees and monitor  sales teams to ensure compliance with our practices. We are  confident that our practices are sound and if we do not meet  customer expectations, we take action to make things right. In the event of a complaint, customers in Canada can first  contact their local branch or contact centre. If the issue is not  resolved to their satisfaction, including by the Management  Officer, they can escalate it to the Office of the President.  If the complaint remains unresolved, it can be escalated to  the Scotiabank Ombudsman. Internationally, the Bank follows  a similar process, although specifics may vary according to  country regulatory requirements or local needs.  Digital Transformation and The Pulse As we continue our digital transformation journey, we have  stepped up our efforts to simplify and digitalize customer  experience, by creating a custom Net Promoter System (NPS).  Now referred to as The Pulse, this is our global customer  experience system, designed to enable a systematic approach  to effectively listen to customers, leverage their feedback and  respond in real time. This precise view of how customers  experience our services will help us to build longstanding  customer relationships, enabling us to invest in the products,  services and tools that our customers require to succeed.  Through 2017, we implemented The Pulse across all our  branches, contact centres and digital channels in Canada,  Mexico, Peru, Chile and Colombia. We also initiated a pilot  program for Commercial Banking customers in Canada   and Peru. Since its launch, we have sent nearly 10,000,000  customer surveys globally, and received feedback from   over two million customers. As we engage all levels of the  organization to connect with customers further on the  feedback, we have made over 200,000 call backs to customers. With the prioritization of feedback, we are now making  improvements for customers and their experience. For  example, customers in Chile were unhappy with our digital  password expiry rules, leading to high call volumes in our  Contact Centre to unlock their accounts. To address this issue,  we improved and simplified the password process and  updated it to ensure sound security. Customers have  responded positively to the change and our Contact Centre  now receives fewer password-related calls.  In 2018, we will focus on expanding The Pulse for commercial  customers across Canada, Peru and into Mexico, Chile and  Colombia. For our retail customers we will continue our  expansion into the Caribbean market, primarily focusing   on Jamaica, Trinidad & Tobago and the Dominican Republic.   We will also roll it out across our additional Contact Centre  teams in our six markets and explore new, technology-driven  ways to gather customer feedback.  We also developed a proprietary system to gather feedback  from employees. The tool enables and empowers employees  to initiate change and improve the employee and customer  experience across the organization. GOVERNANCE:  MAINTAINING TRUST  We received feedback from over 2 million  customers through The Pulse.

We work to increase the ability of  individuals and enterprises to access essential  financial services. RELATED MATERIAL TOPICS   Promoting Financial Inclusion   Innovation and Digitization  Creation of Products with Social Benefits There are some two billion people of working age globally  who lack access to formal financial services, according to   the World Bank.2 By 2030, the UN aims to eradicate poverty  (SDG 1), including by ensuring that everyone has equal access  to basic financial services. By removing barriers and increasing  access to finance, we are actively helping to bridge this gap  and build a more inclusive global economy. Importantly, we  believe every customer has the right to become better off.  We create opportunities for everyone to succeed – from  families to individuals to businesses. Digital innovation plays  a fundamental role in this. We are transforming our products  and services to meet the diverse needs of the customers we  serve, harnessing mobile technology to help customers access  essential financial services like never before.  Promoting Financial Inclusion Aboriginal Banking Scotiabank is taking steps to positively impact Aboriginal  people, communities and businesses, by offering more  effective banking services, creating employment opportunities  and supporting sustainable development.  We have 27 Aboriginal Banking Centres across Canada,  including four on-reserve branches, offering all our banking  services. Commercial Banking also provides customized  on-reserve lending services – which support communities   in boosting their local economies – to Aboriginal economic  development organizations and band councils. All our centres  and branches are aligned to the Canadian Council for  Aboriginal Business (CCAB)s Progressive Aboriginal Relations  (PAR) review process.  We were also awarded the prestigious Gold Standing   from the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business for the  third time.

Scotiabank was one of only six  companies in Canada to have been awarded with the  distinction in 2017. Small Business Small businesses are the backbone of Canadas economy,  contributing, on average, 30% of GDP and employing some  11.6 million people,3 while Mexicos 4.7 million small  businesses contribute USD$1.6 million to the countrys GDP.4  We are committed to enabling small businesses to succeed  with faster, smarter financial services. For example, Scotiabanks  new digital lending platform is helping more small business  customers in Canada to save time and better manage their  finances by gaining access to financial services more rapidly. By digitizing the way we open accounts and approve loans,  we have become Canadas first major bank to enable small  businesses to open an account in as few as 15 minutes. Many  of our customers have taken advantage of our new digital  lending and account opening capabilities for small businesses,  gaining real-time access to the products and services they  need to run their day-to-day business. We plan to make small  businesses accounts available to more businesses in 2018   by engaging with all eligible customers. In 2017, we further expanded our support of independent  professionals, agricultural enterprises and franchises by  growing our network of specialists offering practical advice  and guidance. We also stepped up our support of start-ups  by collaborating with organizations including the   Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) and   Start Up Canada.  For example, in Trinidad & Tobago, 32 small business owners  graduated from our entrepreneur-focused Scotiabank Vision  Achiever Program in 2017, with the top graduate winning  $25,000 to invest in their business. Meanwhile, our new  TT$50million SME Capital Equipment Fund provides low-cost  loans to eligible businesses from diverse industries. Multi-Cultural Banking Moving to a new country can be challenging. Our StartRight  Program helps newcomers transition smoothly to Canada by  providing simplified fundamental financial services catering   to their needs. We help newcomers gain access to bank  accounts efficiently and offer a free chequing account for  students, as well as other reduced-cost services. We also  partner with non-profit organizations such as Colleges and  Institute Canada, CanPrep and the Toronto Region Immigrant  Employment Council to improve immigrants study and career  prospects in Canada. Our employees support this effort by  acting as mentors to people interested in moving to Canada,  both in person and through interactive webinars. In 2017, we enhanced our StartRight program by helping  newcomers gain credit more rapidly. Permanent residents  can now obtain a $3,000 minimum credit limit with no credit  history or income (up from $2,000). Foreign workers can also  apply for a credit card with a 10-month work permit (down  from 12 months).  Our Scotiabank Student GIC Program (SSGP) is now available  in India, China, Vietnam and the Philippines assisting students  in these countries with their study visa application process. CASE STUDY:   WORKING GLOBALLY We recognize the important role that access to financial  services plays in helping people become better off, and  we work to provide innovative solutions to unbanked,  under-banked and disadvantaged populations globally.  In 2016 our subsidiary Banco Colpatria in Colombia  eliminated fees related to its chequing and savings  accounts. This $0 fees strategy and accompanying  marketing campaign attracted a new customer  base and established a renewed trust in financial  institutions from the unbanked, who previously saw  the fees associated with keeping money at a bank  as a disincentive to opening an account. In 2017 this  program continued to grow, with a further increase   in account openings. 3  Source: Government of Canada, Key Small Business Statistics – June 2016   https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/061.nsf/eng/h_03018.html 4  Source: OECD Entrepreneurship at a Glance http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY – REPORT 2017 1 9 CUSTOMERS APPENDIX ENVIRONMENT COMMUNITY EMPLOYEES GOVERNANCE CSR AT SCOTIABANK  INTRODUCTION Microlending We seek to help people with little or no access to financial  services to fulfill their potential and improve their livelihoods,  by providing relevant, affordable solutions. In 2017, total  microlending (including consumer and microfinance for  businesses) saw a 8.9% growth rate year-over-year,  exceeding our goal.  We achieved this by undertaking an in-depth study of our  microfinance customers needs and improving our services  in line with our overall commitment to catalyze digital  transformation in everything we do. For example,   CrediScotia Peru has digitized its background checks,  enabling microfinance entrepreneurs to obtain loans within  just 30 minutes, compared to up to 48 hours previously.  Similarly, Progresar, a new product from our microfinance  division in Uruguay, Pronto!, allows customers to have their  loan approved in less than one minute. In the absence of  traditional credit bureaus, Progresar uses a scoring tool   to rate customers suitability for a loan, with all approval  decisions made automatically. To further expand access to  finance in Uruguay, we have launched self-service banking  kiosks equipped with biometric recognition.  CASE STUDY:   CREDISCOTIA NEW SERVICE   OFFERING IN PERU In Peru, CrediScotia has launched a new financial  assistance services offering, Beneficia, for its Visa  Unica credit card customers, designed to help families  with financial planning in areas such as medical  insurance, funeral services and legal assistance.  Additionally, 45,500 CrediScotia customers began  using Perus Billetera Movil (Mobile Wallet) mobile  banking service in October 2016, following a national  campaign to help underprivileged communities gain  access to mobile banking. A year later, Billetera Movil  is processing an average of 2,000 transactions per  month, and has grown to 87,190 customers. Total microlending (including consumer and microfinance  for businesses) saw an 8.9% growth rate year-over-year,  exceeding our goal of 7% increase.  We also believe in supporting women-owned businesses,   and in FY2017 this represented 50.4% of our microlending  total loans.  CUSTOMERS:   ACCESS TO FINANCE  50.4% of microlending goes to   women-owned businesses.

We educate our customers by  providing them with an understanding of  how they can plan for a better future and by  offering fairly designed products and services. RELATED MATERIAL TOPICS   Financial Education and Literacy  Fair Design and Sale of Responsible Products  and Services Financial Education and Literacy Inclusive, high quality education and lifelong learning,   as represented by SDG 4, are integral to the UNs global  vision for sustainable development, in which everyone has  equal opportunities to thrive and progress in life. Helping  people to manage their finances more effectively is an  essential component of this, as financial knowledge plays a  key role in informing peoples decisions and helping them  become better off.  We strive to promote and enhance financial literacy through  a range of education resources and initiatives for customers.  In November 2016 during Financial Literacy Month in Canada,  we ran a campaign on Twitter and Facebook. The best  advice ever received campaign highlighted the importance  of developing a financial plan and sharing practical tips and  strategies to help customers achieve their savings goals.   The Twitter chat as part of this campaign reached   36.7 million impressions.  We also supported our own employees by kick-starting   a series of financial education sessions. These informative  workshops on financial planning and retirement savings took  place alongside a Financial Fair where employees could learn  more about educational resources, tools and solutions from  various Scotiabank departments. To further support financial literacy, we enhanced our GIC  selector tool, which helps customers to identify the savings  product that best fits their needs. In particular, we lowered  the minimum GIC investment from CAD$500 to CAD$100,  allowing customers to gain access to a wider range of GIC  products. We also improved our TFSA and RSP calculators,  which help customers to determine the level of savings  they need to reach their financial goals. We simplified the  calculators, enhanced their usability and optimized them for  mobile use. More than 455,000 people are now using these  tools, up from 329,000 in 2016.

For  example, our Mapping TomorrowTM program is a financial  planning tool used by Scotiabank advisors to create  customized financial plans for customers, based on various   key life stages. In 2017, a new branch customer experience has started  rolling out across International Banking. These new branches  offer an environment that informs, educates and provides  hospitality level service through customer focused tips   and advice, educational videos as well as seminars offered   to our customers teaching them about various financial   literacy subjects. Scotia iTrade and Sustainable Investing Our Canadian direct investing platform, Scotia iTrade, offers  regular educational events and online training to support  Canadian customers with their investment goals. In 2017,  we delivered 109 webinars to more than 3,000 current   and prospective customers. Participants responded favorably   to the webinars, with an average of 91% rating them very   good or good. Through Scotia iTrade, we also offer  interactive learning modules on topics including investing  tools and techniques and wealth management. Increasingly,  we are focusing on sustainable investing, recognizing that   our customers are interested in how their savings can create  positive environmental and social impacts.  CUSTOMERS:   FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE  Promoting Financial Knowledge Globally Among the initiatives we undertook to promote financial  knowledge, we extended the financial literacy portal we  offer to small businesses in Mexico, to Chile, Peru, Costa Rica  and Colombia. Impulsa tu PyME (Boost your Business)  is designed to help small business owners with everything  from starting and growing a new business, to selling or  winding down a company. Entrepreneurs can access  informative articles, tools, videos and interactive guides  from their mobile phone. We also ran a social media campaign in Chile and Colombia,  highlighting ways in which customers could better manage  their finances. In Chile our total campaign impressions on  LinkedIn were more than 265,000. In Colombia on Facebook  we reached more than 456,000 users. Responsible Sale of Products and Services Ensuring we are selling products and services responsibly   is a critical part of being a customer focused organization.  In 2017, our Executive Vice-President of Canadian Banking,  James McPhedran, explained our policies and procedures to  the Canadian governments Standing Committee on Finance.  In particular, he highlighted that our Branch Advisors provide  customers with balanced advice based on their needs, and  we measure them using a balanced scorecard that aligns to  our customer focused strategy. He added that our digital  transformation is benefiting customers by simplifying their  banking experience, offering improved convenience. Digital  technology also allows us to be more customer focused and  to spend more time giving advice.  Feedback from 700,000 customers in Canada up to June  12, 2017 showed consistently high satisfaction levels,  particularly in relation to our front-line teams. Finally, he also  spoke about our culture and the importance of trust, referring  to our core purpose of supporting customers with achieving  their financial goals, and the values of integrity and respect  that guide our behaviour.  Increasingly we are focusing on sustainable  investing, recognizing that our customers   are interested in how their savings can create  positive environmental and social impacts.

We support programs that  invest in financial, physical and digital access to education.  Through our global partnership with Junior Achievement (JA),  a renowned youth education organization, more than 700  Scotiabank volunteers introduced JAs Road to Success  financial literacy program in their communities in Latin  America. The program reached more than 11,860 students  across 210 schools in 16 countries in 2017, with education,  innovation camps and regional competitions and aims   to reach 50,000 students over three years.  Through our partnership with JA in Canada, more than   100 Scotiabankers delivered the Dollars with Sense  program, which helps Grade 7-9 students gain access to   the tools they need to make effective financial decisions   and become debt-free, savvy investors, to more than   1,940 students in 2017. In 2017, we were awarded the Transforming Education Award  from JA Americas, for our role in helping them transform the  way they are educating their students. Our investment in  digital resources helped to ensure the students connected   the theory on what they learn in the classroom with real life. We reached 660,000 children and 6,000  teachers in Canada by sponsoring the   Talk With Our Kids About Money initiative. Talk With Our Kids About Money  We reached 660,000 children and 6,000 teachers in Canada  by sponsoring the Talk With Our Kids About Money  (TWOKAM) initiative. Developed by the Canadian Foundation  for Economic Education (CFEE), the program seeks to help  children become more knowledgeable about money so they  can make better, more informed financial decisions.  In addition to supporting ongoing educational programs for  children and parents, we sponsored the 2017 Talk With Our  Kids About Money Day, which saw money fairs, talks and  special events taking place in communities across the country.  For example, the province of Manitoba, the first to partner  with the TWOKAM program, held a major money fair with  interactive discussions for young people on money and  managing their finances.

RELATED MATERIAL TOPICS   Diversity and Equal Opportunity  Talent Attraction, Engagement and Development  Employee Health and Well-being  Fair Labor Practices Diversity and Equal Opportunity Diversity drives innovation and business success. Companies  with a good balance of men and women are 15% more likely  to outperform their competitors, and firms with employees  from a mix of ethnic backgrounds are 35% more likely.5  At Scotiabank, we know that our ability to build an inclusive  environment with diverse skills and expertise is critical to  meeting our customers needs, and attracting, developing  and retaining talent. We strive to create a workplace in   which our 88,000 employees are empowered and engaged,  providing them with multiple opportunities to grow.  In particular, through our Diversity & Inclusion strategy, we  support the UNs sustainable development vision for gender  equality, as represented by SDG 5, which seeks to end all  forms of discrimination against women and girls. It aims to  empower women to participate fully in leadership roles and  encourages policies and legislation that promote gender  equality and womens empowerment. We also prioritize  LGBT+ inclusion, as part of our push to encourage everyone  in our organization to be their authentic selves and reach  their full potential. Employee Resource Groups There are 11 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) globally.  These are employee-led initiatives that support under- represented groups in contributing to our business goals,  while promoting greater affinity and understanding.  In 2017, our ERGs continued to grow globally, particularly  within Latin America. For example, Scotiabank Pride, one   of our largest LGBT+ ERGs, expanded to include Colombia,  Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, Asia and the USA.

For the second year in a row, the Scotiabank Aboriginal  Network celebrated Canadian National Indigenous Day in  Toronto. This included drum and dance performances by   First Nations youth, to recognize and celebrate the unique  heritage, diverse cultures and outstanding contributions   of our First Nations, Inuit, and Mtis peoples. Elsewhere, our employees run approximately 30 womens  ERG chapters and the number is set to grow in 2018, with  more groups forming in Canada. Approximately 2,500  women and men are currently members of these groups. In 2017, Scotiabank refreshed the focus of our Inclusion  Council. It is now chaired by our President and CEO, and  includes members of senior management that can affect  change within their respective business lines. LGBT+ Inclusion In June 2017, we celebrated Pride month, one of our annual  Global Inclusion Months, raising awareness for LGBT+ inclusion  among our employees and customers globally. We raised  pride flags at various country headquarters, promoted  inclusion messages through advertisements at branches and  on ABM screens, and led social media and digital campaigns.  In addition, more than 600 Scotiabankers marched in 10 pride  parades globally, including in Mexico, Costa Rica and across  Canada. We also support a number of external organizations  globally, including the Costa Rican Chamber of Commerce  Association, and in Canada, Start Proud and Pride at Work.  Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment In 2017, we developed a new global strategy for gender  equality and womens empowerment, focusing on four areas:  encouraging commitment and accountability among our  leaders; advancing womens inclusion; attracting, developing  and retaining strong female talent; and promoting our  approach to womens empowerment among external  stakeholders. To help more women become senior leaders, we run  multiple, complementary initiatives to attract promising  candidates and help them succeed in leadership roles.   We also identify strong performers at the Senior Manager  and Director levels and support them in advancing their  careers through dedicated leadership programs. The proportion of women in our organization at VP level  or above reached a record high of 33% globally in October  2017, an 8% increase since November 2013 when Brian  Porter became our President and CEO. We saw the highest  level of women at VP level or above in Canada (39%).  In Latin America, the proportion reached 19% (up from 14%  in 2016). We recognize that we need to do more to empower  women in the Latin American countries where we work.  Including all countries we operate in outside of Canada,   the proportion of women at VP+ level was 20%.  We celebrated International Womens Day in 2017 by raising  awareness of unconscious bias, which arises when people  make quick judgments about others based on their own  perceptions and cultural references. Scotiabank Mexico  hosted two Engaging Men Executive Roundtables with  Catalyst in Mexico to help empower senior male leaders   to become gender equality champions. Many of our Latin American countries supported our  unconscious bias campaign by hosting events of their own.  Scotiabank Mexico launched a broader employee  engagement campaign on gender inclusion. In Colombia,  senior leaders conducted a workshop with labor organization  Aequales, to identify opportunities to promote gender  equality. Chile also ran an internal campaign on unconscious  bias to dispel common myths. In 2017, we held a one-day Commit to Action event to  support the UNs International Day of the Girl, inviting  Scotiabankers to commit to taking one action to promote  gender equality. In Colombia, Colpatria partnered with  non-profit organization PLAN International to organize a  CEO Takeover, whereby Colpatrias CEO gave up his seat   to a young woman for the day. The initiative was a way to  empower girls to believe their dreams are attainable. In 2017, Scotiabank became the Founding Supporting  Canadian Sponsor of the Boardlist, a talent marketplace for  the tech community. Boardlist discovers, recommends and  connects highly qualified female leaders with opportunities   to serve on private and public company boards.  EMPLOYEES:   DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION  We saw the highest level of women in  leadership (VP level or above) in Canada.   CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY – REPORT 2017 2 5 EMPLOYEES GOVERNANCE CSR AT SCOTIABANK  INTRODUCTION CUSTOMERS APPENDIX ENVIRONMENT COMMUNITY Talent Attraction, Engagement and Development Developing, promoting and recruiting the highest performing  candidates is critical to the future of the Bank. By strengthening  our talent pipeline and ensuring all employees have equal  access to advancement opportunities, we aim to build   a high performing team and be recognized as a leader   in business performance. Employer of Choice Scotiabank remains a top choice for people seeking financial  services roles. We continue to attract and retain employees  with the right combination of skills to deliver our business  goals. In 2017, we filled approximately 50% of our vacancies  with existing employees, providing nearly 12,000 employees  with an opportunity for promotion.  Externally, we engaged regularly with professional and  community organizations in order to attract talented  professionals to our company. In particular, to build our digital  expertise, we sought people with specialist skills in areas such  as data analytics, statistics, robotics, programming, engineering  and mathematics. We also hire more than 1,500 interns a   year in Canada through partnerships with top Canadian  universities, and made seven retail and operations hires  through HireUp, a non-profit organization that links homeless  young people in Canada with businesses. We look forward   to continuing these partnerships in 2018.  Employee Engagement In 2017, we achieved an employee engagement score of 79%  through our annual employee survey, ViewPoint. The score  measures our employees depth of commitment, sense of  pride and level of satisfaction, and exceeds the global  financial services industry 74% average.  Employee engagement score 2017 2016 2015 Scotiabank 79% 77% 84% Average EEI reported by IBM   for financial services globally 74% 74% 73% This score reflects our focus on supporting our employees  with a positive, inclusive work environment and listening   to their perspectives. While our decline in 2016 was not  unexpected given the degree of change happening in parts  of the organization, we are pleased to see an increase in 2017  that still exceeds the global financial services average. EMPLOYEES:   DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION  In 2017 amongst our participating employees, globally 90%  of employees agree that there is a strong customer focus.   Additionally, 88% of employees shared that they believe  Scotiabank is socially and environmentally responsible.  Employee Development Our people are our greatest asset. We continuously invest in  providing our employees with the learning and development  opportunities they need to grow and fulfill their potential,  preparing them to exceed our customers expectations.  In 2017 we invested CAD$69.9 million in employee training  and development globally. The average amount of hours  spent on training annually per employee is 33. As we make  efforts to digitize and make training more relevant and  efficient, the average of learning hours and total spend on  learning and development is expected to decrease over time.  Promoting Lifelong Learning and Growth Employees are supported in creating a Development Plan  shortly after they are hired, identifying the skills, knowledge  and competencies they need to succeed in their current   and future roles. The Development Plan is ongoing, and not  associated with any specific year. In 2017, we built on the  new digital learning, performance and development platform  we launched in 2016, and by strengthening our employee  performance review process integrating it with the  Development Plan process. In particular, managers work with  their employees to set performance goals and review long- term development needs at the same time. This allows us   to meet both short- and long-term business goals, while  supporting our employees development. In addition, in 2017  we put a strong emphasis on ongoing dialogue and regular  coaching to ensure that employees are supported in following  their plans and achieving their performance and development  goals. Coaching and regular feedback is an important part of  our performance culture. For the first time, we have automatically assigned four core  competencies (results-focus, customer focus, self-awareness  and personal development, and developing and coaching  talent) for all employees to be assessed by themselves and  their managers at year-end. These competencies are integral  to meeting our business goals, making progress on our digital  transformation journey and fostering a high performing,  customer-oriented and inclusive culture. Looking ahead,   88% of participating employees shared   that they believe Scotiabank is socially   and environmentally responsible.  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY – REPORT 2017 2 6 EMPLOYEES GOVERNANCE CSR AT SCOTIABANK  INTRODUCTION CUSTOMERS APPENDIX ENVIRONMENT COMMUNITY we have added Curiosity as a fifth competency for 2018.   This underscores the focus on continuous learning   and development and the need for outside-in thinking,   which were themes that emerged in 2017.  Empowering Future Leaders Developing future leaders is critical to the ongoing success  of our business. Scotiabank offers employees the opportunity  to select from thousands of learning activities, including  classroom learning, e-learning, virtual instructor-led courses,  social learning and community volunteer work. Through our  global management and leadership development program,  iLEAD, we strive to develop tomorrows leaders, providing  them with tailored support at every stage of their career  through multiple education resources. In 2017, more than  8,000 employees participated in iLEAD, attending more than  13,000 courses. Additionally, we actively identify and support  potential future leaders through our Leadership Resource  Planning (LRP) process, in order to ensure we have the right  people in place to take on key leadership roles.  Employee Health and Well-being We recognize that people perform better when they are in  good health and benefiting from a positive work-life balance.  We invite every employee to take responsibility for creating   a healthy, safe work environment. In 2017, we made hazard  prevention tools and guides available to all employees, and  made it easier for our teams to comply with health and safety  requirements by streamlining our administrative processes. Our global online platform, Your Wellbeing, provides   multiple programs and resources that support our employees   well-being, and allows employees to share ideas and best  practice with co-workers worldwide.  Among the additional health and well-being resources we  offer are: Topic Scotiabanks Offering Stress management  training Resources and tools on stress management to employees in Canada, and country-specific programs  that respect the culture and customs of each country Ergonomics in the  workplace We launched our global Ergonomics Portal in 2017 to share resources with employees on topics such  as setting up workstations correctly, stretching and good posture Fitness  Health & Wellness Centres focusing on physical, nutritional and spiritual wellness in some new  corporate locations Health and nutrition  For any employees with complex medical conditions, Scotiabank offers a Health Assistance Program,  and access to dedicated pharmacy programs Flexible working hours  Our Flexible Work Options policy aims to help employees in Canada to achieve a good work-life  balance. Internationally, we offer programs and policies that respect local cultures and customs Working from home  arrangements Some corporate locations offer an activity-based program, which provides employees with the  autonomy to select where they work, including from home Childcare facilities   or contributions Scotiabank provides membership to a national child care provider in Canada, which offers childcare  for newborns to children up to age 12  Paid maternity leave   in excess of legally   required minimum Employees on maternity leave in Canada are eligible to receive a supplementary top-up to their  employment insurance benefits for a six-week period  Looking ahead, we plan to increase our focus on employee  health and well-being, by refocusing our employee services  on two key pillars: mental and financial health. For mental  and emotional health we align with partners that focus on  preventative and early intervention solutions for employees  when support is needed the most. For financial health, we  continue to improve communication channels with employees  which includes in-person sessions for pension understanding,  and simple comprehensive fact sheets for topics such as   the importance of insurance coverage including selecting  disability coverage and understanding savings opportunities.

We proudly work  with community partners that enhance  the health and education of young people  in the community. RELATED MATERIAL TOPICS   Community Investment and Philanthropy  Supporting Health, Well-being and Education  Initiatives for Young People Scotiabank in the Community By 2030, the UN aims for people of all ages to enjoy healthy  lives and a sense of well-being (SDG 3), and for everyone   to have access to quality education and lifelong learning  opportunities (SDG 4). Business and finance stand to play   a key role in helping to achieve these goals. For example,  financial risk protection can help to safeguard people against  the financial hardship associated with paying for health  services, while health financing can significantly boost the  quality and availability of health services, particularly in  developing countries. Similarly, supporting programs that  promote free, equitable learning opportunities for girls and  boys and empowering young people to develop employability  and entrepreneurial skills contribute directly to quality  education for all.

We strive to make a positive difference in   the communities where we live and work, recognizing that  when communities are healthy and have access to education,  they boost their chances of employment, which in turn  strengthens both the community and the Bank. Young  people are our future leaders and it is critical to help them  develop the skills and resources they need to succeed.  Through our community investment strategy, we partner   with organizations promoting young peoples health,   well-being and education.  In 2017, we contributed CAD$80 million to communities  globally in donations, sponsorships and other forms of  assistance, directing over 60% of our funding towards   young people in the community. Within our spending   on youth, 65% was invested in Health and Well-being   and 35% in Education and Arts. Young People in the Community Index In 2017, we launched the Scotiabank Young People in the  Community (YPC) Index – a framework to measure and track  young peoples quality of life, accompanied by a new report  highlighting our findings. It focuses on health, well-being and  education as the foundational elements of success. We are  using the YPC Index, created in partnership with research  consultancy GlobeScan and a committee of global youth  experts, to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges  facing young people across 30 countries in the Americas   and the Caribbean where we are active.  Pinpointing where young people could benefit from health,  well-being or educational support enables us to identify  where progressive policies and social investments are needed.  It also allows us to compare the well-being and quality of   life of young people in the diverse countries where we work,  highlighting examples of best practice across a series of   19 indicators.  We are monitoring multiple health and education challenges,  such as youth pregnancy and school drop-out rates and  nutrition (which includes elements such as obesity and  under-nourishment), using data derived from credible, expert  sources. Looking ahead, we will partner with like-minded  organizations and governments to direct our efforts toward  the greatest challenges, as we strive to impact more young  people, faster. We also intend to grow the Index and number  of indicators that we cover as more data becomes available. Health and Well-being Live Healthy Nutrition and safety, combined with an active lifestyle, are   the foundations of healthy living. We invest in programs   that encourage young people to participate in sports and  become more active, including through our support of kids  community hockey across Canada and futbol (soccer) in   Latin America.  Through Scotiabanks support of community hockey, we have  reached an important milestone of helping one million kids  and counting have the chance to play Canadas favorite game.  We will amplify our efforts to help children benefit from the  power of sport through our new 20-year partnership with  Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment (MLSE). Part of this  agreement includes an expanded partnership with the MLSE  Foundation helping young people in the Greater Toronto  Area, changing lives through the power of sport.  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY – REPORT 2017 2 9 COMMUNITY APPENDIX ENVIRONMENT GOVERNANCE CSR AT SCOTIABANK  INTRODUCTION CUSTOMERS EMPLOYEES COMMUNITY:  INVESTING IN YOUNG PEOPLE  Stay Healthy We want to help young people remain healthy all their lives,  and invest in organizations that provide access to medical care  and healthcare support. In 2017, we donated CAD$1 million  to the Childrens Health Foundation and London Health  Sciences Foundation, in support of the Scotiabank Family  Assistance Program, which helps fund medical treatment   for women, children and their families experiencing financial  hardship during treatment in London, Ontario, Canada.  In November 2016, Scotiabank donated CAD$1 million   to Sinai Health Systems Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research  Institute, one of the top biomedical research institutes in  North America, to support discovery of the determinants   of health for infants and children. The gift will support   the research to better understand both the genetic and  environmental factors that shape the health of infants   and children from the time of conception. Education Access to Education Young people reach their infinite potential if they have proper  and equal access to education. We support programs that  invest in financial, physical and digital access to education.   For example, in Canada our partnerships with yconic (previously  Student Awards Inc.) fund financial awards for students,  including bursaries, scholarships and contest prizes. In 2017,   the Bank donated over CAD$2.3 million in scholarships globally. Knowledge and Skills Development Continuous learning is a fundamental part of strengthening  young peoples knowledge of technology and skills  development. In Peru, Scotiabank helped over 48,000  primary and secondary school students build their financial  and entrepreneurial skills through its support of Plan  Internationals Formando emprendedores del maaa  (Forming the entrepreneurs of tomorrow). This will prove  particularly useful in Peru, where young people experience  comparatively higher challenges in accessing the internet   and bank accounts, according to our 2017 YPC Index report. In 2017, the Bank awarded over   CAD$2.3 million in scholarships globally. In Latin America, the Scotiabank Futbol Club offers more   than 165,000 children and youth, the chance to play in  organized leagues and tournaments, make friends and learn  positive values. In 2017, we launched Futbol Championships  in El Salvador and Costa Rica, reaching 1,160 children. We  also reached more than 5,700 boys and girls through five  FutbolNet festivals in Mexico, Peru, Colombia, El Salvador   and Chile, held in partnership with the FC Barcelona  foundation. Over the next two and a half years, we aim   to reach over 18,000 boys and girls.  Additionally, we donated four soccer fields to underprivileged  children in Peru and Mexico through our new Campos de  Futbol program, and expanded our sponsorship of the  Mexican Futbol Federations Amateur Sector (FMFSA),  sponsoring the full season of the Amateur Womens League  (U13 to U20 age categories) for the first time.  In addition to our large hockey and futbol programs, in the  Caribbean we run a Kiddy Cricket Program through school  activities, summer camps and cricket festivals. In 2017,  we reached 127,600 children. In the Dominican Republic we run a Baseball Community  Program. Since its creation in 2014, this program has  benefited more than 3,000 children who have access to  training through baseball clinics, equipment and participate   in national and international tournaments.

The award recognized the Banks contribution  toward helping children develop financial and entrepreneurship  skills. In particular, 123 Emprender seeks to help children to  become economically aware and plan effectively for the  future. It also supports children in developing competencies  required for entrepreneurship, such as leadership, creativity,  team work, risk-taking and the ability to innovate. Overall, we engaged more than 50 academic institutions and  invested more than CAD$4 million in academic partnerships,  of which we directed CAD$1.4 million to digitally focused  partnerships across Canada. We also launched a technology  partnership with the University of British Columbia, donating  CAD$2 million toward research on cyber security and  financial risks. The Scotiabank Cybersecurity and Risk  Analytics Initiative will focus on understanding the impacts   of cyber attacks and strengthening the tools that companies  use to guard against them. In Canada, we supported efforts to empower women in  technology by partnering with non-profit Ladies Learning  Code to help more women and young people to improve  their digital and computing skills. In particular, we donated  CAD$150,000 to the organization on International Womens  Day in support of its Girl Learning Code program, which  engages girls on topics from HTML to CSS to 3D printing   and hardware hacking. Additionally, we continued our sponsorship of Enactus,  a community of student, academic and business leaders  committed to empowering young entrepreneurs to transform  lives and shape a better world. In particular, Enactus reaches  budding entrepreneurs through an experiential learning  platform. In 2017, we supported two Enactus challenges:  the Scotiabank Youth Empowerment Challenge and the  Scotiabank EcoLiving Green Challenge. These are national  competitions encouraging post-secondary students to  develop solutions to challenges facing young people and the  environment, and have reached more than 11,500 students  collectively since 2016. Employee Volunteering Globally, Scotiabank employees dedicated more than 403,500  hours of volunteering to worthy causes in their communities   in 2017. We encourage our employees to engage with   the community in two ways. We offer individual employees   who have volunteered for at least 50 hours a year with   a qualifying community organization to apply for funding   of up to CAD$1,000 for that organization. Additionally, we  encourage groups of employees to raise funds for charity,  matching up to CAD$5,000 in funds raised by teams of five   or more employees, and CAD$15,000 by teams of 30 or  more employees. Foundational Giving In 2017, many of the communities where we work  experienced devastating natural disasters. Scotiabank  donated funds to help our customers, employees and  communities in multiple locations. Scotiabank donated   over USD$500,000 to charitable organizations assisting   with rescue and relief efforts across the Caribbean,   in the wake of the devastation brought by   Hurricane Irma in September 2017.  In Canada, we donated CAD$15,000 to the Canadian   Red Cross in support of relief efforts in northeastern   New Brunswick in February 2017, following heavy ice storms.   We donated CAD$50,000 to the Canadian Red Cross to  support relief efforts in British Columbia, where wildfires  prompted a state of emergency and thousands of residents  were evacuated.

RELATED MATERIAL TOPICS   Environmental and Social Risk Management  in Lending  Creation of Products with Environmental Benefits At Scotiabank, we recognize that business has a key role to  play in creating a better, more prosperous future. As a bank,  we strive to make a positive difference by assessing social and  environmental risk in our lending practices and investing in  sustainable solutions.  Environmental Policy Our global Environmental Policy sets out the core principles  that inform the way we manage environmental issues on   a day-to-day basis. The Policy provides overall guidance   for our operations, lending practices, supplier agreements,  management of real estate holdings and external reporting  practices. Our Global Risk Management and CSR teams share  responsibility for the Policy and work closely with key partners  across the Bank to review internal processes, industry best  practices, regulatory developments and emerging trends.   The Policy is overseen by senior management, reviewed by  the Risk Committee and approved by the Board of Directors.  Our five environmental principles, part of our Environmental  Policy updated in 2016, define our approach to managing   our direct and indirect environmental impacts: 1. Comply with applicable environmental laws and  regulations and voluntary standards and initiatives   adopted by the Bank. 2. Contribute to operational efficiency that is consistent   with reducing environmental impacts and promoting  responsible actions. 3. Incorporate environmental risk assessment and mitigation  criteria into risk management procedures. 4. Contribute to ongoing dialogue with relevant stakeholders,  such as customers, employees, government, non- governmental organizations and industry associations. 5. Measure and report publicly on the Banks environmental  performance on at least an annual basis. More information on our approach to environmental risk   can be found in our 2017 Annual Report.

We have robust policies and  procedures in place designed to uphold this. Addressing Risks We assess environmental risks (including climate change)   and opportunities in the companies to which we lend by  incorporating environmental risk factors into lending  decisions. We explore both the risks associated with  borrowers business operations and the potential impact   of climate change on the clients business.  Our banking and credit teams follow our Credit  Administration Handbook for a comprehensive approach   and best practice in identifying and assessing potential  environmental and climate change risks.  Importantly, Scotiabank requires banking and credit teams   to assess transactions to determine if the deal triggers the  application of the Equator Principles (EP), which we adopted  in 2006. The EP provides companies with an environmental  and social risk management framework to help understand  the potential impact of major projects on people,  communities and the environment. The EP can apply to  project finance loans and advisory assignments where total  capital costs exceed USD$10 million, as well as to certain  project-related corporate loans. Three projects met the   EP transactions requirements in 2017.  Throughout the year, our Environmental and Social Risk team  collaborated with credit and lending teams across our  business, including Corporate, Commercial, International,  Small Business and Wealth Management, helping them to  assess environmental and social risks for transactions in  diverse sectors. In 2016 the Bank launched our enhanced  Environmental Risk e-learning course and in 2017 an  additional 1,700 non-retail banking and credit officer  employees took part, bringing the total to more than   4,700 since it was launched.  ENVIRONMENT:  RESPONSIBLE FINANCE  Sustainable Investing Tools Creating sustainable investing tools is an important focus  for Scotiabank, as our customers interest in social and  environmental issues continues to rise. In March 2017, our  online trading platform in Canada, Scotia iTrade, launched  North Americas first sustainable investing tool for direct  investors, in partnership with ESG research firm Sustainalytics.  The tool provides customers with relevant, up-to-date  information about companies corporate social responsibility  credentials and practices, helping to inform their investment  decisions. Previously, customers in Canada with an interest  in socially responsible investing would typically purchase a  managed fund – such as a mutual fund or exchange traded  fund (ETF). Now, they can use our investing tool to assess  how companies perform on the issues they care about  the most.  To help encourage uptake of the new tool, we offered online  introductory videos and webinars on sustainable investing  together with a practical how to guide for customers  wishing to use the tool. Since introducing the tool, we have  seen an increase in account openings in the first quarter after  launch compared to the same period in 2016.  More broadly, we have added social and environmental  criteria to Scotia iTrade as a whole, making it easy for our  customers to consider sustainability in their everyday  investing, including those who might not have considered  these issues previously.  Sustainable Living Beyond investing, the Scotiabank EcoLiving Auto Loan  program in Canada provides discounted financing for   the purchase of hybrid, clean diesel or electric vehicles.   We saw bookings increase by 160% in 2017 compared to  2016, suggesting that consumers in Canada are becoming  increasingly conscious of climate and environmental issues.  We have observed a similar trend in Mexico. In 2016,  Mexican authorities put in place restrictions for vehicles  to stay off the road on some days to address air-quality  concerns. To respond to this need, Scotiabank Mexico  launched CrediAuto, offering customers a credit plan  to purchase an electric or hybrid vehicle. Lending under  CrediAuto continues to increase year-on-year. Three projects met the Equator Principles  transaction requirements in 2017.

By setting emission reduction targets and  taking action to meet them, we seek to  reduce our impact on climate change. RELATED MATERIAL TOPICS   Carbon Footprint Carbon Footprint Climate change poses a significant risk to the global economy  and to society as a whole. As a major financial institution,   we have both the responsibility and the opportunity to take  action. In particular, we support the UN-led push to prevent  further climate change and address its impacts (SDG 13). This  global movement seeks to strengthen communities resilience  in the face of climate-related hazards and natural disasters,  integrate climate change measures into all countries national  agendas. It also aims to improve climate education and  enable people to better plan for and manage the effects of  climate change. We are taking action to reduce our carbon  footprint and prevent climate change by lowering our energy  use and improving energy efficiency in our operations.  In 2018, we plan to develop a global climate change strategy  to bring a harmonized, consistent approach to the way we  manage and act on climate risks and opportunities.  Strengthening the way we address our environmental  footprint will help accelerate our progress on mitigating  climate change, respond to our stakeholders expectations,  save costs and generate new business opportunities for us  and our customers. Disclosing our Carbon Emissions to Investors In February 2018 we announced our support of the Financial  Stability Board (FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD). We are a signatory to and participant in, the non-profit  organization CDP, which provides detailed information to  investors on the GHG emissions and climate change risks  associated with major companies. In 2017, our CDP score  was C, in line with the financial services industry average. Certified Green Buildings We strive to research and implement energy and  environmental best practice in all the countries where we  work, and follow all local building regulations. In Canada,  we actively seek to achieve Green Building Initiatives  Green Globes program certification for all new branches.  Green Globes is a widely recognized sustainable building  certification tool that scores the efficiency of buildings  across multiple energy and environmental criteria. Our  global headquarters in Toronto, Scotia Plaza, is LEED  Platinum certified – the US Green Building Councils highest  environmental certification for office buildings. Our London,  United Kingdom, office building has achieved BREs BREEAM  very good certification for its efforts to minimize  environmental impacts, improve energy efficiency and  conserve natural resources.

After reaching our GHG emissions reduction target early in  2016, we set a new, global GHG emissions reduction target  in 2017, taking our global operations into account. Our new  target is 10% absolute reduction of global Scope 1 and 2  emissions by 2021, compared to 2016. We have developed   a number of current and upcoming initiatives to help us reach  this goal, from HVAC replacements for international premises  and LED lighting in new branches, to solar panel installation  in some Central America and Caribbean branches.  Introducing an internal price on carbon has also helped to  create a pool of capital expenditure to fund these initiatives. Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition In July 2016, Scotiabank joined the Carbon Price Leadership  Coalition (CPLC), a World Bank initiative focused on  promoting carbon pricing among corporate organizations  and developing carbon pricing policies through public-private  sector dialogue. To demonstrate our commitment, in 2017  we established a cross-functional team to develop an internal  carbon price and strategy. We will implement our internal  carbon price of CAD$15/tonne in 2018. In this way, we will  advance our emissions reduction efforts by generating a pool  of funding for the Banks carbon reduction and energy  efficiency projects. Greenhouse Gas Emissions In 2015, we set a goal of reducing our Canadian Scope 1  and Scope 2 emissions by 15% (in absolute terms) by   2017, compared to 2012. We exceeded this target a year   early in 2016, achieving a 28.68% reduction in our   Canadian emissions. In 2017 our emissions overall continued  to decrease. This year we saw a decrease of 7.74% across   our global operations.  Examples of how we have reduced our energy consumption  and GHG emissions in 2017 include:  Energy efficient lighting retrofits which decreased our   GHG emissions by 1,385 tCO2e in Canadian branches and  412 tCO2e in Perus offices  We are building our new branches with a smaller footprint  – 1.5M s.f. to 4M s.f. compared to 5M s.f. to 6.5M s.f. to  better serve customer needs and achieve efficiencies  including reducing our environmental impact  We have begun replacing existing HVAC equipment with  more efficient units in Canada and will continue this effort  over the next four years   We perform annual energy reviews for 20% of our  Canadian branch portfolio to reduce our energy use by  identifying and repairing maintenance items to reduce  energy consumption   In 2017 we established a cross-functional team  to develop an internal carbon price and strategy.  We will implement our internal carbon price of  CAD$15/tonne in 2018.  Assessing and managing climate-related risks  and opportunities are critical to our long-term  operations and business success. We are proud  to be part of a global movement moving  towards a low-carbon economy and we  support the voluntary recommendations   on climate disclosure, as set out by the TCFD. Brian Porter, President and CEO of Scotiabank  CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY – REPORT 2017 3 6 ENVIRONMENT APPENDIX GOVERNANCE CSR AT SCOTIABANK  INTRODUCTION CUSTOMERS EMPLOYEES COMMUNITY Reducing our Environmental Footprint Increasingly, we are taking steps to protect the environment  and improve the efficiency of our business, and engaging   our employees and customers in this effort. For example,   in 2017, Colpatria supported a bike to work initiative for  our Colombia employees in response to growing traffic  congestion and air pollution in Bogota, providing 160 secure  bike parking facilities and resulting in commute times being  halved for employees who switched to cycling to work. More  than 125 employees took advantage of this scheme in 2017. In Canada, we installed electric vehicle charging stations in   30 branches across Ontario. To celebrate this, we ran an   Earth Day event for Toronto employees to showcase electric  vehicles, in partnership with GM and Tesla. The event  encouraged employees to consider buying an electric vehicle  by showcasing drive ranges, charging time and Government  cost incentives, helping to dispel common myths around  electric vehicles.  Water Consumption We measure water consumption at selected branch locations  through water metering. We also record water consumption  at the major office buildings we own and are working with  property managers to obtain accurate water consumption  data for large buildings where we lease office space. Waste Reduction: Paper We are undertaking multiple paper reduction efforts across  our global facilities.  Scotiabank delivered more than 73 million documents to  customers electronically in 2017 through the Canadian  Banking Paperless Program, saving more than 223 million  pages of paper. We also incentivized customers in   Latin America to choose online statements over physical  credit card and deposit account statements.  Paperless policies internally were also developed, resulting in  a significant decrease in paper consumption. For example,  through targeted employee communications campaigns  promoting the use of digital technology over printing, our  International Operations and Shared Services team cut paper  consumption by 70%, compared to the previous year.  Additionally, as part of a strategy to improve workplaces,   the Real Estate team piloted a paper reduction strategy which  cut its paper use by 53% year-on-year. This pilot is set to   roll-out to other groups across the Bank. In Chile, Scotiabank   cut paper use by 4% compared to 2016, largely though a  Paperless pilot project. Opting for digital alternatives there  saved more than 9,200 sheets of paper in its first month.

CAU entries are then subject to monthly audits  by Real Estate and an energy consulting firm. These  figures are then subject to a final audit by an  independent third party for verification. The audited  and verified consumption figures are then used by   both third party suppliers and Real Estate in comparing  technical specifications for facilities projects and  weighted average consumption estimates based on  actual portfolio consumption to determine energy  savings associated with any given initiative. These  figures are then converted into gigajoules and  megawatt hours using known and accepted  conversion ratios.

The Code includes an  explicit expectation that employees comply with the Code and  all applicable Scotiabank policies; the Anti-Corruption Policy is  one of such policies, and it is specifically identified in the Code.  The Anti-Corruption Policy is an enterprise-wide policy that is  reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption course is a learning   tool designed to provide training and guidance to employees  on Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption. It includes detailed  guidance, scenarios and a test. The course is assigned to  employees through the me@scotiabank learning platform,  the International Learning Centre, or local learning platforms.  The Board of Directors reviews and approves the   Anti-Corruption Policy.  The total number and percentage of employees that received  training on Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption are broken  down by employee category and region. A total of 16,720  employees completed the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption  course in FY2017. 15,467 of those employees were still active  on November 1, 2017.

For 2017, the table represents the full Canadian portfolio and  a sample of the International portfolio. For 2015-2016, the  table represents a sample of the Canadian portfolio   and a sample of the international portfolio. When necessary,  some buildings were estimated using consumption data  found in similar regions and building types. Our 2017 Canadian report is based on 955 owned and leased  retail locations and the space occupied by the Bank in 147  office buildings across Canada, representing approximately  1,079,152 square meters. Our 2017 International report is based on 543 owned and  leased retail locations and the space occupied by the Bank   in 125 office buildings in Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia,   El Salvador, Mexico and Peru, representing approximately  486,490 square meters.  M3 = cubic meter Measuring Energy Consumption The gases used in calculation include CO2, CH4, N2O.  The Bank uses a 2012 Base Year for its 15% emissions  reductions target on Scope 1 and 2 Canadian Absolute  emissions to be achieved by the end of FY2017. As 2012 was  the first time emissions for the entire Canadian portfolio were  disclosed, this year was chosen as a base year as it provides   a common denominator from a premises perspective (plus   or minus any organic growth/contraction) in comparing all  subsequent years emissions. In FY2015, the base year along  with 2013 and 2014 emissions were restated to account for  the amendment to the GHG Protocol concerning operational  boundaries of what qualifies as Scope 1 emissions. Heat that  is not metered was moved into Scope 2. Fuel purchases for  owned premises in Scope 1 were restated to 100%  consumption indicating full control.  Quantification of data is calculated in accordance with GHG  Protocol: A corporate accounting and reporting standard  (2006) and GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance: an amendment  to the GHG protocol corporate standard (2015).  Data is verified using the ISO 14064-3 standard, and   is consolidated using operational control. *  Calculated in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol of the World   Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development  (www.ghgprotocol.org), including emission factors for electricity purchases,   natural gas and fuel. **  The completeness and accuracy of our total GHG emissions has been verified by   an independent third party. Proxy data amounting to 7% of our Scope 2 emissions  was not subject to verification.

This includes preparing and  submitting the annual report to Employment and Social  Development Canada (ESDC) of all reportable Hazardous  Occurrences bank-wide.  ESDCs Hazardous Occurrence Report is completed by the  individual unit manager/delegate and/or Health and Safety  representative and then sent to WAHS. The HOIR is   reviewed, investigated and reported as per policy and   federal requirements.   WAHS determines whether the Hazardous Occurrence  constitutes a workplace injury. It must be established that   the occurrence and resulting injury occurred due to and   in the course of the employment relationship. If this is the  case, a copy of the revised report is forwarded back to   the department by WAHS. Workplace Accidents Law: Accident includes  A willful and intentional act, not being the act of the worker   A chance event occasioned by a physical or natural cause,  and   A disablement arising out of and in the course   of employment. Chance event:  A chance event is defined as an identifiable unintended  event which causes an injury. An injury itself is not   a chance event. Disablement:  The definition of disablement includes:  A condition that emerges gradually over time   An unexpected result of working duties. The following table represents coding information related   to the HOIR. Type Name Definition Person Major  Disabling injury: one that prevents an employee from reporting for work or from effectively performing   all the duties connected with the employees regular work on any day subsequent to the day on which the  injury or disease occurred, whether or not that subsequent day is a working day for that employee,   or results in the either temporary or permanent loss of body member or function.  All lost time (absence on the next scheduled working day or subsequent to the day on which the injury   or disease occurred) occurrences except for illnesses.  Major incidents must be faxed within 14 days to ESDC except in some cases thus 24 hours   e.g., a fatality; a disabling injury to two or more employees; the loss by an employee of a body member or  part thereof or in the complete loss of usefulness of a body member; the permanent impairment of a body  function of an employee; an explosion; damage to a boiler or pressure vessel that results in fire or the  rupture of the boiler or pressure vessel; any damage to an elevating device that renders it unserviceable   or   a free fall of an elevating device.  Robbery related incidents are considered major with above noted definitions applicable. Noted difference   is these incidents have robbery related time missed.  All robberies must be faxed regardless of absence only in the province of British Columbia.  Intermittent Day email should be sent to supervisor for absences (first day of absence is the day following  the accident). The first three days should be coded as special leave with pay.
