It voluntarily complies with Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI) and International Integrated Reporting Council  (IIRC) guidelines, globally approved and recognized standards,  covering the period from January 1 to December 31, 2017. In this edition, we have adopted the new version Standards,  in line with GRI Rules: Essential Option. Our aim is to tell a story of transformation and openness, on  a digital journey that goes far beyond the companys walls.  Accordingly, this year, we have incorporated our stakeholders  more deeply into the report. This is to recognize that you too  are ever more important players in this story. We are pleased to say that 2017 was a key year for TOTVS.  We advanced along our digital journey, supported by three  pillars: people, clients and technology. Learn about the steps  of this evolution and discover how we are opening ourselves  up to be together with you. In Chapter 10, we give a brief explanation of what an integrated  report is, to help you understand the structure of this narrative.  In Chapter 11, we present the GRI Index, a way of easily find- ing indicators and topics that are strategic to the company in  the text.

We want to con- stantly improve. WELCOME  TO OUR  INTEGRATED  REPORT 2017 GRI 102-1  4 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 Value creation for investors, ethics in business and appreciation  of human capital were principles embodied by TOTVS over  the course of 2017, in a context of slow, gradual economic  recovery in Brazil. In this context, TOTVS solutions helped  companies of all sizes to raise their levels of productivity to  get through this year. We sought to meet our clients needs,  in line with our strategic vision. We invested continuously in  innovation, and improved our governance. In particular, last year we created our Governance and Nomi- nation Committee, in order to improve the companys corpo- rate governance, evaluate the adoption of best practices, and  select and appoint board members and executive officers,  among other things. 4 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 These are some of the aspects we have presented in this  Integrated Report, while demonstrating our process of gen- erating value in an interconnected, simple and effective way  for our different stakeholders. We sought to listen to these stakeholders when producing this  report during the materiality process, which was enhanced  through the use of interviews, consultations with specialists  and an online survey, as well as sector studies and analyses.  We believe in the potential of publications like this to improve  management, and to allow companies and their customers and  investors to visualize strategies and expand transparency and  relationships of trust. We hope you enjoy this report!   Board of Directors, TOTVS  The recent renewal of our Board of Directors also warrants  highlighting. We elected new members based on their strong  technical profile, contributing to our constant evolution. Also in 2017, we made progress in terms of our internal organi- zation, by revising, creating and publishing various policies  to aid the development of our business in a responsible and  sustainable way. All these policies are available on our investor  Relations website (www.ri.com.br). We also revised our stra- tegic risk map, as part of a profound process that involved  the companys main leaders. At the same time, the Board of  Directors continued to support the management of its digital  transformation journey. GRI 102-10, 102-14 MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD   5 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 MESSAGE FROM THE  PRESIDENT GRI 102-14 2017 was the year in which we reached the halfway point in  our digital journey. It also marked the acceleration of TOTVS  transformation, as part of a movement that began at our  company and in the digital world, but has also expanded  beyond our own boundaries and technology, involving a new  way to see the world. We are turning into a company with a more open business  vision, offering the world and society shared knowledge and  experiences. And we are not alone. our clients, employees, investors, partners and suppliers are  also protagonists on this path. it is a trajectory replete with  lessons learned and challenges overcome. Last year was marked by modest economic growth in Brazil,  but ToTVs obtained solid results, such as total revenue growth  of 2.0. This performance is also linked to deep transformations in  our business model. The adoption of a subscription model,  among other measures, is based on our belief in the trans- formative power of technology and its potential to contribute  to the evolution of society. The technological revolution under  way is resulting from peoples desire to share information in  a collaborative and connected way. This new culture means that people can consume products  and services anytime, anywhere, and this is leading companies  to focus on deciding which technologies to use to deliver their  products and services. All this is part of our intense and dynamic  ongoing journey. As you will be able to see in this report, we had some impor- tant achievements in 2017, through our work in our People,  5 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 Clients and Technology pillars. One of these pillars is Culture and Environment. Here, the  #WEARETOTVERS campaign was the starting point to spread  our fundamental attributes and promote TOTVERS leader- ship on this journey. In the Supply and Portfolio pillar, we launched Carol, our quality  data and artificial intelligence platform, with the mission of  expanding our clients capacity for analysis and to speed up  their decision making. In the Processes and Customer Service  pillar, we implemented more agile methodologies and new  management methods, in which we revisited all our develop- ment processes. In the social field, we continued with our activities, as found- ers and funders of the Social Opportunity Institute (IOS),  which last year hit new records for services and employability  rates. Being socially responsible is one of our companys values, and  this is reflected in our participation in and commitment to  the United Nations Global Compact and the Ethos Institutes  Business Integrity and Anti-Corruption Pact. In the new cycle in which we find ourselves, we have some  important choices to make. Citizens, companies, government,  the private sector, academia and society all want to find the  best, fairest and most effective paths to grow. On this journey, TOTVS continues to have the purpose of  simplifying the business world. For everyone.    6 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7   TOTVS    All good stories need to  present the scene where they  begin and where the action  takes place. Our journey  starts with TOTVS. Here,  we use letters and numbers  to describe what we do and  how we do it, and we make  clear our voices and the  principles of governance and  transparency that govern  our relations with other  protagonists in this narrative. 6 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7  7 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 When we talk about totVS, we are talking about a company  of Brazilian origin, with international operations, which provides  technology solutions for the market. At first, it focused on small  and medium enterprises, but it now offers solutions to clients  of all sizes. Our main advantages include the development of applied tech- nology based on platforms and the generation of segmented  solutions, integrated into a distribution model underpinned by  franchises, in Brazil and abroad. This allows us to have a broad  presence, to be close to our clients, and to offer them agile,  effective services. In practice, we work like a software house, capable of operating  in three dimensions (solutions, platforms and tools), adding  ever more professionals and companies around us, in an open  ecosystem that can track and integrate evolving demands and  anticipate future trends. Few software houses operate with this triple perspective. And  TOTVS is now adding a fourth dimension: distribution of soft- ware components developed by the company, its franchisees  and its partners, through the TOTVS Store. In this way, we will take another step in our opening up to the  market and society, and we will make a large share of our tech- nology available to the innovation community. This opening- up movement includes promoting social and cultural diversity  and having a presence in different business environments. To make companies more competitive through intelligent  solutions and simplify the business environment, TOTVS is  present in all Brazils business centers and leading centers  elsewhere in Latin America and other continents.

Below you can see a complete list of organizational policies  disclosed by the company, which guide its activities. All these  documents underwent a rigorous process of development,  discussion, recommendation and approval, overseen by the  Board of Directors: /// Policy on Producing and Publishing     Regulatory Documents /// Corporate Compliance Policy /// Credit and Billing Policy /// Disclosure Policy /// Risk Management and Internal Controls Policy /// Litigation Management Policy /// Negotiation Policy /// Policy on Commercial and Institutional    Relations with Public Organizations /// Information Security Policy /// Policy on Transactions with Related Parties /// Internal Rules of Board of Directors    and Advisory Committees TOTVS is a company made up of people who are committed  to ethics and client experience.  These elements are sustained by our Compliance and Risk  Management Program and corporate governance structure,  to guarantee the dissemination of our values throughout our  production chain. the governance structure, together with the Code of Ethics  and Conduct and corporate policies (especially Compliance  Policy), are the guardians of our principles. They establish  business and conduct guidelines that must be reflected on and  followed in the companys everyday routines. As an element of the governance and compliance structure,  compliance has the goal of analyzing the regulatory environ- ment and internal rules, considering the companys processes  and activities, and presenting recommendations aimed at  ensuring that applicable requirements are met, based on proper  risk measurement. In this context, this structure works in  conjunction with other areas of the company in establishing  and monitoring necessary action plans for appropriate risk  control and mitigation. We seek constant evolution in the  following areas: formalization, documentation, monitoring and  reporting of risks; governance in the approval of documents  (100% of organizational policies are approved by the Board  ToTVs GRI 102-16, 102-17  17 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 GRI 102-25, 205-1  We wish to highlight the Policy on Commercial and Institu- tional Relations with Public Organizations (Anti-Corruption  Policy), published in July 2017. It applies to the TOTVS group,  as well as contractors and suppliers. This policy establishes conduct guidelines for TOTVS relation- ships with public sector organizations, through any representa- tive or agent, considering its values and principles set forth in  the Code of Ethics and Conduct. The policy also reinforces  TOTVS commitment to comply with Brazils Anti-Corruption  Law (Law 12,846 of 2013), the United Nations Global Compact  and the Ethos Institutes Business Integrity and Anti-Corruption  Pact. In order to prevent and administer situations involving potential  conflicts of interest, in 2017 we published our Policy on Trans- actions with Related Parties, which provides for monitoring  of records involving related parties and the management and  control of such information. In addition, every year we conduct  a census involving all members of the Board of Directors and  key senior managers, in order to verify their participation as board  members, employees and shareholders at other companies. To internalize compliance with these documents as part of our  corporate culture, we carry out continuous communication and  training work with TOTVERS. As part of this agenda, last year we held several events open to  clients, partners and the general public, including the following: /// Second edition of panel discussion to discuss anti-corruption  measures during the companys Social and Environmental  Responsibility Week, involving the directors of Instituto  No Aceito Corrupo (the I Do Not Accept Corruption  Institute); /// Webinar open to market players on December 9, Inter- national Anti-Corruption Day, to discuss measures to fight  corruption in the corporate world, confirming TOTVS po- sition and engagement in this area. TOTVS also works collaboratively with anti-corruption orga- nizations on the following initiatives: /// Ethos Institutes Anti-Corruption Working Group – For  example, we hosted the launch event of the Integrity App  in So Paulo, organized by non-governmental organization  ToTVs Alliance for Integrity, its Global Steering Committee, and  Transparency International; /// Participation in and support for Ethos 360 Conference; /// United Nations Global Compact Working Groups – For  example, we have signed up for the 10 Universal Principles  derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the  International Labor Organizations Declaration on Funda- mental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration  on Environment and Development, and the United Nations  Convention Against Corruption; /// Transparency International – Participation in the production  of a package of new anti-corruption measures.  18 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7     0800 721 5966 in Brazil  55 11 3232 0766 in other locations  Monday to Friday, 9 am to 5 pm  www.totvs.com/eticatotvs Click here to see our code in full. Commitment to integrity is based on TOTVS values, which drive  us to seek best practices regarding ethics and transparency,  and to adhere to legal and sector requirements. In this context, the companys integrity program and compliance  system are evaluated annually through an independent external  audit. The evaluation report contains a rigorous analysis of the  compliance and anti-corruption programs eight pillars and  involves assessments through substantive testing, as well as  interviews and document analysis covering the compliance risk  control environment. Evaluation results and action plans are reported to the Audit  Committee,* which in turn reports its findings to the Board of  Directors. The end product is a roadmap to track the implementation of  defined actions, resulting in a cycle of evolution and maturing  in the theme, and providing an environment of greater security  and refinement in terms of anti-corruption measures. * The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring allegations submitted    through the companys reporting channel, striving for enforcement of TOTVS    Code of Ethics and Conduct, warning the Board of Directors of fraud    and other crimes, and suggesting responses. the Code of Ethics and Conduct, recently revised and ap- proved by the Board of Directors, orients behavioral standards  aligned with our values and business strategy. The document  is a practical guide and it must be used in TOTVERS everyday  interactions and decisions based on the companys values and  culture. Considering the Code of Ethics and Conducts guidelines,  TOTVS maintains a reporting channel open to internal and  external stakeholders to report misconduct. In 2017, the  channel received 127 allegations, which were duly analyzed  and responded to, compared with 71 cases reported the  previous year. This suggests that the channel has been widely  divulged by the company and used by its stakeholders. The following actions have resulted from investigations of  these allegations: dismissal with cause of professionals proven  to have engaged in serious unethical behavior; warnings and  suspension of professionals proven to have engaged in low  and medium-level unethical behavior; e-learning regarding the  Code of Ethics and Conduct; improvements to the monitoring  process of complementary customer service channels; and  enhancements of internal policies, rules and procedures. TOTVS also has an Ethics and Conduct Commission, which is  aimed at fostering and promoting integrity and compliance with  the values and standards of behavior contained in its Code  of Ethics and Conduct. This commission is responsible for  handling allegations, using a formal process to check alleged  violations of the code, and referring cases to the appropriate  bodies, together with an assessment of each occurrence for  the purpose of taking appropriate disciplinary action. The Ethics and Conduct Commission meets monthly to analyze  investigations into allegations and action plans, when applicable.  The Compliance area enjoys functional independence and it can  gain access to meetings, numbers involved in investigations and  negotiations regarding consequence management as part of the  process of dealing with allegations, in order to make adjustments  to rules and continuously improve the Compliance Program. the Ethics and Conduct Channel, available to TOTVERS and  other stakeholders, can be accessed at: CODE OF ETHICS AND CONDUCT –   GRI 102-16, 102-17, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3  A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO VALUES AND CULTURE   ToTVs  19 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 TRAINING ON CODE OF ETHICS   AND CONDUCT AND ANTI-CORRUPTION   MEASURES GRI 205-1 BUSINESSES SHOULD WORK AGAINST   CORRUPTION IN ALL ITS FORMS, INCLUDING   EXTORTION AND BRIBERY.         The Code of Ethics and Conducts content is now presented  on an e-learning platform, and communications reinforce the  requirement for all TOTVERS to do this training. The training is done annually, and in 2017, 4,552 people success- fully completed it. For those who do not have internet access,  the training takes place in person. In 2018, we will launch a thematic gamification platform to  train 100% of TOTVERS on the new Code of Ethics and Conduct,  which was approved recently. The new edition of training will  promote greater engagement, as the learning process is more  fun and interactive, involving simulations of real situations. With regard to specific training on anti-corruption measures, 124  people, including 100% of our franchisees CEOs, professionals  in strategic posts and those in areas of the company that are  most exposed to risks, did in-person training with a specialized  professional last year. At the end of the training, the participants  signed an agreement stating that they were familiar with the  Code of Ethics and Conduct and Policy on Commercial and Insti- tutional Relations with Public Organizations (Anti-Corruption  Policy). Training materials related to commercial partners were  deployed in each business unit.

To this end, it uses best practices and international  benchmarks to implement practices that make sense in TOTVS  business environment and culture. The strategic risk management process periodically reports its  analyses to the Board of Directors, to ensure impartiality and  impact assessments in guiding business decisions and monitoring  strategic initiatives. These evaluations are conducted every six  months for risks considered very high and high, and annually for  risks considered medium and low. Management of these risks is executed through the synergistic  action of the companys different governance structures. BOARD OF DIRECTORS Sets strategic objectives to orient the work of identifying risks,  besides tracking management actions in line with the companys  business guidance. PROCESSES, INTERNAL CONTROLS, RISKS   AND COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT Responsible for identifying, evaluating, treating, monitoring and  communicating strategic risks and tracking the status of strategic,  operational, financial and regulatory risks (compliance). INTERNAL AUDIT AREA Responsible for auditing the companys risk management  process through impartial and independent reports. It tracks the  implementation of action plans for identified points and checks  whether actions have been implemented as planned. It also identifies opportunities to improve and prioritize processes  to be audited, based on the risk management process, and  expands the environment for substantive testing or continuous  monitoring if new risks or bigger impacts and vulnerability  regarding existing risks are identified. INDEPENDENT AUDIT AREA Monitors and evaluates the companys internal control environ- ment and risks considered relevant, in order to correctly produce  and present the financial statements. AUDIT COMMITTEE Monitors risk management work to guarantee that the language,  methodology and mechanisms of adopted controls are appro- priate, considering the structure, processes and evolution of  residual risk following the implementation of actions plans  defined by the company. It also ensures alignment of financial  policies with strategic guidelines and business risk profile.  It reports its conclusions to the Board of Directors. Risk control and management practices are described in TOTVS  Policy on Transactions with Related Parties and Risk Manage- ment and Internal Controls Policy, which cover the following: ToTVs  21 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 GOVERNANCE   AND RISK CULTURE A culture of mapping and managing risks is disseminated at all  levels of the company, and necessary actions are not restricted  to a single executive or department. Managers are primarily  responsible for day-to-day management of risks associated with  their area or business process and spreading this culture among  their team members, managing risk exposure through action  plans defined and monitored by the Board of Directors;  RISK, STRATEGY   AND GOAL SETTING Risk strategy and management must cover internal and external  factors, as well as the impact of risks that may be misaligned  with the guidelines established by the company, which could  affect the achievement of business objectives and strategy; RISK IDENTIFICATION,   EVALUATION AND TREATMENT Risks are periodically identified, evaluated, prioritized and docu- mented in a structured way so they can be treated properly. Risks are categorized in line with their nature and origin, in risk  categories. To this end, it is necessary to describe the processes  for identifying, evaluating and treating them. The methodology applied at the company is supported by the  components of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations  of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and its Enterprise Risk  Management Framework (COSO ERM) with respect to internal  environment, risk assessment, control activity, information,  communication and monitoring. The main risks to which the company is exposed are as follows: STRATEGIC RISKS Risks that affect strategic objectives, considering the internal  and external environment; OPERATIONAL RISKS Risks related to the companys operations (processes, people  and technology), which affect operational efficiency and the  effective and efficient use of resources. They may manifest  themselves in various ways, such as fraudulent acts, business  stoppages, improper conduct by employees and deficiencies  in contracts, resulting in financial and commercial losses, fines,  legal impacts and/or reputational impacts; FINANCIAL RISKS Risks associated with the exposure of the companys financial/ accounting operations and the reliability of its financial state- ments. They may materialize as a result of the ineffectiveness of  cash flow management aimed at maximization and the generation  of operating cash, returns from financial transactions, the raising  or usage of financial resources, and the possibility of issuing  incomplete, inaccurate and late financial, managerial and tax  reports, exposing the company to fines and penalties. REGULATORY/  COMPLIANCE RISKS Risks related to compliance with rules and legislation, considering  laws applicable to the sector of activity and general laws, both  national and international (environmental, labor, civil and tax/ fiscal).

The risk map also makes it possible to classify each  risk as low, medium, high or very high, in line with the level of  impacts and vulnerability to which it is exposed, as shown in the  results of qualitative and quantitative analyses. The process of  updating the risk map involved gauging executives perceptions  through interviews, a risk poll, updating of forms, and tracking  of indicators together with Risk Owners.* CLIENT PRIVACY   GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 418-1 TOTVS strives to guarantee the privacy and security of its own  data and that of its clients through an Information Security  Policy that provides for mechanisms to protect the environ- ment, a process for managing technical risks, and monitoring  of occurrences. Furthermore, TOTVS conducts internal investi- gations into potential violations of the environment, data secu- rity and privacy, involving forensic analysis, electronic searches  and interviews with those involved in suspected incidents. How- ever, the company recognizes the need to constantly improve in  this area. In 2017 and previous years, there were no records of inves- tigations exclusively involving violations of privacy, so we are  unable to generate a specific indicator for the topic. Never- theless, we have constantly enhanced our control environment  to allow greater specification of occurrences and potential risks  broken down by type of transaction/operation. The sector in  which TOTVS operates is still lightly regulated in Brazil, but  regulation has become stricter internationally, and this is likely  to be repeated domestically, leading us to expand our internal  control mechanisms.

This includes opportunities   and challenges on this path, strategies to deal with   them, and our future prospects. 23 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7  24 T O T V S  R E L AT O  I N T E G R A D O  2 0 1 7 CONTExT OF EVOLUTION  AND DIGITAL JOURNEY  We are experiencing a new digital age driven by the advent of  new disruptive technologies and profound transformations in  behavior. People are now consuming products and services in  a different way, while organizations are challenged to revalidate  their own business models. Individuals lie at the center of all  these changes. Peoples decision to connect and share infor- STRATEGIES, PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES mation is now a decisive factor for digital evolution in business  and the way we deal with the world in which we live. In ancient times, human beings always sought to understand  things on their own. When they started to work in groups and  in a collaborative way, they realized it was possible to transform  this understanding into knowledge, expanding and maximizing  the benefits generated for everyone. When people became  connected, they opted to express themselves and choose what  they wanted to consume, at any time and anywhere, demanding  that their needs be anticipated and promptly met. In this context, transformation is the word that best sums up  the moment that TOTVS and all other companies, large or small,  whether or not they belong to the world of technology, are going  through, or will go through. Those that do not incorporate the  digital variable into their strategic plans will become obsolete,  as the speed of transformation in the world requires ever faster  responses for organizations. Find out more. It has therefore become vital to companies sustainability and  competitiveness to think and do everything in a different way.  All this movement is positive, and it provides opportunities for  reinvention for all corporations. Extensive connections between  people and things through technology are generating a world  of shared data and creating countless possibilities for content  production and collaborative solutions. This is the context for  TOTVS digital journey, which in 2017 was marked by the high- lights presented in this edition of our Integrated Report. Watch this video to learn about TOTVS  vision for digital transformation. GRI 102-15, 103-1  25 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 EVOLUTION OF    GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3 SOFTWARE BUSINESS In recent years, more demanding consumers and high-speed  connected devices have triggered new digital business models,  such as subscription services. These services are spreading  across all industries, causing ruptures in traditional businesses  and becoming a viable business model. As clients participate  in active online communities, they become loyal to brands and  generate more and more on-demand experiences. The market  has grown year after year, and it is forecast to be worth US$100  billion per year worldwide in the short term, according to Gartner,  particularly driven by the fast-developing Internet of Things. In this age of the shared economy, in which people are increas- ingly paying to use rather than own goods and services, we can  perceive that many industries have been radically transformed  MOVE TO SUBSCRIPTION MODEL In 2017, we recorded a 34.3% increase in TOTVS subscription revenue, which now accounts for more than 20%  of the companys total software revenue. Last year, we also gained more than 6,000 new subscription clients,  which represents a 53.5% rise in relation to 2016.  This change represents an important step in the companys trajectory and long-term strategy, aimed at sustainable  growth, predictable results and operational scalability of its business model. To enable this process, TOTVS rethought  and reformulated not just the way it produces its software, but also how it sells it and interacts with clients. The  company sought to understand what really makes sense to the lives of companies and people, in a context of new  behaviors and forms of interaction. The contrast is clear. TOTVS has evolved its business, previously focused on licensing, maintenance and service  activities, to a subscription-based format. Closed, complex and user-focused software systems have been turned  into platforms, which are steadily getting more open, integrated, specialized and aimed at identities, while  prioritizing development in line with the mobile-first concept. They are cloud based, they include upgrades, they  interact with legacy systems, and they process external data and information, via artificial intelligence, generating  content to strengthen businesses. In practice, clients now have a simpler and easier way to sign up for and use TOTVS solutions. Merely by paying  for a monthly subscription, which represents a low initial investment, they get free access to all the companys  solutions on multiple devices and for multiple identities. They can enjoy the convenience and flexibility of the TOTVS  Intera sales process (a commercial subscription model for small, medium and large companies). In this way, TOTVS  is contributing to digital democratization, empowering ever more people and organizations via technology, and  keeping clients within the core focus of its strategy.

The profile of customers is  changing. Today they are more connected and empowered, and  they are looking for better consumer experiences, based on  a notably digital universe. This obviously applies to the software  sector. Since 2015, TOTVS has been working to become a Soft- ware as a Service (SaaS) company. One of the fundamental  innovations in this process was the implementation of a sub- scription model to replace the former licensing system.

This broad distribution network reflects a physical and digital  model that helps to increase TOTVS market penetration, boost  clients business generation through marketplaces, and strength- en the internationalization of the companys brand. This strategy of everyday proximity to clients is the result of TOTVS  continuous learning and experiences, in a trajectory marked by  entrepreneurship and purposeful innovation. Combining organic  and inorganic growth with a journey of overcoming challenges,  it has been possible to overcome geographical and commu- nication barriers, laying the foundations that allow TOTVS to  compete globally with the biggest market players. STRATEGIES, PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES  29 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 STRATEGIES, PROSPECTS AND CHALLENGES Innovation Community  /// In response to social changes  caused by growing connectivity and the strategy of working  as a provider of open management and business platforms  (such as ERP, HR, fluig and Carol), TOTVS has opened its doors  to more intense interaction with the innovation community. in 2017, iDEXO was opened. This institute has the purpose of  connecting startups, entrepreneurs and developers to large  companies in the pursuit of new business solutions. Designed  as an open innovation platform, the institute seeks to identify  innovative ideas that have the potential for adoption and  exponential growth. It helps startups to structure their business  models, connecting their solutions to the market. Located in an area specifically dedicated to its activities within  TOTVS new head office, iDEXO is different from all other  initiatives in Brazil, providing TOTVS infrastructure and tech- nologies (including APIs) to startups and the community of  developers to create innovative business solutions. Further- more, these companies may receive investment from TOTVS  and other members of the institute, and sell their solutions at  the TOTVS Store. TOTVS has also other structures focused on research, develop- ment and innovation activities, which are described in Intellec- tual Capital. HOW DOES THE ACCELERATION PROGRAM WORK? Every year, iDEXO holds three public contests for its acceleration program, called StartupX. Participation is  completely free, and organizations legally constituted, resident and domiciled in Brazil may apply. The evaluation process consists of analyzing projects in accordance with three criteria: (I) potential connections  and synergies with associates; (II) economic and market feasibility of solution; and (III) novelty and innovation  capacity of the proposed product or solution. The focus is on finding exponential, early-stage startups in all sectors, and connecting them to large companies,  boosting their ability to access investment and develop their consumer market, and bringing innovation solutions  and technologies to the business world. After being selected, the startups and their entrepreneurs go through a three-month residency at the institute. They  have free access to iDEXOs coworking space, all its infrastructure, technical and business mentors, acceleration,  programming challenges, and easy contact with the executives of associate companies, as well as content and  support for the technical and technological development of their solutions. Startups contact with iDEXO takes place precisely in one of the most challenging phases for these entrepreneurs,  the feared Valley of Death, the initial operating phase, in which many of these young companies fail due to a lack  of traction and access to essential technologies. As a partner of these startups on this journey, iDEXO uses a hands-on approach and the methodology and content  of two partners: Swedish school Hyper Island, based on an enterprising culture and mindset; and iMasters, a Brazilian  platform aimed at developers (its virtual community contains 450,000 professionals). Every week, there are two  or three days of mandatory activities, which amount to more than 200 hours of content by the end of the batch. Another major distinctive feature of iDEXO is that it uses the equity-free model, meaning that it does not acquire  a stake in startups, and nor does it demand any kind of intellectual property regarding whatever is developed. The  institute also has different associates and not a single owner, enabling a greater diversity of connections and  possibility of investment.

Thus, in keep- ing with our commitment to transparency and best practices  regarding information, and aligned with the spirit of this Inte- grated Report, we will describe the challenges we have identified  managerially as the main ones to be overcome in 2018 and the  next few years, in order to ensure sustainable value creation for  our chain of shareholders, TOTVERS, clients, suppliers and part- ners, as well as the innovation ecosystem and society as a whole. 2018 is a Year of Execution for TOTVS. The main challenge is  therefore to execute transformations that we have been devel- oping, to continue on our digital journey, and to further strength- en the #WEARETOTVERS culture. In 2018, we will guide our actions by the following principles: The ARC, which represents the Attitude, Results and Conse- quences expected of TOTVERS in their actions. It encourages  recognition of responsible engagement with the companys  quality and growth. the TOTVS DIGITAL MODEL (TDM) caps off the journey to  transform our ERP, HR and segmented solutions into platforms,  integrated with fluig, Carol and TOTVS Store. In 2018, we are  committed to the materialization of TOTVS Store. To this end,  the company will enter the stage of expanding the posting of  APIs for its solutions and platforms, making the store an environ- ment of connection between TOTVS and its clients, with apps,  services and products available for sale and installation through  TOTVS Store. MAIN CHALLENGES In this TDM context, TOTVS INTERA represents a commercial  subscription model for TOTVS platforms and solutions. It offers  a versatile subscription package, affordable to companies in any  sector and of any size, with the best cost-benefit relationship  in the market. The challenge involving the evolution of TOTVS  Intera is to expand the base of clients in this modality, gaining  their loyalty through the intensive and unlimited use of TOTVS  essential solutions. Indispensable protagonists on this journey, the company has  listened to its clients and learned about the challenges they face at  their own companies, and their need to evolve, migrate, simplify  or reimplement existing solutions. The principle of ConVer- genCe then arises, with the aim of proposing convergence be- tween all the solutions used by clients, including TOTVS, based  on the fluig platform, making clients software legacy an IT asset. 31 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Technology and algorithms that make things and processes   smarter, answering questions and offering insights to aid decision   making or the performance of tasks.

This growth will mainly involve digital business projects, block- chain, the internet of things, and the use of big data together with algorithms, machine learning and artificial intelligence.  The biggest growth will be in the corporate software segment. Global spending in this area is forecast to rise 9.5%  in 2018, to US$421 billion. Gartner believes that organizations will expand their investment in corporate management  systems, and part of their budgets will migrate to the software as a service (SaaS) model.

It is   a base that lets us bring to  Brazil whatever is happening  around the world. MARCELO COSENTINO  Vice President of Professional Services & IT GRI 103-1 In this chapter, we describe the importance of our Research &  Development area, as well as the investment we are making  to gradually expand our knowledge and competence regarding  the sectors in which our clients operate – something that has  become a competitive advantage during our trajectory. The objectives that guide the existence of these structures  include the following: I) enhancement of the technical foun- dations of our software, permitting greater efficiency in the de- velopment of solutions; II) adoption of new technologies and  evaluations of their impacts; III) implementation of tech- nological alternatives to uphold and protect our operations;  IV) constant refinement of concepts, functionality and usability;  V) development of special products at the request of clients;  VI) constant pursuit of new development methodologies; VII)  integration of third parties tools; and VIII) evaluation of new  organizational models and their applicability. Our dedicated research, development and innovation teams  are organized as follows: R&D CENTERS These centers specialize in the companys 10 strategic operating  industries. They are staffed by specialists who understand  the specific needs and challenges of each segment, translating  them into innovative solutions and aligned with our clients  core businesses. Each center is structured with specialized teams covering areas  such as products, development, support, customer service and  relationships, and services (implementation). Ux LABS Located in So Paulo, Brazil, this center hosts a team of research- ers and designers who are exclusively dedicated to exploring  market trends and improving the user experience of our solutions  and services through constant research and observation in the  field with clients. In this lab, projects are guided by the design thinking approach,  which involves empathy, collaboration and creativity, seeking  constant improvements to our products processes, interfaces  and navigability. TOTVS LABS EUA Attentive to international technological evolution, the company  has had an innovation laboratory, TOTVS Labs, in Silicon Valley  since 2012. It is focused on developing new technologies and  solutions involving cloud computing, social media, big data, arti- ficial intelligence (see How Carol was born on page 35) and  mobile devices. TOTVS Labs has a team of 22 people, including designers, scien- tists and engineers from different countries, such as Brazil, the  United States, China, Russia and India. It also has the role of iden- tifying and strengthening partnerships with local companies and  startups.  35 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 HOW CAROL WAS BORN  Carol, TOTVS artificial intelligence platform, was created from the very beginning by teams in California and  New York, as well as a group of data scientists in Brazil. Interaction, prototyping and cocreation on our artificial intelligence platform provides an example of how we  make innovation happen. Simply put, Carol is like a child: if you dont teach it, it will not learn anything. On  its own, with little interaction, a child may grow, but it will not develop its potentialities for the world. When  it comes to artificial intelligence, learning takes place through algorithms, which search for appropriate  information, attitudes and behaviors to support the evolution of this platform and its contribution to the  development and journey of our clients, their partners and their sectors, in a linked way. Intelligence ultimately lies in data. And it only  functions if we can transform it into strategy  and predictability for business. That is the purpose  of Carols first applications, which are starting to  reach the market. The first was a tool to track  university dropouts, which makes it possible to  predict, 90 days in advance and with a 90%  accuracy rate, the probability that a student will  take a break from college. After this, a chatbot  for hotels was launched, permitting management  of all contact with guests, from pre-bookings to  checkout. INTELECTUAL CAPITAL Together with other development centers located in Brazil,  TOTVS innovation hub on the American West Coast demon- strates the understanding and experience that technology  changes societys behavior and the way business is done. These teams are attentive to the market, which is increasingly  looking for mobile solutions involving the cloud, cognitive tech- nologies and artificial intelligence, generating a universe of  shared data and creating opportunities to produce collaborative  content and solutions. New business opportunities are created  all the time and the focus is on offering greater convenience to  clients, so they can access more innovative, faster, simpler tech- nologies, which meet their needs in the best possible way. At the same time, the company has been dedicating itself to  implementing more agile and simpler service processes. This  involves looking for and implementing disruptive business struc- tures, without any intermediation and allowing potential econo- mies of scale. From these efforts, a new digital platform has emerged.

SRGIO PAUPRIO SRIO FILHO  Executive Manager for Institutional Relations,   Investor Relations and Social Opportunity HUMAN CAPITAL TOTVS culture evolved in 2017 in an unparalleled way. This  was a milestone for our journey and our relationships with  clients, suppliers and partners. A watershed that defines our  companys main driver in this journey: people. To understand this story, let us return to the past and recall the  trajectory of TOTVS, a company that largely grew by acquiring  dozens of other companies. Each one had its own practices.  As a result, although TOTVS had its own culture, there was a  lack of shared guidelines, a common language and a crystalized,  clear and accessible way of acting. The situation began to change in 2016, when the people area  was restructured and repositioned in a more strategic manner. This new way of acting marked the beginning of this evolution  in TOTVS culture. It involved mapping what TOTVERS behavior  ought to be during this digital transformation journey. This process was built through a bottom-up methodology,  listening to TOTVERS and taking their insights to the companys  senior management. This made it possible to connect employees  demands in relation to culture with the companys strategic drivers. The attributes that define the company were born then: People,  Clients and Technology. Clients and people are helping to  strengthen a sense of unity, identity and purpose, reflected  in the creation of the #WEARETOTVERS campaign and the en- tire communication plan for disseminating this new culture. GRI 102-16  39 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 Technology + Knowledge are in our DNA We have built a legacy for an ever-changing-word. We are always thinking   about how to combine technology and knowledge to keep boosting innovation now and forever.   We are creative and not afraid of making mistakes. We value competent people who are nice people Courious, collaborative, digital and driven by results. We are driven by our own style, and we are restless.   We are TOTVERS. Our customers success is our success We anticipate the needs of our customers. We deliver quality in solutions that are more essential,   simpler and more agile for businesses. Always there and nearby. #WEARETOTVERS CULTURE HUMAN CAPITAL GRI 102-16  40 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 However, our transformation was just beginning. And it was  deeper than the new concept itself (although this is extremely  important). It also involves new internal actions, a review of  processes, and new tools. The dissemination of the cultures attributes and everything  surrounding it is, in itself, a continuous project, given the com- panys dynamism and its desire to overcome the new challenges  that continually appear for our clients and the market. One of the signs of evolution in our culture is the implemen- tation of a new model for evaluating TOTVERS performance,  which has two aspects: employees competencies, and the  process of targets focused on the organizations strategy in  this digital transformation journey. The new model puts the same emphasis on behavior and re- sults. This reinforces one of the elements of TOTVS culture:  how is as important as what. This shows that the behavior  the company requires of its employees is being incorporated  into the companys processes, and that our culture is not merely  a declaration of intent framed on a wall. Another striking initiative was a change in our parameters  for training leaders. Competencies such as process, project  and finance management continue to be relevant, but the  main focus is now on people management. This means that  leaders must be active listeners, give feedback, understand  differences between generations, and plan succession (fun- damental to business sustainability in the long term), among  other points. In addition, all senior management levels are now  trained based on the same methodology – a practice seldom  seen in the market. HIGHLIGHTS /// In 2017, 350 company leaders, including managers and executives, were trained. /// There were three in-person training modules, focusing on basic principles of people management, ascendant  communication and high-performance team manage- ment. /// In 2018, the target is to train 500 coordinators.  This vision of TOTVERS training culminated in December  2017 with the launch of TOTVS University, a new model of  collaborative learning, which fosters peoples thirst for  learning and self-development, supported by different  methodologies. In this model, the company allows all TOTVERs  to go far beyond the knowledge proposed for their track at  each moment in their career. In 2018, the process continues with the structuring of career  tracks for TOTVERS and the strengthening of this model. In addition to TOTVS Universitys content, in 2017 we also  offered approximately 100,000 hours of training, repre- senting an average of 14 hours per TOTVER.

NOT AFRAID OF MAKING MISTAKES The innovation sector, in Brazil and across the world, requires  freedom to make mistakes. Our employees are trained to work  with excellence. However, fear of punishment or hierarchical  reprimand must not interrupt the process of evolution: it is  opposed to the idea of innovating. As a result, in addition to all  its risk management controls and investment, TOTVS explicitly  specifies the expected conduct in such cases for its employees:  if you make a mistake, do it quickly, admit it, and then correct  it immediately.

WEARETOTVERS #WEARETOTVERS is a symbol of pride in belonging, and it  has yielded better-than-expected results. Last year, its usage  grew 60%. Overall, this digital indicator reflects progress in  employees engagement with the company, which is also  reflected in other metrics. This effect can be seen in some important human resources  management indicators. For example, the employee absenteeism  rate in 2017 fell to 1.55, the lowest in the companys history.  By way of comparison, across all Brazilian technology companies,  the average figure is three times higher, around 4.5. In a ranking of the best places to work at, TOTVS scored a 95%  favorability score for diversity, which means working with people  who think or behave differently from you. This is crucial at a  creative and innovative company. Last year, we launched our Healthier program. TOTVS believes  that balance in life is fundamental to people. Connected to  the growing demand for health and well-being, the program  is basically split into three pillars: /// #activelife: actions focused on health, diet and     encouragement to regularly do physical activities. /// #wellness: actions focused on mental health. /// #myfinances: actions reinforcing and encouraging     the proper and conscious use of money. Monitoring, guidance and practices make up the three pillars,  incentivizing and supporting habits and a healthy lifestyle to  promote the well-being of TOTVERS and their families.

Inspired by the  concepts of collaborative, creative and integrated work, TOTVS  new head office was opened in June 2017, following total  investment of R$280 million. Of this sum, R$ 80 million was  spent directly by the company to equip the new building  properly and the rest was allocated by investors through a  build-to-suit project. In the past, the companys employees were spread across eight  sites in and around So Paulo. Bringing together these units  and physical infrastructure was aimed at increasing connectivity  and inspiration for innovation among TOTVERS. HUMAN CAPITAL The buildings architectural design was based on the physical  and organizational philosophy of state-of-the-art technology  companies in Silicon Valley. The office has around 65,000  square meters of floor space and it houses the companys  3,200 employees (2,000 in development and innovation, and the  other 1,200 in administrative and customer service areas). This infrastructure closely reflects the companys digital trans- formation journey and the evolution of its culture. It stimulates  a collaborative environment and the formation of multifunc- tional teams, which work in a synergistic way, bringing together  different areas and internal clients, without losing sight of  benefits for end clients. The head office also features a 174-m2 laboratory designed for  innovation, which hosts developments based on the concept of  design thinking. It also contains games rooms, a multifunctional  terrace, a picnic room and even a slide that links two floors. The iconic building is not an isolated fact. In an organic way and  in line with its strategy, TOTVS has been reequipping or building  new facilities for its affiliates across the country, based on the  architectural style of its head office in So Paulo. TOTVS is a single  company, and its buildings convey its practices and culture  wherever they are.

In practice, this was the first joint trainee and  training process conducted by the company. Of these group of trainees, seven have been hired. They em- body high tech culture and the meaning of being a TOTVER.  In other words, they are innovative, restless, curious, proactive  and collaborative, always looking for simple and nimble solutions,  with excellence and a thirst to learn more. We believe in the transformative power of technology and the  empowerment of individuals and organizations that maximize  benefits and values generated by them. SPECIAL RECRUITMENT We have professionals specialized in seeking talents in tech- nology communities created by fans themselves. One knows  each other and recommends another one. To find the best ones,  we locate the communities around which these young people  organize themselves and swap programming challenges within  the world of data science. It is a highly dynamic, innovative and  cutting-edge environment, from which a national ranking of  programmers and data scientists has emerged. TECH TALENTS TOTVS wants to do more and overcome its challenges. Produc- tivity and competitiveness are two of these challenging subjects.  As barriers for development in the information technology  market decline progressively, in a more open and collaborative  market, innovating is imperative. Internally, the biggest challenge is to have inspiring leaders capable  of promoting development, innovation and the retention of our  tech talents. One initiative to address this issue is Programmed  Future, in which we train potential job candidates. Outstanding  participants are kept in our pool of talents and they are called  when opportunities arise. They want to work at TOTVS and we  begin our relationship with them based on this intention, which  is particularly intense for the technology development area, which  demands highly specialized professionals. Because of the advance of artificial intelligence, people are  increasingly relying on very specific competencies as well as  suitable cognitive structures and logic to read and work with  data and algorithms. These professionals are sought in the cor- porate market, academia and in particular in the geek universe.  At the same time, TOTVS is developing an internal program to  train data scientists. As the use of artificial intelligence advances in the solutions we  offer to our clients, in the industries in which we operate, our  demand for these professionals grows. Reflecting the attention we give people – as one of the pillars  of our culture – in 2017 alone, 6,000 candidates applied for  our Trainee Program.

As a result,  the numbers in TOTVS financial results are fundamental to  understand this shared journey with its stakeholders. In 2017, the company resumed its growth path. Net revenue grew  2.0% organically, driven by a 34.3% increase in subscription  revenue, which now represents 20.7% of total software revenue.  This growth in subscription revenue is a result of the digital  journey TOTVS is going through, which is increasingly trans- forming it into a subscription company. As a consequence of this transition, costs and expenses rose  faster than revenue. This factor, combined with the effects of  Brazils economic recession, led to a reduction in net earnings  and EBITDA in the period. Despite lower profits, the maintenance of financial discipline  led to a 26.6% rise in net operating cash flow and a 32.7%  reduction in net debt. NET REVENUE The companys net revenue amounted to R$2.3 billion in 2017,  mainly the result of growth in recurring revenue, which went  up 8.7%, accounting for 65.8% of total net revenue in the year,  up 4 percentage points from 61.7% in 2016. Subscription revenue was the main driver of this advance. It  totaled R$307.9 million, up 34.3% year-over-year. It repre- sented 20.7% of software revenue, up from 16.4% the previous  year. Over the course of 2017, the company gained 6,166 new  subscription clients, 53.5% more than in 2016. Subscription revenue increased 9.5% between the third and  fourth quarters. This was the fastest growth in this revenue in  a single quarter since we began our transition to this model. On the other hand, licensing revenue declined 0.7% between  2016 and 2017, reflecting a 16.2% drop in the number of sales,  largely due to the migration of a share of the sales pipeline for  new clients to the subscription modality. Maintenance revenue remained practically unchanged between  2016 and 2017, rising 0.9%, reflecting the lower volume of  license sales in previous periods, higher non-payment by clients  and a rise in partial contract termination resulting from spending  cuts by clients. The combination of different behavior in the two business models  (licensing + maintenance and subscription) raised software  revenue 6.2% during 2017.

However, we believe that revenue in itself is not the best  parameter to gauge the performance of subscription sales  between quarters, given that the first monthly payment due  through TOTVS Intera is billed the month after a sale is made. Thus, sales made in the first month of a quarter affect the two  following months of that same quarter. Likewise, a sale made in  the second month of a quarter only boosts sales in the quarters  third month, while sales in the last month of a quarter contribute  to revenue in the first months of the following quarter. Accordingly, Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), a metric widely  used in the SaaS model, allows comparisons between periods  by annualizing all existing subscriptions, regardless of the month  of sale. ARR also captures the effect of subscriptions sold each  quarter, which will add to subscription revenue in subsequent  periods. Subscription ARR amounted to R$ 368 million in 4Q17, up 41.5%  from 4Q16 and 10.1% higher than in 3Q17, and it represents  a net addition of R$ 33.9 million in the quarter, up 35.1% from  4Q16. The sum of R$ 368 million is 19.5% higher than sub- scription revenue of R$ 309.7 million in 2017, which represents  an addition to 2018 revenue arising from sales made in 2017. 2015* 2016 2017 * Pro Forma 2015* 2016 2017 2015* 2016 2017 2015* 2016 2017 2015* 2016 2017 188.790  229.235 307.866 1,258.820  1,348.883 1,466.416 456.913  358.728 303.498 339.618 260.508 329.772 SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE  (R$ MILLION) RECURRING REVENUE  (R$ MILLION) ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS  (R$ MILLION) ADJUSTED EBITDA   (R$ MILLION) OPERATING CASH FLOW (R$ MILLION) FINANCIAL CAPITAL 21.4% 7.2% -42.8% -21.5% -23.3% 34.3% 8.7% -40.5% -15.4% 26.6% 283.079  162.044 96.405 GRI 201-1  53 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 CONTRIBUTION MARGIN   BY BUSINESS (SOFTWARE, SERVICES   AND HARDWARE) The reduction in adjusted software contribution margin in 2017  is mainly a consequence of faster growth in research and  development expenses than increases in the prices of main- tenance and subscription contracts. This growth is essentially  associated with salary rises arising from collective work agree- ments in the period and innovation investments in innovation,  largely related to specialized business solutions, open platforms  and the micro and small enterprises segment. In the case of services, the reduction in contribution margin  is mainly a result of a slowdown in project sales and a smaller  deployment of service and consulting professionals. This  situation was more intense in the first half of 2017. The adjusted hardware contribution margin fell, both in 2017  and in the last quarter of the year, as shown in the chart, due  reduction in net earnings year-over-year was faster than the  reduction in EBITDA, mainly due to growing depreciation and  amortization expenses and the higher share of negative financial  income in relation to EBITDA in the period. CASH FLOW TOTVS cash flow last year was R$308.3 million, up 56.7% from  2016. This was largely due to a 92.3% drop in investment in  working capital and lower investment in fixed and intangible  assets in the period, following investments related to new  facilities in 2016. DEBT Gross debt (loans + financing + bonds + liabilities arising from  acquisitions of net escrow deposit investments) amounted to  R$709.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with  R$693.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross debt was  maintained, despite a bond issue worth R$200 million in the  third quarter of 2017. to a drop in sales of tax invoice printers and lower financial  grants in the third quarter, because of a rise in stock levels. EBITDA In 2017, there was a 15.4% decline in adjusted EBITDA,  basically due to a combination of four factors: disproportional  growth in commercial expenses amid our transition to a sub- scription model; higher general and administrative expenses,  mainly arising from cost inflation and additional spending  involving the integration of operations at companies acquired  in previous periods; lower service income because of a smaller  deployment of professionals; and lower hardware income,  mainly due to a reduction in sales of tax invoice printers and  lower financial grants.  NET EARNINGS The companys adjusted net earnings in 2017 were R$96.405  million, down 40.5% from R$162.044 million in 2016.

Economic growth was 3% in 2017, the highest since 2011. Despite uncertainty surrounding President Donald  Trumps political proposals, as well as conflicts and tensions in specific parts of the world, which negatively  marked 2017, recovery of the Chinese market and economic growth in the Euro Zone, driven mainly by Germany,  Spain and France, were factors responsible for an improvement in global economic conditions. Latin America saw a slight recovery compared with 2016, caused by an improvement in global trade, higher  commodity prices, and lower financial volatility in international markets. The Brazilian economy grew 1% in 2017 and inflation as measured by the IPC-A index ended that year at 2.95%,  below the ceiling in the Central Banks target range and the lowest level in the last 19 years. The benchmark Selic  interest rate, which was 13.75% at the end of 2016, fell to 7.25% in December 2017, while the US dollar rose  1.99% against the Brazilian real. Brazils balance of performed well and direct foreign investment increased, largely due to improved confidence in  the market. Despite these positive signs, Brazils fiscal crisis continues to be the governments main priority. It is  looking for solutions to increased revenues and contain expenditure. However, the public pension reform will be targeted in the governments last year. Despite the negative effects  of politics and slow economic recovery, Brazil continues to be a country with many business opportunities. The  reduction in interest rates and inflation, combined with a recovery in GDP, leads us to believe in the reestablishment  of Brazilian economic growth in the upcoming year.

This applies to TOTVS  trajectory and the journey we are describing here. This is a narrative of transformation and leadership. All leading  companies recognize the responsibility of working to positi- ve ly influence the environment around their business. This is  the case with TOTVS, the foremost company in its sector in  Brazil and Latin America, and one of the largest in the world.  Therefore, in addition to the standards demanded by law and  relationship best practices, we seek to uphold our core busi- ness shared values in our relations with all our stakeholders:  proximity, presence, agility, transparency and defense of shared  interests such as ethics, development and social justice. OUR STAKEHOLDERS  The identification and definition of initiatives to promote en- gagement with stakeholders is one of the functions of TOTVS  Institutional Relations and Social Opportunity area, together  with other corporate areas, such as Marketing. These areas  define the strategy, actions and their frequency of deployment. In 2017, as part of the process of defining high-priority topics  for this report, we held interviews with the companys leaders  and market specialists, besides conducting an online poll of  TOTVERS, our clients and suppliers. In 2017, we continued to contribute to the development of  the technology sector, by participating in associations, sector  organizations and development forums. We also made pro- gress toward our goals in the social area, such as by achieving  record employability at the Social Opportunity Institute (IOS).  We ex panded our presence on social networks and digital  media, offering content presented through a multiplatform  concept. Our efforts in this area also included projects such as iDEXO,  an initiative to promote entrepreneurship and innovation,  con necting startups, new entrepreneurs and developers with  large companies, as part of projects to co-create value for the  business environment.

Over time, both  the beneficiaries and the content offered have been expanded,  and students completing the free vocational training have got  jobs with the support of partner companies. IOS is present in four Brazilian states (So Paulo, Rio de Janeiro,  Minas Gerais and Santa Catarina), and it has so far provided  training to more than 32,000 people aged 15 to 29, including  people with disabilities, since it was founded in 1998. In line with its business strategy, TOTVS assigns all its annual  social investment to IOS projects, through direct donations.  In 2017, we invested more than R$5 million in the institute,  representing nearly 6% of the companys net earnings. BUSINESSES SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT   THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY  PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS;  and MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT   IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. 32,000 students trained over the course of 20 years 10,259 students   completed vocational courses between   2010 and 2017 5,756 students employed in the job market between   2010 and 2017 SOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL Last year, IOS exceeded its target for employability and set  an annual service record early, in October. Also in 2017, the  institute launched a pilot project aimed at training Future  Talents, focusing on programming, the installation of software,  infrastructure and networks, citizenship, employability and  behavioral development.

More than 600 people parti ci pated  in the five-day event, in person and via remote connection. In  panel discussions, TOTVERS, IOS team and external specialists  debated the role of each person and each orga ni zation in building  a more conscious, diverse and ethical society. SHARING KNOWLEDGE To develop closer links between TOTVERS and IOS students,  we ran a campaign called Share Knowledge and Transform  Lives. Besides visiting TOTVS sites, students took part in chats and talks  about the labor market, IT careers, technology and opportunities. The meetings were led by TOTVER volunteers from company  sites in So Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro, and they  involved more than 300 students from the institute.

The Institutional Relations and Social Opportunity team, now  in its fifth year, has been working to make TOTVS a leader in  the countrys development agenda. Through a plan produced  in partnership with sector organizations, over the course of  2017, we sought to foster closer links with the executive and  legislative branches, in a technical and transparent manner, in  order to devise and enhance public policies that can generate  economic growth and social progress through the use of tech- nology. The growing participation of TOTVS and trade associations in  Brazilian political life, combined with heightened visibility of the  use of technologies as drivers of development, has stimulated  the public sectors interest in debates that permeate the sectors  regulatory agenda, including subjects related to the business  environment and the prosperity of the IT sector. We also had collaborative interactions related to the afore- mentioned subjects within the scope of the Presidential Eco- nomic and Social Development Council, the Ministry of Science,  Technology, Innovation and Communications Science, Tech- nology and Innovation Council, the science, technology and in- novation commissions of the House of Representatives and  Senate, the municipal government of So Paulo, and other the- matic parliamentary commissions. Participation in the working  groups of trade associations such as BRASSCOM and ANPEI  was also essential to generate content and to address the  topics presented here.

In essence, TOTVS Code of Conduct has the goal of strength- ening our culture, which we define as: Being a company  of owners without frontiers, based on people who provoke  innovation. /// Gifts and presents We comply with Resolution 3 of 2000, which regulates the  treatment of gifts and presents given to public officials, as  well as the policies and codes of respective public agents,  organizations and entities to which they belong. /// Monetary donations to public agents  All kinds of contributions, donations or payments to public  officials, whether monetary or otherwise, are explicitly  prohibited.

It is a nonprofit institute funded  by the company and other members, which has the purpose of  connecting startups, entrepreneurs and developers to large  companies in the pursuit of new business solutions. Created  as an open innovation platform, the project aims to identify  innovative initiatives that have the potential for adoption and  exponential growth, to structure businesses, and to connect  them with the market. The idea is to create a large ecosystem based on the concept of  co-innovation, encouraging connections between new entre- preneurs and established companies, enabling joint inno vation  and the creation of solutions to meet organizations and sec- tors demands. Three times per year, the institute will select  startups or independent developers who wish to join iDEXO  to collaborate on projects, always starting with a business  challenge.

On this  journey, tech nology is the driving force for dynamic, more in- teractive and effective relations. Carol, TOTVS quality data and  artificial intelligence platform, marks a new era in the com panys  innovation and it is taking interaction with organizations to a  new level. By accelerating the capacity for analysis and the speed of deci- sion making, in light of the growing volume of information,  Carol brings more intelligence, productivity and efficiency to  business, as well as better working, service and consumer ex- periences for employees, clients and society in general. This  has enabled the development of specific solutions for many  different sectors. In education, for example, Carol uses more  than 230 variables to predict, with a 90% accuracy rate and  90 days in advance, the probability of a student enrolling at a  university. Likewise, other TOTVS platforms are facilitating the routines  of our stakeholders and their production chains. These plat- forms include fluig, which allows the creation and sharing of  content and projects, almost like an internal social network for  companies; Analytics, which enables companies to analyze and  generate indicator reports, based on ERP or CRM system data;  and Bemacash, a management system incorporated into point- of-sale hardware. Over the course of 2017, TOTVS Analytics was enhanced to  offer even more agile information to clients and indicate how  their company is evolving. On the fluig platform, the interface  was adjusted to make it faster and to add complementary  solutions to aid management and decision making. TOTVS has in-depth knowledge of the needs and specific fea- tures of each sector. As a result, it relates in an integrated and  engaged way with its clients. We perceive this characteristic to  be a high-value aspect of our relationships. All this, combined  with our internal dynamics, in which TOTVERS have the free- dom to propose and create new things, strengthens us on our  journey, through closer and more productive relationships. To present our innovations for the sectors in which we operate,  and above all to listen to our clients, the Sensational Experiences  Space in our head office includes completely visual environments,  which show real situations in order to demonstrate what tech- nology is able to provide. Innovation and technology together  have a positive impact on companies productivity and every- day routines. The space is divided into the following areas: Supply Chain  (en compassing the Agribusiness, Manufacturing and Logistics  industries), Consumer (including Fashion, Food Services, Super- markets and General Stores), Healthcare and Professional Services  (including Education, Construction & Projects, Hospitality, Services  and Legal). There is also an interactive table with a 70-inch touch- screen, presenting the TOTVS City in 3D, featuring graphic  simulations, videos and demonstrations of all the industries in  which the company operates. SOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAKE OUR CLIENTS  RELATIONSHIPS MORE DYNAMIC  66 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 CLIENTS We are a business-to-business (B2B) company, 100% focused  on our clients. We believe that our technology is capable of  affecting our clients customers, and so we seek to be conti- nually in contact with all our stakeholders through important  relationship mechanisms, including the following: /// Segmented newsletter This newsletter contains personalized content for each of  our operating industries, including news, details of new  product features, and articles written by our specialists. It  is sent to all our clients and other stakeholders. /// Meetups Meetings for the technical community (IT professionals,  students and TOTVERS) to debate key trends in technology  development. /// Digital transformation events Meetings between our CEO, executives, clients and pros- pects to present and discuss the impacts of digital trans- formation on business. In 2017, we held eight events across  Brazil, in Porto Alegre, Goinia, Cuiab, Manaus, Curitiba,  Fortaleza, Campinas and Joinville. /// Webinars Events transmitted via the internet, aimed at empowering  companies in their markets and clarifying sensitive topics  for their management, such as regulatory and tax obliga- tions. In 2017, we held 293 webinars. /// Clients Portal Our main channel for communication with our clients, pro- viding all necessary information about their support, con- sultations and demands, as well as relevant news for them. /// Ombudsman Office Our clients can use an Ombudsman Office that is separate  from our organizational structure, which reports directly  to our Board of Directors. /// Testing and research We basically have three main moments when we consult  our clients:  Constant market research: this helps us to understand our  clients main needs. For example, it feeds our innovation  road map and guides our R&D teams activities. Client consultations: our innovation model is based on  getting an in-depth understanding of our clients needs. To  this end, we consult them even before we have formatted  our solutions, so that we can jointly build models that are  better aligned with their market. Pilot projects: these are run in partnership with strategic  clients, resulting in new tools, which are developed on  demand and tested on site before being opened up to the  market.

It largely focuses  on the development of software programs that the company  sells, as well as suppliers of databases, which are sold on to  clients and technology platform providers. Other services are  also significant, such as consulting assignments on different  subjects, cleaning and maintenance, marketing, audits, and the  supply of office and administrative materials. Through Bematech,  the company also works with suppliers of raw materials and  end products. In order to strengthen relations with our suppliers, selection  and procurement processes are conducted in line with our  Supplier Contract Administration Policy and our Code of Ethics  and Conduct, involving fair criteria, considering items such  as the supply of materials and services, deadlines and costs.  We also consider aspects such as labor practices and the non- existence of slave-like and child labor. Thus, we do not hire  suppliers that have been blacklisted and fined by the Labor  Ministry for involvement in slave labor, and we encourage our  suppliers to adopt the principles and clauses set forth in Brazils  Anti-Corruption Law. Most purchases and contracts involve local suppliers (located  in the same municipality as the companies and affiliates of  TOTVS and Bematech S/A, since its incorporation in November  2017). BUSINESSES SHOULD SUPPORT AND   RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY  PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS. MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT   IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS   OF FORCED AND COMPULSORY LABOR. SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION   OF CHILD LABOR.

These include water, land,   minerals, forests, biodiversity   and ecosystem quality.  71 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7  72 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 In the contemporary world, all organizations need to take into  account the environmental impacts of their actions. This applies  to TOTVS journey and those of its stakeholders. The efficient  management of natural resources and responsible behavior  in the context that permeates our activity are also part of the  commitment made by TOTVERS and the company. An example of this is provided by Bematechs plant in the mu- nicipality of So Jos dos Pinhais, Paran. The company tracks  the indicators and impacts involved in its manufacturing  process, from assembly to the delivery of equipment to clients.  It also runs annual continuous improvement programs. (See  more details below.) We also prioritize fair relationships in the value chain and we  promote a sustainable productivity environment. Likewise, we  make business decisions in a responsible way, with the aim of  protecting our brand, culture and values in the long term. To provide a perspective, we bear in mind that our products  and services also enable the sustainable development of our  chain of clients. Examples of this impact can be seen in the use  of agricultural management, logistics routing and industrial  optimization software. This does not only allow our clients  to simplify their business processes and lower their costs, but  also cuts waste and spending on inputs across the planet. NATURAL CAPITAL ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND  DIFFUSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY  TECHNOLOGIES.  73 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 DIGITAL AGRICULTURE The conservatism of past decades has given way to the growing  presence of technology in the field, through the widespread  use of smartphones and tablets, as well as other technologies  such as the IoT, automation and artificial intelligence. From  planning and crop growing to harvest and delivery, there is a  series of opportunities for efficiency gains, optimized use of  resources, improved productivity and sustainable development. PAPERLESS TECHNOLOGIES With an eye on demand for effective communication with cus- tomers, adherence with compliance rules and cost reduction,  health insurers are looking for new solutions. The TOTVS Health  Guide is an example of a multiplatform tool that helps health  insurance customers to find medical service providers, book  consultations, send messages, and see statements and other  records, as well as many other functionalities. SUSTAINABLE LOGISTICS It is estimated that logistics activities account for around 10%  of worldwide energy consumption, and even more in countries  that rely heavily on road transportation, such as Brazil. To make  its operations more efficient, cut costs and make progress in  terms of social and environmental responsibility, TOTVS offers  the sectors companies new technologies to optimize routes,  the number of trips and distances traveled, enabling lower fuel  consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. RESPONSIBLE TECHNOLOGIES We spread technologies that do not harm the environment and  that contribute to the socially and environmentally responsible  management of our clients operations in sectors such as agri- business, manufacturing, health and retail. ENERGY EFFICIENCY Automation, management and intelligent management pro- jects can reduce manufacturers energy consumption, improve  their profitability and help them to comply with environmental  requirements. In addition, automation is part of a set of tech- nologies that can increase productivity, reduce costs and  speed up production chains, generating positive effects in the  economy. NATURAL CAPITAL  74 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 In 2017, we recorded an increase in our energy consumption,  particularly due to the move to our new head office, which  raised our employment capacity to 3,500, more than double the  1,500 capacity of our previous head office. Thus, we concentrated  all our operations in So Paulo at a single address. On the other  hand, our new infrastructure favors energy savings, as the  building was designed to facilitate the entry of sunlight and  natural ventilation, it has solar panels on its facade, and it  contains efficient VRF air conditioning systems.

A supply contract  for the new head office was taken out in the unregulated power market. FOCUS ON CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT GRI 417-1 When it comes to the environment, Bematech is a special chap- ter in TOTVS journey. Besides developing solutions mainly de- signed to boost the digital journey of micro and smaller entre- preneurs – important protagonists in our story – the company  has the TOTVS groups only manufacturing operation. NATURAL CAPITAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION AT OUR SITES Considering financial, social and environmental dimensions,  as part of the concept of sustainability, Bematech has been  investing more strongly in staff training for at least six years,  to empower its teams, which have become multipliers and  implementers of best practices. During each new annual cycle, around 30 projects are de- veloped using the Kaizen methodology. Kaizen is a Japanese  word meaning change for better or continuous improvement.  Kaizens are carried out internally, focusing on activities or  processes that present opportunities for improvement. For  example, significant improvements have been made to key  production indicators, cutting costs by eliminating waste worth  approximately R$3 million since this initiative was adopted. Other projects are designed to involve and benefit the com- munity surrounding Bematech, from the design of training and  income generation programs for homemakers to the involvement  of employees as volunteers in renovating a rest home. Also  from the social perspective, the company has provided more  training for the inmates of Piraquara Womens Prison in Paran,  where the company has a component assembly line. In 2017, training and improvement projects were also extended  to other units, besides the hardware plant, involving teams of  employees in the cities of Curitiba (Paran) and So Paulo. 74 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7  75 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 CONSUMPTION OF MATERIALS   AND WASTE MANAGEMENT The materials used to produce Bematech equipment include  plastic, mechanical, electronic and cabling components. These  items are largely made up of materials from non-renewable  sources, such as plastic, ferrous and/or non-ferrous metals (steel,  aluminum and iron, among others), heavy metals (copper, silver,  gold and nickel) and conducting metals (aluminum and copper).  Product packaging is made of cardboard, which comes from a  renewable source.

The volume of waste sent to sanitary landfills has fallen con si- de rably in the last two years, due to better segregation of  materials, and so the percentage of materials recycled has  risen. Between 2015 and 2017, the amount of hazardous and  non-hazardous waste sent to landfills has fallen 88% and  69.15%, respectively. The recycling rate was 87% in 2017  (encompassing cardboard, plastic and electronic waste). In  addition, 12% of waste was classified as non-recyclable, and  1% was classified as hazardous waste. RESPONSIBILITY   GRI 417-1 FOR PRODUCTS Labeling information follows standards recommended for this  type of equipment. The manuals that accompany the products  made by Bematech (printers, computers, readers, authenticator  and transmitter systems, and accessories) contain information  on their safe use and proper method of disposal. The companys  goal in 2018 is to simplify its packaging so that the same model  can be used for several kinds of equipment. This will reduce  inventories and consumption of material (cardboard).

Initiated in the previous  reporting cycle, in 2017, the survey included  interviews with the companys executives and other  senior management, consultations with external  specialists, and an online poll of TOTVERS,   suppliers and clients. 77 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7  78 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 The process also included analysis of studies of national and  international trends , the sectors risks and impacts, and inter- nal strategic policies, commitments, research and documents.  Materiality is an important guiding principle for reporting and  strategic management of integrated business sustainability. It  helps to identify what is important for the company, to manage  critical points, and to establish targets and action plans. As a result of the listening and document analysis process, we  identified the topics of most relevance to the company and con- sulted stakeholders, through convergence between internal and  external visions, based on the described consultation sources.  The material topics – presented below – guided the content  included in this document, as well as the reported indicators. OUR MATERIAL TOPICS TOTVS is committed to steadily improving the materiality con- sultation process, to make it ever more consistent. As it evolves,  the process will incorporate new perspectives, through even  wider consultations with different stakeholders, about the future  of the business, its negative impacts and the capacity to gene- rate positive value for society, within its sphere of influence.  79 T O T V S  i n t e g r at e d  r e p o r t  2 0 1 7 TOTVS is the only Brazilian company that has its own language to develop its ERP systems. It is the leader in the country and Latin America as a whole, and it is an exception to   Brazils economic tradition of generating income through commodities. Through investments in research and new technologies, it generates prosperity and income, helping to boost   the domestic economy. It also trains technology sector professionals, who are valuable assets for society. By promoting technological innovations, the company also benefits the  development of solutions in areas such as the IoT, artificial intelligence and other innovations with social and environmental impacts, directly related to Brazils economic progress. Solutions based on science   and information technology;  creation and development   of Brazilian technologies  FIND OUT OUR MATERIAL TOPICS AND WHY THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO US Client loyalty and proximity has always been an important asset in TOTVS strategy. It has also paved the way for the companys new business model, focused   on services and subscriptions. TOTVS has a differentiated distribution model, involving franchises, ensuring a wider local presence and the capacity to be closer to clients.   This model is an important attribute of the companys and a pillar of its strategy for evolution. Relations with clients The recent economic crisis in Brazil and worldwide has significantly affected the financial performance of not just TOTVS, but many other companies.   Internally, difficulty in achieving individual and area targets during this period demonstrated the need to strengthen our focus on performance. This subject is part   of the transformation process the company is going through. Economic performance   and impacts of crisis TOTVS is reformulating its business model and changing its organizational culture, to adapt to the digital transformation under way in society, considering technological,   market, legal and behavioral aspects. This process has profoundly impacted the company and its relationships with its stakeholders.   Digital transformation   and new business models   Service quality is a key factor in TOTVS business model and its relations with its clients. This topic is related to the principle that our clients success is our success,   which has been widely promoted by the company. Quality of services   and products Data and information are some of TOTVS main operating assets and they involve its relations with its clients and internal stakeholders.   This topic demonstrates the importance of establishing control actions, policies and mechanisms. Security, client privacy and  information management  This type of stakeholder is very important to the companys strategy, as it has a direct impact on initiatives related to innovation and new technologies, for example.   This demonstrates the need to establish relationships without losing sight of governance and compliance aspects. Relations with government   This reflects the process the company is going through, including the change in organizational culture, and the impacts of acquisitions and the integration of new cultures.  Business restructuring  Relations with different stakeholders are based on transparency criteria. TOTVS is recognized for this, and this company value affects its stakeholders   engagement and loyalty.

However, value is not only  generated by the organization or within it. It is also  influenced by the external environment, it is created  through relations with stakeholders, and it is   linked to the resources available to the company  and its environment.

Throughout our report, we convey the concepts behind each of  these kinds of capital. The methodology for defining indicators will follow the com- panys evolution in tackling the challenges presented by the  Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Integrated Report of the  International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). In this edition, we adopted the new version of standards, in line  with the GRI Rules: Essential Option. Replacing version G4 of the  sustainability indicators adopted in last years report, the new  standards require a new structure and format. The data contained in this publication refers to the period from  January 1 to December 31, 2017. However, our plan is for the  next edition published by the company to cover 2018 and 2019.  This report has not been submitted to external assurance. Our Integrated Report 2017 also shows the companys results  and progress in line with the 10 Principles of the United Nations  Global Compact, to which we have been a signatory since 2014.
