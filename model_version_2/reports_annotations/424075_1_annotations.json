We have a presence in over 15 countries and sell more than 60 products throughout the world. Our  clients expect high-quality products, innovative solutions, reliable delivery and an attractive cost- benefit ratio.

The main goal of this project is to save a lot of money from buying gas pumps for household  purposes , they will also save money when it comes to buying their needs from Organic fertilizers   Further, they can also sell what they dont use from organic fertilizers.   The biogas unit when installed gives about 2 SQm of biogas daily , which is equivalent of 2 to 3 gas  pump  monthly , price of one pump is EGP 50 to EGP 60. Each family average number is 6 persons ,  some are extended  families  of 12 members.   The unit also give 3 SQM of Organic Fertilizers in liquid per month, which gives daily 100 Liter . Price  per 100 liter Is EGP 60 if the farmer wishes to sell it . so the unit will also generate income and save  the environment.  The Organic fertilizers will also be used in the farmers field and replace the use of chemical  fertilizers.  The amount of fertilizers coming from each unit is enough to cover the fertilization of 2.5 Feddan per  year, ( each feddan is equivalent to 4200m).    The benefits of this project will be marvellous on the life of people at all levels , and to the  environment.

It is important to  mention that we have chosen this area because most raw materials of our industry come from this  governorate.  The village has 10,000 inhabitants from which 50% lives in very bad conditions:   No concrete roads   Poor living conditions  Unhygienic atmosphere    The houses of the village had the following problems:   No or poor roofing  Instable walls  Absence of drainage system    Roofing    Most of the houses of the village are having straw or wooden roofs. Most roofs of the houses are made  from straw which could not protect the inhabitants of the houses from cold weather and other bad  weather conditions such as rains. That is why the majority of the people living in those houses suffer  from rheumatism and joint pains caused by humidity. Consequently, these disabled people are not  able to work and generate income. In the next pictures we can notice the condition of the roofs of the  houses made from straw and wood.    Our company decided to intervene and provide proper roofing for the houses of the village. Our  intervention was with the collaboration of a local NGO Al Tanmeya Al Mostadema NGO. Improving  the housing condition can help the inhabitants of the village develop themselves and live a healthy  atmosphere. With the help of the NGO working in the \"Haraga\" village, Hashem Brothers has  succeeded to build a number of ten homes.               65      \"Supporting Local NGOs programs in providing basic needs of the local community\" (SDG  goal# 2)    Case 1:    Hashem Brothers collaborates with the Meshwar NGO in providing food for the extremely poor  families in Giza.
