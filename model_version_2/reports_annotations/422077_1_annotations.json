      "June 2018                  1  Unilever Global Compact Advanced COP   2018 Self-Assessment     Implementing the Ten Principles into Strategies & Operations   GC Scope or  Principle   Criteria for GC  Advanced Level  Unilever Approach  Where To Find  Out More  Reference  to GRI  Indicators  Scope:  Implementing  the Ten  Principles into  Strategies &  Operations  Criterion 1: The  COP describes  mainstreaming  into corporate  functions and  business units.   Our commitment to responsible business is embedded into our business  agenda through our purpose and vision, articulated in our Code of  Business Principles and carried out through the Unilever Sustainable  Living Plan (USLP), which is our blueprint for sustainable growth.  Our Code of Business Principles are mandatory for all employees and  others working for Unilever, including our board of directors, and apply to  all Unilever companies, subsidiaries and organisations over which  Unilever has management control.  We are integrating sustainability into our brands and innovation to help  drive business growth.  To assess product and purpose, we developed a methodology to help us  determine how, and to what extent, each brand delivers against the two  criteria. These are called our Sustainable Living Brands. 26 of our top 40  brands are now Sustainable Living brands. It enables brands to generate a  systematic view of their progress across social and environmental factors.  In 2017, we analysed our top brands using this methodology. Our analysis  Our strategy  Our vision  Our sustainability  governance  Embedding  sustainability  Code of Business  Principles  Advancing human  rights in our own  operations  Advancing human  rights with  G4-1   G4-2   June 2018                  2  revealed that in 2017 our Sustainable Living brands delivered more than  70% of Unilevers turnover growth.   We believe that if we want to effect change at scale, we will achieve this  by making large, successful, category-defining brands recognisably  sustainable. Our five biggest brands, namely Dove, Dirt is Good, Knorr,  Hellmanns and Lipton, are all Sustainable Living brands  We are working with our customers, and suppliers, engaging employees  and forging new partnerships. We have developed a simple four-point  framework to help capture the ways in which sustainability contributes to  our business success – more growth, lower cost, less risk, more trust.   Our USLP Steering Team (USLP ST) includes nine of our 13 Unilever  Leadership Executive (ULE) members, including our Chief Marketing &  Communications Officer (chair); Chief R&D Officer; Chief Supply Chain  Officer; and three Divisional Presidents, and is responsible for approving  new USLP targets and monitoring progress. The Boards Corporate  Responsibility Committee (CRC) monitors USLP progress as one of its  allocated focus risks. The USLP ST and CRC benefit from the insights of  the USLP Council – a group of external specialists who guide and critique  our sustainability strategy. In 2017, we reviewed the strategy for our  USLP Council and relaunched the Council with six new members in 2018.   The USLP spans our entire portfolio of brands, all countries in which we  sell our products and applies across our whole value chain – from the  sourcing of raw materials to our factories and the way consumers use our  products. To embed sustainability into every stage of the life cycle of our  products, were working with our suppliers to support responsible  approaches to sourcing raw materials.   suppliers &  business partners  Responsible  Sourcing Policy  Responsible  Business Partner  Policy        Criterion 2: The  COP describes  value chain  implementation.  We believe that as a business we have a responsibility to our consumers  and to the communities in which we have a presence. Around the world,  we invest in local economies and develop peoples skills inside and  outside of Unilever. Through our business and brands, we run a range of  programmes and use our scale, influence and resources to make a real  difference to issues such as taking action on climate change and halting  Sustainable Living  Report 2017     June 2018                  3  deforestation, creating more opportunities for women and enhancing  livelihoods, promoting health & well-being, championing sustainable  agriculture and improving food security. Our Responsible Sourcing Policy  (RSP) and our Responsible Business Partner Policy (RBPP) both updated in  2017 embody our commitment to conduct business with integrity,  openness, and respect for universal human rights and core labour  principles advocating a beyond compliance approach to both our supply  and distribution channels.

Principle 2:  Businesses  should make  sure that they  are not  complicit  Criterion 3: The  COP describes  robust  commitments,  strategies or  policies in the  area of human  rights.  In line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  (2011), we base our human rights commitment and policy on the  International Bill of Human Rights (consisting, in addition to the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights, of the International Covenant on Civil and  Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and  Cultural Rights) and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in  the International Labour Organizations Declaration on Fundamental  Principles and Rights at Work. We also support the OECD Guidelines for  Multinational Enterprises. Our approach is to uphold and promote human  rights in three ways:    In our operations by upholding our values and standards.    In our relationships with our suppliers and other business  partners.    By working through external initiatives, such as the UN Global  Compact   A key requirement of the UN Guiding Principles is for businesses to have a  policy statement that addresses their responsibility to respect human  Human Rights  Report 2015  Human Rights  Progress Report  2017  Unilever Human  Rights Policy  Statement  Advancing human  rights in our own  operations    G4-HR3  G4-HR4  G4-HR11   June 2018                  4  inhuman rights  abuses  rights. Our Human Rights Policy Statement provides clarity on our  commitment to respect universal principles, our due diligence processes  and our governance.  We were the first company to adopt and use the UN Guiding Principles  Reporting Framework to produce a comprehensive, standalone Human  Rights report, published in June 2015, fulfilling our commitment to report  publicly on our implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business  and Human Rights.In the report we focus on our salient human rights  issues - that is, those that are at risk of the most severe negative impacts  through our activities or business relationships. This approach is in line  with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We  describe our progress in our second Human Rights Report, published in  December 2017.   We are committed to ensuring that all our employees work in an  environment that promotes diversity, trust, human rights and equal  opportunities, and is free from discrimination or victimisation. Our  Respect, Dignity and Fair Treatment Code Policy sets out what we and our  employees must do to ensure this, and forms part of the framework of  policies supporting our Code of Business Principles.

We will only work with suppliers who  implement our Responsible Sourcing Policy. They must agree to ensure  transparency, to remedy any shortcomings, and to drive continuous  improvement. We continue to build the awareness and knowledge of our  employees and workers on human rights, including labour rights,  encouraging them to speak up, without retribution, about any concerns  they may have, including through our grievance channels. We are  committed to continue increasing the capacity of our management to  effectively identify and respond to concerns.     June 2018                  5    Criterion 5: The  COP describes  effective  monitoring and  evaluation  mechanisms of  human rights  integration.  We recognise that we must take steps to identify and address any actual  or potential adverse impacts with which we may be involved whether  directly or indirectly through our own activities or our business  relationships including with our non-supplier business partners who must  align with our Responsible Business Partner Policy. We manage these risks  by integrating the responses to our due diligence into our policies and  internal systems, acting on the findings, tracking our actions, and  communicating with our stakeholders about how we address impacts. We  undertake impact assessments for high risk  commodities/countries/interactions and take proactive steps to identify  activities that may contribute to negative human rights impacts.   In 2017, we rolled out an internal training programme on forced labour to  raise awareness and build capacity. We also co-sponsored three industry  supplier training events in Dubai, India and Malaysia.   Our UK Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement 2018 gives specific  information relating to our work to eradicate forced labour from global  supply chains. Recognising temporary workers as potentially vulnerable to  poor working conditions, we carried out a survey to monitor the numbers,  roles and terms and conditions of temporary workers in our operations.  The realisation of the right to Freedom of Association in addition to the  provision of grievance mechanisms in line with the UN Guiding Principles  on Business and Human Rights is vital to effectively evaluate our progress.  We created internal guidance in 2017 relating to Human Rights elements  of Mergers and Acquisitions. For more information of how we are both  integrating human rights principles and monitoring this work see both our  Human Rights Report and our work on understanding our human rights  impacts (links in next column).

Principle 4: The  elimination of  all forms of  forced and  compulsory  labour.    Principle 5: The  effective  abolition of  child labour.    Criterion 6:  The COP  describes  robust  commitments,  strategies or  policies in the  area of labour   We prohibit discrimination and we are committed to safe and healthy  working conditions, the right to freedom of association and collective  bargaining, and to effective information and consultation procedures. We  expect our partners to adhere to business principles consistent with our  own, and implement this through our Responsible Sourcing Policy and  Responsible Business Partner Policy.  Our Respect, Dignity & Fair Treatment Code Policy sets out our commitment  to human rights within our own operations, specifically our commitment to  ensuring a working environment that promotes diversity, where there is  mutual trust, respect for human rights and equal opportunity, and no  unlawful discrimination or victimisation.  Our Code of Business Principles states that We will not use any form of  forced, compulsory, trafficked or child labour. Our internal Social Impact  Hub gives guidance on issues including child, migrant and contract labour  and the eradication of forced labour including modern day slavery.  During 2015 we worked with the Fair Wage Network to develop a  Framework for Fair Compensation. The Framework outlines how the various  existing elements of our compensation packages deliver fair compensation  to our employees and is supported by a methodology to monitor our  employees rewards against relevant Living Wage benchmarks.   This work enabled us to set a target to achieve full Living Wage compliance  for all our 169,000 direct employees by 2020. In 2017 we brought our  ambition forward to end 2018. We have a longstanding commitment to  equal pay for equal work, which forms another principle of our Fair  Compensation Framework.

Our dialogue with suppliers and business partners is critical, where they feel  able actively to raise issues so that we can work together to share best  practices and respond to challenges as they emerge. For example, to keep  the lines of communication open, our procurement managers work directly  with suppliers to help identify risks and remediate gaps in policies and  practices.   We regularly engage with expert organisations such as Shift and the Institute  for Human Rights and Business, and with trade unions and civil society  organisations, such as Oxfam, on human rights including labour rights. We  support the Childrens Rights and Business Principles developed by UNICEF,  Save the Children and the UN Global Compact. We are members of industry  organisations such as the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), Aim Progress and  the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, where we use our  membership to work with other businesses to scale up solutions to human  rights issues. Unilever is a member of the Institute for Human Rights and  Business Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment where we are  committed to the Employers Pays Principle – that no worker should pay for a  job and we were instrumental in the CGF resolution on forced labour and  subsequent Three Priority Industry Principles.   We have signed a partnership agreement with non-profit organisation  Solidaridad to work with our suppliers on issues such as gender equity and  improving labour practices. Marcela Manubens, Unilevers Global Vice- President for Integrated Social Sustainability serves on the World Economic  Forums Global Future Council on Human Rights and a member of the  Advisory Group on Human Rights to the UK Foreign Secretary. Marcela  Manubens team sits within the Supply Chain function to enable us to  comprehensively implement and embed our human rights approach.   We have relationships with trade unions both at the local and global level.  We have established a global forum with the International Union of Food  workers (IUF) and IndustriALL on labour rights to identify, discuss and  Promoting safety for  women  Working with others on  human rights  Responsible Business  Partner Policy  Fairness in the  Workplace                                   June 2018                  8  address issues and geographies of concern. We meet twice a year and have  specific working groups on Diversity and Sustainable Employment in  between.                Links as per above in  Criterion 6                              Criterion 7:  The COP  describes  effective  management  systems to  integrate the  labour  principles  We have sought to align and expand our internal policy framework with the  UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which has facilitated  their integration into pre-existing policies and codes. These in turn drive our  internal and external compliance requirements.  For example, we strengthened our Code of Business Principles in 2016. Our  approach focused on the role every individual plays in living our values.   Some examples of questions asked during the 2017 Integrity Pledge week  were: How do you Protect What You Love? What do you feel the need to  Protect? What inspires you to work for a company with strong values and a  clear purpose? How does Business Integrity come to life in your local team or  area?  The campaign included insights and images from Paul Polman, our CEO, and  other senior leaders who encouraged employees to refresh their  understanding and renew their commitment to our policies, have open  conversations and speak up across the business. Over 55,000 employees  have taken part and signed our online Pledge to uphold the principles  embedded within our Code of Business Principles.  We have also strengthened our internal Respect, Dignity and Fair Treatment  Code Policy. In 2015 we developed a Responsible Business Partner Policy to  align with our Responsible Sourcing Policy, which we launched in April 2014  and both were enhanced and updated in 2017.  Effective grievance mechanisms, as described in the UN Guiding Principles,  are critical in ensuring that human rights, including labour rights, are  respected. We have developed a single integrated channel to ensure that  our employees can raise grievances, issues and concerns as simply as   June 2018                  9  possible. We have also further developed and strengthened our tools to  analyse and resolve the grievances and breaches we receive.          Externally available:   Whistleblowing  reporting site        Criterion 8:  The COP  describes  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanisms  of labour  principles  integration  Since 2012, we provide a web-based reporting process for both employees  and suppliers, in addition to existing telephone and email reporting systems.  Employees can also report concerns to their line manager, local Business  Integrity Officer or a member of their local Business Integrity Committee.  Alternatively, they can use our confidential external Unilever Code Support  Line (whistleblowing line) via telephone or internet. Business Integrity  training and communications materials provide details of available options.  All reported breaches of the Code of Business Principles are monitored and  dealt with by our local business leaders at country level.  We continue to align our own factories with our Responsible Sourcing Policy,  using independent, external on-site audits determined from a risk-based  perspective. This ensures that all internal sourcing units are held to the same  standard as external suppliers.  We are seeking to improve our analytical capabilities to make sure any  internal trends, hot spots and root causes are rapidly identified and  remediated through the introduction of appropriate controls.  We are committed to transparency, acknowledging that many challenges  remain which must be resolved. In the Salient Issues section of our Human  Rights report, we discuss the complexities present in both our operations  and our extended supply chain. We have continued to expand our  Framework for Womens Safety and created global Land Rights Principles  and Implementation Guidance which we will use to monitor our work to  address potential human rights issues. Our 2017 Human Rights Progress  Report shows our progress against each of our salient human rights issues in  both our own operations and extended supply chain and the actions we are  taking to remedy any issues.

Principle 9:  Businesses  should  encourage the  development  and diffusion of  environmentally  Criterion 9:  The COP  describes  robust  commitments,  strategies or  policies in the  area of  environmental  stewardship                     Our Code of Business Principles states that we are committed to making  continuous improvements in the management of our environmental impact  and to the longer-term goal of developing a sustainable business.  Furthermore, our Code states we will work in partnership with others to  promote environmental care, increase understanding of environmental  issues and disseminate good practice.  Our approach has five aspects, which aim to affect change within our own  operations and beyond:  1. Working to eliminate deforestation  2. Championing sustainable agriculture and the development of  smallholder farmers  3. Leveraging our brands and innovation to help consumers live well -  by using less water, less energy and recycling more  4. Shaping our manufacturing and distribution operations to be more  eco-efficient  5. Advocating for ambitious public policy to tackle climate change.  By 2030 our goal is to halve the environmental footprint of the making and  use of our products as we grow our business. This covers our entire value  chain, from the sourcing of our raw materials and our own manufacturing,  through to consumer use and disposal.   In 2015 we set an ambition to become carbon positive in our operations by  2030 which includes sourcing 100% of our energy across our operations from  renewable sources. We have committed to ensure all our plastic packaging is  designed to be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. In January  2017, we committed to ensuring that 100% of our plastic packaging will be  reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.

Our longstanding aim has been to develop a closed  loop system; One that would allow us to continue to provide the price and  convenience of sachets to consumers while tackling the environmental  issues associated with their use. We have had a major breakthrough in this  regard. We have launched a new technology to recycle sachet waste. We  have developed this technology, called CreaSolv Process, with the  Fraunhofer Institute for Process Engineering and Packaging IVV in Germany.  We are founding members of the CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project)  Supply Chain Leadership Collaboration. CDP aims to increase companies  disclosure of their GHG management plans and impacts, and to encourage  them to put reduction plans in place. CDPs supplier programme has a global  reach and involves businesses collaborating through their supply chains.  We are part of the Natural Capital Coalition and we working to advance work  in this area, through the WBCSD and Natural Capital Project amongst others.   We are promoting the involvement of suppliers of both agricultural and non- agricultural based raw materials in the CDP programme. This represents a  global standard approach for disclosure of GHG management plans and  performance. We believe that involvement in the CDP programme is of  intrinsic value to our suppliers and we encourage their participation.  Independent Assurance  PwC's Independent  Limited Assurance  Report 2017  Unilever Basis of  Preparation 2017  Protecting our forests  Global climate action  The New Climate  Economy: Global Report           Responsible Business  Partner Policy              Criterion 10:  The COP  describes  effective  management  systems to  integrate the  environmental  principles      Our environmental management system (EMS) underpins our environment  strategy. All Unilever companies must comply with the Unilever standards  for occupational safety and health and environmental care (SHE), as well as  our Consumer Safety Policy. They must comply in a manner that also  recognises, and is consistent with, local legislation.  Lifecycle assessment (LCA) is one of a number of techniques we use to help  us understand the impacts of our products on the environment. We conduct  LCAs on our existing products and ingredients to help identify improvement  opportunities, to improve data quality and relevance to our studies.            June 2018                  12  Our environmental management systems are designed to achieve  continuous improvement. They are based on, and compatible with ISO  14001.  We require all suppliers to comply with our Responsible Sourcing Policy,  which requires suppliers to conduct their business in a manner which  embraces sustainability and reduces environmental impact. Our mandatory  requirement is that suppliers are environmentally compliant with all  necessary legal permits, but the policy expects them to proceed towards  best practice. We are willing to apply more stringent criteria than those  required by law when we believe this to be appropriate.  Within our own operations, our approach is to deliver tools, techniques and  awareness, and share best practice directly with those people responsible  for reducing the environmental impact of our manufacturing operations.  Much of our progress has been achieved through good manufacturing  practices at our factories. We continue to promote this through an  environmental roadmap that includes an awareness-raising programme  called Simple Solutions.   Our successful eco-efficiency projects are known as Proud Practices. These  evolved from our Smarter Greener Living campaign, which began in 2013,  and aim to involve as many people in our factories as we can in improving  our eco-efficiency. We found that a practice from one factory can – in many  cases – be easily replicated elsewhere. This helps to speed up the delivery of  environmental benefits and provides inspiration to generate new ideas,  helping us to reduce our environmental impact.  Many of our employees have sustainable business ideas. Factory teams can  apply for investment for these via our Small Actions Big Difference fund.  Ideas are evaluated on the basis of environmental benefit and financial  return. In 2017, we invested 43 million in energy, CO2 and water projects.    June 2018                  13  Criterion 11:  The COP  describes  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanisms  for  environmental  stewardship   We use a number of metrics to assess our environmental impacts across the  value chain covering: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water, waste and  sustainable sourcing.   Eco-efficiency data is used to track performance, set targets and identify the  best opportunities to drive reductions in each of our key indicators.  Many of our manufacturing sites also make use of real-time eco-efficiency  data. This is collected through automated systems – known as  measurement, monitoring and targeting (MM&T) systems. This helps our  manufacturing sites to better track their performance and identify reduction  opportunities.  Environmental auditing programmes have been implemented within each  region to help sites achieve continuous improvement in environmental  performance.  At least once a year, all operating units conduct a review of their  environmental business risks and their compliance with corporate policies.  They also conduct a continuous self-assessment of their operating controls.  These exercises are summarised in a Positive Assurance letter that is sent to  our Corporate Risk Committee each year.  Our environmental policy requires that we audit our compliance with  legislation and Unilever Standards and investigate all environmental safety  incidents in order to prevent recurrence  A selection of our environmental metrics is independently assured by PwC.   June 2018                  14   Anti-Corruption Management Policies & Procedures   Principle 10:  Businesses  should work  against  corruption in all  its forms,  including  extortion and  bribery.  Criterion 12:  The COP  describes  robust  commitments,  strategies or  policies in the  area of anti- corruption   Unilever has a zero-tolerance approach to bribery in any form: it is  committed to being a no-bribe business and eradicating any practices or  behaviours in this regard. This zero-tolerance policy extends to Unilever  employees, contractors, third parties, new acquisitions and joint-ventures,  through which or with whom we do business, irrespective of financial values  involved. We operate with a broad definition of corruption which includes  fraud and financial misrepresentation, conflicts of interest, bribery, anti-trust  activity, misuse of information and misrepresentation of the company or its  assets.   Our core values - Integrity, Responsibility, Respect & Pioneering - are  enshrined in our longstanding Code of Business Principles (CoBP) and 24  Code Policies.  These also underpin the Unilever Sustainable Living Plans 3  Big Goals: Improving Health & Well-being, Reducing Environmental Impact &  Enhancing Livelihoods. Our CoBP & Code Policies define minimum  mandatory standards of behaviour for Board directors and employees  globally, including JVs where we have management control. They go  significantly beyond complying with laws and regulations. The Code Policies  were refreshed and relaunched in 2016 and are published both externally  and internally. Specific Code Policies Address Countering Corruption,  Discrimination, Confidentiality of Information, Antitrust, Money Laundering,  Insider Trading and Environment, Health and Safety. The Code Policies are  also distilled into a Winning with Integrity booklet for non-managers,  translated into multiple languages.   Countering corruption continues to be a focus area in 2018 and we continue  to deploy mandated interactive training capsules across the business to all  employees such as Gifts and Hospitality, Conflicts of Interest and Anti-Money  Laundering.  Any suspected CoBP breach is subject to an accelerated review procedure  that involves subject-matter experts (SMEs) from Legal Group to ensure  compliance with the UK Bribery Act and US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

Unilever are committed to working with others who share our values and  seek to operate to the same standards as we do. Both our suppliers and  distributors are prohibited through mandatory compliance with our  Responsible Sourcing Policy and Responsible Business Partner Policy from all  forms of bribery, corruption, extortion or embezzlement and there are  adequate procedures in place to prevent bribery in all commercial dealings  undertaken by a Business Partner.  Criterion 13:  The COP  describes  effective  management  systems to  integrate the  anti- corruption  principle   Unilever is a founding signatory of the United Nations Global Compact  (UNGC): as a Board member (and incoming Vice-Chair) CEO Paul Polman  actively helps drive global efforts to combat bribery. Realising UNGC  Principle 10 (regarding corruption in all its forms) is a core focus for us. To  foster dialogue on best practices, Business Integrity representatives are  active in key external platforms, notably as successive 2017 and 2018 co- chairs in the Responsible Business Conduct and Anti-Bribery Taskforces of  the B20. The Chief Business Integrity Officer (CBIO) established and chairs a  new Chief Compliance Officer peer group for European multinationals.  Unilever also takes part in the Business Integrity Network of Transparency  International UK and regularly contributes to policy updates such as the  recent update of their Adequate Procedures guidance for business. UL are a  member of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Partnering Against Corruption  Initiative (PACI) and the new platform created by the Bingham Centre for the  Rule of Law to further contribute to collective business efforts to fight  corruption in all its forms.   Our CoBP framework is built on the pillars of Prevent – Detect – Respond  to ensure we have a continuous ability to develop our compliance  programme based on learnings (e.g. from CoBP cases, self-assessments and  audits). We also actively monitor regulatory developments and participate in  conferences to share, learn and adopt best practices.   The Chief Legal Officer (CLO) is responsible for the strategy implementation  of the full compliance programme. She is supported by a CBIO who was      June 2018                  16  included in the Ethisphere 2016 Attorneys Who Matter list. The CBIOs team  is part of Unilevers legal function, giving Unilever dedicated expert resource  to embed a compliance culture and make Unilever more agile in identifying  & mitigating compliance risks. The BI organisation features 5 dedicated  experienced regional BI Directors who oversee BI work in North America,  Latin America, Europe, Asia & Russia/Africa/Middle East: reporting to the  CBIO, they are supported by a BI Officer for each country, including  dedicated team members in geographic hot spots to drive operational  excellence.    The CLO chairs the Unilever Global Code & Policy Committee (GCPC), which  oversees compliance globally including related policies & standards, and  reports to the UL Leadership Executive (ULE) to the Audit & Corporate  Responsibility Committees of the Board of Directors. We have a global  process for speaking up about actual or potential CoBP breaches. Employees  are encouraged to raise CoBP breaches via internal channels: line manager,  local BI Officer, member of the local BI Committee or email directly to the  ULE. SMEs or Legal business partners may also be informed of concerns.  To foster dialogue on best practices in ABC, Unilever partners with external  organisations on intercompany benchmarking exercises. We actively  participate in IBE, DJSI and TI exercises and recently were ranked second  across the entire TI submission.    We are also actively engaging with AIM Progress to drive collective action.   We partner with Maplecroft for detailed indices of compliance risk by  country and we have historically partnered with PwC to review our third- party compliance programme for external validation and recommendations  to build into our 2017-2020 Roadmap. Further, Unilevers risk assessment  methodology builds on UN Global Compact, OECD, Transparency  International and external advisor PwCs best practice.  Criterion 14:  The COP  describes  We have a global process for reporting actual or potential CoBP breaches.  Employees are encouraged to report CoBP breaches via internal channels:  line manager, local Business Integrity Officer, member of the local Business   June 2018                  17  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanisms  for the  integration of  anti- corruption  Integrity Committee or email directly to the Unilever Executive. SMEs or  Legal business partners may also be informed of concerns.  UL provides external channels for employees and third parties to  confidentially log concerns through a dedicated web portal or 24-hour toll- free hotline. A dedicated helpdesk covers questions about CoBP compliance  so issues can be discussed to pre-emptively find solutions that avoid  breaches.  Potential CoBP and Code Policies breaches are monitored by country-based  senior management, supported by the local Business Integrity Officer with  oversight from five dedicated and experienced regional Legal Directors who  report to the CBIO. Breaches are tackled through to a local Business Integrity  Committee unless senior executives are involved (in which case the CLO and  CBIO are personally involved). Reportable breaches are escalated to the  GCPC as well as to the Unilever Leadership Executive & the Audit and  Corporate Responsibility Committees of the Board. They see a quarterly  review of case analytics and reportable Code breaches by country.   In 2017, BI closed a total of 1,654 incidents with 709 confirmed breaches  across all areas of our CoBP, including Countering Corruption. In 2017 we  issued 284 written warnings (36 with a downgrade in individual performance  rating), initiated legal action in 3 cases and dismissed 279 employees. We  disclose this information publicly. The number of issues raised per 1,000  employee and substantiation rates benchmark well against industry average,  pointing to ongoing employee willingness to report concerns.          June 2018                  18   Taking Action in Support of Broader UN Goals and Issues   Scope: Taking  Action in  Support of  Broader UN  Goals and  Issues  Criterion 15:  The COP  describes core  business  contributions  to UN goals  and issues     Criterion 16:  The COP  describes  strategic  social  investments  and  philanthropy     Criterion 17:  The COP  describes  advocacy and  public policy  engagement     Criterion 18:  The COP  describes  partnerships  We are signatories to Business for Peace, a platform of over 130 leading  companies from 37 countries dedicated to catalysing collaborative action to  advance peace. Companies who join Business for Peace commit to paying  heightened attention to the implementation of the UN Global Compact Ten  Principles in high-risk and conflict-affected areas, take action to advance  peace, either individually or in collaboration with others, and annually  communicate on our progress.  We are a founding signatory to the UN Global Compact (UNGC). This sets out  commitments for business in relation to human rights, labour, the  environment and anti-corruption. We have pledged to uphold these  principles across our business. Our CEO Paul Polman is the incoming Vice  Chair of the UNGC and a long-standing member of the Board. We are active  participants in the Action Platforms.   In January 2016 Paul Polman helped co-create the Business and Sustainable  Development Commission (Business Commission). The Commission brings  together international leaders from business, labour, financial institutions  and civil society to show how mainstreaming development can spark  unprecedented business opportunities. In January 2017, the Business  Commission published its flagship report Better Business, Better World,  which identified 60 hot spot with a potential to create $12 trillion of value  every year by 2030, if we aligned business opportunities with the SDGs. The  BSDC has now closed its doors, but Unilever continues to be an active  member of the resulting initiative on Blended Finance, Food and Land Use  and the World Benchmarking Alliance.   In addition, Paul Polman was a member of the UN High Level Panel on the  Post-2015 agenda, for which we organised an extensive private sector  outreach on the SDGs in 2013, engaging directly with over 300 businesses of  all sizes, sectors and markets - with combined revenues representing over  10% of global GDP.

In January 2016, Paul Polman was invited by the then-UNSG Ban Ki-Moon to  join the UN Secretary-Generals SDG Advocacy Group. Mr Polman is one of  two business voices on the Group.   We are members of UNGCs Human Rights Working Group, Business for the  Rule of Law Committee, CEO Water Mandate and Caring for Climate  Initiative. We are also members of 16 UNGC local networks in a number of  countries including the Netherlands, Vietnam, Zambia, Romania, South  Africa, Turkey, Myanmar, Mozambique, Ghana, Chile, Indonesia, Sri Lanka,  Singapore, Argentina, Colombia, Kenya and the UK. We are actively  increasing our membership of UNGC local networks.  In July 2013, we endorsed the Womens Empowerment Principles, a  collaboration between UNGC and UN Women. We are implementing these  across our business, as well as taking steps to increase womens rights and  economic inclusion in our supply chain. We have also given our support  to UNGCs Business for Peace Platform and the Food and Agriculture  Principles.  Unilever partner with global organisations Oxfam, Save the Children, PSI,  World Food Programme and UNICEF to help reach our ambitious goal of  helping 1 billion improve their health and well-being. In addition to our focus  on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), we are also investing in  livelihoods, sustainable sourcing and womens empowerment. Our partners  in these areas include: Acumen, Clinton Giustra Enterprise, the Ford  Foundation, and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN).   In supporting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we worked  with a diverse range of organisations to campaign for a holistic water goal  (SDG6), including measurement of handwashing with soap facilities. We  helped establish the WASH4Work coalition, which aims to mobilise greater  business action to address water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) challenges  in the workplace, in communities where workers live and across supply  chains. We are now looking to support countries in implementing SDG6, with   June 2018                  20  a particular focus on promoting behaviour change as a means of realising the  benefits of improved facilities.  We believe that Unilever should play an active role in shaping legislation and  regulations that enhance positive social and environmental outcomes. We  have an advocacy team that works together with other stakeholders to bring  about changes in public policy in key areas of health and sustainability.

The Boards Corporate Responsibility  Committee (CRC) monitors USLP progress as one of its allocated focus risks.   We have introduced The Unilever sustainable progress index, a long-term  incentive which helps to secure long-term value creation by decoupling our  growth from our environmental impact, while increasing our positive social  impact. To avoid over-focus on any one element of the USLP, the progress  index is an assessment made by the Boards Compensation Committee  taking into account progress towards the targets in our reported USLP  scorecard.   Criterion 21:  The COP  describes  stakeholder  engagement.  To succeed in our purpose of making sustainable living commonplace, we  need to engage and work in partnership with a wide range of stakeholders.  These include: investors; customers and consumers; suppliers; governments,  regulators and legislators; NGOs; civil society; and others in the business  environment, including peer companies.  We seek to understand the issues of concern to our stakeholders and to  respond openly and transparently to any questions raised about our     June 2018                  22  products and the way we run our business. We publish our responses to  some of these questions in the What Matters to You section of our online  Sustainable Living Report.  Both our USLP ST and CRC benefit from the insights of the USLP Council– a  group of external specialists in corporate responsibility and sustainability  who guide and critique the development of our sustainability strategy. The  USLP ST and CRC benefit from the insights of the USLP Council – a group of  external specialists who guide and critique our sustainability strategy. In  2018, the USLP Council will be refreshed with a new group of members.     The variety of our relationships means we engage in different ways,  depending on the nature of the interest, the relevance to the business and  the most practical way to meet stakeholders specific needs and  expectations.

The results of HRIAs enable us to adapt our  due diligence and sourcing decisions. We continue to monitor  working conditions or our tea plantations including ensuring that  any issues of harassment are addressed, focussing on the  prevention of incidents through increased education and  awareness, strengthening the management team, and improving  the grievance and reporting procedures. Progress is continually  monitored through monthly reviews with the VP of Tea  Procurement and Operations and bi-monthly meetings with the  Chief Procurement Officer.      In addition, we are working with UN Women to externally review  the measures we have implemented and to extend our Safety  Framework in Kenya and Assam, India. In countries with a  particularly high risk of forced labour, we are rolling out awareness  raising and capacity building for our employees and suppliers.
