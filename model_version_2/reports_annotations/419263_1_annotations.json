Foreword by the  Chief Executive Officer Reiner Winkler Chief Executive Officer   MTU Aero Engines AG For us, Clean Air is more than just a slogan. As we  shape the future of aviation, we see it as our core  responsibility to work with our partners to develop  and to bring fuel-efficient, low-emission, quiet engines  to market. We already brought you up to speed on  this and other select issues in our first non-financial  statement in the 2017 Annual Report. However, this  new legal reporting obligation is not the reason  sustainability is important to us. For years now, we  have been in dialog with our stakeholders and have  produced an annual sustainability report outlining  our far-reaching sustainability strategy and the pro- gress we have made with it. We plan to intensify  our efforts in this regard. Dear readers, 5 With our Clean Air Engine program, we  aim to play a key role in the sustainable  development of the environment and so- ciety in the years up through 2050. Our  objective is to cut CO2 emissions from air- craft engines by up to 40 percent, and their  noise emissions by as much as 65 percent.  And we are confident that we will succeed:  the new PW1000G Geared Turbofan en- gine family signals the start of our journey  towards an innovative and sustainable  future for aviation. It already reduces CO2  emissions by 16 percent, lowers noise by  40 percent, and has entered regular service  with some 20 customers. We achieved  important goals this financial year as we  drove our eco-efficient technology forward: further  engine designs for new aircraft models have  either been certified or flown for the first time.  And in keeping with our Clean Air Engine Agenda,  we have applied additional innovations to make  the geared turbofan even better. All this is quite  simply part and parcel of our responsibility as  Germanys leading engine manufacturer and  globally active partner.  With our Clean Air Industrial Site program, we  plan to lower CO2 emissions at our Munich  location by 25 percent. After all, we are tackling  the challenges of climate change and resource  scarcity not only in our product responsibility, but  along the entire value chain. Our manufacturing  facilities employ energy-efficient, low-emission  processes that we continuously strive to improve,  and with our state-of-the-art co-generation plant,  we are producing more of our own carbon-neutral  energy than ever before.  We also have our eye on the supply chain: Our man- datory social and environmental standards place  important sustainability demands on our suppliers.  Digitalization and technological transformation are  increasingly shaping working life at MTU, and so  we are also training our employees to be equipped  for their long-term effects. We secure the employ- ability of our workforce primarily through high- quality and comprehensive training, and create an  attractive and safe working environment based on  important social standards. We value a corporate  culture that promotes innovation. Clear and reliable  leadership plays a key role in this, as does diversity  and equal opportunity. After all, we rely on each  and every one of our 10,000 employees around the  world. Their ideas, their skills and their commitment  are the decisive foundation for our success. Thank you for your interest in our sustainability  activities and strategies. In this report, you will learn  what we have achieved on our path towards a  more sustainable world and what we have planned  for the future.  We hope you will join us on this journey!  About this report MTU Aero Engines AG  2017 Sustainability Report Reporting in accordance  with GRI MTU Aero Engines AG has compiled this sustain- ability report to inform its stakeholders about  corporate responsibility (CR) within the company.  The report provides information about the com- panys CR strategy, objectives and performance  and describes the priorities and progress for the  various spheres of CR activity in 2017. It builds  on the previous report and supplements our  first non-financial statement in the 2017 Annual  Report. The Sustainability Report is available on our  website for download as a PDF in both German  and English. >MTU Sustainability Report (German) >MTU Sustainability Report (English) Readers can address questions about the report  to corporateresponsibility@mtu.de Communication on Progress  for UN Global Compact This Sustainability Report also provides infor- mation on progress made in accordance with  the ten principles of the UN Global Compact.  Cross-references to those principles can be  found in the GRI Index at the end of the report.  Reporting period and scope  of validity The reporting period covers financial year 2017  (January 1 to December 31, 2017). To better  organize how information is presented and pro- vide explanatory context for readers, activities  from outside the reporting period are also cited  in some cases. The report covers all of the MTU  Group sites that are treated as fully consolidated  in the companys financial reporting. This includes:  MTU Aero Engines AG, Munich, Germany   (headquarters, OEM business)  MTU Maintenance Hannover, Germany   (MRO business)  MTU Maintenance Berlin-Brandenburg,   Ludwigsfelde, Germany (MRO business)  MTU Aero Engines Polska, Rzeszw, Poland   (OEM business)  MTU Maintenance Lease Services B.V.,   Amsterdam, Netherlands (MRO business)  MTU Maintenance Canada, Vancouver,   Canada (MRO business)  MTU Aero Engines North America, Rocky Hill,   USA (OEM business)  Vericor Power Systems, Alpharetta, USA   (OEM business) Overview of MTU sites: www.mtu.de The 2017 information and key performance  indicators in the report refer to the above group  reporting entity, if not otherwise indicated.  There were no significant year-on-year changes  in the companys supply chains in 2017. The 2017 Sustainability Report was drawn up in  compliance with the Global Reporting Initiative  (GRI) guidelines and meets the GRI G4 standard  (Core option). Accordingly, we report on all  required standard disclosures as well as on man- agement approaches for key aspects and on  selected indicators for each aspect. The GRI Index  at the end of the report indicates how the con- tents are mapped to the GRI requirements. Tables,  graphics and text passages with statements  relevant to GRI have been appropriately marked  (for example, GRI G4-EN1). A materiality matrix  in Chapter 1.1, Sustainability strategy and organi- zation, presents the sustainability topics that  are relevant for the MTU Group and shows how  they are weighted from an internal (x-axis) and  external (y-axis) perspective. It serves as the  basis for selecting the key aspects and perfor- mance indicators for this report.  6  Key performance indicators  (KPIs) All data and information for the reporting period  was collected by the relevant departments using  representative methods. Environmental KPIs are  collected via the environmental management  systems at the individual sites and then consoli- dated centrally in the CR database according  to agreed criteria. The HR KPIs are collected  and evaluated centrally at the headquarters in  Munich for Germany, and using an electronic HR  management system for all non-German sites.  Once the data is evaluated, it is sent to the CR  database. All other data is requested from the  CR coordinators in the relevant departments and  compiled centrally in the CR database. Financial  KPIs are collected and published in accordance  with the International Financial Reporting Stand- ards (IFRS).

The Munich site in figures  1 Sustainable governance We manage MTUs business in a responsible and forward-  looking manner. Our efforts are supported by our sustain- ability strategy and the embedding of that strategy in our  organizational structures. Ethics, integrity and respect for  human rights provide the necessary foundation.        10  1.1 Sustainability strategy and organization Sustainability is the overarching principle in the MTU Group, firmly embed- ded in its organizational structures and implemented in corporate processes.  We aim to continuously improve in all key corporate responsibility topics  and also further develop our sustainability management concept. Sustainable governance  1.1 Sustainability strategy and organization We are committed to adding value in a respon- sible and sustainable way. As the executive body  of MTU, the Executive Board acts at its own  discretion to pursue this goal in the companys  interests while taking into account the interests  of its stakeholders. In consultation with the  Supervisory Board, the Executive Board decides  on the companys strategic direction, sees that  this is implemented, and ensures that the com- pany has appropriate risk management and  control systems in place. The Executive Board is  also responsible for ensuring compliance with  statutory requirements and the companys own  guidelines. It works as a team, with all members  holding joint responsibility. The Supervisory Board  advises and monitors the Executive Boards  management of MTUs business. The MTU-wide  code of conduct, which the Executive Board and  the group works council agreed on and rolled  out together, forms an important basis for the  compliance of all employees and managers with  legal and ethical principles. We see sustainability as part of our corporate  social responsibility to ensure long-term business  success. In the process, we consider not only  economic but also ecological and social aspects,  and we promote dialog with our stakeholders as  a way for us to keep informed about societys  key demands and expectations. Sustainability is  enshrined in our annual corporate objectives as  a strategic goal.  Our sustainability strategy covers every area of  MTUs business. It focuses on key topics that we  identify and evaluate using a materiality analysis.  We weight each topic according to its importance  to MTU and our stakeholders, and we take a  holistic perspective along the entire value chain  including the supply chain and the use of our  products and services. Our sustainability strategy  addresses the global challenges and trends that  MTUs business faces. Climate change, mobility  and resource scarcity are important drivers of  that business. We create products and inno- vations that contribute to the sustainable devel- opment of society and the environment. These  support airlines in improving their energy foot- print and in reducing emissions and aircraft noise.  That is why product responsibility is at the heart  of our sustainability strategy, which addresses  the topics of product quality and flight safety, fuel  efficiency, CO2 emissions and noise emissions.  Other topics that are highly relevant to MTU and  its stakeholders include innovations, a steady in- crease in shareholder value, and anti-corruption/  bribery. Compliance and respect for human rights  are the basis for our conduct. We see the ten principles of the UN Global Com- pact, which we joined in 2011, as a guide to  responsible corporate governance. As a signatory,  we are committed to respecting human rights,  ensuring fair working conditions, protecting the  environment, preventing corruption and con- tinuously improving the way in which we imple- ment it across the company. This report also  serves as our annual UNGC Communication on  Progress. The International Labour Organizations  (ILO) core labor standards serve as another point  of reference for us. Furthermore, in 2018 we  will take a closer look at the United Nations  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which  were set in 2015 under the title Transforming  our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable  Development. We will analyze which of the 17  SDGs are most relevant to MTUs sustainability  strategy and how we can support this global  agenda. < With our engine products, we help airlines improve their   energy footprint, reduce CO2 emissions and aircraft   noise. That is why product responsibility is at the heart   of our sustainability strategy. 11 More information: Working procedures of the MTU Executive Board  and Supervisory Board: 2017 Annual Report,  Corporate Governance Report, page 22ff. MTU code of conduct: Chapter 1.2 Compliance  and respecting human rights Sustainability topics along the entire value  chain: Materiality principle according to GRI,  page 88  Product responsibility as a focus of CR:  Chapter 2.2 Eco-efficient engines UN Global Compact: www.unglobalcompact.org  The materiality analysis rated product-related  topics (quality, safety and eco-efficiency) as very  highly relevant. We recategorized Product quality  and product safety as Product quality and  flight safety, and also split our focus topic of  eco-efficient engines into Fuel efficiency/CO2  emissions and Noise emissions of our products,  since fuel consumption is directly proportional  to CO2 emissions. Other emissions of aircraft  Materiality analysis When it comes to sustainability, we focus on  key topics that are relevant to MTUs business  success and have an impact on society and the  environment, which makes them of particular  interest to our stakeholders. We identify these  important topics using a materiality analysis that  we conduct every year. The materiality analysis  covers all our key business areas and fully con- solidated locations as well as the experience and  insights gathered from our dialog with stake- holders. We insert the relevant aspects into a  materiality matrix, which weights the topics  according to their importance from an in-house  perspective (X-axis) and from the point of view  of our most important stakeholders (Y-axis). In  the materiality analysis, we also take up new  topics and review them to see how they fit with  our CR strategy. Through direct contact with key  stakeholder groups, we determine their expec- tations and demands (e.g. at recruiting and  customer fairs, employee and customer ques- tionnaires, Annual General Meeting). We also  have a survey on the MTU website that addresses  all CR topics.  The materiality analysis is conducted by the cor- porate responsibility (CR) coordinators in the  relevant departments, in collaboration with the  CR steering committee as the central body. For  the first non-financial statement required by  the new European guideline as implemented in  Germany (CSR-RUG), which we published in  spring 2018 as part of our management report,  MTU reevaluated all topics in the financial year  using uniform criteria according to CSR-RUGs  updated definition of materiality. In addition to  shareholder expectations, the analysis also looked  at social, ecological and economic impact to cal- culate a position for the Y-axis. When evaluating  a topic for relevance to the company (X-axis), the  first aspect considered is its economic impact  on MTU—measured by its effect on the balance  sheet or the companys reputation—using a pre- determined scale. As a result, the materiality  matrix produced new positions for the focus topics  of MTUs CR strategy in financial year 2017. Sustainable governance  1.1 Sustainability strategy and organization 12 engines, such as nitrogen oxide, are not within  MTUs sphere of influence, since the company  does not develop combustors. Therefore, exhaust  emissions are less significant for our sustain- ability strategy.  One topic of particular importance is compliance.  To examine it more closely, we broke it down  into individual issues so that we could weight  them more carefully. One example here is IT  security and data protection, which is becoming  more relevant due to current developments such  as the Euro-pean Data Protection Regulation.  Other key compliance issues for MTU include:  anti-corruption/bribery, trade compliance (export  regulations and customs law), and environmental  and occupational safety as required by law.  All compliance topics are highly or very highly  relevant to MTU and its stakeholders.  The supply chains for MTUs business segments— OEM (new and spare parts) and MRO (commer- cial maintenance, repair and overhaul)—each have  their own organizational units at the company  and are subject to various general and market  conditions. In general, public interest in the sus- tainability aspects of supply chains and regulations  is on the rise. To better take these requirements  into account, we have evaluated responsible  sourcing separately for the OEM and MRO seg- ments.      Our matrix breaks down the focus topic of  Environmental protection in production (previ- ously known as Environmental management/ performance) into individual categories such as  energy, emissions, waste and water so as to  conduct a more nuanced assessment. These  topics are less relevant for us as we have a much  greater impact on the environment through our  products. As for social issues, occupational safety and em- ployee development rank as the most important.   Diversity & equality of opportunity have become  more important for MTU, as it is a high-profile  issue in the United States and can have an  impact on MTUs business. In assessing our  sustainability strategy with regard to relevance  to business and impact on third parties, we also  reexamined human rights. For MTU, these apply  to all stakeholder groups equally, but we pay  special attention to our employees, suppliers  and business partners. MTUs report on donations/sponsoring can now  be found under Corporate citizenship.

In collaboration with the managers and experts  in their technical areas, the coordinators are  heavily involved in shaping the strategic focus of  their CR goals and developing these goals over  time.  Every year, they report validated KPIs and infor- mation on sustainability activities and progress  to the CR coordination team by means of an  integrated database. They also meet regularly  over the course of the year to exchange infor- mation, coordinate measures and approve sus- tainability goals. In one project, we are reviewing  our current sustainability organization and pro- cesses for transparency, completeness and  efficiency. The overall goal is to improve our CR  management. For example, we are planning to  expand the CR Steering Committee into a CR  Board and involve other key management func- tions so that we can better address the scope  of sustainability issues. CR management We have integrated sustainability into organizati- onal structures throughout the entire MTU Group.  Through our CR management system, we monitor  our sustainability strategy, performance and  goals. The supervising body is a CR Steering  Committee whose members consist of the tier-1  senior management team. It submits multiple  reports during the financial year to the Executive  Board, which sets the direction of the sustain- ability strategy. As the highest decision-making  body, the Executive Board holds overall respon- sibility for sustainability at MTU. A central CR  coordination team manages implementation of  the sustainability strategy in the Group, com- munication with stakeholders, and reporting on  CR topics. Stakeholder dialog >GRI G4-24-27 We strive to conduct a proactive and mutually  supportive dialog with all our stakeholders in  which we communicate about sustainability  topics openly and transparently. By so doing,  we aim to achieve broad acceptance among the  general public. This dialog gives us the oppor- tunity to respond to suggestions, expectations  and feedback and act on new topics and chal- lenges in a timely manner. Stakeholders are  individuals, groups or organizations that have  a regular relationship with MTU. Our key stake- holders are employees, customers, business  Eckhard Zanger Senior Vice President  Corporate Communications  and Public Affairs  MTU Aero Engines AG Sustainability is part of our corporate identity.  Our responsibility to the environment and to  society has been integrated into our decision- making processes. Because we aim to continuously  make progress in this area, we are further  expanding our sustainability management system.  MTUs CR management  system Board of Management CR Steering Committee CR Coordination CR Divisional  Coordinators partners, suppliers and shareholders. We are  also in dialog with scientists, researchers, analysts,  journalists, politicians, associations, NGOs,  employee representatives, neighbors and com- munities.  To involve our stakeholders and gather feedback,  we use a variety of communication channels and  platforms that are tailored to the target group in  question. For instance, in 2017 we began holding  a Sustainability Day for our employees. We also  use an online survey to invite all stakeholders to  evaluate and discuss our sustainability strategy.  We pick up and act on topics that come to our  attention through the stakeholder dialog. Our  stakeholders are interested primarily in eco- efficient engines, product responsibility, com- pliance, MTU as an attractive employer, human  rights and the regional responsibility of MTUs  sites. We have taken up data security as an  important new topic in our stakeholder dialog.  We wish to intensify our dialog on CR topics  in particular. Preparations for interviews with  selected representatives of key stakeholder  groups as well as for an evaluation of our first  non-financial statement in the annual report are  under way. Political dialog >GRI G4-SO6 As a matter of principle, MTU takes no political  position. The company purposely cultivates  relationships with parties and factions on certain  topics, as aviation is affected to no small degree  by political decision-making, especially at the  national and European levels. Key points of con- tact for the company include elected represen- tatives and decision-makers from ministries at  the state, federal and EU levels as well as from  subordinate authorities and the German Armed  Supervisory Board (Key Topics)  Sustainable governance  1.1 Sustainability strategy and organization 15  Product innovation/eco-efficiency   Responsible corporate governance  Human rights  Compliance  Environmental protection  Risk management  Supplier management  Developing new technologies  Promoting research and teaching  Networking between industry and research  Study of engineering and scientific disciplines  Recruiting    Innovation and technologies  Aviation sector/eco-efficiency  MTU as employer  Financial issues  Site development  Compliance  Social commitment  Environmental protection  MTU as employer  Site development  Compliance  Developing and promoting technology  Environmental protection, eco-efficiency  Political frameworks and regulations  Mobility concepts  Site development  Demographic change  Globalization  Compliance  Eco-efficiency  Promoting innovation and technology  Economic and labor policies  Health and safety  Career and advanced training opportunities  Compensation and Benefits  Work-Life-Balance  Diversity & Equality of opportunities  Co-determination    Capital market Science and research Media Region Politics,  public agencies Associations and organizations  Annual General Meeting  Conferences and roadshows  Investor discussions  Trade fairs  Ratings  Financial communications  Joint research projects  Work in MTU centers of excellence  Trade fairs  Visits from university student groups  Presentations/discussions at universities     Press releases  Press conferences and briefings  Plant tours  Internet/Social Media  Trade fairs    Museum open house days  Community partnerships  Internet/Social media  Plant tours  Parliamentary evening  Plant visits   Trade fairs  Political discussions  Background talks  Visits by political delegations    Meetings and committees  Participation in forums and events  Internal media  Employee surveys  HR services  Dialog and information events  Company suggestion scheme  Product quality and safety  Environmental Protection  Responsible Sourcing  Compliance with MTU standards   Supplier Collaboration Center  Audits  Supplier surveys  Supplier Days  Product quality and safety  Sustainable technologies  Product fuel efficiency  Human Rights  Compliance  Voice of the customer  Trade fairs  Corporate communications   media channels  Stakeholder dialog >GRi G4-24, 26  Stakeholder Topics Employees Suppliers Business partners  and customers Forms of dialog   Sustainable governance  1.1 Sustainability strategy and organization 16 Managing sustainability risks We integrate sustainability risks into our internal  control system, and map and evaluate them using  defined processes. MTU has established a group- wide integrated risk management and control  system, based on the leading international  COSO II ERM Framework standard, with which it  manages risks and opportunities for its business.  The system also takes into account non-financial  risks. For the topic of compliance, MTU has  established a separate risk assessment and a  separate reporting line, which the Compliance  Board coordinates.  The top issues for financial year 2017 identified  in the materiality process have been reviewed by  the departments and the CR Steering Committee  for potential risks that may arise from MTU busi- ness activities and impact the environment,  society and the companys workforce. Building  on the existing risk management system, the risk  assessment was carried out in a similar fashion  on a scale referencing the likelihood of occurrence  and the impact of the risk. The analysis identified  no significant risks that had a high probability of  severe negative impact. Based on this, in 2018  Adding value by steadily increasing share- holder value  We take a long-term approach to our companys  success, aiming to steadily increase shareholder  value with a view to profitable growth. Our com- mercial success generates added value for our  stakeholders and contributes to societys pros- perity and the economic development of the  communities where our business activities are  located. We create attractive jobs in a high-tech  industry and offer professional training as part  of Germanys dual-track system. At present, the  MTU Group employs 8,846 people at fully con- solidated locations around the world, with 287  young apprentices training in Germany. We  are a major employer at all major international  locations, offering an appropriate return for  shareholders and competitive salaries for our  employees. We also contribute to society through  the tax we pay on our profits. As a local investor  and patron, we promote education and the  academic landscape, for example by maintaining  close ties to local universities. We invest in our  locations and are in the process of expanding  our plants in Rzeszw, Munich and Berlin. Through  our innovative capabilities, we create upstream  value chains and jobs in the supply chain.  2017 was another record-breaking year for MTU.  This means we were able to continue writing our  success story of sustained value creation. Our  commercial success has a positive impact on  MTU as an employer and as a client, and makes  our stocks an attractive capital investment. It  also allows us to invest heavily in expanding our  locations. Peter Kameritsch Chief Financial Officer and  Chief Information Officer  MTU Aero Engines AG Forces. To ensure transparency and adherence to  external and internal regulations, MTU manages  its political dialog centrally through the Corporate  Communications and Public Affairs department.  Topics of discussion with political decision-makers  include innovation, technology development and  funding, environmental protection and noise re- duction, the relevance of air traffic to society,  site development, economic and labor market  policy, and support for exports. MTU pursues its  industry-specific interests through memberships  in various professional associations.  MTU does not make any financial or in-kind  donations to political parties. All transactions  are carried out in compliance with the applicable  legal and regulatory requirements and with  MTUs Code of Conduct, and must be granted  central clearance. Mandatory requirements are  stipulated in the MTU compliance management  system and Code of Conduct, including those  relating to donations, sponsorship, customer  events, in-house events, hospitality and corporate  gifts. Compliance with these rules and regulations  is the responsibility of the relevant manager in  each case and is safeguarded by an internal  control system. we launched a quarterly risk survey of the most  important sustainability topics at the behest  of the CR control board. Department managers  conduct the survey. The results are reported  regularly to the CR Steering Committee. If neces- sary, the Steering Committee passes the report  to the risk management team and, if appropriate,  to the Executive Board.

MTU  Maintenance (MRO business) had its best year  in its more than 36 years of history. The MTU  Group as a whole reported a record adjusted  EBIT of 555.3 million euros, and earnings after  tax (adjusted) reached 381.8 million euros for  the first time. The companys order backlog ran  to 13.2 billion euros in 2017, which in purely  numerical terms translates to production capacity  utilization of up to three years. In addition to the  V2500, the most important engine programs in  the order backlog are the PW1000G Geared  Turbofan family, which serves as the basis for  reducing aircraft noise and CO2 emissions as  part of our Clean Air Engine Agenda and climate  strategy. We expect a moderate increase in both  adjusted EBIT and earnings after tax for 2018.

This includes our commitment  to respecting human rights, which is firmly embedded in our corporate culture. As a signatory to the UN Global Compact (UNGC),  we are committed to protecting human rights  (UNGC Principles 1 and 2) and preventing cor- ruption within our company (UNGC Principle 10).  In the interests of maintaining sustainable corpo- rate leadership, we take our lead from the German  Corporate Governance Code and international  compliance standards (set by the Institute  of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW Auditing  Standards) and the guidelines issued by the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development, or OECD (Good Practice Guidance  on Internal Controls, Ethics, and Compliance)).  MTU also participates in the anti-corruption initi- atives of the Aerospace and Defense Industries  Association of Europe and of TRACE International. Management approach  MTU acts as a fair employer, business partner  and customer, and advocates transparent com- petition where all parties are on an equal footing.  Integrity and responsible conduct are core values  of our corporate culture and are embedded in  our code of conduct, which is binding for all em- ployees, managers and members of the Executive  Board. Key parts of the MTU code of conduct are:  Safeguarding human rights  Observing labor laws  Maintaining fair working conditions and    business relationships  Occupational health and safety for all    employees  Refraining from corruption, bribery and    accepting undue advantages  Providing employee training  In addition, each employee is to be familiar with  the legal requirements relating to their role and  observe both the terms of their employment  contract and company regulations. Managers  have a particular responsibility to uphold these  requirements and regulations and to act as role  models. Acting with integrity is a fundamental  part of our working and business relationships.  Compliance strengthens the trust our stake- holders place in our company and bolsters MTUs  good international reputation. We also expect  our business partners to fully comply with all  applicable laws. We shape the future of aviation is the title of  the MTU Principles. As an integral part of our  corporate culture, they help MTU to act in a  consistent and reliable manner. The MTU Prin- ciples define the companys future orientation  and its basic goals and values, and provide for  the observance of MTUs code of conduct and  ethical principles. They are based on five pillars:   Products, technology and growth   Cooperation and conduct   Employees and management   Partners, customers and shareholders   Environment and society  The MTU Principles are regularly updated to  reflect new developments and challenges.  More information: MTU code of conduct: www.mtu.de Declaration of conformity with the German  Corporate Governance Code: MTU Annual  Report 2017, page 22  UN Global Compact: unglobalcompact.org TRACE International: traceinternational.org The only way we can be successful over the long  term is if we conduct our business responsibly.  This includes complying with all laws as well  as our own principles and guidelines in all units  of the MTU Group. Compliance is a key pillar  of our corporate culture. Our aim goes beyond  preventing corruption and bribery and ensuring  fair competition; we also want to respect funda- mental values such as human rights within MTU  and along the supply chain.   Reiner Winkler Chief Executive Officer MTU Aero Engines AG  21 Anti-corruption One focus of our compliance activities is the  prevention of corruption and bribery. MTU con- demns corruption of any kind, including bribery  and all other forms of white-collar crime. The  long-term success of any business is founded on  compliance with applicable laws and regulations  and the companys own internal guidelines. In  addition to obligations to act responsibly and  with integrity, the group-wide framework of com- pliance rules obliges the adherence to statutory  requirements and internal regulations. MTU guide- lines also provide clear rules for day-to-day  dealings with officials and when it is appropriate  to accept gifts. Further internal regulations con- cerning the prevention of corruption relate to  invitations, hospitality, customer events, dona- tions, sponsoring and the approval process for  sales consultants.  Trade compliance MTU acts in accordance with all customs laws  and export regulations our products are subject  to and has implemented standardized processes  throughout the company to ensure this. These  processes include the review of all data and parts  prior to shipping to make sure they are in line  with export control regulations. MTUs own export  controls include checks for any existing and/ or required authorization requirements. Before  deliveries are dispatched, MTU performs an  additional system check using SAP. Compliance  with customs laws and export regulations is  explicitly laid out in the code of conduct. Compliance organization MTU has established a compliance system for  the entire company. As the final decision-making  authority, the CEO is responsible for the com- panys business ethics and anti-corruption policy.  The key tool for ensuring the ethical conduct of  business activities is a group-wide Compliance  Board comprising members on the management  level. The Compliance Board holds both regular  and ad hoc meetings and provides quarterly  updates on its activities to the Executive Board  and the Supervisory Boards Audit Committee,  which for its part informs the plenary meetings  of the Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee  oversees the Executive Boards compliance acti- vities. Employee representatives make up half of  the members of the Supervisory Boards Audit  Committee and of the full Supervisory Board.  The company has instituted a global whistleblower  system that allows employees and external stake- holders to report suspected cases of corruption  or bribery, or any general suspected cases of  non-compliance with the MTU code of conduct,  internal guidelines or applicable laws, to an  ombudsman (ombudsmann@mtu.de). MTU does  not tolerate any kind of conduct that violates laws  or regulations. Any detected violations will be  punished. In such cases, MTU applies a principle  of zero tolerance. Should there be clear grounds  for suspecting a violation, the Compliance Board  will take appropriate action.  In the reporting year, no suspected or confirmed  cases of corruption were identified. In addition,  as in previous years, no violations of the code of  conduct were reported by employees or external  stakeholders in the reporting period. No signifi- cant fines were levied against the company for  breaches of applicable laws. MTU also faced no  legal action due to anti-competitive, antitrust  or monopoly practices. In 2017, no reportable  incidents of data protection breaches occurred  within the MTU Group. >GRI G4-SO5, 7-8, PR8 The ways of reporting non-compliance are com- municated to employees through internal media  channels and explained to external stakeholders  in writing or on our website. The identity of the  whistleblower and the information he or she  imparts are treated as strictly confidential—even  if the suspicion turns out to be unfounded. It  goes without saying that whistleblowers acting  in good faith shall not be penalized or disadvan- taged by the company in any way. In addition,  employees can confide in their superiors, the  legal department or HR. Sustainable governance  1.2 Compliance and human rights  22 Sustainable governance  1.2 Compliance and human rights Training employees on compliance >GRI G4-SO04 MTU puts a high priority on preventing possible  forms of misconduct and raising awareness of  compliance issues among employees. When new  employees are taken on, they are informed  about the code of conduct and sign a declaration  to uphold it. We also present and discuss the  code of conduct during the induction event for  new employees at all our locations.  Furthermore, we run regular training sessions  on the code of conduct for selected business  units as part of our regular compliance activities.  Raising awareness of compliance issues is done  first and foremost by organizing mandatory anti- corruption and compliance training courses for  managers and employees who hold positions of  trust. In the reporting year, we trained 190 em- ployees on antitrust law. We also trained various  employee groups plus a further 165 employees  on compliance issues through an e-learning  course. The training methods are monitored by  the Compliance Board. Addressing risks of non-compliance To ensure sound and reliable business relation- ships, the Compliance Board inspects sales sup- port consulting contracts for possible corruption  risks before they are placed or renewed. The  potential consultants are also reviewed by an  independent provider of due diligence services.  The corporate audit department conducts regular  compliance audits in which it checks business  processes and procedures for conformity to legal  requirements and adherence to internal guide- lines. The Supervisory Boards Audit Committee  reviews the framework of compliance rules  and deliberates on the measures and employee  training recommended by the Compliance Board.  Moreover, MTU is regularly evaluated by Trans- parency International, a non-governmental orga- nization dedicated to fighting corruption. MTU  achieved an overall rating of B (Good Evidence),  which means that the company has provided  good evidence that it has established an anti- corruption and ethics program. Monitoring and improvement MTU wants to continuously improve its com- pliance system and so underwent a review in  2017. Recommended measures, such as a new  compliance reporting system, enhancement of  the whistleblower system and organizational  changes in the structure of compliance respon- sibilities, are being successively implemented. Respecting human rights MTU respects the internationally proclaimed  human rights set out in the United Nations Uni- versal Declaration of Human Rights and enforces  and protects these rights within the company.  MTU pursues the goal of preventing human rights  violations occurring in its own business activities  (zero-tolerance principle) and has also imple- mented measures for upholding human rights for  the upstream supply chain. In the case of invest- ment agreements with suppliers, the suppliers  must follow the MTU code of conduct, which is  laid out in the purchasing agreement and requires  the adherence to human rights. >GRI G4-HR1 MTU is committed to respecting the individuality  and dignity of all, maintaining equality of oppor- tunity in the workplace and preventing discrimi- nation. The protection of human rights, the right  to appropriate remuneration, and recognition  of regulations governing employee and union  representation under labor and works constitution  law as well as constructive collaboration with  employee representatives and labor unions are  implemented group-wide through the code of  conduct. As an employer, we want to create fair  working conditions based on legally binding  employment contracts with appropriate remune- ration. This includes the right to unionize and to  adopt collective agreements. Compliance with  the code of conduct and ethical principles is  enshrined in the MTU Principles, and our commit- ment to respecting human rights is reinforced  by our status as a signatory to the UN Global  Compact since 2011. In addition, we respect  the United Nations Universal Declaration of  Human Rights and the principles set out in the  International Labor Organizations (ILO) core  labor standards. The adherence to and protection  of human rights is also covered under national  legislation. In Germany, MTU is bound by the  General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG), which  prohibits discrimination against employees and  job applicants. For employees in Germany, there  are also internal guidelines on fair and coopera- tive conduct that are designed to prevent bullying,  sexual harassment and discrimination. MTU has established points of contact within  the company for reports or complaints of human  rights violations. It is ensured that the company  investigates all claims. Reports can be directed  to the ombudsman. In line with the provisions of  the General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG), every  site in Germany has an appropriately trained  contact to whom employees can address any  complaints of discrimination. Employees can   23 also report complaints to managers, the works  council or the head of human resources. The  Executive Board is informed about infringements  depending on the severity of their impacts.  When they join the company, new employees are  informed about the regulations laid down in the  code of conduct and—in Germany—in the General  Act on Equal Treatment (AGG), and they under- take to comply with these requirements. In addi- tion, MTU provides regular training on the code  of conduct at all the companys sites and across  all hierarchical levels. At our locations in Germany  in 2017, we trained a total of 4,431 participants  on legal issues for 1,064 training days. Employees  at all fully consolidated locations within the MTU  Group were given training on the MTU code of  conduct. There was one well-founded complaint under the  German General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG)  in 2017. This complaint was followed up and  appropriate action taken. Other than this, there  were no substantiated breaches of the code of  conduct within the MTU Group. >GRI G4-HR3, 12  MTU considers the risk of human rights violations  among its employees to be low at all its locations,  as these activities are governed by the relevant  national legislation that upholds human rights.  The company thus puts its focus in the area  on the supply chain. We have taken steps here  to ensure the protection of human rights, for  example to increase transparency in the procure- ment of certain raw materials classified as con- flict minerals, which we therefore procure only  from secure and trusted sources. In 2017, we  launched a due diligence process to assess risks  to human rights in the supply chain to prevent  human rights violations. Our approach is laid out  in detail in Chapter 2.3 Responsibility for the  supply chain. >GRI G4-HR4-6, 9 Sustainable governance  1.2 Compliance and human rights MTU is committed to respecting human rights in its own workforce, along the supply chain  and in its collaboration with business partners.  2 Responsibility for products and for   the supply chain We pursue product responsibility over the entire product  lifecycle of an engine. Our priority are the safety, quality  and eco-efficiency of our products, above all in their use,  and we take this into account starting in the product  development stage. We include the supply chain in a  sustainable process of adding value. 24  2.1 Product quality and flight safety Every day, some 100,000 aircraft around the world take off and land safely  back on the ground. Our part in this is the safety and quality of our engine  products. Safety first—this is our maxim, too. Responsibility for products and for the supply chain  2.1 Product quality and flight safety We strive for nothing less than first-class perfor- mance. The MTU name stands for high-quality  and reliable aviation products around the world.  Our extensive quality management guarantees  that our exacting quality standards for products  and processes will be upheld. Safety is our  number one priority. Martin Schffner Senior Vice President  Corporate Quality  MTU Aero Engines AG Quality control and its standards are undergoing  continuous development. Impetus for this comes,  for example, from collaboration in the Aero Engine  Supplier Quality Group or from regular meetings  of the quality managers. The framework of rules,  too, is continuously reviewed and amended as  needed.  Management approach Safety plays a special role in aviation. Legal  requirements concerning the safe operation of  flights are closely monitored by the aviation au- thorities. This is mirrored in the high importance  MTU places on product quality and flight safety.  The company must comply with the legal require- ments imposed upon it as a development, manu- facturing and maintenance organization in the  aviation industry. These include the requisite  aviation-authority licenses, approvals and certi- fications as well as safety and environmental  requirements as legally mandated by regulatory  authorities. Through stringent quality standards,  we ensure that these are implemented across  the Group and at all levels of the value chain in  accordance with the law, thus adding value for  our customers and partners.  A group-wide integrated management system  (IMS) ensures compliance with laws and internal  regulations and clear assignment of responsi- bilities within the company. One principle of the  IMS policy is that safety takes priority in what  we do. The quality framework is enshrined in  a management manual that is binding for all  employees and managers across the Group. Cor- porate Quality is a separate department directly  subordinate to the Chief Operating Officer (COO)  and reports quarterly to the Executive Board on  quality aspects and flight-related incidents. MTU  Safety Management in accordance with the Inter- national Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) stand- ard is part of the IMS and defines how to handle  safety-related air-traffic events. Appropriate  organizational structures and responsibilities,  such as a Flight Safety Board and a flight safety  manager, have also been established. High qua- lity standards together with product safety and  reliability are enshrined in the MTU Principles as  an important corporate objective. The effective- ness of MTUs IMS is certified by independent  and accredited external auditors. < As an engine manufacturer, we are working hard to   minimize the fuel consumption, carbon footprint and   noise of aircraft engines. We have achieved particular   success here with the new PW1100G-JM Geared   Turbofan. MTU at its best: Our key components for the PW1100G-JM powering the A320neo are  innovative and of premium quality. 25  Development Production Service life Recycling*  Clean Air Engine agenda (Claire)  New technologies for a longer service life of life-limited parts  Environmental management (mostly compliant with EMAS and/or ISO 14001)  Production processes that conserve resources, such as additive manufacturing  Sustainability standards for suppliers  MTUPlus Engine Trend Monitoring  MTU repairs, such as MTUPlus ERcoateco (patented erosion protection for compressor blades)  For older engines, we offer tailored solutions such as MTUPlus Mature Engine Solutions for   disassembling and recycling components Sustainability over the entire product lifecycle Phase  Measures *Due to their highly valuable materials (titanium, nickel and alloying elements such as platinum and rhenium), aircraft engines have very high recycling rates.  As a vendor, MTU has no direct influence over the scrapping of engines, which is carried out by specialist companies.  26 Responsibility for products and for the supply chain  2.1 Product quality and flight safety Sustainable product lifecycle >GRI G4-PR1-4, 9 We examine our engine modules for their impact  on the environment, health and safety throughout  their development, production and operation  lifecycles. Accordingly, we cover all major stages  of a products service life completely. The key to  our continuous progress is development. Our  mission in any collaboration is to design every  new engine so that it is more fuel-efficient, with  less emissions, and quieter than its predecessor. We take into account all safety and environmental  requirements of regulatory authorities in the  early stages of planning new engines for later  More information: IMS policy: www.mtu.de Certifications: www.mtu.de We include our employees in our high quality  standards and provide basic information with our  group-wide Q.net quality network. Furthermore,  the company publishes its quality information,  Q-Info, group-wide on the intranet several times  a year, with the aim of raising awareness among  employees. At MTUs principal maintenance site  in Hannover, this is supplemented by the local  QM-Info. We provide training on quality issues  for managers and employees at the individual  sites. Shopfloor/office management in Germany  and Poland, where employees and managers  exchange views on quality and other issues several  times a week and initiate short-term measures if  problems arise, also supports continuous improve- ment. Shopfloor/office management was also  rolled out at MTUs Vancouver location in Canada  in 2017,  with more locations to be included in  the future. For our technically demanding designs, we use  highly precise measuring technology—here is a  contourograph in use. use, and compliance must be documented as  part of the certification process. We employ a  comprehensive testing program involving test  builds and series tests to validate the safe flight  operation of our products. This includes being  able to ensure safe operation during a bird strike,  bird ingestion event or hailstorm and complying  with strict limits on pollutants and noise emis- sions. MTU components frequently exceed avi- ation authority requirements. Our customers demand high standards when it comes to fail-safe  operation and eco-efficiency. In addition, the  manufacture of engine parts and modules our  production shops meets all required standards  concerning occupational safety and environmen- tal protection.   We use only fault-free and clearly identifiable  components that have been approved by the  appropriate aviation authority, are based on  approved development documentation and have  been produced or repaired in compliance with  aviation regulatory processes by a certified  company. The aviation sector has strict rules governing  documentation in order to verify the airworthiness  of components and engines. There must be no  gaps in documentation for the entire product  lifecycle. MTU holds its suppliers to the same  standards. To ensure compliance with quality  and safety requirements, the company has im- plemented comprehensive monitoring and testing  processes throughout the entire value chain.  Safety-critical components (engine components  are categorized into various safety classes) are  subjected to very rigorous testing to verify their  technical quality. Strict requirements also apply  to materials. Fail-safe materials are a basic pre- requisite for aviation safety, and all engine com- ponents, including all materials we use, must be  approved by the aviation authorities. In 2017, we once again fulfilled all our product  compliance requirements. In the previous finan- cial year, once again no breaches of statutory  regulations were observed in connection with  the purchase or operation of our products, nor  were any fines imposed on MTU. Neither were  there any incidents or breaches of statutory  regulations or internal guidelines in relation to  the effect on health or safety of our products  and services. More information: Clean Air Engine agenda: 2.2 Eco-efficient  engines Environmental protection in production:  Chapter 3 of this report MTU maintenance technologies: www.mtu.de Harmless materials >GRI G4-PR3 Wherever possible, we avoid using dangerous  and environmentally hazardous materials in our  manufacturing processes and products. Accord- ing to the European REACh (Registration, Evalu- ation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals)  regulation, certain substances of very high con- cern (SVHCs) containing chromium6+ have been  subject to authorization since September 2017.  MTU uses chromium trioxide in its production  processes and the European Chemicals Agency  (ECHA) has authorized continued use until 2029.  In a project to implement the REACh regulation,  we are pushing ahead with the long-term elimi- nation of SVHCs that require authorization, insofar  as possible, either by replacing them or by re- jecting new authorizations. We obtain further  REACh substances necessary for our processes  exclusively from authorized suppliers, and com- municate the REACh requirements to the sup- pliers of our various sites in our General Terms  and Conditions of Purchase. MTU is duly imple- menting all provisions of the EU regulation for  protecting employees and the environment. Responsibility for products and for the supply chain  2.1 Product quality and flight safety We have established comprehensive monitoring and testing processes in our  component production operations. 27  MTU Maintenance offers repair and additional  services for aircraft engines and industrial gas  turbines, and is thus active in the end-customer  business. Direct interaction with customers,  specifically airlines, leasing companies, and energy  producers, forms the basis of customer care.  For this purpose, customer advisers use a cus- tomer relationship management tool containing  a voice of the customer module to regularly  measure current satisfaction levels. The survey  takes place once a quarter for all major sites,  including Hannover, Ludwigsfelde and Vancouver,  and for all main products. Each customer has  the option of providing feedback about product  quality, service, logistics and commercial terms.  We actively use this feedback in order to identify  areas for improvement and initiate measures  accordingly. Doing so allows us to improve our  performance and continuously increase customer  satisfaction as means of staying competitive.  In addition, MTU Maintenance Lease Services  runs its own measurement system in the area of  engine leasing and asset management. Responsibility for products and for the supply chain  2.1 Product quality and flight safety Focus on customer satisfaction  >GRI G4-PR5 A high level of product quality and safety is crucial  for customer satisfaction. Corporate objectives  for 2017 were to deliver products and services  in the required quality and increase customer  satisfaction. Our certified quality management  system serves to ensure customer satisfaction,  process orientation and continuous improvement  in all phases of development, production and  maintenance. We are also setting on-time deli- very and quality at a high level as a core objective  for 2018. One way in which we continually monitor quality  is by sending monthly reports on quality KPIs to  executive managers or shopfloor/office manage- ment, so that they can take the necessary steps  to achieve sustainable improvement. Providing  customers and partners with safe, top-quality  products and services helps to keep MTUs busi- ness competitive. In 2017, the goal was to lower  or at least keep the number of customer com- plaints stable at all locations. To ensure uniformly  high standards and compliance with legal require- ments, MTU routinely conducts internal and  external audits. These audits are managed locally  by the respective sites. A defined process en- sures that all customer complaints relating to  substandard quality of delivered MTU products  are followed up and analyzed, and appropriate  measures are defined and implemented so as to  eliminate the cause of the defects. In mainte- nance operations, too, a procedure is in place  for examining customer complaints using quality  methods in order to eliminate the root causes  permanently. We closely monitor the progress  of those measures. A cross-divisional CI project  (CI = Continuous Improvement) carried out at  the Munich location in 2017 systematically ana- lyzed complaints by key accounts from the two  previous years for causes of failure, and initiated  appropriate measures to eliminate them. We  processed individual cases using problem-solving  methods that have proven their effectiveness at  MTU. Customer complaints are evaluated at the indivi- dual MTU sites, and for the majority of locations,  these declined compared with 2016. In the  reporting period, 410 internal audits including  certification audits and 96 external quality audits  by customers or aviation authorities were con- ducted. MTU was able to improve its ranking by  customers in 2017 as well. 28 Thirty percent of commercial aircraft are equipped  with our technology. We are the partner of choice  for high-pressure compressors, low-pressure  turbines and turbine center frames, and we are  the maintenance sectors number one independent  service provider. MTU has made a name for  itself based on premium quality, on-time delivery  and competitive pricing, and customer satisfaction  is something we take very seriously.   Michael Schreygg Chief Program Officer  MTU Aero Engines AG  2.2 Eco-efficient engines Last year, 4.1 billion passengers boarded a plane—giving the aviation  industry another record-breaking year. This growth presents us with  new challenges and new tasks. Joint efforts in the sector are focusing on  innovative and sustainable mobility concepts. As an engine manufacturer,  we are working hard to minimize the fuel consumption, carbon footprint  and noise of aircraft engines.  Responsibility for products and for the supply chain  2.2 Eco-efficient engines      Participating in various discussion forums,    for example run by the German Aviation    Association (BDL), Friends of the Earth    Germany (BUND), Greenpeace, Munich Airport   Giving consideration to new scientific insights,    for example research findings of the Inter-   governmental Panel on Climate Change    concerning the impact of aviation on climate    change   Working on committees such as the German    Aerospace Industries Association (BDLI) or    the Advisory Council for Aviation Research in    Europe Management approach MTU is working on solutions to make flying more  environmentally friendly, with a focus on reducing  fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and noise  emissions of engines—factors it can directly in- fluence with its high-pressure compressors and  low-pressure turbines. This commitment is con- tained in the MTU Principles under the maxim of  sustainable product development with reduced  fuel consumption and noise emissions. There is  a direct link between fuel consumption and CO2  emissions. Because CO2 emissions are a contrib- uting factor to climate change caused by aviation,  MTU is working on solutions to make engines  more fuel-efficient. The MTU code of conduct  also contains guidelines on product development  according to environmental criteria. MTU also  contributes to the European industry and research  sectors Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda  (SRIA) and supports its targets to reduce its  impact on the environment. With our own long- term Clean Air Engine agenda (Claire), we are  implementing concepts for developing innovative  and sustainable products by 2050. And thanks  to the technology roadmap embedded in that  agenda, we are concentrating on future-oriented  products and promising key technologies for the  next generation of engines in 2030 and beyond.  The development of innovative, sustainable pro- ducts and processes is firmly anchored in our  organizational structures and established by  means of a company-wide process. MTU is committed to the principle of integrated  environmental protection, which takes a pre- cautionary approach to how the companys prod- ucts impact the environment and integrates in- sights from this into entrepreneurial decisions.  MTUs technology and innovation process in- corporates environmental and societal driving  forces for aviation and takes them into account  when defining its own concepts and targets. The  company identifies negative impacts of air traffic  on the environment and on society for instance by  More information: MTU Code of Conduct: www.mtu.de SRIA: http://www.acare4europe.org/sria Certified in 2017: the PW1900G for the new generation of E-Jets from Embraer. Thanks to  the Geared Turbofan, the E190-E2 consumes 17 percent less fuel and thus produces  17 percent less CO2. 29  Research and development  Innovation and research are cornerstones of the  company and part of our strategy. Leading tech- nology is one of three pillars that help the company  achieve profitable growth. Further expanding  MTUs leading technological position is a contin- uous corporate goal, and one key topic is digi- talization of the entire value chain. To that end,  MTU launched the group-wide MTU 4.0 initiative  in order to utilize that potential for all areas of  the company. The initiative takes into account  the entire product lifecycle, from development to  production to maintenance. One focus in 2017  was the greater use of simulation techniques in  development and manufacturing—a corporate  goal in technology. In 2018, we plan to continue  driving our digitalization strategy forward, and  have enshrined the virtual engine in our targets  as a key technology of the future. An Innovation Board regularly discusses all topics  related to technology and innovation and initiates  technology projects and studies. The Technology  steering committee, of which the Chief Operating  and Chief Program Officers are members, ap- proves MTUs technology roadmap and regularly  receives progress reports. MTU maintains a cen- tral department for the development of future  technologies, which in turn works hand in hand  with in-house product development. MTU manages its short- to long-term product  development in a multi-level technology and inno- vation process. Short-term product development  is oriented toward concrete customer specifica- tions on the basis of existing technologies; in the  medium term (up to 15 years), advanced product  designs are created from which technology re- quirements are derived; and long term (up to  2050), a technology radar is used to develop pilot  concepts and initiate enabling technologies.  Product and technology development is concen- trated at the Munich location, with some activities  being carried out at the Hannover, Ludwigsfelde  and Rzeszw sites.  In 2017, 199.7 million euros (2016: 208.6 million  euros) were spent on research and development.  R&D as a proportion of revenues was 4 percent,  slightly below the previous years level of 4.4 per- cent. A large portion of research and development  spending goes toward improving the environ- mental sustainability of aircraft engines (lower  fuel consumption, weight reduction, lower CO2  emissions, noise reduction). We are currently working on about 150 techno- logy projects from all departments, which we  systematically align to our corporate objectives.  Our system of intellectual property management  ensures that we protect our technological ex- pertise. On average, MTU employees file 400  patents and make about 200 invention disclosure  reports each year. At the end of 2017, MTUs  patent portfolio encompassed 3,510 property  rights, primarily in the technology areas of manu- facturing, compressors and turbines.  To sustain MTUs technological expertise, it is  important to be adequately plugged into the  research landscape. The company is involved in  all major national and European research pro- grams. In addition, MTU cooperates with numer- ous universities and research institutions in  Germany and maintains centers of excellence  devoted to specific priority research topics at  selected universities.  In financial year 2017, MTU launched an ideation  challenge intended to intensify the use of its  employees knowledge and creativity and thus  grow its capacity for innovation. The ideation  challenge kicked off with a pilot project on  additive manufacturing and bionic designs. Over  the next few years, innovation management will  become more of a focus than in the past; it is  firmly enshrined in the corporate strategy and,  for the first time as of 2018, in the corporate  objectives. We are currently developing a concept  for an interdisciplinary, future-oriented innovation  management system.

Launched  in 2014, Clean Sky 2 aims to make  aviation even cleaner and more  efficient. MTU is working on the next  generation of Geared Turbofans,  designed to be more fuel-efficient,  cleaner and quieter—thanks to new  technologies for the low-pressure  turbine and high-pressure compressor  components, which MTU develops  and validates. To this end, MTU  experts are building an experimental  apparatus for low-pressure turbines  and a demonstrator for the compres- sor system at the German Aerospace  Center (DLR) in Cologne. The DLR is  where the test campaign kicked off  at the end of 2017 (see image left).  And by 2020, a demonstrator for  the new inner workings of the low-  pressure turbine (image below) will  be built and tested. The focus is on  new, lighter materials that are more  temperature-resistant.   <  Responsibility for products and for the supply chain  2.2 Eco-efficient engines 31  32 MTUs Clean Air Engine Agenda  >GRI G4-EN7, 27 The aviation industry is characterized by long  product cycles, with aircraft engines as a rule  spending 30 years in service before they are  decommissioned. Goals to produce more eco- efficient engines therefore have a long-term  perspective and are established in memoranda  of understanding by the aviation stakeholders  (airlines, aviation industry, research, aviation  authorities). In Europe, goals aimed at cutting  fuel consumption as well as CO2 and noise emis- sions are defined in the SRIA, which forms the  basis for all national and European technology  programs as well as for the MTU Clean Air Engine  Agenda (Claire). The International Air Transport  Association (IATA) has set similarly ambitious  goals. Our Clean Air Engine Agenda sets our own eco- efficiency targets, derived from the SRIA, through  to 2050 (change compared with an engine from  the year 2000, per passenger kilometer). These  targets concern fuel consumption, CO2 emissions  and noise emissions. The next MTU goal is set  for 2030 and intends to reduce the fuel consump- tion and carbon footprint of future engines by 25  percent and cut noise by 50 percent. By 2050,  the company aims to cut fuel consumption and  carbon footprint by 40 percent, and noise by 65  percent. Responsibility for products and for the supply chain  2.2 Eco-efficient engines Implementation of the Clean Air Engine Agenda  2030 is based on the Geared Turbofan, a new  type of engine co-developed by MTU in collabo- ration with Pratt & Whitney. In the next generation,  this engine will be refined into an ultra-high by- pass engine with higher bypass ratios, pressure  ratios and temperatures, with the aim to lower  CO2 and noise emissions. MTU is already working  on the preliminary design of this engine. MTU develops the requisite technologies for this  generation of engines, such as integrated com- pression and expansion systems or high-tempe- rature lightweight materials, within the German  national aviation research program LuFo and  European technology programs. These technolo- gies are being further developed in collaboration  with partners in initiatives such as the Clean  Sky technology program, until they are mature  enough to be applied in product development.  In the next stage, which runs until 2050, entirely  new concepts will be put into practice, such as  integrated and distributed fans to increase thrust  efficiency or highly efficient heat engines. Due to the long-term approach to improving the  aviation industrys environmental performance,  no annual targets are set for eco-efficient engines  or corresponding performance indicators col- lected.

MTU was in charge of testing an  engine demonstrator on its test rig. 33 Upgrade for existing products  >GRI G4-EN7 Besides developing new engine models, engine  manufacturers are also introducing upgrades  for existing products to improve their energy  and carbon footprint and increase their service  lives—even though every change subsequent to  type approval has to be recertified for safety  reasons. Examples from the MTU product port- folio include the V2500 SelectOne (1% reduction  in fuel consumption/approx. 20% increase in  service life) and the V2500 SelectTwo (1.5%  reduction in fuel consumption/approx. 20% in- crease in service life). The fuel efficiency of the  GEnx-2B was improved by 1.6 percent as part  of a Performance Improvement Package, and a  further upgrade extending its service life is  planned for mid-2018. Saving fuel not only mini- mizes resource consumption and environmental  impact, but also reduces airlines operating costs,  of which the fuel kerosene accounts for about  30 percent.  MTUs climate strategy  >GRI G4-EN27 Climate change is one of the greatest global  challenges of our time. It is generally accepted  that CO2 emissions caused by human activity are  largely responsible for global warming, and that  the increasing mobility of the human population  is a contributing factor. According to the Inter- national Energy Agency, global air traffic is res- ponsible for some 2.4 percent of CO2 emissions  around the world (data from 2011). MTU has  committed to environmental protection and  pursues specific goals as part of its climate  strategy, particularly for products, as the vast  majority of CO2 emissions are caused during the  products service life. and LEMCOTEC—were completed at the end of  2017. With the new technologies derived from  LEMCOTEC, E-BREAK and ENOVAL, the European  engine industry has achieved the SRIA target  for 2020 with respect to fuel and CO2 reduction.  The SRIA goal for 2020 for cutting flight noise  has not yet been achieved. Some milestones that  we have reached in connection with our Clean  Air Engine Agenda 2017 are described in detail  in the 2017 Annual Reports non-financial state- ment on page 100 and in the objectives in the  annex to this report. 32 ACARE 2020** SRIA 2020 SRIA 2035 SRIA 2050 CO2 emissions, aviation CO2 emissions, engine NOX emissions, mainly engine *  Changes compared to year 2000, per passenger kilometer ** By way of comparison: original ACARE 2020 targets (ACARE=Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe) *** Based on same improvement of aircraft and engine -75% -43%*** -90% -60% -30% -84% -50% -20% -80% -43% -20 % — Climate goals* Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)  Responsibility for products and for the supply chain  2.2 Eco-efficient engines As air traffic continues to see strong growth, eco- efficiency is a key topic for the future of the avi- ation industry. Forecasts by aircraft manufacturers  Airbus and Boeing indicate that global air traffic  will double every 15 to 20 years. The number of  airline passengers was a record-breaking 4.1 bil- lion in 2017. By 2036, IATA predicts this number  will grow to 7.8 billion. Ambitious climate targets  such as the SRIA agenda, the IATA targets, or the  2016 climate agreement on offsetting CO2 emis- sions reached by the UN civil aviation organization  ICAO are intended to make air flight more sus- tainable.  With the climate strategy enshrined in the over- arching Clean Air Engine Agenda (Claire), we  are pursuing a multi-stage plan for reducing CO2  emissions by 25 percent by 2030 and 40 percent  by 2050. This will also let us secure a decisive  competitive edge in the market, since engines with  improved carbon footprints consume less fuel,  which translates into lower operating costs for  the customer. The ICAO is successively tightening  its environmental regulations for aviation, and  further limits, such as for non-volatile particulate  matter, are to be expected. As an integral part of our research activities, we  regularly compile interim reports in which we  compare our progress to our objectives and  measure our goal attainment. All points of the  Clean Air Engine Agenda concerning CO2 emis- sions are proceeding on schedule. The milestones  achieved in reporting year 2017 are listed on  page 77 of this report and are also described in  detail in the Annual Reports non-financial state- ment on page 100. Furthermore, MTU actively promotes efforts to  spread the use of sustainable fuels with low carbon  content through aireg e.V. (Aviation Initiative for  Renewable Energy in Germany). The company  co-founded the initiative with airlines, manufac- turers and research institutes and heads the  working group on fuel utilization. In addition to  increasing the energy efficiency of engines, using  alternative fuels is also an important approach  for reducing the CO2 emissions produced by  aviation. By 2025, aireg aims to have Germany  using 10 percent biokerosene. MTU supports  this undertaking as an active member of the  organization. Challenges & trends  >GRI G4-EC2 A much-discussed topic concerning the future of  aviation is electric flying. MTU is also looking at  this issue, collaborating with research partners  to conduct studies on all conceivable concepts  in order to be prepared. The key findings are that  current technology is still several decades away  from electric-powered passenger aircraft the size  of an A320. If development of battery storage  capacity continues to advance (at 5 percent  annually), electric-powered regional aircraft might  be possible in 30 years. Initial concepts have  been drawn up for batteries with the necessary  capacity to power short- and medium-haul air- craft, but implementation in practice will require  a few more decades of development. At present  Lars Wagner Chief Operating Officer MTU Aero Engines AG We are systematically reducing noise and CO2  emissions and are fully committed to the aviation  industrys overarching climate goals. We have  enshrined climate and resource protection in our  MTU Principles—these Principles apply to our  products and our production process in equal  measure.  34 The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) reports that the climate impact of  air traffic is due mainly to CO2 emissions, ozone  production as a consequence of NOX (nitrogen  oxide) emissions, and the formation of contrails  and cirrus clouds. CO2 emissions have the greatest  impact on climate. For MTU, the greatest potential  lies in reducing greenhouse gases by developing  engines that are more energy efficient. New com- bustor concepts can significantly reduce NOX  emissions, but as combustors are not a core MTU  component, the company cannot directly affect  in-flight NOx production. However, we can have  an indirect impact by making efficiency improve- ments. With the new heat-exchanger concept, we  are developing an engine that produces consider- ably lower NOX emissions due to the lower pres- sures involved. Depending on the weather con- ditions, contrails and cirrus clouds are generated  at higher flight altitudes and can be mitigated by  means of different flight paths or flying at lower  altitude.   2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 1 2 3 4 5 Relative change the development of CO2 emissions  IATA targets CO2 emissions Business as usual Efficiency +2%/year Air traffic +5%/year  CO2 neutral growth from 2020 onwards  absolute reduction of CO2 emissions by      2005 compared  New aircraft  concepts New engines/ propulsion concepts Air traffic  management Alternative fuels The aviation industry has committed itself to ambitious climate targets: starting in 2020, all  growth is to be carbon-neutral (goal of the trade association for the worlds airlines, IATA).

Hybrid drive concepts that combine electric  motors, generators, gas turbines and batteries  are opening up completely new possibilities in  aircraft design and propulsion technology. They  will continue to use kerosene, a fuel with high  energy density for greater range. MTU is already  testing these drive concepts as part of stage 3  of its Clean Air Engine Agenda. 35  Responsibility for products and for the supply chain  2.3 Responsibility for the supply chain 2.3 Responsibility for the supply chain We work with suppliers around the globe, whose services and products are a  key part of the value that our plants add. This is why we value sustainable  sourcing that complies with ecological and social criteria and upholds human  rights within our sphere of influence. environmental, social and compliance require- ments. To a large extent, the same standards  apply to both of MTUs business segments: new  and spare parts (OEM) and commercial mainte- nance, repair and overhaul (MRO). However, they  each have their own organizational units for  sourcing production material. Because todays supply chains are so global,  extensive and complex, we concentrate our efforts  regarding sustainability aspects on the supply  step immediately upstream (tier 1). However,  our direct suppliers are contractually obliged to  ensure that their subcontractors also abide by  our defined standards. In 2017, the MTU Group  purchased goods and services from 6,521 sup- pliers around the world (up from 6,249 the year  Management approach The value created by an MTU product contains  important pre-production stages at external sup- pliers. In keeping with our claim of sustainable  value creation and the expectations of our stake- holders, we uphold certain standards in purchas- ing. Responsible sourcing for us encompasses  environmental and social aspects as well as trans- parency in the supply chain. We have enshrined  the essential requirements for sustainability in  a code of conduct for suppliers, with which we  apply the same standards to our supply chain  that we do to our own business activities. MTU  requires every supplier to comply with this code  of conduct and communicate the requirements  on to its subcontractors.

The  purchasing volume was about 476 million euros  for the OEM business, 1.5 billion euros for MRO  (in each case, production material only) and a  total of 447 million euros for non-production  material.  Measured in procurement volume, the Western  Europe and North American markets, which are  so important generally for the aviation industry,  Responsibility for products and for the supply chain  2.3 Responsibility for the supply chain 37 account for the lions share of MTUs procurement.  Suppliers in the Americas (primarily the United  States) deliver 46.8 percent of OEM purchasing  volume and 85.3 percent of MRO purchasing  volume (production material only). Germany  accounts for 23.5 percent of OEM purchasing  volume (production material only). In the business  for new and spare parts, we procure across the  entire breadth of the supply chain, from blanks  to finished parts. We always source castings and  forgings externally, and the same goes for special  materials for which MTU has not built up manu- facturing expertise, such as electronic control  systems. If possible, we source our supplies  directly from manufacturers of blanks or finished  parts. MTU procures only a small proportion of  its raw materials directly. For commercial engine  modules, the average proportion of sourced parts  lies between 51 and 74 percent. We were able  to freely source 96.3 percent of the total OEM  purchasing volume and 100 percent of non-pro- duction material. By contrast, MRO purchasing  volume is subject to strict requirements imposed  by the relevant original equipment manufacturers  (OEMs). As a result, MTU Maintenance has less  room for maneuver in selecting suppliers. Local value creation is particularly important when  purchasing non-production material and services,  as is the wide variety of goods and services. We  procure non-production materials predominantly  in the regions in which we operate. The local  proportion of the purchasing budget (production  and non-production material) was 23.3 percent  in Germany, 7.8 percent in Poland, and 9.5 per- cent in Canada.

The code is informed by the ten prin- ciples of the UN Global Compact and contains  the following social and environmental standards:  respecting internationally recognized human  rights, observing the International Labour Organi- zations (ILOs) core labor standards, protecting  the environment and combating corruption. Each  contract signed by a supplier includes the com- mitment to abide by these principles and to  communicate them to subcontractors. The code  of conduct applies to suppliers of the European  manufacturing sites and of MTU Maintenance  Canada and MTU Aero Engines North America,  and therefore to 75 percent of the group reporting  entity. In our General Terms and Conditions of  Purchase for our European sites, we also insist  on compliance with the EUs REACh chemicals  regulation. Suspicions that the code of conduct for suppliers  may have been breached can be reported to MTUs  ombudsman (ombudsmann@mtu.de). Should a  supplier be implicated in charges of corruption,  extortion, embezzlement or the utilization of child  labor in the execution of a contract for MTU, the  collaboration agreement will be terminated with- out notice. If other principles of the code are  violated, the supplier must demonstrate that  suitable corrective measures have been initiated  and implemented and must guarantee this in  writing. No accusations of possible breaches of  the code of conduct were reported during the  period under review. Neither were there any  complaints about suppliers. MTU reserves the  right to carry out on-the-spot audits to verify  compliance with the code of conduct. Risk management and assessment We seek out long-term relationships with suppliers.  In the OEM business unit for aircraft engines, for  example, a large proportion of the materials and  services is based on contracts with a typical  term of two or more years. Contractually agreed  buffer inventories allow us to respond quickly  to fluctuations in demand. In the reporting year,  the MTU Group worked together with 1,014 new  suppliers, or 15.5 percent of the total. All sup- pliers are vetted before being accepted into MTUs  supply chain.

To cover environmental aspects, we demand  proof of certification to standards such as ISO  14001. We have revised our guidelines on the  approval of suppliers in order to take greater ac- count of environmental aspects, such as hazardous  materials. Using periodic evaluations, we regu- larly review existing suppliers, including with  respect to their ISO 14001 certification. In 2017,  we carried out a total of 403 audits on all major  suppliers, which included on-site inspections  and interviews. Once approved, suppliers of pro- duction material must regularly demonstrate their  ISO 9001 compliance for quality management  via re-certifications. To raise awareness of sustainability standards in  the supply chain, we regularly provide purchasers  with training on professional compliance behavior  and on the MTU code of conduct, which applies  to all the companys employees and prohibits  corruption, bribery, the granting of undue advan- tage, and anti-competitive behavior. MTU pur- chasers are also trained on the code of conduct  for suppliers. In addition, we offer special cor- porate responsibility trainings, including some  specifically for MTU purchasers. Code of Conduct for  MTU Suppliers  Focus on human rights   >GRI G4-HR6-7 In procurement, we take various steps to safe- guard the respect of human rights in the supply  chain. The issue of human rights plays a particu- larly significant role in the sourcing of certain  raw materials, specifically conflict minerals like  tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten, which can be  found in certain components of engines manu- factured by MTU. These minerals can cause pro- blems in procurement because they are sometimes  mined in Central African countries, where the  profits are used to finance armed conflicts in  which human rights are not respected. MTUs  commitment to sustainability includes a trans- parent value chain that excludes the use of conflict  minerals. We never deliberately purchase conflict  minerals, but they can find their way into our  production or pre-production at the various levels  of our global supply chain. According to the pro- visions of the Dodd-Frank Act applicable to com- panies listed on stock exchanges in the United  States, MTUs American partners and customers  require that MTU disclose the origin of minerals  used and limit its sources to certified mining com- panies and primary-alloy producers (Compliant  Smelter List). In turn, MTU demands that its relevant suppliers  should specify the origin of such minerals, in  order to ensure that the value chain contains  only conflict-free raw materials. MTUs procure- ment guidelines require suppliers to provide infor- mation about the source of minerals in accordance  with the EICC/GeSi Conflict Minerals Reporting  Standard. To date, no infractions have come to  the knowledge of MTU that infringe on the princi- ples of the Dodd-Frank Act.

MTU reserves the right to terminate any  contract with a supplier using child labor to manu- facture products supplied to MTU, without prior  notice. We are closely following developments in  the EU vis--vis new regulations on the use of  conflict minerals, which will go into effect in  2021, so that we can implement the provisions  in good time and as required.  Moreover, during the reporting period a risk  analysis was conducted for the first time for sup- pliers of sites in Germany, Poland and Canada.  The analysis looked at the individual countries as  well as sourced products and services (for A and  B suppliers, corresponding to about 95 percent  of total purchasing volume). The risk analysis by  country was based on the annual Global Slavery  Index compiled by the Walk Free Foundation,  which assesses countries according to standar- dized criteria on forced and child labor and legal  frameworks. MTUs risk matrix was established  in the OEM segment at the management level  and then adopted by MRO. This assessment found  no MTU suppliers in countries that represent a  risk according to these criteria. In addition, MRO  conducts a supplier evaluation twice a year for  suppliers of the German sites. The evaluation  covers sustainability aspects as well as a review  to check suitability for ISO 14001 certification.  In the future, we aim to incorporate information  on critical minerals into the overall supplier eval- uation with a view to creating a parts-based  lifecycle assessment.  Throughout MTU in 2017, no cooperation was  terminated because of sustainability deficiencies  or other complaints, nor did we discover any risk  of compulsory, forced or child labor at any of our  suppliers.  39  40 3 Environmental protection   in production Climate change and the scarcity of resources are global  challenges of our time that are also relevant for our  company. MTU develops, manufactures and maintains  engines and modules in a way that is as energy-efficient  as possible and minimizes emissions and raw material  consumption. We view environmental protection as our  corporate responsibility for our products and our manu- facturing operations.  3.1 Operational environmental protection Environmental protection is an important maxim guiding how we do busi- ness. At all our sites around the globe, we aim to be efficient in our use of  energy and resources, limit our emissions and avoid environmental risks.  We strive for continuous improvement in all these areas.  Environmental protection in production  3.1 Operational environmental protection 41 are laid down in documented process flows and  special standards. Minimum operating standards  for our machines and facilities, such as engine  test cells, are stipulated by national legislation and  local specifications. For machines and facilities  with environmental implications, this body of rules  and regulations is supplemented by approvals  from the authorities. We conduct measurements,  tests and inspections at regular intervals to  ensure our machines and facilities are operating  invariably in accordance with these rules and  regulations.  Management approach Environmental protection is an important principle  guiding our corporate behavior and is imple- mented in our business processes. It is also  enshrined in the global code of conduct for all  employees, where we express our commitment  to a policy of integrated environmental protection  that starts at the causes of pollution and evalu- ates in advance the environmental impact of our  production processes and products. We apply the  precautionary principle so as to keep negative  environmental impact to a minimum, and inte- grate insights from this into entrepreneurial  decisions. The most significant way we can help  protect the environment is by means of eco- logically efficient products, as the environmental  impact (energy consumption, CO2 emissions,  noise) of our products is greatest during their use.  Integrated environmental protection covers:  Making continuous improvements  Taking a precautionary approach  Involving employees  Limiting environmental impact  Carefully complying with statutory limits   and requirements  Using resources and energy sparingly Furthermore, we have embedded our environ- mental responsibility in the MTU Principles in  the section entitled Environment and society,  and our annual corporate objectives hold us to  high standards of environmental protection. To  this end, we take various steps at our locations.  Responsibility for company-wide environmental  protection is assumed by the Executive Board.  Uniform high standards are applied across the  MTU Group at the site level through an environ- mental management system that defines pro- cesses, responsibilities and targets. Environmental  protection is part of our integrated management  system (IMS). Internal standards are binding for  MTUs sites and, in some cases, exceed the  legal requirements. The stringent environmental  criteria apply to all divisions and processes and  < A GE90 on a test rig at MTU Maintenance Hannover.   We seek to conserve resources and protect the climate,   not only in our products, but in our manufacturing and   maintenance operations, too.  When building the blisk production center at our Munich location, we paid careful attention  to the energy efficiency of the structure. It uses waste heat from compressed air generation  and well water for cooling.  42 Environmental protection in production  3.1 Operational environmental protection Monitoring and assessments  >GRI G4-EN29, 34 Our goal is to constantly develop and refine our  operational environmental protection measures.  Independent external auditors and environmental  consultants conduct annual reviews to confirm  implementation of and adherence to the appli- cable environmental protection management  requirements, and provide recommendations for  improvement. MTU usually passes these reviews  with flying colors, as it did in financial year 2017.  This monitoring is supplemented by internal  inspections and audits. MTUs management con- ducts reviews to monitor and steer environmental  management in the company and to influence  its further development.  All production and repair facilities are state of  the art and are also subject to regular internal  and external monitoring and reviews. Emergency  management plans have been prepared to deal  with interruptions to operations with a negative  environmental impact. This includes regular  staff drills and instruction on what to do in the  event of an emergency. Furthermore, we inform  employees, external staff and visitors to the pre- mises of the Munich site as well as neighboring  buildings about the effects of potential malfunc- tions, as required by Germanys Hazardous  Incident Ordinance. MTU has comprehensive fire  protection measures in place that comply with  legal directives.  In 2017, there were once again no incidents at the  production sites with a negative environmental  impact, nor were any fines levied against the  company for breaches of statutory requirements  relating to the environment.

The Executive Board receives a quarterly  report on the consumption of energy (Scope 2)  and potable water at all the Groups production  sites. Individual managers are directly responsible  for environmental protection. They are advised  and supported in their environmental protection  efforts by the relevant technical departments at  their site. The environmental departments regu- larly share their innovations and best practices  across all sites. Employees are trained regularly  on matters relevant to the environment, such as the  safe handling of hazardous goods or chemicals. Some of the sites are certified to ISO 14001, the  international standard for environmental manage- ment systems, or are validated according to the  EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). Through our environmental management system,  we continually improve energy and resource  efficiency and minimize emissions of CO2 and  pollutants in production and maintenance. In this  way, we meet the expectations of our stake- holders. We use various measures to achieve  improvements in our energy and carbon footprints.  In 2017, we spent some 14.6 million euros in  total on investments and ongoing expenses in a  bid to increase our environmental compatibility.  The lions share of that went to climate protection.   Environmental protection in dialog with  stakeholders >GRI G4-EN34 We are in a dialog with our stakeholder groups  about MTUs environmental impacts. Stake- holders can direct complaints and report abuses  to us and we will follow up; this applies to em- ployees, suppliers, residents and other stake- holders. In the reporting year, MTUs production  sites received no substantiated complaints about  negative environmental impacts caused by our  operating activities.  We inform the public annually about our environ- mental impacts and environmental management  through statements issued by MTU for its sites  in Munich, Hannover and Berlin. We promote  greater environmental protection in industry and  business through the following global and local  initiatives:     UN Global Compact  German Environmental Management   Association (B.A.U.M.)  Bavarian Environmental Pact   (Umweltpakt Bayern)   Energy Efficiency Network for Munich and   Upper Bavaria  Munich Business Climate Pact   (Klimapakt Mnchner Wirtschaft)  YVR Airport Authoritys environmental   initiative We involve our employees in active environmental  protection endeavors and promote environmen- tally conscious behavior through awareness  events, information campaigns and training  courses at all our locations. These form part of  our code of conduct on environmental protection.  We launched our mission zero campaign in  Munich. With the projects in this campaign, we  aim to reduce resource consumption and emis- sions and encourage employees to take the  initiative. An employee program for saving energy  is planned as part of the mission zero campaign  for 2018. All fully consolidated production sites of the  MTU Group worldwide are included in our environ- mental reporting (Munich, Germany; Hannover,  Germany; Berlin, Germany; Rzeszw, Poland;  and Vancouver, Canada). Smaller office sites are  not relevant for our environmental impacts and  are therefore not included. 43 Environmental protection in production  3.1 Operational environmental protection Umwelterklrung 2018 Aktualisierte Fassung ber das Berichtsjahr 2017 fr den Standort Mnchen der MTU Aero Engines AG Umwelterklrung 2018 der MTU Maintenance Hannover GmbH (Daten und Zahlen 2017, aktualisierte Fassung) German versions only  Environmental protection in production  3.2 Energy and emissions 3.2 Energy and emissions When producing engine modules or engines in our plants, or when main- taining them in our maintenance shops, we aim to conserve resources as  far as possible. Energy-efficient processes require less energy and produce  fewer emissions. In this way, we are able to contribute to resource conser- vation and climate protection.  Management approach With the help of our environmental management  system, we aim to drive our resource-conserving  production forward, and gradually improve energy  efficiency in the manufacture of our products and  the maintenance of engines and modules. Our  goal is highly efficient production and mainte-  nance with minimal emissions of greenhouse  gases and airborne pollutants. We use raw mate- rials and energy sparingly. This maxim is ex- pressed to employees as a requirement via the  code of conduct and the MTU Principles. In this  way, we also create added financial value for  the company through lower energy costs. The  use of resources depends on batch sizes in pro- duction and maintenance. Given the current phase  of increasing capacity utilization in manufacturing  and maintenance, reducing the consumption of  resources and energy presents a particularly tough  challenge. MTU relies on a mix of renewable and non-re- newable energy sources and chooses energy  resources based on security of supply, cost  effectiveness and environmental sustainability.  As non-renewable primary energy, we use natural  gas, the aviation fuel kerosene, diesel and a very  small amount of heating oil. In Munich, we have  been operating a cogeneration plant (BHKW)  Measures for energy-efficient production/ maintenance  >GRI G4-EN6  Using well water for cooling purposes  Modernizing the district heating network  Improving thermal insulation  Using building automation systems  Using heat recovery systems  Using renewable energy  Using energy-efficient compressed air supply  Using energy-efficient lighting systems  Using waste heat from compressed air   generation  Using electric transport in the plants  Shutting down machines during disruptions   of production to reduce the base load since 2006 with renewable energy, generating  carbon-neutral heat and electricity. We procure  the renewable vegetable oil on which it runs from  certified sources. We began modernizing the  BHKW in 2017, and it will be operated using bio- methane starting at spring 2018. The Hannover  facility uses solar energy with the aid of a solar  thermal power plant. We also achieve greater  energy efficiency through having the sites use  waste heat from compressed air generation as  thermal energy (combination principle).      MTUs upgraded BHKW 2.0 runs on biomethane and, compared to conventional co-generation plants,  generates power much more efficiently and cleanly. 44  Environmental protection in production  3.2 Energy and emissions Energy sources used in 2017, Scope 1 and 2 (consumption in MWh and as a % share)  >GRI G4-EN3  Scope 1: Fossil fuels MWh % Natural gas  Kerosene Diesel 91,872 91,841 31 56,689 56,590 99 586 32.7 20.2 0.2 Scope 1: Non-fossil fuels Scope 2: Purchased energy Electricity Vegetable oil Production/development Heating Total Production related 149,147 53.1 121,935 9,683 131,618 43.4 3.4 46.9 District heating Energy consumption 280,765 280,635 Total Production related Development All test facilities Production related Development Plant filling station, emergency power, BHKW Scope 1: Total 0 Scope 2: Total We used less energy in 2017 than in the pre- vious year. Overall demand for Scope 1 and 2  was 280,765 megawatt hours (MWh) (2016:  299,158 MWh). The decline is due to lower con- sumption of kerosene for test runs in develop- ment. With our energy management system, we  manage primarily the consumption of our main  energy sources electricity and natural gas and  implement improvements. Together, these energy  sources supplied about three-quarters (76.1 per- cent) of the required energy in 2017. Only a very  small amount (<1 percent) of energy demand  was not related to production. Kerosene is used  as fuel for testing engines on the test cell, so  consumption depends on how extensive the tests  are and on engine size. As the Munich site con- ducted no comprehensive development tests,  the amount of fuel used in 2017 dropped by  some 23 percent. MTU has no influence on the  type and duration of test runs. Our digitalization  campaign is making strides toward increasing  the use of simulations in development and manu- facturing; the hope is that the latest computer- assisted simulation processes will reduce the  amount of development tests for new engines.  In MRO and for newly manufactured engines, all  engines must complete a test run prior to delivery  for safety reasons and to demonstrate their  performance.  Because BHKW 1.0 was decommissioned, the  use of certified palm oil as a renewable energy  source in the reporting year was zero. BHKW 2.0,  which we inaugurated at the end of 2017, is  even more efficient and runs on biomethane  since spring 2018. Compared to conventional  power plants, cogeneration plants produce energy  much more efficiently and emit less pollution. In  the reporting year, we invested some 2.4 million  euros in upgrading and modernizing our facilities  to expand our use of renewable energy. In 2017, we procured a total of 131,618 MWh of  external energy (Scope 2), somewhat more than  in the previous year (129,254 MWh). Purchased  energy is mainly electricity (92.6 percent of the  total energy in Scope 2). Our use of green elec- tricity is determined by the extent to which our  suppliers feed it into the grid. In the reporting  year, the proportion of green electricity at the  European production sites ranged from 13.5 per- cent (Rzeszw) to 59.7 percent (Hannover).  MTU Maintenance Canada gets all its electricity  from hydroelectric power stations and therefore  100 percent from renewable resources. 45 Production sites only; the vegetable-oil-powered BHKW was decommissioned in 2017 and a new facility went  live at the end of 2017.

We conti- nuously assess these emissions according to the  international Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol in  order to permanently reduce them. Of all the  greenhouse gases that the Kyoto Protocol lists as  having an impact on the climate—such as carbon  dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),  hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons  (PFC) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)—only the CO2    emissions are relevant for MTU. Our carbon foot- print is made up of direct greenhouse gas emis- sions (Scope 1) from sources owned by the com- pany and of indirect greenhouse gas emissions  (Scope 2) that come from the consumption of  bought-in electricity and district heating. CO2  emissions from business trips and transports in  the logistics chain fall under Scope 3.  In the reporting year, MTU emitted a total of  74,954 tons (2016: 77,546 tons) of CO2. Natural  gas accounted for the lions share of Scope 1  CO2 emissions at 24.6 percent, and aircraft fuel  kerosene accounted for 19.5 percent of all CO2  emissions.

The goal of this  investment is to reduce emissions caused by our  operating activities. The Clean Air Industrial Site  (CLAIR-IS) program operates at MTUs head- quarters in Munich. With the help of this program,  we are engaged in reducing the CO2 emissions  at the companys largest plant by 25 percent by  2020 (baseline year: 1990). In total, we have  already saved roughly 395,000 tons of CO2.  Simply by shutting down our production machines  gases: 55.8 percent. Demand for electricity and  natural gas is dependent on production volume;  the amount of kerosene, on the type and duration  of test runs.  for two weeks over New Years 2016-2017, we  were able to save some 800 tons of CO2. This is  roughly equivalent to the annual emissions attri- butable to 80 average German consumers.

It also up- graded its BHKW to produce more electricity on  site. The carbon-neutral BHKW will be powered  by biomethane; this should reduce annual CO2  emissions by 7,500 tons versus the previous  facility. The 15 major Munich companies in the  Climate Pact have committed to reducing CO2 by  a total of 40,000 tons during the Pacts three- year term. MTU committed to a target of 5,500  tons, but was able to achieve a total of 7,000 tons  by the end of 2017. In addition, the mission zero  campaign has launched various actions to mini- mize consumption and emissions.  To make our companys environmental impact  still more transparent, we take part in the annual  assessment by the international non-profit orga- nization CDP.  Transport and logistics  >GRI G4-EN17 We also involve our transport and logistics chain  in climate protection. Measures include opti- mizing routes for in-plant transport and using  vehicles with better environmental performance  or electric motors to reduce fleet consumption.  In Munich, for example, we are reducing the  company fleets CO2 emissions by setting a new  emissions limit and using two electric cars for  the internal mail system and site security. MTUs  principal maintenance site in Hannover has also  added two electric cars to its fleet. Other mea- sures are currently in the planning stage.   Furthermore, MTU promotes sustainable com- muting practices among its workforce, for example  through a special discounted job ticket for the  local public transportation network.  Emissions from the transport and logistics chain  (excluding owned company vehicles) fall under  Scope 3, for which we do not have comprehen- sive data.

The  use of kerosene, natural gas, electricity and  district heating from fossil fuels causes the  emission of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides,  sulfur dioxide and dust, which we also determine.  In 2017, absolute emissions of air pollutants in  the atmosphere totaled 248 tons. This is roughly  on par with the previous year (269 tons). At 159  tons, nitrogen oxides made up the majority. We  aim to reduce these emissions, too. For example,  generation of electricity and heat in the new  BHKW 2.0 cuts emissions of nitrogen oxides by  80 percent and of carbon monoxide by 66 per- cent compared to its predecessor.

Accordingly, we protect water sources and use water efficiently in the  manufacture and repair of our products. We aim to use as little potable  water as possible.  Management approach We use valuable resources such as water spa- ringly. We have effective water management  systems in place at all production sites. Our water  use also depends on production capacity. In  keeping with the precautionary principle, we treat  wastewater properly and in accordance with the  applicable legal requirements. We spent some  2.4 million euros on water protection in 2017.  The mission zero campaign we launched at  headquarters also aims to decrease water con- sumption overall (absolute reduction) or, when  production increases, to keep the increase in  water consumption at a lower rate than in the  past (relative reduction). The production sites  in Europe and Canada are not located in water- stressed regions, which are regions in which  water is a scarce resource.  Water use  >GRI G4-EN8, 10, 22 We use drinking water for production and mainte- nance processes, in sanitary facilities and in the  cafeteria. We use well water for cooling processes.  In 2017, the production sites of the MTU Group  required a total of just under 7 million cubic  meters of water (2016: 7.1), with 2.5 percent  potable water vs. 97.5 percent groundwater.  MTU increasingly uses Quaternary groundwater  extracted from its own on-site wells in Munich.  Increased consumption of potable water, having  gone up to 19,531 cubic meters (+12.7 percent),  is part of a multiyear trend and corresponds to  increases in production and the number of em- ployees. We use recirculated water as much as  possible in chemical process baths for applying  protective coatings to blades and also for the  process water in installations for testing compo- nent damage. This means we are able to reuse  large volumes of water and have to treat only a  small amount of waste water before discharging  it into the municipal sewers. As a result, we  saved some 600,000 cubic meters of water in  2017. Our sustainable water management also  includes a systematic inspection and renovation  of the well water and sewer canal networks. At  the Rzeszw site in Poland, for instance, we were  able to optimize use of cooling water. In its production processes that use water, such as the PECM process shown here, MTU is  careful to ensure efficient consumption. Water quality  >GRI G4-EN9, 24 MTU treats waste water in suitable sewage  systems according to the type and extent of  pollution. The quality of the discharged waste  water complies with the official requirements  issued for the respective location. Strict monito- ring at the sites ensures that legal limits are ob- served.

We conserve resources throughout the material cycle and see to it that we  have safe and proper waste streams with high rates of recycling. Management approach The long service life of our products and the con- tinuous improvement of our maintenance proces- ses reduce our demand for raw materials. In all  of our methods, we pay attention to efficiency  and seek to avoid waste. MTU develops its own  production and repair methods that are charac- terized by their high material efficiency. With its  repair beats replacement philosophy, MTU  Maintenance achieves a truly impressive depth in  aircraft engine repair. Using special techniques  the company has developed in-house, we repair  engine components that in other maintenance  shops would have to be replaced with new parts.  For example, we manage to give around 70 per- cent of all engine blades a second, third or even  fourth lease on life. We are gradually expanding  this product recycling approach to include new  processes with an eye to achieving even longer  service lives and thus greater material efficiency.  For instance, in the case of life-limited parts,  we have succeeded in repairing integrally manu- factured engine blades and disks, known as  blisks. These used to have to be replaced with  new ones when overhauling an engine. A key new field is that of additive manufacturing  (similar to 3D printing), which MTU has tapped  into in a way that holds great promise for engine  construction. Additive manufacturing enables the  quick 3D production of highly complex compo- nents and allows for more freedom in designing  them. Components are laser-melted directly  from a powder bed according to CAD data—with  no excess material. This significantly reduces  the amount of resources used. MTU is already  producing its first production components using  additive methods and is gradually expanding the  range of components as part of its digitalization  strategy. Preparations are currently under way  for manufacturing highly complex parts such as  seal carriers. Material consumption of alloys sourced for pro- cessing new parts and of consumables and  supplies was 9,755 tons in 2017, or about the  same level as the previous year (10,561 t). In  our push to establish a green office, we have  already decreased the amount of paper used in  our printers, but we want to go a step further  and increase our use of office supplies from  sustainable sources.

Our chief  priority is to try to avoid waste in the first place.  Leftover materials are reused, while waste is used  either for its materials or as energy; if recycling  is not possible, waste is disposed of properly.  In this way, we seek to minimize material con- sumption and waste disposal volumes. As a result,  we achieve high rates of recycling.  For the reporting period, we introduced interna- tional reports based on uniform waste categories.  These indicated that total waste produced came  to 7,103 tons. Measured against that total, the  MTU Group achieved an overall recycling rate of  87.5 percent; just 12.5 percent was disposed of.  The amount of waste produced and recycling  routes are dependent on production capacity  utilization and on building activities. The share  of hazardous waste in the reporting period was  42.3 percent. 73.5 percent of that was able to  be reused after proper processing. Construction  waste amounted to 596 tons and is due to  construction activities at the Munich site and  renovations in Hannover.   In 2017, no soil contamination was found at MTU  sites that resulted from hazardous materials or  pollutants. With sustainable waste management, MTU is able to achieve high rates of recycling: in 2017, the rate was about  88 percent. 54  Total waste Waste footprint  (in t) >GRI G4-EN23 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 4,640 4,611 5,072 5,656 7,103 Recycled 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 4,080 3,899 4,362 5,008 6.212 Disposed of 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 560 712 709 648 891 500 1,000 1,500 ,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 4,000 4,500 5,000 5,500 6,000 6,500 7,000 7.500 Production sites only; not including construction waste *2013-2016: Germany only; as of 2017: fully consolidated MTU Group according to uniform waste categories Hazardous waste 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 1,353 1,407 1,354 1,512 3,008 Recycled 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 837 737 691 906 2,211 Disposed of 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 516 670 663 605 797 Environmental protection in production  3.4 Material efficiency and waste  55  56 4. Employees and society Our employees are essential for MTUs success. We create  secure, attractive jobs in a future-oriented environment,  and our corporate culture enables our employees to make  the most of their potential. The company promotes cultural  and personal diversity, flexible working arrangements  and high-quality training and development opportunities.  Science and research are the cornerstones of our corporate  social responsibility.  4.1 Occupational health and safety We design MTU sites to be safe places to work, and our workplace  health management (BGM) system helps keep our employees healthy  and productive over the long term. In this way, we are laying the  foundation for a competitive workforce. Employees and society  4.1 Occupational health and safety 57 We strive to minimize health and safety risks to  our employees and third parties as far as possible,  while also seeking to make continuous improve- ments. Workplaces are regularly assessed for  any risks and hazards they present for employees  so that appropriate measures can be imple- mented where necessary. With the aim of per- manently reducing the number of accidents and  reaching a level of safety that aspires to prevent  any accidents whatsoever, the local occupational  safety officers record all accidents according to  uniform criteria and investigate them together  with the affected employees and their managers.  Where the analysis reveals notable accident  hotspots, the causes are investigated and ap- propriate steps taken to prevent a recurrence.  In addition, the company has a system in place  to record and evaluate near-misses at all pro- duction sites. All employees across the groups  production sites receive regular safety training,  and first-responders trained by charities are  appointed for all areas. Every two years, first- responders are obligated to attend a refresher  course. The local technical departments are  continually carrying out prevention work at the  companys sites through training sessions and  information on occupational safety issues. Management approach MTU places a great deal of importance on the  safety of its employees. Occupational safety and  employee health are enshrined as one of the key  principles of corporate social responsibility in  MTUs code of conduct. Compliance with national  statutory regulations on occupational safety is  embedded in the code of conduct as a manda- tory minimum standard for all international MTU  subsidiaries. In addition, we have set up internal  standards that lay down generally valid para- meters, rules and KPI definitions. A group report  is submitted to the Executive Board each quarter.  Occupational safety is organized and imple- mented at the operational level within MTU at  the individual locations: occupational safety is  the responsibility of the site managers and occu- pational safety officers are appointed at the  management level at each of the companys  production sites. Local technical departments  take action on occupational safety issues on  site and report regularly to the site management.  The workforce at the companys production  sites in Germany, Poland and Canada is repre- sented in locally organized occupational safety  committees, the composition of which includes  members of the works council. >GRI G4-LA 5 Occupational safety forms part of MTUs IMS  policy (integrated management system for quality,  industrial health & safety and environmental  protection). The occupational safety systems are  regularly reviewed and improved. At each of the  European production sites, workplace regulations  that are mandatory for all employees contain  important safety rules pertaining to accident  prevention, fire protection and what to do in the  event of workplace or commuting accidents.  The occupational safety systems in place at the  German production sites are certified externally  in accordance with the international Occupational  Health and Safety Assessment Series (OHSAS)  18001 standard, which covers 84.8 percent of  all MTU jobs. < Some 10,000 people work for MTU around the world.   We offer them long-term career prospects and nurture   individuals with talent and potential, so they can keep   taking us forward tomorrow, too. Occupational safety is a top priority for us—group-wide standards, such as wearing pro- tective gear, are in place. More information: Overview of certified MTU locations:  www.mtu.de IMS policy: Chapter 2.1 Product quality and  flight safety  58 Clear objectives for occupational safety >GRI G4-LA6 High standards in occupational safety across the  group are one of the companys annual corporate  objectives. For each location, we define annual  tolerance thresholds for category 4 reportable  workplace accidents (accidents that entail more  than three days lost). MTUs comprehensive oc- cupational safety systems reach a level of safety  that produced a group-wide accident rate for  2017 of 3.7 reportable workplace accidents per  1,000 employees. This is significantly below the  average for the German metalworking industry  (Wood and Metal Trade Association—BG Holz und  Metall) of 37 accidents per 1,000 employees.  Our actual objective is zero accidents, but we  use the tolerance thresholds mentioned above  because experience tells us that at this extremely  low level, there is no certainty that a lasting  annual reduction towards zero can be achieved.   MTUs accident statistics for 2017 showed a  positive trend, with a decrease in accident num- bers at almost all locations. For the group as a  whole, the number of reportable workplace acci- dents entailing more than three days lost was  33 in 2017, down from 43 in 2016—a reduction  of 25 percent. The number of days lost following  reportable accidents is falling overall (2017: 486,  2016: 606). This drop is accounted for primarily  by the German locations; other regions unfortu- nately saw an increase compared to last year.  The accident rate per 1,000 employees is lower  this year than last in both Germany and North  America; the rate for Europe (excluding Germany)  is higher as a result of two accidents at the MTU  Aero Engines Polska plant, but still low overall. Occupational safety takes account of the con- ditions prevailing at the individual business loca- tions. We develop proactive measures based  on regularly updated risk assessments, routine  inspections and audits. At the end of 2017, the  mission zero campaign was launched at our  headquarters in Munich with the aim of mini- mizing the number and severity of workplace  accidents. A local occupational safety initiative  has also been launched at MTUs principal main- tenance site in Hannover. This and other site- specific measures across the MTU Group for  2017 are described in detail in the non-financial  statement in the 2017 Annual Report, page 103.

Workplace accidents do not include any commuting accidents. The day of the accident does  not count as a day lost. Accidents involving temporary agency workers in 2017: 14 Reportable workplace accidents (entailing more than three days lost)  Health management  Health is a key success factor when it comes to  meeting entrepreneurial challenges. The only  way for MTU to stay in the lead is with healthy— and hence motivated and high-performing—em- ployees. We also want to integrate health more  strongly into our processes and structures than  before, especially considering demographic  change at MTUs German locations. That is why  we have a project to further develop the existing  company health promotion campaign at the  three German locations into a sustainable and  effective workplace health management (BGM)  system.  In 2016, we joined with the University of Heidel- berg in identifying eight strategic spheres of  activity for our two largest locations, Munich and  Hannover. These spheres will serve as a basis for  a successful BGM system, which we will syste- matically improve in this reporting year and be- yond. As part of this initiative, in 2017 we pre- pared an information and awareness campaign  on the BGM offerings in Munich, Hannover and  Ludwigsfelde, and launched it at the start of  2018. After a successful pilot project on systemic  ergonomics management (SEM) at our head- quarters in Munich, we expanded SEM to all  German locations in this reporting year. We also  draw up an ergonomics map as the basis for  measures and standards. Our next step is to  develop a concept that focuses on age-appro- priate workstations in a time of demographic  change in Germany. Key BGM measures that were developed,  expanded or rolled out in 2017  Manager qualification: Health-Oriented   Leadership  Further development of offerings designed   to promote health in the workplace  Risk assessments of psychological stress  Workplace reintegration management  Systematic ergonomics management  Offering screenings for early diagnosis We systematically promote the health of our  workforce with a clear emphasis on prevention.  Our goal is to motivate our employees to adopt  healthy lifestyles and take more responsibility  for their choices. Health services at the German  sites cover occupational and emergency medicine  as well as general preventive medicine, while  counseling services offer employees support with  performance and work-related issues as well as  mental health issues. Additional benefits offered  by MTU include fitness centers at our German  sites, which are run either in-house or by external  partners, as well as physiotherapy, ergonomics  training and on-site vibration training. All our  German locations provide employees and man- agers with access to occupational health profes- sionals (in-house or external) as well as social  counselors and supplementary in-house and  external services. Starting in June 2017, we  launched Active Days at our Munich location, a  health management training initiative designed to  raise awareness of our diverse range of offerings.  In Germany, the health rate for the reporting  period held constant at 94.6 percent (compared  to 94.4 percent last year; this rate is determined  only for Germany). Our sites outside of Germany offer a range of  health-related services. For example, employees  in Vancouver, Canada and Rocky Hill, USA, have  access to a free Employee Assistance Program.  It offers a wide variety of health and counselling  options on topics such as financial planning,  mental health, and personal or family counselling,  as well as advice on equipping workplaces in a  way that promotes good health. At our location  in Rzeszw, Poland, the basic medical services  for employees include a doctor who is on-site  once a week, psychological support as needed,  and flu shots. In addition, in 2017 the location ran  campaigns for cancer screenings and prevention  of cardiological conditions. When it comes to promoting the health of our employees, we place special emphasis on  prevention— here, a campaign at the Rzeszw location in Poland. 59 Employees and society  4.1 Occupational health and safety  Employees and society  4.2 Responsible and attractive employer 60 attractive employer also helps us in our efforts  to promote diversity in the workforce.  As an employer, we not only want to be seen  as attractive, we also want to demonstrate res- ponsibility towards our employees. We create  long-term, secure employment based on key  principles of corporate social responsibility.  These social and labor standards are defined in  a group-wide code of conduct and incorporate:  Observance of human rights  Equal opportunities in the workplace  Dealings with suppliers, customers and   business partners in industrial relations  Cooperation with employees, employee   representatives and labor unions  Entitlement to appropriate remuneration  Occupational health and safety  Employee training and development   4.2 Responsible and attractive employer As an employer, we offer an attractive working environment that is marked  by a sense of social responsibility. This should enable employees to develop  themselves over the long term and contribute in their own personal way to  the success of MTU. For us, this is also the basis for finding the right talent  for our future projects and activities. Management approach We are an important driver of technology in the  high-tech sector of aviation. Being perceived as  an attractive employer by existing and potential  employees is one of the key ways in which MTU  bolsters its innovative capabilities and com- petitiveness. In addition, we are competing with  other companies for the best people in Germany  and at our international locations in Canada and  the United States. We want to expand our loca- tion in Rzeszw, Poland, adding some 200 new  jobs at MTU Aero Engines Polska by 2020, pre- dominantly in the areas of new technologies and  projects. In Germany, we are currently looking for  several hundred specialist staff. Being perceived  as an attractive and future-oriented employer is  therefore important for all international MTU sub- sidiaries. We support a wide range of initiatives  to give our employees more options and enable  them to take more responsibility. More flexible  working arrangements make it easier to achieve  a better work-life balance.

These include  flexible working arrangements for achieving a  better work-life balance, attractive remuneration,  a wide variety of options for personal and  career development, a holistic corporate health  management system, and promoting diversity.  At MTU, the way we work is based on mutual  respect and appreciation and promotes fair and  cooperative conduct. Hans-Peter Kleitsch Senior Vice President,  Human Resources MTU Aero Engines AG and internal company guidelines, and our prin- ciple of zero tolerance are described in detail in  Chapters 1.2 Compliance and human rights and  4.4 Diversity and equal opportunities.   As a signatory to the UN Global Compact, we are  committed to observing its principles of respect  for human rights and the implementation of fair  working conditions in accordance with the Inter- national Labour Organizations (ILOs) core labor  standards.  We are committed to respecting employees rights  and safeguarding their freedom of association  through the code of conduct. When drafting em- ployment contracts, we observe national statu- tory requirements as well as internal company  agreements and notice periods as laid down by  law. It is the duty of managers to ensure that  company agreements are properly observed on  a day-to-day basis in their areas of responsibili- ty. In 2017, 98 percent of the people employed  by the company in Germany were covered by col- lective agreements, a figure that stood at 86.6 per- cent worldwide in the same year.   Dialog with our employees For us, employment is a question of consistently  fostering an atmosphere of trust and respectful  collaboration in which we take our employees  concerns into account. In accordance with the  German Works Constitution Act (Betriebsver- fassungsgesetz), MTUs sites in Germany have  works councils that maintain regular, open and  trust-based dialog with management. The German  sites have a group works council that handles  group-related issues. At the companys inter- national sites in Poland and Canada, elected  employee representatives support the interests  of the workforce in dealings with management.  In addition, the interests of employees are re- presented on the supervisory board, where seats  are filled on the basis of parity.  We carry out an employee survey at regular  intervals to provide important impetus for the  companys ongoing development. This enables  employees and managers to identify potential  for improvements and ways to tap that potential.  Surveys of this kind are regularly conducted at  our German sites, in Poland, in Canada and in  the US (MTU Aero Engines North America). In  financial year 2017, we implemented measures  from the previous survey in Germany, introducing  what is known as silent working for uninterrupted  working in various areas. We will be surveying  our employees in Germany again in 2018; once  more, we will be collecting data for the High  Performance Organization Index, which measures  an organizations performance in terms of com- mitment, leadership, goals/strategy and pro- cesses/structures, and for the MTU Work Ability  Index, which gives an indication of whether a  teams working environment is conducive to  good health. We will also conduct an employee  survey in Poland in 2018. MTU Maintenance Canada is the  North American mainstay of the main- tenance business segment. MTU subsidiary Vericor Power Systems  specializes in gas turbines for marine  and industrial applications. Since 2009, MTU Aero Engines Polska  has been responsible for the Groups  development and production activities. In Munich, a number of halls house  manufacturing of various engine parts. Employees and society  4.2 Responsible and attractive employer 62 Responsibility for employment issues lies with the  Executive Board. The CEO is also the Director of  Labor Relations. MTUs human resources center  sets policy in line with the annual and long-term  growth targets laid down in our corporate strategy.  It also assists in efforts to achieve these targets.  All members of the Executive Board receive regu- lar reports on human resources policy. Respon- sibility for successful implementation lies with  local human resources departments and the  respective technical departments and managers. We adapt our human resources policy to take  account of changes relevant to us and reflect  these in the measures and initiatives derived from  this policy. In times of digitalization and techno- logical change, we face new challenges. We are  fully engaged with the key topics of digitalization,  leadership and health. Digitalization was one of  our corporate objectives for 2017; we provide  training in future-oriented skills and platforms,  and are bringing virtual technologies into every- day working for all MTU employees. In addition,  and with a view to the successful progress of  the MTU Group, we promote key aspects of an  innovative corporate culture, a creative environ- ment in which motivated employees can play  their part in maintaining the companys leading  position.   The outside view of MTU Alongside internal employee surveys and feed- back channels, external rankings offer valuable  pointers as to whether our recruiting and HR  processes are heading in the right direction. In  comparative analyses with other companies, MTU  has received consistently positive ratings. This  is especially underscored by the fact that MTU  regularly receives awards ranking it as a top em- ployer in Germany, Poland and British Columbia  (Canada).

This is recognized in the  form of top marks in the Secondary Benefits  and Work-Life Balance categories of national  employer rankings covering all the companys  major sites in Germany, Poland and Canada.  Our initiatives include:  Flexible working hours and flextime accounts  A wide variety of part-time working   arrangements   Educational leave   Teleworking  Sabbaticals  Part-time work for older employees  Parental leave  Job sharing  Services to assist families   (e.g. childcare, nursing services)  Mobile working  We are continuously improving these initiatives  to give people more job flexibility and meet the  expectations of our employees and job applicants.  Since 2017, employees at our headquarters in  Munich have had the option of mobile working  thanks to a new works agreement. In this way,  we have laid solid foundations for greater auto- nomy and personal responsibility among MTU  employees. Part-time working and parental  leave are core initiatives that employees avail  themselves of. Part-time work accounted for 6.6  percent of employment (data collected only in  Germany).  Remuneration and additional benefits >GRI G4--LA2, 11, 13 The right to appropriate remuneration is one of  the pillars of MTUs code of conduct. A stand- ardized, transparent compensation structure  ensures that employees receive competitive  remuneration that reflects their performance.  The remuneration of pay-scale employees in  Germany is based on collective bargaining agree- ments. Compensation for senior managers is  tied to the companys long-term performance.  MTU applies a consistent methodology for eval- uating performance at all levels of the hierarchy,  from senior managers to employees included  in collective bargaining agreements. The per- formance criteria are based on corporate, center  or departmental objectives and are designed to  measure how employees and managers contribute  to reaching these objectives. Goal attainment  is discussed during the year (milestone meeting)  and at year-end (goal attainment meeting). All  managers undergo performance reviews to eval- uate achievement of their personal targets, and  96.5 percent of MTU employees worldwide  regularly receive an evaluation of their perfor- mance (at least once a year). MTU offers a broad range of additional perquisites.  One example is the range of social benefits the  company offers in Germany in addition to its  statutory obligations. These include accident in- surance, profit-sharing, family-related and mobi- lity benefits, a healthcare service and disability  coverage. The company has a pension scheme  for all its employees. At our international locations  we offer a range of additional benefits such as  private life insurance, health insurance and  retirement planning support. In financial year  2017, the company made social contributions  totaling 114 million euros (2016: 102.6 million  euros). MTU enables its employees to share in the com- panys success. In Germany, this profit-sharing  scheme is made available to the entire workforce  and defined in special rules for each employ- 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Alternative working arrangements (Germany) >GRI G4-10, LA3   *Not comparable with previous years figures due to changes in workforce reference values The right to parental leave applies to the entire workforce in Germany and is governed by the German Parental  Allowances and Parental Leave Act.

Some of our international loca- tions offer their own long-term bonus schemes  (Rzeszw, Poland) or year-end and leaving bonuses  (Vancouver, Canada).  4.3 Employee development The expertise of our employees is one of our most important success  factors; thats why we offer a wide range of opportunities and avenues for  personal development. We promote lifelong learning to ensure the best  possible employee training, which makes jobs at MTU an attractive long- term proposition.   Management approach Qualified and motivated employees are indispens- able for driving innovation and ensuring compe- titiveness in the technically demanding aviation  industry. In many areas in which we are active,  aviation authorities prescribe additional qualifi- cation measures, such as mandatory training  for employees with certification authorizations  under aviation legislation. In addition to industry- specific vocational training and dual courses of  study aimed at building up knowledge over the  long term, MTU supports and promotes employee  training—this is a key principle of corporate social  responsibility as defined in the companys code  of conduct. Promoting vocational training oppor- tunities and avenues for personal development  for employees and managers is also enshrined in  the MTU Principles and group-wide HR strategy.  The head of human resources is responsible for  the training and development of employees  group-wide. The Executive Board is kept informed  about training indicators through the annual  education and training report, and occasionally  discusses important training initiatives. The great importance placed on training and  development is reflected in a group-wide works  agreement in Germany that guarantees access  to training for all employees and requires man- agement to conduct an interview with each  employee once a year to discuss their training  and development. This applies to 84.8 percent of  the workforce. At MTUs three sites in Germany,  the works council is also involved in employee  training in accordance with the German Works  Constitution Act (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz) and  has a say in the annual training and development  program.  We move with the times: starting last year, our employees have been able to take advantage of an e-learning portal. Employees and society  4.3 Employee development 65  Lifelong learning >GRI G4-LA10 Employee development and lifelong learning are  designed to hone and develop employees skills.  Our employees should enjoy opportunities for  professional and personal development throug- hout their careers. We systematically review  employees training requirements on an annual  basis as part of a standard process, either in a  direct conversation (training interview) or in  divisional / company-level interviews. Training  courses are evaluated in a personal meeting bet- ween the employee and their superior, or in some  cases via a feedback form.

Training  officers at MTU Group sites can be consulted at  any time for advice on needs-focused training.  To put employee development on a more future- oriented footing, we have set up an e-learning  portal for all employees in Germany that makes  access to training more mobile and more readily  available. This gives 7,500 employees the oppor- tunity to actively help shape their own develop- ment, and managers receive improved training  reporting for their area of responsibility. Since  the end of 2017, employees have been able to  use new electronic learning programs wherever  and whenever they want. By connecting digital  learning content with face-to-face training—an  approach known as blended learning—we have  expanded the variety of training options to put  MTU at the forefront of learning methods. At  this time of digital change, we are giving our  employees the chance to improve their future- oriented skills. Against this backdrop, high-quality  employee development plays an important part  in helping MTU make the most of the opportu- nities that digitalization presents to secure its  long-term position as a technology leader in the  aviation industry.  We invested 3.9 million euros in training schemes  group-wide in the 2017 reporting year, roughly  the same amount as in the previous year. On  average, each employee attended 2.3 days of  training, or a total of 21,971 training days. This is  less than in the previous year (22,324) because  of the large number of short-term courses.  Women made up 13.6 percent of participants in  training courses, which is in line with the  group-wide proportion of women in the workforce  of 14.1 percent. MTU supports and promotes employee training, and has enshrined this  idea in its social responsibility policy. Employees and society  4.3 Employee development 66  Employees and society  4.3 Employee development Strengthening leadership MTU attaches great importance to furthering the  personal and professional skills of all employees  on an ongoing basis. Key areas of focus in 2017  were consolidating leadership responsibility and  promoting internationalization and diversity in the  workforce. This was also one of MTUs corporate  objectives in 2017. Through effective leadership,  managers help to empower employees and also  contribute to the successful management of the  company. We want to support managers in their  important role through targeted measures.  With this in mind, MTU has continued with its  Business Challenge qualification initiative for  managers. Its objective is to promote a culture  of communication and encourage a holistic and  sustainable change in corporate thinking across  all levels of management and all locations. Busi- ness Challenge II places the emphasis on leader- ship, with the aim of promoting consistent leader- ship practices and a culture of feedback and  dialog, as well as making leadership more efficient.  In the 2017 reporting year, we gave an additional  series of presentations in Munich under the  heading Business Challenge to go. The talks,  which covered current topics such as the design  thinking method, were attended by managers  from all levels. At the Hannover location, for  example, leadership skills are strengthened in  the context of the leadership initiative. Events  were held for all levels (including foremen) in  2017 covering topics such as Top performance  and motivation or Management and leader- ship. In 2018 Business Challenge III will be  launched with new emphases. The main aim is  to make management even more effective through  clearly formulated expectations, open feedback  and responsible decisions, contributing to an  innovative corporate culture. The International Leadership Program (ILP) has  been established group-wide and is intended to  promote networking between managers across  all sites as the basis for a common understanding  of leadership in a global business environment.  Program participants are drawn from members  of the extended management with potential for  the next management level. With events held at  the sites in Vancouver, Canada, Rzeszw, Poland  and Munich, Germany in 2017, the ILP program  helped to promote an exchange across multiple  countries and locations. Managers from seven  locations took part. In addition, individual MTU locations have laun- ched leadership initiatives tailored to their speci- fic on-site requirements.

To this end, we have developed  a talent management process for identifying  people with the potential to assume key roles  and supporting them through personalized devel- opment programs. Our primary focus is on suc- cession planning for those positions that are  critical to our companys success. There is a  special trainee program for particularly promising  graduates in areas for which too few potential  managers have been identified. At MTU Aero  Engines North America, our U.S. engineering  facility, we have a program for entry-level engi- neering graduates that rotates them through a  variety of departments focusing on different  areas of aerospace engineering. We also face  Managers play a key role in the company, and we support them in that  with various programs and initiatives. 67  Training and apprenticeships We offer young people in Germany a solid  grounding in various trades, pursuing a holistic  approach that also covers social and ecological  topics, for instance through health and environ- ment days or through corporate social responsi- bility in local communities. Apprentices have  made up a constant proportion of MTUs work- force for many years; in the reporting period they  accounted for 4.1 percent of the total workforce  (4.8 percent in the previous year). MTU employed  287 apprentices on average in 2017. In addition,  we offer practical courses of study in collabo- ration with selected vocational academies. We take part in selected local educational projects  and initiatives in an effort to attract potential  recruits early on:  Training Night  IdeenExpo science exhibition in Hannover  Nature and Technology Days  Teachers in Industry  Girls Day  Research Camp for Girls  EUROTEC The next generation is particularly important to us: besides  apprenticeships, we also offer trainee programs and develop- ment programs for high-potential employees. the challenge here of determining how to retain  talented employees and help them grow.  The following initiatives are aimed at helping the  company preserve valuable expertise and expe- rience (examples):  A know-how buddy system  Exchange of expertise with the aid of   knowledge maps  Wikis Employees and society  4.3 Employee development 68  69 4.4 Diversity and equal opportunities  Successful collaboration among employees of different cultures,  generations and genders makes us more innovative and competitive.  This is why we promote diversity and equal opportunities within MTU. Management approach MTU is actively committed to equal opportunities  and equal treatment of all employees and takes  a clear stand against discrimination in the work- place. These are the principles that underpin  MTUs corporate behavior and are set out in its  code of conduct. We assign employees to posi- tions in accordance with their skills, abilities and  performance. Everyone has the same opportuni- ties regardless of their gender, ethnic origin,  age, religion, disability or sexual orientation.  Promoting diversity is a key component of the  corporate culture and business success that is  enshrined in the MTU Principles. We firmly believe  that a diverse workforce bolsters a companys  innovative capabilities and competitiveness. For  us, diversity means having an intercultural and  mixed-age workforce with equal opportunities  for different genders. An important prerequisite  for this is for all employees to enjoy fair oppor- tunities and full integration into working life and  company life. Promoting a diverse and inter- national workforce has been one of our annual  corporate objectives since 2016, with the aim of  helping to create an innovative corporate culture. MTU views fostering female talent and equal  participation of women in management as its  greatest innovation potential. We see broad  scope for action here, especially in Germany.  The Executive Board is kept regularly informed  about the diversity concept with respect to the  promotion of women and related measures.  Furthermore, the Executive Board presents a  report on equality at the works meeting once a  year. In Germany, the works council is involved  in decisions subject to co-determination, such  as flexible working time rules. MTU commits to diversity and equality of oppor- tunity in the following external initiatives:  Charter of Diversity  UN Global Compact  Munich Memorandum for Women   in Management To ensure diversity and equal opportunity within  the company as well as to prevent discrimination,  MTU embraces a corporate culture based on  respect and appreciation that promotes fair and  cooperative conduct. Managers have a key role  to play in recognizing the value of diversity and  incorporating it into everyday working life at MTU.  We help them strengthen diversity in their own  sphere of responsibility and exploit its benefits  to the full. For us, promoting equal opportunities  is less a question of introducing new initiatives  and more a question of promoting the acceptance  of existing ones and offering new ways of working  such as mobile working. This is why over the next  few years, MTU wants to do even more to heigh- ten managers awareness of their responsibility  to promote equal opportunities, particularly work- life balance. We also want to ensure diversity and equal op- portunities by putting in place clear grievance  mechanisms. Processes have been set up to  allow reporting of breaches of the code of con- duct or of internal guidelines. Employees across  the Group who suspect breaches of the code  of conduct can contact an ombudsman confi- dentially. Managers, the works council and  members of the human resources department  are also designated as persons of trust in this  context. The company fosters talented women with the goal of placing more women in management  positions. Employees and society  4.4 Diversity and equal opportunities   Women in management We attach particular importance in this context  to gender diversity in order to make better use  of talent potential in the face of demographic  change and better position the company for the  future. One important goal is to increase the  proportion of women in management positions  at the German sites—we aim to achieve 13 percent  by 2022 for all management levels except the  Executive Board level. At the end of 2017, this  proportion was 9.7 percent. The principal focus  of the initiatives worldwide and especially in  Germany is to secure more female talent for the  company and offer female employees greater  support throughout their careers. We elaborate  these initiatives at the individual locations and  implement them locally. Our Development Centers  in Germany and Poland help female talent draw  up a personal development plan to assume a  management function in the short term. Since  2003, we have participated in the Cross-Mentoring  program organized by the City of Munich, in which  high-potential female employees are supported  for a year by a mentor from another company,  and MTU managers also become involved as  mentors.  The proportion of women in management posi- tions was 10.3 percent group-wide, compared to  10.7 percent in the previous year; at the German  locations it was 9.7 percent (2016: 10.1 percent).  Despite this slight drop, we are well on the way  to achieving our goal of 13 percent. An analysis  of this can be found in the non-financial state- ment in the 2017 Annual Report, page 106.

The Womens  Career Index is an external tool for evaluating  career opportunities for women in business  enterprises. Employees and society  4.4 Diversity and equal opportunities  70  Generational diversity We believe in good relations between young and  old, and we take age diversity into consideration  in our company. An aging workforce in Germany  also presents us with new health challenges. In  addition, the length of time people spend working  from career entry to retirement is growing. This  is why we are expanding our company health  promotion campaign into a sustainable and effec- tive workplace health management system. Our  aim is to keep our employees healthy and pro- ductive over the long term. Employees in every  age group have equal access to training and  development. We offer a range of measures for  younger generations: apprenticeships, trainee  programs, development programs for high- potential employees (for example, Building on  Talent), etc.  For us, it is each individuals employability that  counts, and this extends to the integration of  employees with disabilities. In 2017, disabled  employees represented an average of 5.7 percent  (2016: 5.6 percent) of the workforce at MTUs  German locations, which are subject to statutory  requirements. Cultural diversity As a globally active company, we consider inter- nationalization to be a key indicator of diversity.  Our engine business has a global outlook, and  having an intercultural workforce helps us to be  successful in different markets. As a long-estab- lished player in the industry, we have strong roots  in Germany, but our character draws on a variety  of cultural backgrounds. We bring together em- ployees from 50 countries. In line with our corpo- rate objective, we are taking various steps to  enhance the international nature of our business  (International Leadership Program, International  Building on Talent).  We encourage new recruits to spend time working  abroad even before they finish their apprentice- ship, traineeship or dual vocational training pro- gram. They are given the opportunity to take part  in international exchange programs with our  partners or work on international project assign- ments within the MTU Group. As part of the  management transition coaching program, we  provide support to managers moving to a new  position whether in country or abroad.

As we drive aviation technology forward, we ourselves rely  on a new generation of well-trained employees and an innovation-friendly  business environment. In addition, we support social projects that have a  local impact close to our business locations.  Management approach Corporate social responsibility is an integral part  of the MTU Principles, which state: MTU takes  a proactive approach to its responsibility toward  society. Particularly in the case of its sites in  Germany and Poland, the company is a major  regional employer offering a wide variety of jobs  in an attractive, high-tech environment. This has  a positive effect on the region in which the sites  are located, including in less economically suc- cessful regions such as Brandenburg, Germany.  We also offer apprenticeships in various trades  in Germany. We offer all employees long-term  perspectives for their employment at MTU. In  addition to training and developing our employees,  we invest in the ongoing development of our  plants, as we are currently doing in Munich,  Germany and Rzeszw, Poland. In this way we  contribute to social development at our locations.  We also strive to strengthen MTUs image as a  responsible corporate citizen. We are well aware of our corporate social res- ponsibility to the communities around our busi- ness locations; our focus is on education, science  and research and we support local and regional  projects near our sites as a promoter, sponsor  and network participant.  Corporate citizenship As a research-focused company, our concept of  corporate citizenship revolves around science and  engineering initiatives. We seek out interaction  and collaboration with the world of science and  research and foster dialog with young people and  new talent.  We offer young people a solid grounding in various  trades, and employed and trained 287 appren- tices on average in 2017. In addition, MTU colla- borates with German vocational academies in  Stuttgart, Ravensburg and Berlin as well as with  Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University  to offer practical courses of study in business  administration, information technology, mecha- nical engineering and business engineering. We  provide training where it is needed most, pursuing  a holistic approach comprising the acquisition  of professional qualifications as well as metho- dological competence and social skills. We involve  our apprentices in all aspects of company life,  including health, environmental protection, social  values and our no-blame culture as well as orga- nizing special open-door and awareness events.  In addition, MTU participates in numerous edu- cational projects and initiatives for children and  young people as it strives to enhance peoples  understanding of technology and sustainability  in society as a whole. Employees and society  4.5 Corporate Social Responsibility 72 We are committed to  nurturing young talent,  and every year we train  young people for a range  of careers.

These  are generally charitable organizations, preferably  with a social focus, to which we provide assis- tance in the form of financial or in-kind donations.  A key factor in selecting recipients is a local/ regional connection or a thematic link to our busi- ness. We prioritize support specific projects over  general institutional funding, which are selected  and implemented independently by the MTU  subsidiaries concerned on the basis of careful  research. The granting of donations and sponsor- ship is governed by internal guidelines. A cent- rally managed clearance and approval process  ensures that the rules are adhered to. In 2017 we dedicated resources to almost 50  projects and institutions in communities close  to our locations. For instance, managers from  Operations spent a day at the Montessori School  in Dachau near Munich, where they built a wooden  outdoor seating area. They also answered ques- tions about MTU, jobs and apprenticeships in  discussions with teachers and students. We regu- larly support various projects run by the Wings  of Help charity, such as financing an electricity  generator in Puerto Rico in 2017.

This is covered  by an internal company agreement. In addition,  MTU allows staff to undertake projects with the  German Federal Agency for Technical Relief  during their paid working day, and offers the  services of lay justices for labor tribunals and  social justice courts and of examiners for the  Chambers of Industry and Commerce. Employees  at MTU Aero Engines Polska worked together to  set up a public childrens playground (MTUlandia)  in the city.  Each month, employees at MTU Aero  Engines North America cook a com- munity meal for people in need in  and around East Hartford in support  of the Hands on Hartford agency. 75 Employees and society  4.5 Corporate Social Responsibility Employees have set up a public play- ground in downtown Rzeszw, with  plans to expand it in the future.
