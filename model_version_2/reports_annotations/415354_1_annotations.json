Castellum reports on our sustainability activities in accordance with the Global  Reporting Initiatives (GRI Standards) Core level. Consideration has been given to  the GRIs industry-specific supplement for the construction and real estate sector.  Castellum presents the Sustainability Report annually, and this document supplements  the information provided in the Annual Report.  In this document we account for the sources of the data, assumptions and conversion  factors used in the context of our sustainability reporting. No significant changes oc- curred in Castellums organization or chain of suppliers during 2017.  EPRA Performance Measures Castellum reports the companys sustainability indicators based on EPRAs   (European Public Real Estate Association) latest recommendations: Best Practice   Recommendations on Sustainability Reporting, sBPR), third version September 2017.  Castellum reports sustainability indicators for all 28 of the EPRA sBPR Performance  Measures. Indicators are reported for energy, greenhouse gas emissions, water, waste  and the proportion of environmentally certified buildings, corporate governance and  social aspects.  EPRA Overarching Recommendations Organisational boundary Castellum limits its report to properties controlled by the Group (operational control)  in accordance with the principles of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Operational control  has been chosen since it provides Castellum with the best conditions for demonstrating  statistics and data that Castellum can directly influence. Properties where customers  are responsible for contracts for energy-supply, water and waste-removal are thereby  excluded. Moreover, in cases where customers are responsible for contracts, Castellum  does not own the measured data and thus has difficulty verifying and reporting such data.  Coverage Castellum works actively to access relevant data for the properties that the Group owns  and manages. Having access to data is important to Castellum, as the information creates  conditions for efficient and sound technical management of the buildings. Castellum  currently enjoys good access to measurement data for virtually the entire portfolio.  The proportion of properties included in each indicator is mentioned in connection  with respective key indicators. Note that the proportion of possible properties to report  in absolute terms for the respective year includes properties sold in the current year,  excluding land. In cases where Castellum acquires companies, and therefore access to  data, on energy, water, carbon dioxide and waste, the previous years data for these   properties is also included in absolute terms – as well as like-for-like – to provide a  more accurate comparison of the change.  Castellum does not, however, have access to measurement data for all properties.  Missing information is primarily accounted for by waste-removal, because waste-  removal contractors are unable to provide statistics for all properties. Information can  also be spotty for absolute energy and water figures, where changes in the portfolio  – i.e. recently purchased, sold and project properties – complicate access to relevant  measuring data. Castellum constantly strives to access all relevant data as comprehen- sively as possible. In total, Castellum owned 671 (640) objects at the end of 2017, excluding properties  that only consists of land.  Estimation of landlord-obtained utility consumption No data are estimated; all data reported are measured and assured.  Third party assurance Castellums Sustainability Report – in accordance with GRI Standards and key sustai- nability indicators according to the EPRA sBPR Performance Measures – is reviewed  by Deloitte AB, in accordance with ISAE 3000, see assurance report on page 145 of  the Annual Report 2017.  Boundaries – reporting on landlord and tenant consumption Castellum only reports the energy purchased by Castellum as landlord. Hence, Castellum  does not report tenant electricity consumption, as the Group mostly does not have access  to data. Nor can Castellum directly affect tenant electricity consumption, making the  statistics somewhat less relevant. Please see the EPRA table for data reported. CASTELLUM SUSTAINABILITY DATA 2017     3  Normalisation Castellum calculates energy intensity key ratios through dividing by the buildings total  floor area. This is the most widely accepted method in Sweden by which to compare  energy utilization and resource consumption.  Castellum uses the SMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute) degree- days for the normalization of energy used for heating.  Segmental analysis (by property type, geography) Castellum reports sustainability data that is divided into separate building types: office  and retail premises, logistic premises as well as projects – in line with the format used  for financial statements. Since Castellum only owns properties in Sweden and a very  small proportion in Denmark, reporting on geographical distribution of statistics is less  relevant.  Disclosure on own offices Castellums own offices are reported separately on page 8. Narrative on performance  To read more about relative changes from 2016 to 2017 regarding sustainability indicators  and savings achieved, see pages 66–67 in the Annual Report for 2017. No adjustments have been made of the reported data.  Decisions upon which community engagements are being implemented/planned in  each region.

Reporting period Reporting for each year accounted for in the EPRA table refers to the calendar year, i.e.  January 1 to December 31. 4   CASTELLUM SUSTAINABILITY DATA 2017  ENERGY ABSOLUTE   MEASURES (Abs) LIKE-FOR-LIKE (LFL) BY PROPERTY TYPE  EPRA Code Units of  Measure Indicator Castellum Offices & retail Logistics Projects Castellum Total 2016 2017 2016 2017 % change 2016 2017 % change 2016 2017 % change 2016 2017 % change Elec-Abs Elec-LfL MWh Electricity Total landlord-  obtained   electricity 91,066 88,482 63,510 58 504 -8% 14,606 12,505 -14% 108 104 -4% 78,225 71,114 -9% of applicable properties Electricity disclosure   coverage 455 of  525 455 of  470 256 of  256 256 of  256 126 of  126 126 of  126 3 of 3 3 of 3 385 of  385 385 of  385 DH&C-Abs  DH&C-LfL MWh District  heating &  cooling Total landlord-  obtained  heating  and cooling 245,081 249,202 156,442 148 ,217 -5% 55,903 52,687 -6% 91 102 12% 212,438 201,007 -5% of applicable properties District heating &   cooling disclosure   coverage 446 of  526 472 of  487 260 of  260 260 of  260 132 of  132 132 of  132 1 of 1 1 of 1 393 of  393 393 of  393 Fuels-Abs Fuels-LfL MWh Fuels Total landlord-  obtained fuels 6,769 5,455 1,637 1,412 -14% 4,076 2,373 -42% 395 255 -35%- 6,109 4,041 -34% of applicable properties Fuels disclosure   coverage 30 of 30 27 of 27 8 of 8 8 of 8 13 of 13 13 of 13 1 of 1 1 of 1 22 of 22 22 of 22 MWh Energy Total energy use 342,917 343,140 221,590 208,134 -6% 74,587 67,566 -9% 595 462 -22% 296,773 276,163 -7% Total energy use   (Degree day   corrected) 362,934 365,927 234,039 221,385 -5% 79,700 72,789 -9% 636 496 -22% 314,376 294,671 -6% Energy-Int kWh/ sqm Energy   intensity Energy building   intensity 98 94 114 107 -6% 80 72 -10% 48 37 -23% 103 96 -7% The table shows energy usage as total and like-for-like figures for Castellum AB per property type.

Health & Safety, GRI 416-2 Castellum had no reported cases of occupational accidents of a serious nature in 2016.  Work-related injuries at Castellum are handled according to established procedures.  If any employee sustains an occupational disease or accident at work or if any incident  occurs at work, the regional Managing Director, the immediate supervising manager  and the HR manager as well as the employee will jointly investigate the causes so that risks   of illness and accidents can be prevented in the future. The regional Managing Director,  or the immediate supervising manager, will immediately report the incident to the Swe- dish Work Environment Authority. The regional Managing Director is also responsible  for reporting work-related injuries to Castellums legal department. The data is used in  Castellums systematic work processes to prevent future work-related accidents.
