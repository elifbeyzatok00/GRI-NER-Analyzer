President & CEO  Byeong-yong Lim Dear Stakeholders, On behalf of the entire GS E&C Corporation, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to  you all for your interest in and continued support for us. In 2017, GS E&C strove to gain market confidence through business management that was true to principles despite  challenging circumstances due to drastic downturns in overseas orders and declining trends in domestic orders. The  company upheld values centered on safety, righteousness, and fair business management, and as a result, generated  exceptional financial, environmental and social value on the basis of sustainable management.   First, GS E&C has been able to achieve exceptional financial performance. Through growth across the architecture and housing, infrastructure, plant and power sector businesses, GS E&C re- corded KRW 11.68 trillion in sales, exceeding KRW 10 trillion for three consecutive years. The company was also noted  for its turnaround with record-high operating sales in six years. In overseas business developments, we were able to  drastically reduce our financial risks and normalize our profit patterns by successfully entering the final stages for  most of our projects, even amid difficult conditions. Domestically, our outstanding performance in the housing busi- ness, both in sales and orders, drove company-wide financial performances despite reinforcements in government  regulations. Second, GS E&C is leading the way in combating climate change through its environ- mental management system and eco-friendly technology.  GS E&C is taking company-wide actions to combat climate change with aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emis- sions by 7.1% by 2020. Centered around our Technology Research Center, we are continuing efforts in developing  eco-friendly technology, and have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 37,500 tons through usage  of green concrete and LED lighting on sites. Furthermore, our energy consumption reduction efforts are carried out  systematically through our Energy Management Committee. Recently, we have taken our technology for efficient  energy operations management from the building to the city level, hoping to more effectively contribute to energy  consumption reduction efforts.  Third, GS E&C creates values for the sustainable growth of all our stakeholders. We strive to provide a working environment that motivates and enables the best performance of our employees  grounded in professional expertise, and support our suppliers with safety and ethics trainings for shared growth. We  have also continued our social contribution efforts, even when business conditions were not at their best, and built  our 230th Dreams and Hopes Study Room.  By taking the initiative to assess and improve our sustainability management by global institutions, GS E&C has been  able to produce sustainable results that meet global standards. Especially in 2017, GS E&C was admitted into the DJSI  Asia-Pacific Index for eight consecutive years, acknowledging the excellence of our management system.  Upon publishing our seventh integrated report, I would like to take this opportunity to express GS E&C's commitment  to creating shared values for all our stakeholders. Thank you.  05 GOING THE RIGHT WAY 04 GS E&C INTEGRATED REPORT 2017  OVERVIEW                       GS E&C SUSTAINABLE FOUNDATION FOR 6 CAPITALS                        GS E&C SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH                       ANNEXES Key  Performance GS E&C is laying the foundation of business ethics and improving  unjust practices to become a transparent and fair company that  customers and society trust. First, the company extensively manages and takes preventative  measures based on our Basic Principles, which includes sexual  harassment, abuse of power, and verbal and physical harass- ment. In particular, the company tracks reports and transpar- ently amends the situation according to principles. Also, the company is leading the movement to correct out-dat- ed unjust business practices as well as to improve the industry  structure. Specifically, the Clean Competition Declaration, an- nounced in 2017, provided an opportunity for the company and  individuals within to take the initiative to change. Some employ- ees were concerned over the possible negative impacts, such as  short-term profit loss, inconvenience in sales activities and social  risks in the case of unethical sales activities, but the company  took a bold move rooted in the belief that gaining trust through  upright business is key to sustainable growth. Having success- fully won large scale biddings through fair competition after the  Clean Competition Declaration, the direction towards business  ethics at GS E&C has become ever more clear.

Striving to end all critical casualties by establishing a  sound safety culture, employees as well as suppliers put utmost priority  in safety. The company continues to systematically carry out safety activ- ities and various programs based on worker behavior. The Safety Innovation School, representative of GS E&Cs efforts to cre- ate a safety culture, has operated for 12 years and become an exemplar  of safety culture within the construction industry at home and abroad.  Specifically, it provides professional training based on job positions,  practical education that replicate field situations and furthermore, im- proves the programs each year by reflecting the feedback from trainees.  This safety training is provided to directors and supervisors of suppliers  as well to foster shared growth. In 2016, the Safety Innovation School  was introduced in Singapore, and its effectiveness has been acknowl- edged, with some clients request practical education facilities on new  sites. Safety is an obligation for everyone, not just certain individuals. The GS  E&C headquarters and business sites will work together, grounded in  safety awareness and open communication to create a sound safety cul- ture.

In the 2017 DJSI assessment, GS E&C was admitted to the Asia  Pacific Index for the eighth consecutive year. And its outstanding  performance in sustainability has been continuously acknowl- edged, ranking 4th in the construction industry. The company has  no doubt that such records will elevate trust towards GS E&C and  positively affect bidding processes as well. Recently, leading global companies are actively participating in  CSR initiatives to promote CSR and assess their sustainability  performances to find areas for improvement. GS E&C has par- ticipated in CSR initiatives including UNGC, DJSI, CDP, ISO 26000  and ESG & SRI to comply with international guidelines and fulfull  social responsibilities as a global corporate citizen. Sustainability management will soon account for company com- petitiveness. GS E&C will ensure that all stakeholders dutifully  fulfill their social responsibilities by reinforcing its foundation  from within to meet the international standards of CSR initiatives  it takes part in.

Depending on the level of infrastructure accessible to residents  in a country or region, the benefits that residents can reap vary  tremendously; this makes infrastructure an important lifestyle  service. GS E&C has contributed to developing infrastructure  in Korea by successfully completing the Wonju-Gangneung  KTX Railroad Section 7 as well as Pohang-Samcheok Railroad  Section 2 and 5. Also, the company has completed various in- frastructure projects, such as special bridges, ports, industrial  complexes and stockpile sites, which have improved regional ac- cessibility, renovated business areas, and expanded tourism and  industry facilities. Like such, GS E&C promotes balanced region- al development and creates new jobs that solve issues around the  concentrated development in metropolitan areas. To improve quality of life and guarantee public safety amid more  complex life patterns and industrial structures in modern soci- ety, greater infrastructure policies and investments are neces- sary. GS E&C will continue to solidify the position of Korea as a  global hub, improve quality of life and further contribute to eco- nomic growth through economic cooperation with North Korea.

Eco-friendly technologies minimize environmental pollution  throughout the entire process, from construction to mainte- nance,  by reducing building energy-consumption, improving in- door air quality and preventing noise and vibration.Like such, GS  E&C has continually developed eco-friendly construction tech- nologies to take responsibility for global environmental problems  and provide unique values to our customers. Specifically, all apartments have been installed with an ener- gy-saving package technology, which consists of a floor heating  system, hot water supply system and LED lighting technology for  basement parking areas. Each year, this technology saves ap- proximately 30% of energy costs and approximately 17% of raw  construction costs. To expand these reductions to buildings other  than housing, the Building Energy Management System (BEMS)  is being adopted to the City Energy Management System (CEMS)  to establish eco-friendly cities. GS E&C continues to take on challenges to explore outstanding  technology in other industries such as automobiles, electronics  and aeroscience and apply them to the construction industry to  secure unique and competitive technologies. By developing new  technologies that anticipate future trends, the company will take  actions to solve environmental problems.

In the architecture sector, the company is striving to meet clients'  requests in business and production facility projects with its advanced designing skills such as  pre-construction. Recently, it is focusing on winning orders for modern complex facilities, such  as data centers and R&D centers. Opportunity Through preemptive actions to the improving housing market, GS E&C has won various housing  orders. Beginning this year, the company plans to focus on supplying reconstruction projects in  the metropolitan area to secure sustainable sales and respond to future market changes. Fur- thermore, GS E&C plans to advance into overseas markets in Vietnam and Indonesia in addition  to the domestic housing market which is expected to show increases in public housing orders  under government policies. Outlook Demands in housing and development projects are expected to continue to increase due to var- ious societal trends: increasing number of small households due to changes in the population  structure, aging of large \"new cities\" in Bundang, Ilsan and Pyeongcheon and the expansion of  residential areas that ensued transportation technology developments, such as the GTX. De- mands for complex modern buildings, such as data centers and smart buildings with the rise of  the 4th industrial revolution as well as E&C market expansions from potential economic cooper- ation between South and North Korea. 1  Gyeongguigung Xi (Seoul, Korea) Project Period: Oct. 2014 – June 2017 Order: KRW 513.5 Billion 2  Ng Teng Fong Hospital (Singapore) Project Period: June 2012- Feb. 2015 Order: KRW 584.4Billion  3  Hana Financial Group Integrated  Data Center (Incheon, Korea) Project Period: June 2015 – May 2017 Order Volume: KRW 194.6 billion Representative Areas  Residential facilities,  Business facilities,  Education/research centers/ hospitals, Cultural/leisure/ sport facilities,  Clean rooms/production  facilities, Logistics/ remodeling, Domestic  development projects,  Overseas development  projects Architecture  & Housing  2 3 1  21 GOING THE RIGHT WAY 20 GS E&C INTEGRATED REPORT 2017  OVERVIEW                       GS E&C SUSTAINABLE FOUNDATION FOR 6 CAPITALS                        GS E&C SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH                       ANNEXES Representative Areas  Roads, Bridges, Railroads,  Underground facilities,  Water resources, Ports GS E&C Business Model     102-2 Overview The infrastructure industry creates new spaces for the public's benefit. GS E&C has carried out  social infrastructure constructions such as roads, bridges, railroads, metro, airports, water re- sources, ports, industrial complexes and underground storage facilities, and has secured high   competitiveness in building and operating private large-scale infrastructure facilities. Opportunity Recently, the domestic (Korean) infrastructure industry is declining, and this trend is expected  to continue due to cuts in the social overhead capital (SOC) budgets. In response, it is crucial to  pioneer into new markets and diversify business through overseas infrastructural PPP projects.  In particular, investment development projects are pursued, rather than simple bidding competi- tions with lower profitability. In the global infrastructure market, orders are expected to continue  regarding transportation related infrastructure projects as a result of urbanization, and oppor- tunities for SOC construction projects based on economic cooperation such as the Economic  Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) are expected to increase mainly in Asia and Africa. In the  Australian market, orders for infrastructural projects are expected to increase as well. Outlook The government continues to secure social overseas capital (SOC) facilities, create jobs, seek  eco-friendly growth and develop the E&C industry through public infrastructure projects. It is  expected that the infrastructure industry will shift to a complex industrial structure with the inte- gration of various industries, rather than simply focusing on installation and services. 1,278 1,388 1,298 2015 2016 2017 1,027 1,100 491  2015 2016 2017 Infrastructure Sales Unit: KRW Billion  Orders Unit: KRW Billion  KRW 1.30 Trillion KRW 491 Billion 4% 11% Orders Proportion  Sales Proportion  1  HCMC Urban Railroad Line 1 Zone 2 (Vietnam) Project Period: July 2012 – Dec. 2019 Order: KRW 402.8 Billion 2  Vam Cong Bridge  Construction Project (Vietnam) Project Period: Nov. 2013- In Progress Order: KRW 180.5 Billion  3  T301 (Singapore) Project Period: March 2016 – Feb/ 2024 Order: KRW 1.537 Trillion 3 1 2  23 GOING THE RIGHT WAY 22 GS E&C INTEGRATED REPORT 2017  OVERVIEW                       GS E&C SUSTAINABLE FOUNDATION FOR 6 CAPITALS                        GS E&C SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH                       ANNEXES Plant Representative Areas  Refinery, Gas,  Petrochemical Plants,  Environmental projects 1  Rabigh CP3/4 (Saudi Arabia) Project Period: June 2012 - July 2017 Order: USD 1.377 Billion 2  NSRP (Vietnam) Project Period: July 2013-Feb. 2017 Order: KRW 1.12 Trillion 3  UHV (Thailand) Project Period: Oct. 2012-Jan. 2017 Order: USD 640 Million  GS E&C Business Model     102-2 Overview The plant industry not only integrates the foundation, design, procurement and installation of  facilities used in refinery, gas, petrochemical and environmental (waste treatment and water  treatment) plants, but also feasibility studies, plant maintenance and repairs. The scope of orders  is determined based on the plant orders of the petrol/gas source country, domestic financial pol- icies and investment/construction regulations also impact the industry. Opportunity Despite the global economic depression, investments in energy and industrial facilities in the  Middle East are expected to continue, and with the expansion of energy industrial facilities fol- lowing the growth of emerging markets, the investments in plant facilities are expected to show  a gradual increase. Also, leading companies are securing profitability in high added value areas,  while late comers in EPC, such as China and India, are expanding their market share based on  price competitiveness. Outlook Plant sector orders are expected to continue in the refinery sector in the Middle East, Africa and  Latin America. Particularly with the focus on environmental issues, such as regulations for CO2  emissions, demands for gas, a relatively clean energy source, is expected increase. For sustained  growth in the plant sector, GS E&C is securing original technology, fostering professional talent  and expanding R&D investments. 4,907 4,108 2,927 2015 2016 2017 2,838 562 1,970 2015 2016 2017 Sales Unit: KRW Billion  Orders Unit: KRW Billion  KRW 2.93 Trillion KRW 1.97 Trillion 18% 25% Orders Proportion  Sales Proportion  3 2 1  25 GOING THE RIGHT WAY 24 GS E&C INTEGRATED REPORT 2017  OVERVIEW                       GS E&C SUSTAINABLE FOUNDATION FOR 6 CAPITALS                        GS E&C SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH                       ANNEXES GS E&C Business Model     102-2 Overview The power generation, transmission and distribution business involves the construction of facil- ities that generate and supply power. GS E&C contributes to sustainable national power devel- opment through its clean energy business including nuclear and renewable energy as well as its  high efficient eco-friendly thermoelectric power business. Opportunity While the overseas power market is stagnant due to continuously declining oil prices, orders for  renewable energy such as photovoltaic and wind power have recently increased. In the domestic  power market, with increased power reserve margins and stabilized energy demands, the scale  of orders, including those of large projects, is expected to decrease. In the overseas transmission  market, orders are expected to continue to grow as demands for energy and international power  grid connection increase. Outlook Investments in the power industry continue to expand, concentrated on developing countries,  as it provides the infrastructure for economic growth. Therefore, the construction of new power  plants is expected to increase particularly for LNG plants and renewable energy in accordance  with a need for shift to low-carbon and reduction of coal fired power plants.

Financial Value Trends & Context Global Economy and Oil Prices According to the 2018 IMF Economy Outlook, the global economy in 2017 grew by approximately 3.7%, and this growth is  expected to continue in 2018.* In conjunction with global economic growth, environmental disasters in the US, a regu- lations agreement between OPEC and Russia restricting oil production and heightened political risks in Middle East, oil  prices have risen in 2017 as well.  Korean Domestic Policy The Korean government reinforced real estate regulations in 2017 in order to manage the housing market based on actual  ownership. With the introduction of regulations such as an excess profits return system for reconstruction and housing  price ceilings, a depression and greater volatility in the housing market is expected.** Also, due to reductions in the Social  Overhead Capital (SOC) budget, concerns over a retraction in construction investments are arising.

Domestic sales accounted for 69% of total sales,  and sales in the housing business rose by approximately 32%. Overseas sales took  about 31% of total sales and fell by 26% due to the decline in overseas plant sales.  The architecture and housing sector took 57% of total sales followed by 25% in plant,  11% in infrastructure, 6% in electricity and 1% in other sectors. In overseas sales,  approximately 64% was from the plant sector. In profits and losses, although overseas  business showed a slight downturn, operating profits recorded its highest in six years  at KRW 318.7 billion, led by excellent performance in the domestic housing business.

Led  by the recent expansion in housing orders, the architecture and housing business is ex- pected to maintain outstanding sales performances. In profits and losses, with the ter- mination of overseas businesses that have produced losses due to increased raw costs  during construction delays, recovery in operating profits is expected to be prominent. Orders Status  Despite the increase in housing sector orders, total orders in 2017 was down by 2.7%  at KRW 11.224 trillion due to the decline in overseas plant orders. The architecture and  housing sector orders took the largest portion at KRW 8.465 trillion, and specifically  housing sector orders drove overall orders in 2017, reaching KRW 6,402 trillion.  Orders Outlook GS E&Cs goals for orders in 2018 are KRW 10.04 trillion. Taking the largest portion  in overseas orders, plant order increases across diverse regions are hopeful due to  improved conditions in the global construction markets from oil price increases 2018.  Compared to the domestic construction boom in 2015-2017, an overall slump in the  housing market is expected. Yet, GS E&C is expected to maintain an excellent order  performance by actively implementing strategies such as launching new PF business- es and securing maintenance projects that put forth brand values. Order Details  Unit: KRW Billion 2017 Sales by  Business Sector  Unit: KRW Billion Credit Ratings  Source: Korea Ratings Corporation Increasing Raw Material Costs The costs of raw construction materials are increasing globally, putting significant  burdens on price competitiveness and financial capital for E&C companies. The  prices of GS E&Cs major raw materials are also expected to rise, making project  implementation and business strategies crucial. Steel prices are expected to rise  due to high demand and reduced steel production in China. As for wires and nickel,  rising demands and environmental regulations are expected to increase prices.  Unit costs for RMC is also expected to rise due to surges in sand prices from pro- duction reduction. 3-Year Price Trends of Major GS E&C Raw  Materials *Steel: HD 10mm, RMC: Metropolitan (25-240-15) Cement: Bulk cement, Wire: 0.6/1KV FCV 1C*95SQ, Nickel: LME 3-month average Credit Rating Status GS E&C was rated A- in its 128th non-guaranteed bond credit rating by the Korea Rat- ings Corporation. Outstanding business stability based on a diversified project portfolio  and high possibility for group support due to its status within the GS group were pos- itive evaluation factors. Yet, the drop was attributed to a decreased financial stability  reflected in its increased debt ratio and loan dependency following low operating prof- itability from overseas construction and businesses transfer delays. Credit Rating Outlook The Korea Ratings Corporation evaluated the credit rating outlook of GS E&C as sta- ble. For profit improvements, while the housing business is a positive factor due to  its satisfactory payability and distribution performance, stagnant performance from  additional raw costs in overseas business transfer delays is expected to burden further  improvements. Also, current housing businesses are expected to improve cash flow,  yet the recent sharp increase in housing volumes could stimulate volatility in working  capital, and continued investment burdens for acquiring industrial land and SOC share  is expected to burden cash flows.

Industrial Value  36 GS E&C INTEGRATED REPORT 2017  E&C companies are concentrating on efficient business operations as investments  in the E&C industry are declining globally and costs in energy and construction  materials continue to increase. In response, GS E&C provides Pre-Construction  Services (PCS) that reduce risks in design alterations and uncertainties in con- struction through thorough design inspections of various stakeholders (contractor,  designer, constructor). With the introduction of PCS, the company has been able  to lead innovations in operations efficiency through not only cost and construction  period reductions, but also enhancement in quality.   GS E&C has recently won orders of the Siheung Eungae S4 Block, which was con- tracted by LH Construction, and the Daegu DGB Data Center using Precon meth- ods. In the case of the Daegu DGB Data Center currently under construction, PCS  was conducted six times through a six-month period; by managing trends in costs,  construction costs were reduced by KRW 14.9 billion, 15% of the originally estimat- ed KRW 99.8 billion, and contractor satisfaction levels were elevated. With such  public and private PCS experience, GS E&C has competitive advantages in biddings  and project implementation.  BIM (Building Information Modeling) digitally models a structure's form and other  properties based on 3D information models. GS E&C utilizes BIM technology to  comprehensively manage information that was difficult to previously achieve in 2D  floor plans, ranging from planning and design to construction and maintenance. As  a result, various risks regarding alterations in design are preempted, and opera- tion efficiency is enhanced by monitoring materials and human resources that are  needed in each step all at once. In 2017, drone mapping technologies were used to  establish 3D digital space information, with plans to further advance the compre- hensive management of design and construction.

Upon registration, new sup- pliers are organized by eco-friendly material types and certification and given addition- al credits upon these categorization standards to motivate suppliers to obtain green  certificates. Major policies related to green purchase are regularly updated on GS-Con- stmat, an internal communication website, to encourage green purchase. Environmental Regulation Compliance through Essential  Environmental Rules  GS E&C obtains various permits throughout its business process, ranging from plan- ning, design, construction and maintenance, and strictly complies to environmental  regulations, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment Act, and Wastes Control  Act. GS E&C has also enforced the Essential Environmental Rules, which regulates  environmental violations on worksites. In 2017, the company partnered with the Korea  Environmental Association to produce the Essential Environmental Rules video, which  was distributed to all worksite workers and staff and translated for Chinese workers  who take the majority among on-site workers. In 2017, there were eight environmental  regulation violations.

High Energy-efficient Building GS E&C has implemented cost effective energy-efficient designs to expand green  buildings and homes and developed optimal energy saving building design tech- nology by assessing energy consumption levels in the early designing stages. Such  eco-friendly building technology was applied to the Yongsan Relocation Program (YRP)  Communication Center, Jincheon Athletes Village and Ananti Seoul Pent House, and  will be utilized for public projects and technological proposal biddings. In 2017, GS E&C  completed the construction of the LG Science Park, certified as a high energy-efficient  building, and maintained the proportion of high energy-efficient buildings at 39%. Waste Management and Reduction Efforts To reach its goal of 90% waste recycling by 2020, GS E&C operates a legal waste  management system and real-time waste management system. Its waste is classi- fied into six major construction waste categories, and recycled amounts are managed  in real-time. Furthermore, it makes efforts to ultimately reduce its wastes through  Waste-to-Energy facilities that incinerates waste to generate electricity. Climate Change Action Protection of Wild Endangered Species     304-2 GS E&C protected endangered species by transferring the habitat zones of sticklebacks  during the construction of the Bukpyeong 2nd General Industrial Complex in May 2017.  Sticklebacks were released into streams such as Jobicheon and Masangcheon, which  are similar in condition to that of their natural habitat, Daegucheon. No sticklebacks died  in the capturing and transferring process as well as the injection of VIE (Visible Implant  Elastomer) tags which were used to check their adaptation status. The successful adap- tation of the recaptured sticklebacks was confirmed upon their favorable conditions and  behaviors. Such biodiversity protection activities were also carried out on the C937 site  in Singapore. 2015 2016 2017 32.0 58.7 74.0 Generated Waste  Unit:\tTon Scope 2 (Indirect)   Scope 3 (Other Indirect)  2015 2016 2017 74,022 68,597 63,959 2015 2016 2017 290,285 293,037 259,329 2015 2016 2017 66,056 72,951 79,473 2015 2016 2017 143,421 144,863 141,802 GHG Emissions  Units:\ttCO2-e Scope 1 (Direct)  Industry Avg GS E&C Climate Change Strategy 2017 DJSI Assessment Results 100 57 Industry Avg GS E&C 90 Environmental Policy & Management System 2017 DJSI Assessment Results 100 73 Industry Best Score Capital 4.

Supply of such a workforce has been  consistently falling short. Especially in Korea, the lack of an expert workforce has led to project delays and quality assurance issues on  overseas construction sites.* To guarantee continuous growth in overseas orders, fostering global experts will become more critical. Preemptive Safety Management The construction industry faces fundamental difficulties in safety management due to a production structure based on contracting/ subcontracting, frequent changes of subcontractors and laborers and large scale projects.** In response, E&C companies in Korea  and abroad have established preemptive safety management systems. Particularly, European countries and specifically the UK  practices Design for Safety which applies safety throughout the entire construction lifecycle, from planning to design.

Nine essential elements for business activities are diag- nosed; based on these results strengths and weaknesses in management competen- cy, corporate culture, leadership and human resource competencies are analyzed and  reflected in improvement activities. All employees are surveyed regularly once a year.  In the 2017 survey, 62.5% were positive towards management competency, similar to  2016. Although employees are generally satisfied by normalized profit patterns, accu- mulated fatigue is identified as a major complaint. Employee Capacity Building Program GS E&C continues to develop and support professionals through various training pro- grams. To foster management competencies in leadership and general management  as well as improve organizational performance, employees participate in business  management training. Advanced training for installation competency are offered to  technicians on site and in business divisions as well as on-site workers. Trainees are  introduced to issues related to cost, quality and safety with a focus on practical field  experience and are able to ultimately foster expertise through practical courses. Employee Expertise Development     404-1 Childbirth and Childcare Support Fair Performance Evaluation & Rewards Performance Cultivating Management System GS E&C operates a performance cultivating management system that improves both  employee performance and expertise. Unlike the existing performance management  paradigm, performance is evaluated and managed separately for results and compe- tencies. To manage employee performance and build capacity, challenging yet rea- sonable business goals and self-development plans are set for each individual, and  feedback is provided regularly. Various methods such as the MBO (Management By  Objectives), multidimensional evaluations and relative evaluations by job position are  implemented to increase the fairness of evaluations. The evaluation grades are deter- mined at the evaluation revision session with the participation of all executives of each  sector/division, and evaluation results are verified by HR (Human Resource) monitor- ing, further enhancing its objectivity. Employee Performance Evaluation & Career Development Review  Unit: % 2015 2016 2017 Performance Evaluation Rate 91.7 95.0 95.3  Merit System and Rewards  To provide reasonable rewards commensurate with employee performance, GS E&C  has introduced an organizational and individual performance reward system. Rewards  are given according to fair performance and competency evaluations without gender or  racial discrimination. Individual performance is reflected in compensation and promo- tions to motivate employees; feedback is also provided for employees improvement.  As for executives, they are evaluated across a wide range of factors including financial,  recognition, and environmental and social performance. Welfare and Employee Culture Childbirth Support GS E&C has introduced a family-friendly work environment so that its employees can  focus at work, even after giving birth. The company expanded childbirth related med- ical costs for spouses, day care centers at work, infertility leave and childbirth and  maternity protection support to help employees childbirth and childcare and ultimately  improve work efficiency. Use of maternity leave continues to increase and the percent- age of returning employees on leave for over 12 months has been maintained at over  90%. In-house Child Care Center For a work and life balance, GS E&C became the first in the industry to open an in- house day care center in 2010. At the Dreams and Hopes GS E&C Child Care Center,  education programs are customized to six age groups, from 8-month toddlers to pre- schoolers, from 7:30 AM to 7:30 PM. Its reliable operation has earned the recognition  of employees.

Particularly regarding equal oppor- tunity for minorities, the company monitors the proportions of females, people with  disabilities and families of war veterans. While the proportion of females, employees is  relatively low due to characteristics of the construction industry, the company prioritiz- es people with disabilities and families of war veterans during recruitment. Human Rights Education & Prevention of Human Rights Risks     412-2 GS E&C conducts human rights surveys and education to uphold the basic rights of  employees and eliminate human rights violations. The human rights survey evaluates  actions taken regarding the 29 tasks across 8 categories which have adapted the Hu- man Rights Management Guidelines of the National Human Rights Commissions of  Korea to GS E&Cs context. In 2017, the company scored 76, with employment, freedom  of association and collective bargaining identified areas for improvement. Also, as part  of human rights education, sexual harassment prevention education is conducted each  year. In 2017, 6,074 employees completed the 2-hour sexual harassment prevention  course. Employee Grievances Each year, the labor union and the company management jointly visit business sites  in Korea and abroad to listen to employee grievances, check their working and living  conditions and ultimately resolve any difficulties. After listening to employees working  in projects in the Middle East, such as the CFP project in Kuwait, overseas benefits  for assistant managers and managers dispatched to projects in the Middle East were  raised in July 2017, accounting for difficulties in the working environment. To support  the families of employees working at regional sites in Korea, such as Yeosu GSC, trans- portation subsidies were increased from once to twice a month. Human Rights of Foreign Workers Status of Foreign Employees Currently, a total of 8,451 foreign employees from 19 countries are classified into Glob- al Permanent (GP), Global Contract (GC), Global Assistant (GA) and Global Technicians  (GT). GPs have equal rights and responsibilities as domestic regular employees, ex- cluding wages, and GCs are transferred to GPs based on individual performance.  Foreign Employee Support  Since 2015, GS E&Cs integrated HR policy for GPs, the company has complied with  human rights regulations during recruitment and in work conditions, including sexual  harassment and grievance processes. Furthermore, an orientation introducing Korean  culture as well as assistance in opening bank and mobile accounts is provided upon  arrival in Korea. Also, living and administrative assistance, including alien registration,  visa, hospital and governmental entities, is offered through various consulting services.  Furthermore, in order to respect minority religions of foreign employees, the company  has established prayer rooms and provides halal food. Open Management Program With aims to diversify communication channels between the CEO and employees, GS  E&C has introduced the CA (Change Agent) system. The CA department is responsible  for improving organizational capacities in each sector, division and office by listening to  employees, fostering G-Spirit, conducting leadership improvement activities and par- ticipating in company-wide CSR activities. GS E&C also provides workshops and exter- nal training programs and expands communication opportunities between employees  by supporting club activity costs and participating in year-end volunteering activities. Current Management Agenda Conferences   GS E&C discusses its management performance and current businesses through its  Management Committee and Current Management Agenda Conferences. Specifically,  at the Current Management Agenda Conferences business environment, annual busi- ness strategies and organizational capacity enhancement methods are deliberated,  and the Management Committee shares these matters in addition to non-financial fac- tors, such as safety and environmental factors to the overall development of GS E&C at  these current agenda conferences. Operations of Current Management Agenda Conferences Online Grievance Bulletin GS E&C introduced the VOE (Voice of Employee) to collect and resolve employee griev- ances. Under this system, when an employee raises a grievance, the manager respon- sible responds within two weeks, and the inquirer evaluates this response based on  their satisfaction levels. In 2017, 37 grievances were raised and resolved, including  improvements in the meeting room scheduling system. Labor-management Cooperation     102-41, 402-1 GS E&Cs labor union consists of 970 (41.4%) permanent employees below manager  ranks (excluding managing positions such as finance, planning, HR, general manage- ment). The company upholds and assures the three primary labor rights through wage  agreements (annual) and collective agreements (biannual). Furthermore, important  management matters of the company are promptly notified for consultation. The joint  labor-management conference is held quarterly to discuss issues related to joint ben- efits, such as improvements in working conditions, on-site safety and health, promo- tion of employee health, and employee grievances.

Specifically, the CSO (Chief Security Officer)  holds QHSE Operations Committee meetings twice a month, totaling 22 times a year,  where the heads of all business sectors attend and share their insights into and issues  on safety and health to all employees. The committee shares casualty trends analyses,  recent casualty cases from other companies, relevant government policies and on-site  inspection results to further discuss action measures. Casualty Prevention Safety Traffic Light Policy GS E&C has carried out the Safety Traffic Light Policy for three years, classifying the  level of on-site safety management into green, yellow, and red to reinforce its essen- tial safety rules and monitor violations of improved policies. Rather than a one-time  action measure, this policy proposes improvement plans to prevent casualties. Sites  that fail to improve after a traffic light inspection are supported by headquarters and  independent on-site workshops are provided. Sites that have been assessed as green  more than three times are designated as exemplary sites and are given benefits. Expansion of Safety Innovation School The Safety Innovation School was established to improve safety management capaci- ties of GS E&C employees, suppliers and on-site workers and ultimately prevent casu- alties. To further improve the trainings, GS E&C has been expanding the network and  support each year. In 2017, the company played the key role in establishing the training  network and spreading safety management awareness in the industry through part- nerships with public institutions including the Korea Occupational Safety and Health  Agency and the Seoul Regional Construction and Management Administration. GS E&C  also reinforced its on-site training programs. Furthermore, the company listens to employees and trainees to maintain trainings that  are applicable and preemptive. In collaboration with the Technological Safety Support  Team, Virtual Reality contents were developed to simulate on-site events, and a survey  was conducted to 3,168 trainees to assess their satisfaction levels and find areas for  improvement. The company plans to implement global safety & health trainings that  meet international standards through the ISO 29990:2010 (educational service man- agement system) certification. 2017 Safety Traffic Signal System Inspections by Equipment Experts GS E&C has five equipment experts who actively perform equipment and on-site re- quest inspections to prevent accidents associated with construction equipment. In  2017, one additional expert in the equipment department was recruited to reinforce on- site support, management and supervision, and a total of 812 preliminary equipment  inspections were performed. GS E&C plans to strengthen its independent equipment  inspection capacities by further fostering and allocating new experts capable of inde- pendent equipment management. Central Monitoring System (CMS)\t The CMS (Central Monitoring System) monitors unstable behaviors and conditions on  site using a remote video management system (CCTV). CMS is a safety management  method using remote videos that regularly checks for instabilities in facilities and  workers and immediately takes actions through facility broadcasts to prevent accidents  on construction sites. Trainings based on video recordings and photos are also provid- ed to workers to promote awareness. Safety Management of Overseas Sites GS E&C has regularly performed on-site safety inspections and supported manage- ment activities in accordance with the Overseas Safety & Health Manuals enacted in  2014. In 2017, the company performed 10 on-site supervision inspections, and remain- ing sites were monitored using a remote supervision system. Furthermore, a video  safety training was carried out to prevent the three most frequent accidents (jams, hits  and crashes) and serious falling accidents. Top 3 Health Issues Management  GS E&C fosters self-initiated on-site inspections and casualty prevention by research- ing monthly themed tasks and casualties, emphasizing the Top Three Health Issues  Management —\"closed-space operations, working environment and hazardous ma- terials management. The company also produced posters and educational materials  regarding health for foreign employees. In 2017, the P9-Project site was awarded the  grand prize for Industrial Safety Weeks Outstanding Health Management, acknowl- edging GS E&Cs health management capacities. Safety Management of Foreign Employees GS E&C is strengthening its communication with foreign employees by stationing in- terpreters at construction sites with high proportions of foreign employees for accurate  delivery of essential information regarding casualties and guidelines. Chinese dubbed  video materials were also produced and distributed on site, and the illiteracy levels of  Chinese workers were determined through site visits to provide dubbed industry spe- cific safety guidelines.

Approximately 2,000 employees across all business sectors attended  and were able to gain a better understanding of action measures needed to ef- fectively address internal issues and deal with rapidly changing external market  factors, such overseas bidding and relevant domestic policies. Discussing enhancements in implementation capacities The workshop began with the CEOs opening remarks followed by presentations  of the heads from its four major business sectors —architecture & housing, infra- structure, plant and power. These presentations aimed to promote improvements  in project implementation capacities ranging from direct management to construc- tion, communication, technological abilities and contract management. In addition  to information on key business areas, all employees who attended watched videos  that showcased the companys CSR activities, such as the 200th Dreams & Hopes  Study Room and GS E&C Site Sketches. Creating shared understanding through sector-wide feedback Through this Project Implementation Capacity Improvement Workshop, employees  were able to thoroughly understand the reality and risks GS E&C is currently facing  and collaborate for resolutions together, rather than through top-down decisions.  Grounded on the CEO and company philosophy, this workshop provided an opportu- nity to further improve current projects by sharing overall progress and Lessons &  Learned that might be less familiar amongst other business sectors. Moving for- ward, feedback from each division was distributed through which GS E&Cs project  implementations capacities will be improved.  Background Contents Impact Special 2. GS E&C Story Executive Member Safety & Health Management Activity GS E&C CEO and executives regularly make site visits and inspect key management  factors, such as on-site worker risks to inspect and encourage on-site safety. In 2017,  the CEO and CSO visited 10 and 118 sites respectively. Casualties are also prevented  by training safety managers on guidance improvements and communication with em- ployees. Current Status of Casualties Critical Casualties To prevent industrial casualties, GS E&C has established a culture of immediate re- porting in the case of critical casualties. In 2017, safety was strained due to the stag- nant supply of GS E&C workforce despite the increase in construction sites and project  workforce in line with growth in housing business orders. As a result, conventional  types of critical casualties occurred relatively frequently, while the industrial casualty  rate decreased by 0.15% to 0.5%, on-site casualty rates increased by 0.06% to 2.56%.

Diversification of Customer and Societys Needs Reflecting customer needs and raising customer satisfaction have become critical factors in biddings. Corporate clients  are requesting non-financial performance measures, such as safety and social contribution, in addition to financial perfor- mance indexes.

Ethics Committee The GS E&C Ethics Committee assists the ethical decision-making of the CEO through  deliberation, votes on necessary agendas, and inspections of the companys ethical  management. The Ethics Committee consists of the committee chairman, the CFO,  and its operating members, business sector planning executives and supporting de- partment executives. In 2017, the committee was held twice in the first and second  half respectively to discuss preemptive activities and audit activities for ethics man- agement. Corporate ethics impacts company reputation, employee morale and business relations. If a companys ethical foundation is compro- mised, this could lead to financial losses in the long term. To become a company customers and society can trust for transparent and  fair management, GS E&C has enacted and enforced its Code of Ethics in 1994 to provide the basis of ethics management, and intends  to continue to enhance its ethics management.

GS E&C has set up various reporting  channels, such as the Cyber ombudsman, phone/fax to facilitate the reporting channel  and provides protection to informants to further encourage reportings. The Compli- ance Department immediately investigates reported matters and related employees  must cooperate in the investigations. In 2017, 31 investigations were conducted. Inspection and Issue Diagnosis of Operating Projects GS E&C performs Site Patrol Inspections and Issue Diagnosis for prevent unethical  violations and risk factors through preemptive measures. The Site Patrol Inspection  monitors compliance measures of operating projects and identifies current on-site is- sues to prevent the diffusion of unethical practices and further improve awareness.  Issue Diagnosis identifies unjustified work practices and areas of improvement in work  processes to prevent company losses and promote efficiency. After such inspection ac- tivities, the Project site team relevant departments at headquarters seek for improve- ment measures and implement them into their projects. In 2017, 20 Patrol Inspections  and 13 Issue Diagnoses were conducted. Ethical Violation Cases Individual Violations GS E&C places sanctions on unethical practices of employees according to HR regu- lations and on suppliers, according to internal deliberation standards. Suppliers who  report unethical practices of GS E&C employees were designated as an excellent sup- plier to increase the effectiveness of the reporting system. In 2017, employees and their  managers were penalized for violations, such as employee cash loans and inappropri- ate business trips.

The RM Committee analyzes risks independently and  operates an integrated risk management system. There are two teams (Civil engineer- ing and Construction Support, EPC Business Support) that consist of experts in rele- vant fields, and each team is separated by business sector, performing risk manage- ment directly under the CEO. Business Environment & Implementation Risk Management GS E&C manages business environment and implementation risks separately and ac- cordingly. Business environment risks are managed based on by their the significance  levels, possibility of occurrence and direct and indirect impacts; as for business imple- mentation risks, all risks expected or unexpected throughout the entire business cycle  are included. To review business feasibility, financial and non-financial risk evaluations  are conducted during each business phase by business sector and the Business Re- view Committee. Preemptive Risk Management System RM Conference In order to reinforce risk management activities, the company holds the RM Confer- ence, which is a collaborative network for sector specific risk management. Sector  RM conferences across five sectors —compliance, resource, fraud, HR and macro-in- dex —operate weekly, monthly and quarterly to share risk issues, seek optimal solu- tions and take early action. Integrated Risk Management System In 2012, GS E&C established the Integrated Risk Management System (IRMS) to in- tegrate risk management of each sector, identify correlations between individual  risks and detect causes for preemptive actions. The company identifies 51 financial  and non-financial risk factors which are classified into 10 categories —management  performance, raw construction cost management, bond management, financial index,  financial risk, safety management, insolvency symptom management, litigations &  housing customer service, subsidiaries and major indices. The efficiency and effective- ness of risk management are improved through monthly and quarterly risk analyses. Since the recent global financial crisis, effective risk management has become even more crucial for long term asset management and  flexible organizations. Particularly with the expansions of overseas Mega projects in the construction industry, risks for value creation  are now regular occurrences. GS E&S has established an Integrated Risk Management System to preemptively detect and respond to  internal and external risks.

Inclusiveness Are stakeholders engaged  in the value creation processes  of GS E&C?  The Assurer has confirmed that GS E&C implements stakeholder engagement through diverse chan- nels in its sustainable value creation processes with stakeholders, and that no stakeholder group was  purposely excluded from the stakeholder engagement processes. Materiality Does GS E&C make reports on  its important sustainable issues? The Assurer confirmed the procedures whereby GS E&C identified its sustainability issues and could  not find any problems in the application of materiality test procedures. Responsive- ness Did GS E&C respond reasonably  to its stakeholders expectations? The Assurer confirmed that GS E&C carried out activities to identify material aspects that affect stake- holders performance and respond to the outcomes and that the contents are appropriately described  in the Report. Recommendations for Improvement \tIt is crucial to reinforce linkages between the identified material issues and the company's long-term value creation process. Spe- cifically, improvement efforts should be made regarding material issues that were deemed more important by external than inter- nal stakeholders, including non-discrimination and human rights assessment. Reporting of the management approach, step-by-step  goals and implementation progress is also recommended.  \tContinuous monitoring and improvement efforts in categories identified in the DJSI assessment, such as governance, supply chain  management and human rights, are needed. The Assurer also recommends that GS E&C integrates its comprehensive performance  data to sustainability KPIs and the UN SDGs for sustained efforts in integrated long-term value creation.
