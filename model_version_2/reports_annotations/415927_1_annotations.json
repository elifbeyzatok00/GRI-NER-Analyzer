The report  provides progress updates for key  areas of our citizenship efforts across  our business units and operations and  focuses on issues we determined to  be of greatest importance through  a materiality assessment process  conducted in 2015 (see page 8).  This report was prepared in accordance  with the G4 Core option of the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI). In addition,  we used the United Nations (UN) Global  Compact and the UN Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights frameworks to  guide our reporting. Index tables indicating  where we have addressed components  for each of these three frameworks can  be found at the end of this report (see  pages 85–99). This report supplements  information published in our 2016 Annual  Report. Additional information about  Citi can be found on our website. All reporting and performance data are  limited to information for the owned and  operated facilities of Citigroup Inc. and  its subsidiaries, unless stated otherwise.

Uncertainty, change and anger were all defining characteristics of 2016, but if I had   to summarize the year in a word, it would be AGAINST. Against the status quo,   against long-serving leaders, and against any perceived threats to what people  in many places had long considered a predictable and secure future.  While the sources and multiple manifestations of this mood are being analyzed   by many, at Citi we think the more important area of focus is: What do we, and   should we, stand FOR? As a company with clients in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions and  with more than 200 million customer accounts worldwide, what we stand for  is informed by many things. First and foremost, were guided by our mission  to responsibly provide financial services that enable growth and progress.   As part of that mission, we ask ourselves how our own actions and behaviors  exemplify what we stand for. Do we hold ourselves to the highest ethical and  business standards? What do we do on a daily basis to meet and live up to those  standards? And, importantly, what do we do when we fall short? Those are the  big questions that the first section of this report, HOW WE DO BUSINESS, addresses.  It makes clear that Citi stands for diversity in the workplace, requiring our  colleagues to adhere to the highest ethical standards, running our operations  in an environmentally friendly manner and safeguarding our clients privacy.   In pursuit of our mission, we also ask ourselves how the work we do with  our clients and in our communities around the world demonstrates what  we stand for. The efforts detailed in the SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT section are  indicative of the many ways we can and do have a positive financial and social  impact in the communities we serve. They demonstrate that Citi stands for  building inclusive cities, working with governments on critical infrastructure  projects and financing solutions that protect against climate change. When I think about the sense of uncertainty that permeates the world today,   I grow only more committed to identifying and taking action on issues where  Citi can use our global scale and expertise to make meaningful contributions.  And while we dont have all the answers and cant solve every problem, we can  and do stand FOR progress and will continue to do our part to conceive of and  contribute to solutions that address some of societys most daunting challenges.   MICHAEL L. CORBAT CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER CITIGROUP INC. CEO LETTER  INTRODUCTION   5 Citis Mission and Value  Proposition defines who we are  as a company and guides every  decision across our business.  The mission is not unique  to our citizenship activities.  Rather, it applies to our entire  business, and everyone — from  our Board of Directors to  each of our nearly 220,000  employees around the world —  is responsible for executing it  on a daily basis.  In this report, we intend to  illustrate how our core activities  help solve the worlds toughest  challenges and embrace its  greatest opportunities — a key  tenet of the mission. And where  we fall short, we will learn  and plan a stronger and more  effective course for the future  as we continue to revise and  strengthen our approach to  corporate citizenship across   the company.  ENABLING GROWTH AND PROGRESS These capabilities create an obligation   to act responsibly, do everything  possible to create the best outcomes  and prudently manage risk. If we fall  short, we will take decisive action  and learn from our experience. We strive to earn and maintain the  publics trust by constantly adhering to  the highest ethical standards. We ask our  colleagues to ensure that their decisions  pass three tests: they are in our clients  interests, create economic value and   are always systemically responsible.  When we do these things well, we make   a positive financial and social impact in   the communities we serve and show   what a global bank can do. Citis mission is to serve as a trusted  partner to our clients by responsibly  providing financial services that enable  growth and economic progress. Our  core activities are safeguarding assets,  lending money, making payments and  accessing the capital markets on behalf  of our clients. We have 200 years of  experience helping our clients meet  the worlds toughest challenges and  embrace its greatest opportunities. We  are Citi, the global bank — an institution  connecting millions of people across  hundreds of countries and cities. What You Can Expect From Us  and What We Expect From Ourselves  We protect peoples savings and help  them make the purchases — from  everyday transactions to buying a  home — that improve the quality of  their lives. We advise people on how  to invest for future needs, such as  their childrens education and their  own retirement, and help them buy  securities such as stocks and bonds. We work with companies to optimize  their daily operations, whether they  need working capital, to make payroll  or export their goods overseas. By  lending to companies large and small,  we help them grow, creating jobs and  real economic value at home and in  communities around the world. We  provide financing and support to  governments at all levels, so they  can build sustainable infrastructure,  such as housing, transportation,  schools and other vital public works.

We continue to take key steps toward this more  thorough, integrated and effective approach. CITIZENSHIP APPROACH   7  INTRODUCTION   8 CITI IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT:   PURPOSEFUL SOLUTIONS FOR   SOCIETAL PROGRESS  Our citizenship efforts and priorities  across the company are continuously  informed by the wider societal context  around us. In 2015, we conducted a  materiality assessment, which provided  us with detailed data and stakeholder  feedback on our key issues (see  materiality matrix below). This informed  and reinforced our priorities, ensuring  we continue to focus on the most  relevant issues for Citis stakeholders  and our firm. In particular, this analysis  helped us to identify which issues are  most important to our business and  operations, which are of most relevance  to our customers and clients and  which broader societal trends matter  most to us and our stakeholders.  Our Material Issues - Impact of Operations    on Communities - Climate Change - Consumer Protection - Human Rights - Regulatory Reform - Taxes - Data Security & Privacy - Diversity & Equal Opportunity - Environmental & Social Risks - Environmental Finance Products - Social Finance Products - Financial Inclusion & Access - Risk Behavior & Culture - Ethical Conduct - Systemic Risk - Transparency & Accountability - Energy & Emissions - Resource Use & Waste - Responsible Sourcing - Strategic Philanthropy - Board Structure - Employee Engagement - Employee Health & Wellness - Executive Compensation - Client Satisfaction &    Quality of Advice - Talent Attraction - Talent Development & Retention - Volunteerism - Political Involvement INFLUENCE ON BUSINESS SUCCESS IMPORTANCE TO STAKEHOLDERS PRIORITY AREAS This approach to citizenship issues — thinking about Citis impact on clients  and customers and society — allows  us to embrace the complexity and  interconnectedness of our most  material issues. We dont have all the  answers, but we continue to evolve  our approach to citizenship and  set ambitious goals that our global  reach can allow us to influence. GRI indicators:   G4-18, G4-19, G4-20, G4-21 For more detailed information on  our materiality assessment and  matrix of material issues, please  see www.citigroup.com/citi/about/ citizenship/strategy.html  INTRODUCTION   9 In September 2015, the 193 Member  States of the United Nations adopted  the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable  Development, including the Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs). This set of  17 universal goals calls on all nations  to end poverty, protect the planet and  ensure prosperity for all. These goals  build upon the Millennium Development  Goals but go further in scope, addressing  the full range of societys economic,  social and environmental needs. The corporate sector will play a  critical role in achieving the SDGs.  Citis business efforts and values, as  articulated in our Mission and Value  Proposition, are aligned with these  goals. Access to financing will be key,  and Citi, as a global institution that  connects governments, businesses  and civil society with capital markets,  recognizes that we have an important  role to play in financing the SDGs. The United Nations estimates that  developing countries will face an  annual investment gap of $2.5 trillion  over the lifetime of the SDGs. Citis  200 years of experience meeting the  worlds toughest challenges through  innovative financing solutions becomes  even more relevant in closing this gap. To highlight specific ways Citi  can contribute to achieving the  SDGs, throughout this report we  explore in greater detail several  examples in which our activities  are directly contributing to  specific SDGs, including: Citi and the Sustainable Development Goals PAGE 63 PAGE 84 PAGE 71 PAGE 74 PAGE 63 PAGE 79  INTRODUCTION   10 CITIZENSHIP GOVERNANCE AT CITI  Governance is an important overall  principle at Citi, and it forms the   basis of several key structures within   our organization. For information   on corporate governance at Citi,   please see the Conduct, Culture and  Governance section. On this page,   we describe the governance structures  guiding our Corporate Citizenship  and Sustainability functions.  The Nomination, Governance and  Public Affairs Committee of the Citi  Board of Directors oversees Citizenship  activities. Committee responsibilities  include reviewing our policies and  programs for sustainability, climate  change, human rights and other  material issues, as well as advising  on engagement with major external  stakeholders. For more information  on the roles and responsibilities of  Citis Nomination, Governance and  Public Affairs Committee, download  our Nomination, Governance and  Public Affairs Committee Charter. At the senior executive level, Corporate  Citizenship at Citi is led by the  Director of Corporate Citizenship and  President of the Citi Foundation. The  Director provides progress reports  to the Nomination, Governance and  Public Affairs Committee at least  annually on issues, trends and results  pertaining to the companys most  material citizenship and sustainability  issues. The Director collaborates with  a range of senior leaders to enable  the development and implementation  of goals and programs that generate  a positive impact on society. Sustainability Governance Citi has an Environmental and Social  Advisory Council that provides guidance  on environmental and social issues  related to global business activities,  including advising on our ambitious  Sustainable Progress Strategy.  The council is co-chaired by senior  executives in our Institutional Clients  Group (ICG) and includes executives  from Banking, Risk, Public Affairs,  Operations, Corporate Sustainability  and Environmental and Social Risk  Management (ESRM). Council meetings  are held approximately three times  annually. Citi also has a cross-functional  Climate and Sustainability Council,  based in London, focused specifically  on our sustainability performance in the  Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Citis Corporate Sustainability team  works in partnership with our businesses  to lead and implement our our  Sustainable Progress Strategy globally.  Citis ESRM Policy is managed by the  ESRM team, which works closely with  ESRM specialists in our Commercial  Bank and regional ESRM Champions.  Our Corporate Realty Services group  also has a specialized sustainability  team that manages our environmental  footprint and green building goals,  and our Enterprise Supply Chain team  oversees supply chain sustainability.  These specialized teams sit within  their respective business units,  ensuring ownership of sustainability  goals throughout the company. REPORTING ON OUR MISSION Citi is committed to continual  improvement in our transparency and  disclosure. We use widely adopted  reporting frameworks such as the GRI G4  Guidelines and the UN Global Compact  to guide our citizenship reporting,  and we monitor the development of  new reporting trends and initiatives  to inform our reporting. For example,  after following the development of  the UN Guiding Principles on Business  and Human Rights and the associated  reporting framework, we have  implemented that framework to improve  our human rights transparency this year.  Two other major reporting initiatives  that we continue to follow closely are the  Financial Stability Boards Task Force on  Climate-Related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD) and the Sustainability Accounting  Standards Boards Standards. The TCFDs  final recommendations are expected  this summer, and we will consider how  they could help guide our reporting on  climate change risks in the future. The Lowline Lab, on the Lower East Side of New York City,  served as a testing ground for technology to grow and sustain  plants underground, mimicking the conditions of a historic  trolley terminal that the Lowline hopes to transform into an  underground park. Citi was a founding sponsor of the Lab.

We also engage  regularly with relevant media outlets  and through social media, in response  to direct queries or as a proactive effort  to share announcements, updates and  information about Citi activities.  With some stakeholders, we actively  engage on a range of issues through  formal stakeholder dialogues at least  once per year. For others, we engage in  a more targeted manner on a particular  issue or as part of a specific initiative.  We have long-standing relationships  with leaders on environmental and social  issues from whom we seek feedback.  Annually, we review our relationships  to identify any gaps and consider  potential new partners that would be  valuable stakeholders for the company  and inform our citizenship approach. We value the input our stakeholders   provide and take action to address   their concerns. A panel with representatives from other  large companies sharing best practices on  diversity in the workplace, including gender. Asking, Listening, Sharing Citi, along with industry leaders  and regulators, participated in the  Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks  workshop focused on improving the  culture and behavior of employees  in the financial services industry.  We also agreed to join six leading  financial institutions and a range of  stakeholders in a one-day symposium  — the start of an ongoing dialogue —  regarding the dynamics and impacts  of culture at financial institutions.

HOW WE DO BUSINESS    16 Responsible business practices  are not only the backbone of our  companys success, but imperative  to protecting the broader financial  system and the communities in  which we live and work. It starts  with a culture of ethics and  integrity delivered by a diverse,  skilled workforce committed to  serving our clients. Whether we are  protecting our customers privacy,  respecting human rights, engaging  with our suppliers or assessing  and addressing the environmental  and social risks of the projects  we finance, our goal is always to  earn our customers trust through  responsible, ethical practices. HOW WE DO BUSINESS  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    17 CONDUCT, CULTURE  AND GOVERNANCE We include this phrase because we acknowledge that there is work to be done, that  our efforts need to be continuous and that even one mistake can undermine trust  in our business and our industry overall. Earning trust is hard — rightly so. But we  are committed — from our Board of Directors and senior management to each of our  employees around the world — to working at it each day. Its what we need to do to be  successful as a company, and it is at the center of all of our decisions and actions. ETHICS GOVERNANCE The Ethics and Culture Committee, a standing committee of the Citi Board of Directors   that was established in 2014, oversees Citis efforts to reinforce and enhance a culture   of ethics throughout the firm. In Citis Mission and Value Proposition, we state that   we strive to earn and maintain public trust by constantly  adhering to the highest ethical standards.   17 2016 HIGHLIGHTS More than  20,000 employees completed in-person  and virtual LEADERSHIP MATTERS:   IT STARTS WITH US training Implemented our  CONDUCT RISK PROGRAM  across multiple businesses  in approximately 44 COUNTRIES More than  197,000  employees have completed ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING,  SANCTIONS AND ANTI-BRIBERY  AND CORRUPTION training  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    18 INDUSTRY COLLABORATION  Improving bank culture is not an end  in itself. It is a means of ensuring that  banks fulfill their public responsibility  to serve the broader economy. If banks  — and the people who work at banks —  are not trusted, consumers, companies  and governments wont want to do  business with us, which would prevent  us from effectively performing our  critical financial intermediation role. Improving bank culture also impacts  the long-term viability of the industry  because it directly affects the acquisition  and retention of top talent. The best  and brightest — future leaders — will  not want to work in an industry if it  is best known for its ethical failures  rather than the value it provides to  the broader economy and society.   We recognize this, which is why we  have made a concerted effort to  partner with key stakeholders on  ways that we can collectively improve  culture in the banking industry. For example, Citi, along with industry  leaders and regulators, participated in  the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks  workshop on culture and behavior  in the financial services industry in  October 2016. The workshop focused  on the roles of supervisors, banks and  other industry groups, and institutional  investors in improving culture in the  banking industry. The conference  highlighted the important public  purpose of banks and the need for  restoring trust in the banking industry.  We also agreed to join six leading  financial institutions to organize a  one-day symposium to discuss the  dynamics of culture at financial  institutions. This symposium brought  together a range of stakeholders,  including senior leaders from across the  industry, regulators and experts from  academia, to share their insights on  financial industry culture. The symposium  focused on the industrys shared goals  and unique responsibilities regarding  culture and conduct. We expect this  dialogue to continue and are committed  to being a constructive participant. Citi is also a member firm of the  Banking Standards Board (BSB) in the  United Kingdom. Together with over 30  member firms, Citi supports the BSBs  independent role to help rebuild trust  and confidence across the U.K. banking  industry by promoting high ethical and  professional standards for behavior and  competence. We remain engaged with  the BSB directly through Citis U.K. senior  management. James Bardrick, Citis Chief  Country Officer for the U.K., has been a  BSB Board member since its inception. REINFORCING CONDUCT  AND CULTURE AT CITI  Embedding values requires time, senior  leaders who serve as role models  and advocates, clear and consistent  communications, and forums that allow  for candid exchange, learning and  development. To promote ethical conduct  and enhance Citis culture, we focus  on both empowering individuals and  creating firmwide policies and programs  that embed our values throughout  the organization. Over the past year,  we have focused on reaffirming our  values and delving deeper into how  to adhere to the high expectations  of stakeholders for ethical and  professional behavior in our industry.  We have also worked to help all of our  employees understand what is required  to meet those expectations. Citis  Leadership Standards outline behavioral  expectations of employees that align  with our Mission and Value Proposition. Conduct Risk Program  Our global Conduct Risk Program is a key  part of the effort to embed and embody  Citis core values and high standards  of ethical behavior into our business  strategy. We continue to implement  this global program across businesses  and control functions to manage and  mitigate instances of conduct risk,  including intentional or negligent actions  of employees or agents that may lead to  negative outcomes for customers, clients  and markets. In 2016, Citi implemented  the program across multiple businesses  in 44 countries, and many other  businesses and countries are scheduled  for program implementation in 2017. CITI'S MISSION AND VALUE  PROPOSITION VIDEO,  featuring Citi CEO Mike Corbat,   is the most viewed video in   company history MORE THAN 20,000 EMPLOYEES    completed in-person and virtual  Leadership Matters: It Starts  with Us training, which focuses  on bringing an interactive,  case-based approach to our  Ethics and Leadership program  to build manager capacity to  exercise new leadership habits  that transform Citis culture EMPLOYEES GLOBALLY   continue to be trained  on our Code of Conduct,  available in 26 languages  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    19 Importance of Escalation  Throughout 2016, we emphasized  with all of our employees globally the  importance of escalating issues that  may pose significant risk to Citi. These  communications reinforce the principles  embedded in Citis global Escalation  Policy, including employees obligation to  escalate potentially significant risks, how  to identify these risks and what channels  are available for their escalation.  These channels include, among others,  management, Human Resources or labor  relations representatives, internal legal  counsel, a designated compliance officer  and the Ethics Hotline. Communications  from senior managers both globally and  at the individual business level have  reinforced these principles. We also  released a video to our global workforce  in December 2016 that highlights the  importance of escalating significant risks. Code of Conduct Citis Code of Conduct (Code),  updated in October 2015, outlines the  standards of ethics and professional  behavior expected of employees and  representatives of Citi when dealing  with clients, business colleagues,  shareholders, communities and each  other. Individuals performing services  for Citi may also be subject to the Code  by contract or agreement. The Code is  publicly available in 26 languages and  reinforces the message that adherence  to our core values and principles is every  employees responsibility. Biennially,  Citi employees are required to complete  Code of Conduct training intended  to help them better understand their  responsibility to make the right ethical  choices, their obligation to promptly  report actual or suspected misconduct  and to know to whom concerns should  be reported. We offer separate training  for non-employee workers who have  access to Citi systems. The Code is  approved by the Ethics and Culture  Committee of Citis Board of Directors. Ethics Hotline Citis Ethics Office provides multiple  channels for employees, customers,  suppliers and other third parties to  raise ethics concerns. Concerns may be  submitted in multiple languages via a  toll-free number available 24/7, email,  fax, mail or website submission.  All  concerns are treated as confidentially  as possible, consistent with the  need to investigate and address the  matter. Concerns may be raised either  anonymously or with attribution, subject  to applicable laws and regulations.  Further, Citi prohibits any form of  retaliation against anyone who raises a  concern or question in good faith, or who  participates in an ethics investigation.    MANAGING COMPLIANCE RISK  The Compliance Risk Management   organization is responsible for helping to  drive a culture of ethical conduct at Citi  by establishing policies, programs and  procedures that guide and support our  employees in making ethical decisions  and adhering to the appropriate  standards of conduct. Through an  integrated compliance risk management  framework, this group protects Citi by  setting standards; providing guidance,  training and advice to our businesses  regarding compliance risk; and  driving ownership and accountability  for managing compliance risk in  accordance with Citi standards across  the firm. Managing compliance risk is  the responsibility of all of our employees  and requires not only adherence to  applicable laws, regulations, policies  and relevant standards of conduct, but  also the promotion of business behavior  and activity that is consistent with  the values and conduct expectations  outlined by our Mission and Value  Proposition, Leadership Standards and  Code of Conduct. Citis global Compliance  organization is headed by our Chief  Compliance Officer, who reports  directly to Citis Chief Executive Officer  and provides regular reports on the  performance of the compliance program  to Citis Board of Directors, including the  Audit and Ethics and Culture Committees.  Anti-Bribery and Corruption Program  Citi complies with all applicable anti- bribery and corruption laws and  regulations, including the U.S. Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery  Act and the applicable local anti-bribery  and corruption laws of the countries in  which Citi operates. Our Anti-Bribery  and Corruption Program expressly  prohibits bribery in any form for our  employees as well as our suppliers. We have written policies, procedures  and internal controls reasonably  designed to comply with anti-bribery  laws. We conduct an annual bribery and  corruption risk assessment of all global  business lines. It addresses many areas  of risk, including gifts and entertainment,  hiring practices and third-party  relationships. We provide our staff with  anti-bribery and corruption training  annually and supplement it with targeted  training and communications as needed.  We give staff multiple ways, including the  Ethics Hotline, to escalate instances of  corruption and to prompt investigations  where necessary. Citis Anti-Bribery  and Corruption Program is overseen  by our Chief Compliance Officer.  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    20 Sanctions Program  Citi conducts business and operations  in compliance with applicable sanctions,  laws and regulations, including those of  the U.S. and other countries in which we  operate. We maintain a robust, risk-based  Sanctions Compliance Program that  applies globally and is commensurate  with our global footprint. As a financial  institution organized in the U.S., Citi  and its subsidiaries globally comply with  applicable U.S. sanctions requirements,  among other requirements. Our enterprisewide Sanctions  Compliance Program promotes  compliance with increasingly dynamic  sanctions requirements. The program  includes policies and procedures,  enterprisewide screening, annual risk  assessments and audits of sanctions  control processes, employee training  and a diverse team of Compliance  professionals stationed around the  world. Citis Sanctions Compliance  Program and the associated policy is  owned by the Chief Sanctions Officer,  and the policy is approved by the Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors.  Anti-Money Laundering Program  One of our most important obligations  is to protect the integrity of the global  financial system. Our Anti-Money  Laundering (AML) Program helps  protect our clients, businesses and  the financial system from the risks  of money laundering and terrorist  financing through a robust, globally  consistent program. It is based on our  Anti-Money Laundering Policy, which  provides globally consistent controls  to identify and mitigate risks related  to money laundering and comply  with relevant laws and regulations. The program centers on:  -  Prevention: Citis Global Know Your  Customer Program is the cornerstone  of our AML Program, enabling us to  effectively evaluate the potential risks  associated with each client relationship  and ensure that we adhere to globally  consistent policies and standards,  customer risk scoring and onboarding.  -  Detection: We monitor transactions  to identify unusual or suspicious  transactions, behaviors or patterns  of activity across our global footprint.  Our AML investigations unit reviews  transactions of new and existing  clients across businesses and regions.  -  Reporting: We create, track and  file Suspicious Activity Reports,  Suspicious Transaction Reports  and Currency Transaction Reports,  as required in many countries.  -  Governance: Our enterprisewide  controls govern the overall program,  including global AML policies,  processes, testing and training. Citis  Global AML Program Head and Bank  Secrecy Act Officer is responsible for  overseeing the program, including  apprising the Board of Directors and  senior management of AML initiatives,  any significant deficiencies and the  reporting of suspicious activity.

These specialists help  us effectively execute the program and  meet our AML-related requirements.  The global program is supported by  the Compliance, Finance, Legal, Risk  and Internal Audit functions. In 2016,  we centralized our AML efforts into a  single, comprehensive function, including  both compliance and operations, to  support the evolution of our AML  Program with increased sophistication,  effectiveness and efficiency. * AML, Sanctions and Anti-Bribery and  Corruption training is a combined online  training. Numbers include all Citi staff who  completed the 2016 training as of January  24, 2017. Employees and non-employee  workers have 30 days to complete it.  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    21 Taxation Policies  and Standards  Our commitment to our Mission and  Value Proposition extends to our tax  policies and approach to paying taxes.  We operate in 97 countries and strictly  abide by all tax laws in the U.S. and  throughout the world. We are a current  income tax payer, both within and outside  the U.S. Our tax profile is consistent with  the locations of our business operations,  and our review and escalation processes  enable us to adhere to high standards  of compliance with applicable tax laws. We emphasize strong internal controls   and transparency with global tax  authorities and share information  relevant to our tax profile. We  supplement this transparency with  additional country-by-country reporting,  which is required under the Organisation  for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD) action plan to  address base erosion and profit shifting. Citi complies with reporting and  withholding requirements imposed  globally on financial institutions in  connection with customer transactions  they intermediate. We have implemented  systems and processes to comply with  the Foreign Account Tax Compliance  Act and are phasing in compliance  with the Common Reporting Standard  as it becomes law in approximately  90 countries. Citi has implemented  the Common Reporting Standard in  all applicable 2016 early-adopting  countries where local implementing  guidance has been issued. Similarly,  we have a firmwide policy applicable  to customer transactions under which  Citi will only engage in a transaction  where there is a high degree of certainty  that any tax aspects will be accepted  by the respective taxing authorities. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  Our governance structures, policies  and processes serve employee, client  and community needs, promote a  culture of accountability and ethical  conduct across our firm, and are  publicly available on our website.  Board of Directors  and Committees  Our Board aims to have at least two-thirds  of its membership as independent  directors. Currently, 86 percent of the  board is independent. Additionally, the  Chairman of the Board is a nonexecutive  independent director. As of January  2017, the standing committees of our   Board of Directors are:  -  Audit                                       -  Ethics and Culture  -  Executive  -  Nomination, Governance and Public   Affairs  -  Operations and Technology  -  Personnel and Compensation   -  Risk Management  All Board committees play a role in  providing oversight of our efforts to  ensure responsible business practices.  For example, the Personnel and  Compensation Committee reviews all  compensation programs, including  incentive compensation, to ensure  that they do not, among other things,  encourage imprudent risk-taking. The  Nomination, Governance and Public  Affairs Committee oversees Citis  global citizenship and sustainability  activities and performance. Our Ethics  and Culture Committee reflects our  commitment to promote a strong  culture of ethical conduct. This  committee is highly engaged and in  continuous dialogue with management.  To review the responsibilities of each  of the committees of our Board of  Directors, see our board charters.  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    22 Executive Compensation We compensate our executives fairly,  based on individual and company  performance, competitive benchmarking  and support of our Mission and Value  Proposition. Citis Proxy Statement  contains a scorecard with each  named executive officers financial  and nonfinancial performance goals,  which are approved by the Boards  Personnel and Compensation Committee.  We incorporate shareholder and  stakeholder input on executive pay  into our Compensation Philosophy. PUBLIC POLICY We engage directly, and indirectly  through trade associations, with  governments and elected officials  around the world to advocate public  policies that support the interests of  our company, clients and employees  in the countries and regions where we  operate. In 2016, guided by our Political  Activities Statement, which ensures  compliance with all applicable laws  and regulations, we promoted policies  and positions on issues such as trade,  cyber security, data localization, tax  and financial reforms. Government  Affairs team members complete annual  compliance training, conducted by  outside experts, on campaign finance,  lobbying and gift/entertainment rules. Under U.S. Federal Election Commission  rules, Citis Political Action Committee  pools the voluntary contributions of  employees to support U.S. political  candidates and campaigns that  support the financial industry and  complementary pro-business policies.  This support allows us to take an  active role in our countrys political  process, promote our business goals  and strengthen relationships with  policymakers. Annually, we disclose  our U.S. political contributions online,  and contributions are reviewed by the  Nomination, Governance and Public  Affairs Committee of the Board.  We also provide extensive disclosure  about our practices pertaining to  political contributions and lobbying  activities, as well as a regularly  updated list of our significant trade  and business associations, on our  Corporate Governance webpage. Our employees need to have the skills  and support to make sound decisions  and take actions that preserve our  culture of integrity, every day, across  the globe. Our work in promoting an  ethical culture is ongoing, as the  challenges our business faces grow  ever more complex. At the same time, questions around  the trustworthiness of banks remain,  and there is more to be done to  articulate how we, along with our peer  institutions, place a premium on our  respective cultures and expectations  for appropriate conduct.  This work will continue day in and day  out, as we focus on working to earn,  maintain and safeguard the trust of  our shareholders, customers, clients  and the public at large. WHATS AHEAD  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    23 INFORMATION SECURITY   With ever-increasing threats from  a host of actors globally that use  technology in an effort to stay ahead  of law enforcement, our customers  expect us to protect their assets and  personal information from these risks  every day without imposing burdensome  security measures on them. As a result, data security and privacy  are a top priority for Citi and for many  of our key stakeholders and are among  our most material issues. Citis Global  Information Security Program employs  an approach that couples information  gathering and data analysis with  forensics to inform strategic decisions.  Our approach rests on having the right  technology, systems, policies, processes  and talent in place to prevent, detect,  respond to and recover from cyber  threats quickly. We conduct regular  information security risk assessments  and trainings and have internal controls  to prevent information security breaches.  We have developed stringent policies,  employ robust technologies to protect  CONSUMER AND  CLIENT PROTECTION Establishing Citi as a trusted partner to our clients is foundational  to our ability to facilitate economic progress around the world  and ensure that the banking system in which we operate remains  robust and trustworthy. Citi works to earn and maintain that trust  every day by safeguarding our customers assets and information  and conducting business in a responsible, ethical way. our data and systems, and have built a  strong, well-trained team that includes  former law enforcement. Citis Global  Information Security Program enabled us  to effectively detect and respond to any  incidents targeting our systems in 2016,  but we remain vigilant as such threats  persist. Our program is accredited by  the British Standards Institution, and  Citi is the first major financial institution  to have its Global Information Security  Program ISO 27001 certified. Our Global  Information Security Program is also  regularly examined by regulators as  well as internal and external auditors. Citi also collaborates with external  stakeholders to raise the security  of the industry. We work with our  clients, competitors, governments, law  enforcement and intelligence agencies  to share best practices and conduct joint  cyber resilience exercises. Our security  teams also study information security  challenges across industries to learn  how to strengthen our internal practices  and respond to problems quickly.    23 2016 HIGHLIGHTS More than 119,000 employees globally completed  annual training on  TREATING CUSTOMERS FAIRLY EXPANDED BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION across various Citi products, and  implemented voice biometric  authentication in customer service  centers in multiple countries  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    24 Reinforcing our culture of ethics and  responsibility, the Audit Committee  of the Board of Directors oversees  the development, implementation  and maintenance of Citis Information  Security Program. The program is  managed by the Chief Operations  and Technology Officer and the Chief  Information Security Officer on a global,  enterprise basis, and the Chief Executives  of each business sector and region are  responsible for implementation and  compliance with program procedures  and requirements. Annually, we provide  our employees with training on how to  properly handle personal information  and how to maintain the security and  privacy of information when working with  companies that provide services to us. PRIVACY  The fair, ethical and lawful collection, use  and processing of customers personal  information is essential to build trust,  provide best-in-class services and  achieve our corporate objectives. To  help meet this goal, Citi has established  a dedicated Chief Privacy Office team  led by a Chief Privacy Officer. The Chief  Privacy Office team leads the Citi Global  Privacy Program, which is overseen  by the Citi Global Privacy Committee.  The program provides a framework for  effectively and efficiently overseeing and  coordinating the management of privacy  and confidentiality risks. Our Privacy  and Confidentiality Policy articulates the  principles for the collection, use, sharing  and disposal of Personally Identifiable  Information (PII) and Customer Data  in accordance with its disclosures and  applicable laws and regulations. We  provide transparency on our practices  and also offer customers choices with  respect to how their personal information  may be shared. We ensure that customers  participate in the management of their  PII where legally required, such as  confirming their preferred method of  communication, reviewing and correcting  information and opting out of marketing  solicitations.

ETHICAL HACKERS  PROTECTING OUR CLIENTS  Some estimates indicate that data  breaches could cost businesses  more than $2 trillion globally by   2019,1 and cyber criminals dont  limit their attacks to large  institutions such as Citi — they can  also target individuals. We work  proactively behind the scenes to  protect our clients from the ever- increasing and complex threat of  cyber crime.  Since 2001, we have had a small  team of specialists testing Citis  electronic safety and safeguards.  That team has now grown to 100  full-time ethical hackers who view  Citis offerings from the perspective  of cyber attackers, identify security  holes that need to be plugged and  stay current on the cutting edge  of technology. This teams focus  has evolved beyond protecting  against current attacks to also  proactively guard against future  ones by evaluating new products  and services to ensure that they  are as safe and secure as possible  before being rolled out. CASE STUDY  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    25 INNOVATING ACCESS As the flow of information moves  increasingly to digital platforms, we are  using sophisticated technology to provide  a streamlined, secure banking experience  for our consumers even when they are  on the go and using mobile platforms.  For example, in 2016 we expanded  biometric authentication across various  Citi products, and implemented voice  biometric authentication in customer  service centers in Australia, Hong Kong,  Singapore, Taiwan and the U.S. This  technology allows us to verify customers  identities within 15 seconds or less as  they explain their reason for calling.  We are continuing to explore how a  range of biometric authentications,  such as fingerprint, voice and facial  recognition, can create a better, faster  and more personal experience for clients  — giving our customers more secure  options to access their accounts.  In addition, we work to ensure that our  products and services are designed  and accessible to our clients varied  needs and preferences. For people with  disabilities, Citi offers braille and talking  ATMs, large print and braille statements  and raised line checks. We also offer  TTY or Text Telephone for the hearing  impaired. Recognizing that we serve  diverse populations, many of our services  are provided in multiple languages. TREATING CUSTOMERS FAIRLY Citis U.S. and Global Consumer Fairness  Policies and Treating Customers Fairly  (TCF) Program demonstrate that our  culture focuses on the fair treatment of  customers and encourages employees  to view fairness as a key element of  delivering a remarkable experience.   The aim of the TCF Program is delivering  products and services that provide value,  clarity and dependability, guided by  the Fairness Principles that define our  standards for our products and services.  The TCF Program provides a globally  consistent framework for analysis of  consumer fairness concerns and a model  for managing emerging risks for our  Consumer Bank. Citis Business Practices  teams have established formalized  escalation processes to facilitate  1. WORKS AS DESCRIBED Customers can predict how the  product or service will work 2. APPROPRIATE Global Consumer Banking  provides products and services  that are appropriate for its  customers, and customers  can rely on the bank to offer  products that match their needs  3. VALUE Customers receive value that  is reasonably related to the  cost of the product or service 4. EASE OF UNDERSTANDING Customers understand the terms  and conditions of the product  or services (particularly any  limitations or exclusions) CITIS FAIRNESS PRINCIPLES consistent, timely and appropriate  identification, analysis and escalation of  potential consumer fairness, reputational  and franchise risk issues. Global Consumer  Bank employees are required to complete  an annual fairness training program to  ensure they understand how to identify  issues of fairness and how fairness  influences real-world results. In 2016,  more than 119,000 Citi employees around  the world completed the course. RESPONSIBLE MARKETING Ensuring that we provide clear marketing  for our products and services and that  our products responsibly meet the  needs of our clients are priorities for  Citi as we work to effectively manage  conduct risk throughout the company.  See Conduct, Culture and Governance  for more on conduct risk. For example,  as part of our customer-centric approach  to communicating with customers in a  simple and easy-to-understand manner,  our Global Consumer Banks U.S. Branded  Cards business launched targeted video  messages in 2016. These personalized  communications have enabled us  to visually demonstrate features in  a clear and compelling way that is  customized to individual customers.  This new content has been well received  by customers, who indicate through  customer surveys that it has led to  increased comprehension of key topics. For new U.S. credit card customers, we  introduced these personalized videos as  part of the new cardmember welcome  kit for Citi Online and Citi Mobile.  These videos provide straightforward  information to cardmembers about their  new cards value proposition and benefits  and how they can manage their account  and make payments online. After watching  the videos, 89 percent of customers who  responded to a survey said they better  understood their new cards benefits.  In addition, we launched yearly  personalized videos for existing  cardmembers to re-educate them on  their cards value proposition and  benefits. Of those customers who  watched the videos and responded to  our survey, 83 percent said they better  understood their cards benefits.  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    26 In addition to tracking customer  satisfaction through the activities just  mentioned, we use the Net Promoter  Score (NPS) system, which measures  customers willingness to recommend  Citi to others. In recent years, weve  revamped our approach for capturing  customer feedback through a new  survey platform and reporting tool,  through which we measure our NPS.  We use standard metrics and processes  across our company to compare regional  performance and surface best practices  and problem areas we can learn from.  We are continuing to build and roll out  dashboards that enable us to review  survey results and customer feedback in  near real time. The dashboards help us  see and act upon customers feedback  more quickly, and many managers use  them to closely monitor feedback in our  major markets and service channels.  These initiatives are just some  examples of our firmwide commitment  to ensuring that our activities are in  the best interest of our clients. More  broadly, new products are approved  by cross-functional committees that  include senior executives from Risk,  Legal, Compliance and other relevant  units, supported by specialists from  other Citi units, such as Fair Lending,  as needed. Citi marketing materials are  reviewed by our Compliance and Legal  departments to ensure that products  are clear, fair and comply with applicable  laws, regulations and Citi policies.     CUSTOMER FEEDBACK   AND SATISFACTION We invest in leading-edge tools and  resources to systematically capture  customer feedback and satisfaction  and develop processes to quickly  monitor, diagnose and act upon  customer experience issues.  When customers indicate through  surveys that they have unresolved  service issues, our team uses a  closed-loop feedback process to  follow up and resolve the problems.  In addition to responding to specific  customer concerns, weve established  a listening command center that  proactively identifies emerging issues  that arise through multiple channels,  including social media, phone, chat and  email. Using data analytics, we work  to understand the root causes of the  problems so we can take corrective  actions to avoid them in the future.  These corrective actions can range  from policy changes to improvements  in particular customer touch points,  such as websites or call centers.  We are in a period of transformation  in banking services. The speed to  market of various mobile solutions  is only increasing, as banks compete  with startups and disruptors. Its  those who are listening to their  customers to understand their  needs, adapting products and  services and continuing to push  innovative, secure solutions, that  will truly be successful.  We dont expect threats from various  actors to dissipate. We know that we  must continue to protect the privacy  and security of our customers  information. At the same time, we  continue to develop innovative  digital solutions that make it easier  for customers to have the services  they demand, while maintaining the  security they rely on.

For Citi, diversity and developing           our talent are business imperatives.  We are a global company and welcome  people of every cultural background,  gender, race/ethnicity, generation,   sexual orientation, and gender identity   or expression, as well as military veterans  and people with disabilities. We strive  to treat all employees fairly and with  respect and hold them accountable for  maintaining our standards of excellence.  Our senior leaders are deeply invested  in ensuring that employees experience  a diverse and inclusive culture. Each  of us has a responsibility to create an  environment where all employees are  comfortable to contribute, be themselves  at work and deliver their best for clients.  At Citi, we value our employees, who span a wide range of  backgrounds and perspectives from over 100 countries. We  come to work every day to serve as a trusted partner to our  clients by responsibly providing financial services that enable  growth and progress. Our success rests on our ability to create  an environment that supports the personal and professional  growth of our employees, one where they can be themselves. TALENT AND  DIVERSITY  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    28 A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE CULTURE  Citis culture supports our mission  of enabling growth and progress.  Leadership matters — our culture  is not just who we are and what we  believe; it's how we lead in everyday  moments. Holding ourselves and each  other to the highest standard is part  of our commitment to operating in  our clients best interests, driving  economic value and minimizing risk.  MANAGING DIVERSITY AT CITI  Holding ourselves to the highest standards  means setting the tone from the top: our  most senior leaders view themselves  and others as accountable for enabling  an equitable and inclusive culture where  we proudly reach our fullest potential. Weve created clear measures of  accountability for leaders at all levels.  This starts with the CEOs leadership  team, who co-chair (along with other  senior leaders in the business, functions  and regions) each of our Affinity  groups (Asian Heritage, Black Heritage,  Citi Women, disAbility, Generations,  Hispanic/Latino Heritage, Military  Veterans, Multicultural, Parents, Pride).  These Affinity groups are designed to  ensure that we understand, appreciate  and leverage the uniqueness of our entire  employee base. Under this new model, we  launched Black Heritage, Citi Women and  Pride in the beginning of 2017 and will  continue to establish the rest throughout  the year.

For managing director  and director level hires, we continue to  leverage diverse slates, ensuring that  women globally and/or racial and ethnic  minorities in the U.S. are interviewed  for our open roles. In 2016, 71 percent  of interview slates for managing  director and director roles included  at least one diverse candidate. Also,  we launched diverse interview panels  in 2016 to ensure the diversity of our  interviewers who represent Citi. In our  inaugural year, 74 percent of managing  director level hires were interviewed by  a panel with at least one diverse panel  member. These practices are important  levers for us to ultimately achieve  our goal of increasing representation  of women and U.S. minorities.  We are also utilizing technology                to help us build a diverse and inclusive  workforce.

To further enable  our commitment, weve combined the  Talent and Diversity organizations to  ensure that diversity is embedded —  and  measured —  in all our talent processes  and initiatives and that our diversity and  talent efforts are consistently linked   with our business strategy. Our Diversity  Operating Committee, made up of senior   diversity human resource leaders,  ensures our programs and policies  advance our culture and inclusion goals,  and our Board of Directors reviews  our progress and priorities annually. Research and experience both confirm  that when a company embraces diversity,  the most talented people are not just  attracted to joining the company,  but are also much more productive  and motivated to stay. Maintaining                    a truly diverse environment has been  proven to be a leading indicator of the  quality of our culture in addition to  being an effective way of connecting  to an equally diverse client base. We believe that we are all accountable  and responsible for promoting  inclusion and work to continually  enhance our capabilities.   Employee Networks  Citi Employee Networks are groups  initiated and led by our employees.  They offer professional development,  mentoring, networking and community  engagement opportunities to members.   Consistent with our inclusive culture,   groups are open to all Citi employees,  whether or not they identify with a   particular community. We now have   140 networks in 63 locations across   36 countries, with 15,000 members  aligned to our Affinity groups. Diversity in Our Leadership Standards  Our Leadership Standards set the  expectations we have of all our leaders.  These standards are now linked to  our director and managing director  promotion criteria, our performance  management process and our  recruitment efforts.

Mentoring programs  like the one supported through Citi  Womens Network Hong Kong often  focus on the impact on the mentee,  and rightfully so, but the impact on  the mentor should not be overlooked.  Along with the satisfaction of  assisting a colleague in navigating  the complicated process of career  development within Citi and the  broader industry, the program gives  mentors a fantastic opportunity to see  a familiar industry and professional  environment from a different point  of view. That renewed perspective  is so valuable. To be good managers,  its critical that we understand — and  appreciate — different generations,  career paths, business roles,  lifestyles and aspirations.   - ADAM COWPERTHWAITE,  Managing Director, Head  of Equity Asia Pacific, Citi  Private Bank, Hong Kong REGION TOTAL CHAPTERS NAM 79 LATAM 11 EMEA 34 APAC 16 NETWORKS TOTAL CHAPTERS BLACK HERITAGE 8 ASIAN HERITAGE 5 DISABILITY 9 GENERATIONS 4 HISPANIC/LATINA  HERITAGE 7 MILITARY VETERANS 16 MULTICULTURAL 5 PARENTS 12 PRIDE 21 WOMEN 53 TOTAL 140 *As of December 31, 2016 Addressing Unconscious Bias               Another critical aspect to building the  right culture is addressing unconscious  bias in the workplace, which is an  area where we continue to invest and  focus.

Diversity in Our Hiring Practices  While the training of our current  employees is important, we have also  focused on our hiring practices to ensure  that diversity is embraced throughout   HOW WE DO BUSINESS    30 Total Citi New Employee Hires # 43,761 Rate 20.0% Employee Turnover  (Voluntary) # 31,184 Rate 14.0% Male Female 21,013 22,748 19.40% 19.9% 14,872 16,312 13.8% 14.3% APAC EMEA LATAM NAM 10,808 4,434 11,568 16,951 17.9% 1.5% 60.5% 22.4% 9,577 3,249 7,674 10,684 15.8% 11.2% 13.3% 14.2% ASIA PACIFIC   (APAC)  59,660 LATIN AMERICA  (LATAM)  55,182 NORTH AMERICA  (NAM)  76,086 TOTAL EMPLOYEES  218,849 EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA  (EMEA)  27,921 Workforce Data Employees 218,849 Non-Employees 13,688 Total Workforce 232,537 Full Time 214,452 Part-Time 4,397 EMPLOYEES BY EMPLOYMENT TYPE EMPLOYEES BY REGION GENDER REGION  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    31 WORKFORCE WELL-BEING  We are continually evaluating the tools  and resources available to support the  well-being of our global workforce. We  recently enhanced our Paid Pregnancy  Leave Policy in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.  As of January 1, 2017, Citi employees  who have been with the company for  at least one year have access to 16  weeks paid leave as the birth mother  (up from 13 weeks) and eight weeks Paid  Parental Leave for all other parents in  connection with the birth or adoption  of a child (up from two weeks). Nearly one-third of Citi employees  leverage our formal or informal flexible  work arrangements, contributing to  employee satisfaction and retention,  increased productivity, business  continuity and more efficient use of  work space. Our formal flexible work  program, Citi Work Strategies, has  more than 17,000 employees enrolled,  allowing them increased opportunity  to meet their personal and business  needs, and includes options for  part-time work and job-sharing. Our Live Well program helps  employees and their families achieve  their health goals and includes  resources that are free, easy to use  and available for employees, whether  or not they are enrolled in a Citi  health plan. Our Save Well plans guide  our employees in building financial  stability and saving for retirement.                                 We rely on our global workforce to be  actively engaged in the communities in  which they live and work. In 2016, Citi  volunteers contributed close to 940,000  volunteer hours in communities around  the world. Citis Global Community  Day, our annual day of service for  employees, friends and family, is an  important way in which we enable  progress through service. Close to  90,000 volunteers participated in events  held in more than 500 cities and 91  countries. Through Pathways to Progress,  our Citi Foundation commitment to  supporting career readiness in young  people, over 2,000 Citi employees  play in an integral role in acting as  volunteers, mentors and coaches.

The DLP alumni  testimonials were consistent-the  program was going to contribute to  fine-tuning executive presence, hone  in on strategic communication skills,  and provide access and visibility to  some of the most senior leaders of  the firm. The most valuable lesson  for me was better understanding my  leadership style and the importance  of how that style is perceived by  others. This lesson was critical for  me to make a successful transition  to director with increased respon- sibility within the TTS business.  DLP heightened my self-awareness  and helped me create a framework  of self-reflection that I continue to  utilize today.   - CRISTAL CHUNG,  North America Market  Management Head for Financial  Institutions, Treasury and Trade  Solutions (TTS), New York Participation in Citis Pride Network  may be a small act in the scheme of  things, but with the world as it currently  is I believe it is more important than  ever for individuals to show their views  through action. The confluence of  some great Pride Week speakers and  the emerging social rhetoric motivated  me to become more involved in our  Pride Committee, at first attending as  an ally and recently being elected to  the Steering Committee. It made me  realize that if I want my workplace,  environment and country to evolve into  the type of culture I believe in, then   I need to be active in shaping that.  - SARAH DAVIES,  Management Associate,   Global Consumer Banking,   Sydney   HOW WE DO BUSINESS    32 LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT  We have continued to focus on enhancing  our learning experience for our global  employees by shifting to more flexible,  cloud-based learning solutions. These  platforms enable our employees to focus  on topics important to their growth,  when and where it is most convenient  for them through mobile access. The  delivery of this digital content has been  greatly enhanced and offers a more  engaging experience to connect with  expert content through videos, tools,  checklists and assessments. One of  our partnerships in this space is with  Udemy, one of the largest producers  of educational how-to videos. Udemy  offers a range of business courses  developed by industry experts. In just  one year, Citi employees (part-time  and full-time) viewed nearly 50,000  hours of Udemy training content.                              In 2016, 100 percent of Citi employees  received some form of training.  We also have a range of internal  programs focused on developing our  leaders at all levels. For example, in our  Institutional Clients Group, the Diversity  Leadership Program is a six-month  program for high-potential women  and minority vice presidents who have  access to workshops and individualized  coaching and sponsors to help build  their confidence, executive presence and  strategic skills. To date, 204 individuals  have participated in the program. There are also three High Potential  Accelerator programs across our      Global Consumer Banking business  focused on developing leaders who have  the potential to take on more complex  leadership positions and critical roles       in the future. The three programs target  emerging leaders to executive-level  leaders, each with a different focus,  ranging from fostering greater cross- business/functional mobility to  building innovation and customer- centricity skills, to providing individual  executive assessment and coaching.  Since inception in 2011, 215 employees  have participated in these programs.  In our global Risk group, we have  a 12-month program designed to  strengthen the pipeline of women for  leadership roles. Under the guidance  of a sponsoring member of the Risk  Management Executive Committee,  Women in Risk participants identify  career goals, implement a customized  career development plan and expand   visibility through networking opportunities.   Since inception, more than half of the   participants have taken on new or  expanded roles within the firm. CLIENTS AND SUPPLIERS  The value of diversity to our business  extends throughout the value chain,  from our employees to our clients  and customers and our suppliers. Our  diverse workforce reflects the diverse  clients and communities we serve. Our  clients are deeply engaged in issues  around diversity, and we invite them  to participate in activities around our  shared interest. One example is our  annual celebration of International  Womens Day (IWD). In 2016, we  hosted 244 IWD events in 130 cities  across 82 countries, including 41 client  events that attracted 1,800 clients.  The Citi Supplier Diversity Program  was created to give maximum  opportunity to diverse partners who  satisfy our purchasing and contractual  standards. The program works to  create mutually beneficial business  relationships with diverse suppliers  that strengthen the communities  we serve and create value for our  shareholders. For more details on our  supply chain, see Responsible Sourcing. FAIR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES Our global workforce is our greatest  asset, and we strive to maintain an  environment where opportunities to  develop are widely available, where  people are hired and advanced on  their merits and where our employees  treat each other with mutual  respect. We are fully committed to  equal employment opportunity and  compliance with the letter and spirit  of all laws regarding fair employment  practices and nondiscrimination.  My resume never matched a  keyword search. As it turns out,   I needed to meet someone in person  to show them my ability. Previously,  I applied for postings at Citi, but  it wasnt until I attended Citi and  You, a new workshop focused on  identifying and hiring individuals  looking to start a new career in  financial services, that I found a   way into Citi. I am an attorney  and teacher by trade, but I lacked   previous banking experience.   Through Citi and You, I met a  representative from Citis Legal  Department who encouraged me  to consider roles outside of the  traditional attorney career path.  It became clear to me that my  experience as an attorney and  educator at both the secondary  and college levels could be relevant  to work at a financial institution.   It prepared me for my role   overseeing end-to-end contract  administration, and I joined Citi   as an ESC contract specialist in  September of 2016. - JENNIFER LYNCH,  Enterprise Supply Chain (ESC)   Contract Specialist,  Enterprise Operations and  Technology, Tampa GLOBAL EMPLOYEE TRAINING BY  REGION: HOURS PER EMPLOYEE               ASIA PACIFIC 40 EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA 38 LATIN AMERICA 45 NORTH AMERICA 51  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    33 Each day, we strive to create an  inclusive workplace where our nearly  220,000 employees can thrive. Our  senior leaders will be championing  initiatives, policies and programs for  our newly launched Affinity groups  that enable our talent to perform  at the highest level and ensure an  inclusive workforce. A culture of  inclusion is one of Citis strategic  advantages and allows us to partici-  pate in an increasingly competitive  environment defined by innovation  and growth.   WHATS AHEAD Compensation Citi takes pride in offering competitive  salaries across the regions in which  we operate. Citi conducts a robust  annual review of compensation, which  includes multiple layers of management  and Human Resources review of  compensation recommendations.           We design our compensation program  based on Citis Compensation  Philosophy, which outlines the five  primary objectives that our program  and structures aim to achieve. Our approach to compensation also  includes ensuring that employees who  are paid hourly receive competitive  wages within the industry. We also  offer employees the opportunity to  take advantage of formal or informal  flexible work arrangements, including  part-time work and job sharing. For more information on fair  employment practices see the  Human Rights section of this report  as well as Citis Code of Conduct.

We value our employees  input and closely review this feedback. Our overall employee  satisfaction held steady in 2016 at 76 percent satisfied. The  VOE Surveys Diversity Index, which measures four items —  senior manager support for diversity, equal opportunity for  a successful career, manager support for work/life balance        and whether employees feel they are treated with respect  and dignity — held steady this year at 81 percent favorability.  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    34 With our global reach, we have the ability  to influence decisions related to human  rights issues across sectors and around  the world. For that reason, our work to  respect human rights touches all aspects  of our company. We have specific policies  and codes of conduct in place, including  our Statement on Human Rights, that  protect our employees, provide guidance  to our suppliers and inform our business  decisions, including what we choose to  finance. We conduct risk analysis, due  diligence and stakeholder engagement  activities to ensure human rights  considerations are taken into account  across our business. Human rights are  a key component of our Environmental  and Social Risk Management activities  and an important consideration in our  financing decisions. In some situations,  we are well positioned to try to exert a  positive influence on those involved in  HUMAN RIGHTS adverse human rights impacts, leading  to a range of outcomes. For example,  our anti-money laundering efforts help  us to prevent criminally sourced funds,  including funds from activity associated  with human rights abuses, from  passing through our bank. Our ability  to disrupt the flow of money to those  perpetrating human rights abuses is an  effective way to thwart their efforts.  In other situations, however, we have  far less opportunity to exert a positive  influence consistent with our values. In those instances, our first approach is  to engage as constructively as possible  to improve our clients awareness and  practices, but at times we also need to  re-evaluate the client relationship. For more about anti-money  laundering, see the Conduct,  Culture and Governance section.  As a global bank that connects millions of people worldwide,  it is imperative that we champion and strive to protect  human rights wherever we do business. We employ hundreds  of thousands of people, purchase a significant amount of  goods and services around the world and provide financial  services in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. The  potential for human rights abuses to be carried out by those  with whom we do business places a serious responsibility  on us and also creates an opportunity to put our values  into action. Advancing respect for human rights involves  complex decisions with uncertain outcomes, but it is a task  we embrace and work toward implementing every day.   34 2016 HIGHLIGHTS JOINED  SHIFTS BUSINESS LEARNING PROGRAM Shift is the leading center of  expertise on the UN Guiding  Principles on Business and  Human Rights SCORED 100% on the Human Rights Campaigns  Corporate Equality Index annually  since 2004 GRI indicator:   G4-27  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    35 OPERATING WITHIN THE GLOBAL  CONTEXT OF HUMAN RIGHTS As we encounter and address human  rights issues, we do so within a broader  global context. Citi engages human rights  experts, clients and peers with the intent  to promote and help secure respect for  human rights, in line with the United  Nations Guiding Principles on Business  and Human Rights — a global framework  for preventing and addressing the risk  of adverse impacts on human rights  linked to business activity. This report  has been prepared in accordance with  the UN Guiding Principles Reporting  Framework (see Index). The UN  Guiding Principles draw upon existing  international human rights instruments  whose principles we endorsed years  ago, such as those in the UN Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and the  International Labour Organizations  Core Conventions regarding child labor,  forced labor, freedom of association,  the right to organize and bargain  collectively, as well as equal pay and  nondiscrimination in the workforce.  IMPLEMENTING OUR RESPECT  FOR HUMAN RIGHTS The UN Guiding Principles on Business  and Human Rights, which were endorsed  by the UNs Human Rights Council in  2011, call upon companies to adopt  policy statements on human rights  that they operationalize and to make  those statements publicly available. Policy Development   and Stakeholder Engagement For years prior to the adoption of our  formal Statement on Human Rights in  2007, Citis Environmental and Social  Risk Management Policy, which we  adopted in early 2003, guided our  approach to environmental and social  issues related to our financing of our  clients business activities. As a part of  developing our Statement on Human  Rights, which we last updated in 2014,  we conducted broad-based internal and  external stakeholder engagement to help  assess our human rights impacts and  identified issues across our employee  population, supply chain, clients and  the domestic and foreign communities  where we do business. We regularly  update the policies and practices that  underpin our Statement on Human  Rights to continuously strengthen  our human rights due diligence.  Beyond our policy update process, we  regularly communicate our approach  to human rights issues externally and  engage with stakeholders on issues  of concern. During 2016, we engaged  nongovernmental organizations,  including the Rainforest Action  Network, BankTrack and Global Witness.  As part of these interactions, we  received feedback about our human  rights policies and discussed trends  and concerns related to various  industries and about specific issues.  In addition, we pay close attention  to human rights issues raised by  stakeholders within specific industries,  such as fossil fuel extraction, forestry  and palm oil. In response to these  concerns, we actively engage with  those industries by participating in  groups such as the Roundtable on  Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). We  take very seriously the opinions and  information that stakeholders provide  us with regard to human rights. Citis senior management is informed  about and discusses human rights  issues. Salient issues are regularly  communicated to senior management  and our Board of Directors. For more  about governance of citizenship  issues, including human rights, see the  Citizenship Governance at Citi section.  Our Salient Human Rights Issues Human rights has in recent years  emerged as one of our most material  issues, a concern that was reinforced  by the findings of our 2015 materiality  assessment. We recognize that our most  salient human rights issues, where risks  to people are greatest, could also pose  material risks to the business as well. We have spent more than a decade  working on the most salient human  rights issues for our company. While we  evaluate human rights risks that could  arise in our own operations as well as  our supply chain, our most salient human  rights risks are those that are related to  our financing of client activities. Most  of these risks we identified under our  ESRM Policy as Areas of High Caution  several years before the advent of the  UN Guiding Principles, although the  ESRM process substantially mirrors the  analysis under the UN Guiding Principles  of risk severity and salience. Our work  to address these risks has included  establishing an internal ESRM team,  developing our risk identification and  mitigation policies and procedures and  helping to found and govern the Equator  Principles framework to enhance and   standardize risk management across   the banking sector.  The salient issues we have consistently   worked on related to financed activities   include:  -  Indigenous Peoples. Various concerns  can arise regarding consultation in  project development, contestation over   land rights and uses, as well as potential   impacts on habitats, livelihoods and   cultural heritage.  -  Labor. There are risks related to labor  forces used in the construction of  projects or other operations, including  risks related to forced labor, child  labor and human trafficking by project  operators and their subcontractors.  -  Resettlement. Resettlement of local  communities, including indigenous  peoples, can be necessary for project  implementation. When this occurs, it  should be conducted through carefully  planned resettlement action plans  that are reviewed by project lenders  in advance of implementation.  -  Security. Security concerns have  been identified relating to how  project sponsors engage with  public or private security forces  protecting project sites.  In such  circumstances, if we decide to proceed  with financing, we will advise project  sponsors on the implementation  of international standards, such as  those in the Voluntary Principles  on Security and Human Rights.  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    36 If we do finance any project in which  these issues may be identified,  we manage these risks based on  our ESRM Policy, including, where  applicable, the engagement of an  independent consultant to review  the project sponsors mitigation  approach and efforts. For such  transactions, we typically monitor  the project sponsors implementation  of risk mitigation plans through the  construction and operation phases. We will continue to evaluate human  rights risks in line with evolving  international best practice. RESPECTING THE HUMAN  RIGHTS OF OUR EMPLOYEES Every Citi employee is expected to  adhere to our Code of Conduct, which  includes a commitment to human  rights, and to participate in relevant  trainings. Our Code of Conduct prohibits  unlawful discrimination, harassment  and other behaviors that infringe on  individual rights. This policy applies  to all employees as well as suppliers,  clients and community partners  globally. (Details about human rights  related to suppliers and clients are  covered later in this section.)  Diversity and inclusion are of particular  concern, especially in countries where  there is no legal protection based on  characteristics such as gender, gender  identity, race, age or sexual orientation.  Diversity and inclusion issues are not  always discussed in terms of human  rights, but they are essential to human  dignity, a key tenet of basic human rights.  Championing diversity and inclusion  not only aligns with our core values, it  is also vital to our business success. Citi  prohibits discrimination and harassment  of our employees in all forms regardless  of whether or not individual protections  are legally mandated in the countries and  communities where we operate. In fact,  we know that even in locations where anti- discrimination laws exist, there is still a need  for companies to stand up for individual  rights. We provide diversity training to our  employees globally to foster a respectful  and inclusive work environment, and we  investigate and take action on all violations. Freedom of association is another important human rights issue that  affects our workforce. While the financial services industry is not heavily unionized, we do have unions or work councils in   approximately 30 of the countries where   we operate. More than 15 percent of   our employee population is covered by  collective bargaining agreements. We  engage directly with our employees  and through these associations to  discuss issues such as health and safety,  remuneration, work hours, training,  career development, work time flexibility  and equal opportunity. Citi values and  respects our employees, and strives  to provide fair compensation, benefits  and working conditions. We are proud  to be considered an employer of choice,  based on the external diversity and  workplace awards and recognitions  that we have received around the  world. For more information on our  diversity and workforce initiatives,  see the Talent and Diversity section. Our employees are encouraged to use  Citis Ethics Hotline to raise and resolve  concerns, questions and grievances. The  hotline is open to external parties and  available in several formats and languages. EXTENDING RESPECT FOR HUMAN  RIGHTS PROTECTION THROUGH  OUR SUPPLIERS AND PARTNERS Nondiscrimination policies also extend  to Citis and the Citi Foundations  philanthropic grantmaking and to Citis  suppliers. We do not provide funding to  organizations that discriminate on the  basis of personal characteristics, such  as gender, race and sexual orientation,  among others, nor do we work with  suppliers that violate our policies. Our suppliers are expected to adhere  to Citi standards, including those  related to human rights, as outlined in  our Statement of Supplier Principles.  This expectation is reinforced by our  Corporate Responsibility Questionnaire,  which helps our procurement team  determine how well potential and current  suppliers manage environmental, social   and governance issues, including human   rights issues such as labor rights  and health and safety. As with our  employees, suppliers are encouraged  to use Citis Ethics Hotline to raise  concerns. For more information  on our supply chain work, see the  Operations and Supply Chain section. As a U.S. company and the worlds  most global financial institution,  global issues and local policies  impact us as well as our clients. In  2016, the White House called on U.S.  companies to aid refugees in the U.S.  and around the world with education,  employment and enablement (i.e.,  strengthening infrastructure and  access to resources for refugees).  We responded with a commitment to  collaborate with clients and partners  on ideas that respond to the needs of  refugees, including youth education  and employability efforts supported  by the Citi Foundation as well as  financing solutions that address  the needs of displaced persons. In  addition, our CEO issued a message  to our employees reinforcing Citi's  commitment to diversity and the  importance of maintaining an open  and welcoming society. SUPPORTING THE BASIC NEEDS   OF REFUGEES   HOW WE DO BUSINESS    37 INDIGENOUS PEOPLE LABOR RESETTLEMENT SECURITY OTHER reviews. Of the 28 transactions flagged  for additional human rights due diligence,  9 proceeded to close after we confirmed  the client was managing and mitigating  the potential risk appropriately.  Transactions may not reach financial  close for a number of reasons, not solely  tied to ESRM review. The specific types  of risks reviewed are outlined in the table  below. One transaction may have more  than one human rights risk. One example of a transaction reviewed   was a small letter of credit for a construction  company acting as a subcontractor on a   hydroelectric dam. The business sent  the transaction to the ESRM team given  some potential triggers of the Areas of  High Caution in Citis ESRM Policy. ESRM  screening flagged the transaction for  human rights review, and the ESRM   teams due diligence identified allegations   of forced labor in construction of the   project, as well as troubling environmental  and cultural impacts to a UNESCO  biosphere reserve. Given the identification   of these risks, we declined to approve the  transaction as it was not in compliance  with our ESRM Policy. Citi has approximately 14,000 corporate  and institutional clients. The UN Guiding  Principles acknowledges the challenges  posed by having such extensive business  relationships and, accordingly, we have   adopted their recommendation of  identifying general areas in which the risk  of adverse human rights impact is most  significant. This entails identifying what  may be the underlying cause of such risks  —  for example, a companys operating  contexts or direct operations, their  products or services, or other relevant  considerations —  and then prioritizing  them for review (see Our Salient Human  Rights Issues on page 35). We regularly  evaluate and, when needed, enhance our  due diligence requirements to ensure that  all our clients manage and mitigate risks  in line with international best practices. We also believe in the value of  transparency around these issues.  Citi engages with NGOs in an effort to  communicate about our processes and  advance transparency as appropriate.  While, in recent years, banks have come  under increasing pressure to disclose  specific findings related to client projects,  we are bound by legal requirements and  business ethics related to confidentiality  that limit our ability to disclose such  information. As we continue to work with  our clients on human rights issues in  their organizations, addressing requests  for transparency will continue to be a  balancing act between protecting the  confidentiality of our clients information  and disclosing information to stakeholders  as appropriate to advance the protection  of human rights more broadly. ADDITIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS   DUE DILIGENCE IN OUR FINANCING  Assessing and managing human  rights risks related to our clients and  the projects we finance are integral  to respecting human rights at Citi.  Our ESRM team reviews clients and  projects we are considering financing  for environmental and social risks,  including those relating to human rights.  Our ESRM Policy pays special attention  to activities we believe pose heightened  risks to individuals and communities.  This includes an absolute prohibition  on financing any clients or projects  involved in forced labor, child labor  or human trafficking. In addition, the  policy covers Areas of High Caution  — heightened environmental and social  risks that require closer due diligence  and heightened risk management. These  areas are discussed on page 35 under  Our Salient Human Rights Issues. To assess and manage risks consistently  around the globe, our client transactions  must comply with Citis ESRM Policy.   We review transactions covered by our  ESRM Policy for human rights risks  during the initial due diligence phase,  and do our best to ensure that these  risks are being properly mitigated and  managed by our clients as a condition for  our financing. In addition, Citi complies  with the Equator Principles (EP) to assess  and manage environmental and social  risks for financing projects. The EP  framework helps financial institutions  define processes and standards for  stakeholder engagement, including  mechanisms for affected communities  to address grievances proactively  with project sponsors. For more  information, see the Environmental  and Social Risk Management section. Transactions Reviewed Under Citis  Statement on Human Rights  In 2016, the ESRM team screened 411  total transactions at the initial marketing  phase, and of those, 28 were flagged as  requiring additional due diligence for  human rights risks. Note that this does  not include other human rights risk  assessments the ESRM team does as  part of annual client reviews or portfolio  *There were 28 transactions requiring additional human rights due diligence in 2016. Of those,  nine closed after risk remediation. 7 16 1 8 1 6 1 2 6 3 RISK(S) IDENTIFIED IN  TRANSACTIONS REQUIRING  ADDITIONAL DUE DILIGENCE* HUMAN RIGHTS RISK RISK(S) IDENTIFIED IN THOSE  TRANSACTIONS THAT CLOSED  AFTER RISK REMEDIATION  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    38 Following the flow of funds from  human trafficking is no easy task; its  like looking for a needle in a haystack.  But we began on a year-long journey  of testing what we knew and what we  didnt and inputting massive amounts of  data. In the end, we built an algorithm to  identify potential patterns of behavior  related to human trafficking. - A lead statistical data miner,   Data Intelligence Unit, Citi The Data Intelligence Unit is a specialized  group within our AML team that  seeks to understand connections  and associations related to the  movement of money to prevent fraud  and money laundering. To report  and deter the illegal movement of   money  within  Citi  related  to   these crimes, the team worked  with law enforcement and Citi   investigators to develop a highly  effective algorithm to systematically  identify potential human traffickers.  The team is leveraging its patent- pending methods to further advance  detection by applying advanced data  science techniques to detect human  trafficking networks — potentially  giving the algorithms a global range. PREVENTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE STUDY  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    39 UPHOLDING HUMAN RIGHTS IN  COUNTRIES WHERE WE DO BUSINESS We are committed to upholding high  standards of human rights protection,  regardless of the varying human rights- related laws and practices in the  many places where we operate. Not  all governments uphold their duty to  protect, respect and fulfill human rights  according to international standards.  Consequently, we sometimes find there  are situations where local policies do  not align with efforts to respect human  rights. Particular examples include  issues related to diversity and inclusion,  especially related to gender and lesbian,  gay, bisexual and transgender issues;  some countries where we operate have  laws or practices that are contrary to the  protection of these rights. Consistent  with the UN Guiding Principles, in these  instances, we increase our due diligence  to ensure we manage any risks related  to our business, share best practices  and set a positive example to raise  human rights standards worldwide. CONTINUOUS LEARNING  AND IMPROVEMENT  Continuous learning and engagement  with other companies and experts  in the field of human rights is a key  component of our approach to respecting  human rights. In 2016, Citi joined Shifts  Business Learning Program. Shift is a  nonprofit organization that engages with  companies, governments, civil society  and other actors to build capacity and  provide guidance and expertise related  to implementation of the UN Guiding  Principles on Business and Human Rights.  Our work with Shift will improve our ability  to meet our human rights responsibilities  in a number of ways. First, we are working  together to build a more sophisticated  system that identifies heightened risks  within our client base, across geographies  and sectors. This system uses a  portfolio-based approach, through which  we identify client sectors and subsectors  that, based on their industry and geography,  have a greater risk of human rights  impacts. The insights we gain from the  analysis will help inform our evolving  human rights due diligence approach.   Through our participation in Shifts  Business Learning Program, we are also  collaborating with other companies to  understand how they are bringing the  UN Guiding Principles to life for their  businesses. Given the broad range of  sectors represented, this strengthens  our capacity to advise our clients,  especially those we have identified with  gaps between their current human rights  performance and best practices. Clients  with identified gaps may be working  toward completion of an Environmental  and Social Action Plan to fill those  gaps. See the Environmental and Social  Risk Management section for more  information about these action plans.    COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING To further analyze our human rights  performance and continue our  commitment to transparency, we  have undertaken an effort to align  our reporting with the UN Guiding  Principles Reporting Framework. In  addition to increasing transparency and  accountability, this reporting provides  a single place to find a comprehensive  review of our human rights activities  and our expectations for those we  employ and do business with — further  clarifying the responsibilities our  employees, suppliers and clients have  in this area. We will continue to develop  our reporting using this framework,  and we will engage with external  stakeholders to help us understand  their expectations for disclosure. Global financial institutions such as  Citi operate within a complex set  of circumstances related to human  rights. The extent of our influence  and input on our clients activities  can often be limited as they navigate  human rights challenges. We are  mindful, as noted in the UN Guiding  Principles, that disengagement  should be a last resort, as that  would eliminate any influence and  potential leverage we might have  in working with our clients. As we  continue to collaborate with clients,  we are focused on strengthening  our due diligence and increasing our  understanding of human rights risks  that can be addressed. One area for  opportunity is how we can go beyond  minimum legal compliance in high- income OECD countries.   We will continue to listen to  stakeholder concerns and expert  views to stay on top of human rights  issues. We receive this input in a  variety of ways, including through  employee training, concerns raised  through our Ethics Hotline and  other feedback we receive from  employees, suppliers and clients.  Whatever we do, we must see  human rights not in terms of how it  affects companies or financial risk,  but how it affects people. WHATS AHEAD  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    40 OUR ESRM POLICY  Citi lends billions of dollars of capital  to a wide variety of companies and  projects, many of which have potential  environmental and social impacts. We  carefully evaluate and consider these  risks when making financing decisions on  individual, project-related transactions,  during annual company reviews, and  when assessing entire portfolios.  Our ESRM Policy covers a broad  scope of financial products, and it  sets standards for assessing client  impacts on local communities, labor,  biodiversity, air quality, water quality  and other environmental and social  issues. As the first U.S.-based financial  institution to introduce a comprehensive  ESRM Policy — back in 2003 — we  continue to evolve our ESRM Policy  and standards in response to emerging  risks and new product development.  ENVIRONMENTAL   AND SOCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT At Citi, we help our clients meet the worlds toughest  challenges and embrace its greatest opportunities. Managing  and addressing environmental and social risk in our financial  transactions helps us ensure that those challenges and  opportunities are met responsibly. Environmental and  Social Risk Management is one pillar of our Sustainable  Progress Strategy, and the related activities and policy  help us and our clients navigate a constantly evolving  risk landscape and make responsible decisions.  In 2016, coal mining and palm oil were  two sectors that received special  scrutiny and focus from us and our  stakeholders. In the coal mining  sector, particular areas of concern  are contributions to greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions, climate change and  community impacts. In 2016, we had  our first full year of implementation  of our updated Coal Mining Standard,  which requires additional enhanced due  diligence for coal mining companies  and commits Citi to reducing our credit  exposure to this industry over time.  This commitment applies globally to  coal mining companies generating a  majority of their revenues from coal  mining activities, including those that  use mountaintop removal methods,  and to coal-focused subsidiaries of  diversified mining companies. As part  of the enhanced due diligence process,  the ESRM team analyzes the companies    40 2016 HIGHLIGHTS REDUCED OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE  to coal through the first full year of implementation of our COAL MINING STANDARD Addressed fire prevention  practices of PALM OIL CLIENTS  to assess alignment with industry  best practice by updating our  DUE DILIGENCE QUESTIONNAIRES Piloted an ESRM Watchlist  process to provide an                   EARLY WARNING SYSTEM on clients and transactions  that may pose heightened  ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL                 OR REPUTATIONAL RISK GRI indicator:   G4-27  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    41 environmental and social policies and  performance, including environment,  health and safety management systems,  mine safety data, pollution control  information and community relations.  To deliver on our commitment to credit  exposure reduction, we have reduced  and are actively measuring and tracking  our credit exposure, which is reviewed  by senior management in our business,  Risk and Public Affairs groups.  We also updated the due diligence  approach for our Sustainable Palm Oil  Standard in response to the growing  human rights and environmental  concerns that we see in this industry,  including impacts to biodiversity, air  quality and labor issues. In 2016, we  began strengthening our human rights  efforts through our partnership with  Shifts Business Learning Program and  engagement of a third-party consultant  to help us further develop the Areas  of High Caution — issue areas that  require special attention, focus and  respect — outlined under our current  ESRM Policy. For more information  on our human rights work, see the  Human Rights section of this report. POLICY IMPLEMENTATION Our centralized team of ESRM specialists  evaluates all transactions that trigger  a review according to our ESRM Policy.  We also rely on employees throughout  our organization globally, including  designated ESRM Champions — credit  risk officers who have expertise in  regional and product-related ESRM  issues. ESRM Champions provide  important regional insight that improves  our ability to make responsible lending  decisions. This network approach greatly  enhances the global coverage capacity  of our centralized specialist team.  The ESRM team works collaboratively  and regularly shares information and  best practices that help support and  strengthen the entire network.  Transactions reviewed by the ESRM  team are categorized as A, B, C or GR  (general review), based on the magnitude  of potential adverse social and  environmental impacts associated with  the project. Project-related financing is  assessed against applicable standards  — either national law in high-income  OECD countries, or the Environmental  and Social Performance Standards  and Environmental, Health and Safety  Guidelines of the International Finance  Corporation (IFC) for projects in  emerging markets. Our ESRM policies  help us ensure responsible financing of  projects while managing and minimizing  environmental impacts and effectively  engaging local communities. Higher-risk,   project-related transactions receive  in-depth reviews against applicable  standards by independent environmental  and social consultants. If gaps are found  between a clients environmental and  social plans, policies or practices and  industry best practices, we develop   an Environmental and Social Action Plan  (ESAP) to fill the gaps. As a condition   of financing, we require the client to  implement the ESAP, and we monitor  progress over time. The application  of our ESRM Policy helps us identify  additional risks we may not otherwise  be aware of, guides decisions for  how to evaluate future transactions  related to companies or projects  within high-risk sectors and presents  opportunities for us to advise clients  on solutions to thematic risks.  To learn more about our ESRM  Policy, including Areas of High  Caution, sector-specific standards  and policy prohibitions, visit our  Guidelines for Environmental Practices  webpage and our Environmental  and Social Policy Framework. MONITORING EMERGING RISKS As part of our commitment under our  Sustainable Progress Strategy, the ESRM  team is implementing new methods to  proactively scan for emerging risks in  both specific clients and projects, and  more broadly in high-risk industries  and stakeholder areas of concern. Our  Environmental and Social Risk Radar  Report tracks environmental and social  concerns that pop up in external sources,  such as media outlets, data providers,  internet searches and financial industry-  targeted civil society reports. The Radar  Report flags both high-risk projects  and emerging issues with increasing  risk and/or global attention. It helps us  fine-tune our risk management, raise  awareness within Citi about new issue  areas to watch, shore up our approach  to specific sectors, update policies if  warranted and provide advice to our  clients. The Radar Report is informing  the development of a new ESRM  Watchlist, where we proactively flag  certain client relationships as higher risk  from an environmental, social, human  rights or reputational risk perspective.  While Citi has always kept an eye on  emerging risks and updated our policy  to respond, the Radar Report reflects a  more systematic, data-driven approach,  which increases our ability to flag  issues of concern and take a proactive  approach to addressing these risks.  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    42 Palm oil is a widely used ingredient,  found in products ranging from food to  cosmetics. Derived from oil palm trees,  which grow mainly in low-income,  tropical countries, its cultivation is both  land- and labor-intensive. In addition  to human rights concerns related to  labor practices and the displacement  of indigenous communities, there  are serious environmental risks in  the palm oil industry. Mass fires used  to clear tropical forests for palm oil  plantations or caused by dry, exposed  peat and combustible conditions shrink  the habitats of endangered species and  often cover the region in a thick haze,  contributing to climate change and  serious health problems. Since 2016, Citi has been advising  Global Forest Watch (GFW) on the  development of GFW Finance. The  platform is designed to enable the  finance sector to screen palm oil and  forestry investments and portfolios  for environmental and social risk and  receive ongoing fire and deforestation  alerts related to their clients. This kind  of information is invaluable for banks,  such as Citi, that are attempting to  provide oversight and accountability  in the agricultural commodity sector. We also worked with World Wildlife   Fund and the Indonesian Financial  Regulator (OJK) to conduct a workshop  with risk managers from Indonesias  eight largest banks on our palm oil  due diligence process. This effort is  part of the government of Indonesias  multi-year  sustainable  finance  roadmap. This workshop focused on our  use of GFW Fires, a separate platform  developed by GFW that serves as an  important tool for tracking fires, and  our questionnaire on best practices for  fire prevention on palm oil plantations.  We also presented our Palm Oil Due  Diligence process at the Association of  Banks in Singapore, which helped with  the development of Singapores Haze  Diagnostic Guidance Note. CASE STUDY DEFORESTATION AND THE  PALM OIL INDUSTRY   HOW WE DO BUSINESS    43 Citi provided a loan, guaranteed in  part by Export Development Canada  (EDC), for TRECSA — the Guatemalan  subsidiary of Empresa de Energa de  Bogot. The loan financed construction  of a landmark, 868-kilometer, high- voltage electric transmission line that  will cover nearly half of Guatemala  and provide electricity to previously  underserved areas. However, the  planned route passes through more than  300 communities and 330 kilometers of  natural habitat. An independent review  of the project against the IFC standards  found that it had implemented a robust  communications and engagement  strategy with local communities at all  levels, including best practice elements  such as stakeholder mapping and  community engagement in both Spanish  and indigenous languages. Regarding  environmental impacts, while the project  was designed in compliance with national  laws, it required additional biodiversity  assessment and mitigation work to  comply with IFC Performance Standards.  Citi and EDCs ESRM teams required  the company to hire an independent  biodiversity expert to work with them  to bring the project into compliance  with IFC standards.  This work included  developing and implementing a formal  biodiversity management plan to avoid  impacts to critical habitat and mitigate  impacts to sensitive species, as well as  developing additional staff capacity to  implement these plans moving forward.  This project has set a precedent for  other similar projects in the region  and helped our client enhance its  own environmental and social risk  management capacity. MINIMIZING IMPACTS TO HABITATS   AND COMMUNITIES IN GUATEMALA  CASE STUDY   43  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    44 ENHANCING OUR TRAINING  Annually, we train key risk and banking  personnel on our ESRM Policy, including  in-depth discussions on environmental  and social risks relevant to certain  regions and sectors, Equator Principles  implementation and Citi Sector  Standards. In 2016, our ESRM training  was revamped to include emerging risks  and new guidance to help recognize  environmental and social risk in  transactions. We trained more than  1,000 Citi employees under this new  format. We also worked with the Equator  Principles Association to develop an  in-depth multimedia training module  on the details and implementation of  the Equator Principles. The training  includes videos, quizzes and a broad  range of useful guidance materials. STRANDED ASSETS ANALYSIS  Financial institutions are paying more  attention to stranded asset risk, or  the potential for assets to lose value  as a result of circumstances such as  climate change. For example, power  companies that rely on water for their  operations may face lower earnings  or increased costs due to drought- induced water scarcity. This may result  in a decline in those companies credit  profiles. To understand the resilience  of Citis lending portfolios to drought  scenarios, our ESRM team participated  in a project hosted by the Natural Capital  Finance Alliance (NCFA). The result was  a drought stress-testing tool that blends  traditional valuation methodologies with  environmental scenarios to identify the  impact of drought on key industries. Our  ESRM team has tested the tool, which  is a major step in creating a standard  for environmental stress testing and  climate scenario analyses. In the  future, we will explore incorporating  the tool into Citis Risk Architecture,  as scenario modeling may reflect  how external environmental shocks,  which may become more frequent  with climate change, could affect the  credit quality of certain industries. ZERO DEFORESTATION  INITIATIVES WITH THE  RAINFOREST ALLIANCE Over the past few years, Citi and the  Citi Foundation have collaborated  with the Rainforest Alliance to  develop and roll out workshops  aimed at producing funding models  for zero deforestation initiatives  with smallholder farmers in Peru  and Indonesia. The 2016 workshop  in Peru resulted in a blueprint for an  impact investment fund, which will  continue to be developed in 2017.  In addition, a similar workshop,  focused on small palm oil farms in  high-poverty areas, will take place  in Indonesia in 2017. CASE STUDY   44  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    45 Citi is one of the 17 banks that  financed the Dakota Access Pipeline  (DAPL) project — an underground  oil pipeline in the U.S. from North  Dakota to Illinois. Construction of the  pipeline raised concerns and spurred  protests by indigenous peoples and  environmentalists as well as many  others who were concerned about  the project and its potential impact.  Citi recognizes the importance of the  issues they have raised and will learn  from this experience to improve our  approach to due diligence on social  risk, including on issues related to  indigenous peoples. When first approached to work on  this project, Citi conducted careful  due diligence under our ESRM Policy  and the Equator Principles, and the  project was rated a Category A for  high environmental and social risk. Citi  reviewed the projects Environmental  Assessment report, and, along with  other banks involved, engaged an  independent consultant to review  the permitting and approval process  to confirm compliance with U.S. laws  and regulations, and to prepare a  report summarizing the findings as  required by the Equator Principles.  Through this process, we understood  that the Standing Rock Sioux tribe  had raised concerns about potential  impacts to their drinking water at the  Lake Oahe/Missouri River crossing.  We also understood that, in response,  the project sponsors proposed using  horizontal directional drilling to go  more than 95 feet under the river  crossing to minimize impacts and risks,  in line with industry best practice for  water crossings. Subsequently, we  determined that the project met our  ESRM Policy and the Equator Principles. As the objections of the tribal and  other stakeholder communities to  the project escalated, Citi realized  the need to directly engage with the  Standing Rock Sioux tribe, as well as  a number of stakeholders from the  human rights, academic, investor  and nongovernmental organization  communities, to better understand  their concerns.  We greatly appreciated  the constructive nature of those  discussions and used what we learned  from them to engage with the project  sponsors, expressing our concerns and  advocating for steps toward a peaceful  resolution. Citi, together with TD Bank  and on behalf of the other banks,  spearheaded the engagement of an  independent human rights expert,  Foley Hoag LLP, to review the U.S. legal  requirements for consultation with  indigenous peoples and the project  sponsors policies and procedures in  the areas of community consultation,  cultural heritage assessment and  security. The review resulted in  recommended improvements that  project sponsors can make to these  policies and procedures in line with  international best practice. Citi took away a number of key  learnings from our involvement in  this project that will impact how we  evaluate such work in the future.  Specifically, the current approach to  consulting indigenous peoples in the  U.S. does not align with international  standards, and the policies that  we have used to evaluate those  consultations during due diligence  are not sufficient. Accordingly, we are  working with a third-party consultancy  specializing in community engagement  — Monkey Forest Consulting — to advise  us on strengthening our internal due  diligence in this area this year. We also  intend to continue to maintain a direct  dialogue with members of the Standing  Rock Sioux tribe community and other  relevant stakeholders on a regular  basis going forward. DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE CASE STUDY In 2017, we will strengthen our policy  guidance on human rights due  diligence, with a specific focus on  indigenous peoples, in consultation  with Monkey Forest Consulting,   a third party specializing in  community engagement. This  guidance will help inform another  2017 key initiative, the roll out of   our ESRM Watchlist, which will  identify existing clients with  elevated environmental and social  risks, prior to new transactions,  to stay ahead of emerging risks.  The Watchlist will incorporate data  from third-party environmental   and social data providers together  with further research by our   internal ESRM team, and will create  an early warning system allowing   us to flag targeted environmental  and social risks more efficiently   and proactively. We will also continue to develop  and share best practices with the  banking industry through our active  participation in multi-stakeholder  industry associations. In our role  as chair of the RSPO Financial  Institutions Task Force, we will help  plan a series of workshops on labor  standards and due diligence in  palm oil. And in our new role on the  steering committee of the Cross- Sector Biodiversity Initiative, we  will contribute to the new Guiding  Principles for Business on Key  Biodiversity Areas.

We also  recognize the interconnectedness  of environmental sustainability and  employee well-being and continue to   look for ways to advance progress   in these areas. 2020 Goals  As part of our Sustainable Progress  Strategy and overall commitment to  action on climate change, we measure  our environmental footprint and  set ambitious goals to minimize our  environmental impact. We began  reporting on our direct environmental  impacts related to our operations in  2002, and have achieved the first and  second generation of environmental  footprint goals that we set for ourselves.  OPERATIONS  AND SUPPLY CHAIN In 2015, we announced the third  generation of our operational  environmental footprint goals, which  we intend to reach by 2020. We used  a science-based approach to absolute  reductions consistent with the United  Nations 2C threshold for a climate  tipping point to establish our goal to  reduce GHG emissions by 35 percent  by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050  compared with our 2005 baseline. To  achieve this ambitious 2050 goal, we  will continue to set absolute GHG goals  in five-year increments and track annual  performance. We have also established  2020 goals for energy use, water  consumption, recycling, waste and green  building (see box on the next page). During 2016, we made positive gains  toward our 2020 goals in all areas.  Our GHG emissions and environmental  data are verified and assured by SGS  (see the Assurance section), a leading  third-party inspection, verification,  testing and certification company. With 12,000 owned and leased facilities and thousands  of suppliers worldwide, our operational footprint and  supply chain have an impact on the environment and the  communities where we work. We take this responsibility  seriously and continue exploring ways to increase  efficiency and minimize our negative impacts on the  environment and society. These actions represent one of  the core pillars of our Sustainable Progress Strategy.   49 2016 HIGHLIGHTS Nearly 2,400 suppliers have completed our  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY  QUESTIONNAIRE  since it was established in 2013 REDUCED ABSOLUTE GHG EMISSIONS BY 28% towards our 2020 goal Expanded our LEED-CERTIFIED  real estate portfolio to 20%  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    50 UPDATE ON REDUCING  CARBON EMISSIONS  IN EUROPE  Achieving energy and carbon  dioxide (CO2) reductions at long- established data centers can be  more challenging than designing  new, efficient facilities. In our  2015 Global Citizenship Report,  we first reported on our U.K. data  center and how we addressed this  challenge by selecting Combined  Heat and Power (CHP) technology  to provide the electricity for the  data center.  CHP is a highly efficient technology  for generating energy on site from  a single fuel source, such as gas.  The CHP plant generates electricity  and heat. The heat would normally  be lost, but by coupling the CHP  plant with cooling equipment that  runs in parallel, the heat energy can  be used to help cool the data center.  We are able to use up to 85 percent  of the useable energy produced,  reducing the amount of energy  that would typically be lost during  the transmission of electricity from  central power plants. Citis Asset Finance Group worked  with a third-party investment  company to fund this project through  normal operating costs rather than  with a capital expenditure, requiring  no upfront investment costs by Citi  Realty Services. In 2016, we were able to avoid  6,790.54 metric tons of CO2  emissions, significantly more than  what had been estimated, resulting  in even greater energy and cost  savings at the data center than we  had initially forecast. CASE STUDY 35% REDUCTION                                    in absolute Scope 1 and   Scope 2 GHG emissions  (compared with 2005 baseline) 30% REDUCTION  in water consumption   (compared with 2005 baseline) 60% DIVERSION                                                 of waste stream to landfill  (compared with 2005 baseline) 30% REDUCTION                                          in energy consumption  (compared with 2005 baseline) 10% OF WATER  used coming from reclaimed  or recycled sources 33% OF GLOBAL  real estate portfolio  LEED-certified                                       2020 OPERATIONAL FOOTPRINT GOALS   50  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    51 Reporting In keeping with international best  practice for transparently reporting  climate-related impacts, Citi has  submitted data to the CDP every year  since 2003. We follow the GHG Protocol  Scope 2 Guidance for measuring and  reporting both market-based and   location-based Scope 2 GHG emissions,  and we also report on Scope 3 CO2  emissions from employee air and train  travel and project-financed thermal  power plants. In 2016, Citi received  a score of A- on our climate change  impact reporting, compared to a score  of A in 2015. Reporting requirements  and expectations change frequently,  and while we remain diligent in our  effort to be as comprehensive and  transparent as possible, these changes  can result in fluctuations in year- over-year scores. In 2017, we will review  reporting requirements to identify any  potential gaps that may be addressed. Innovations in the Built Environment There is much that can be done to  design physical workspaces that not  only reduce environmental impacts but  also enhance the comfort, well-being  and productivity of employees (see  next page). In assessing our operations,  we looked for opportunities where the  sustainable design of buildings could  contribute to improved employee  health and wellness, productivity,  engagement and satisfaction.  We are incorporating biophilic design  elements — those that draw on the  principles of nature — into the current  renovation of our global headquarters in  New York. We will be seeking LEED Platinum  certification when the update is complete  and are using environmentally sustainable  products throughout the renovated  spaces. Were also improving air quality  by using no- or low-VOC (volatile organic  compound) paints, installing direct outside  air systems, which balance recirculated  air with outside air, and opening up the  workspaces to accentuate outside views  and bring in natural daylight. Our aim is to  maximize efficiency and make the space as  natural as possible, which is not only better  for the environment but also beneficial  to our employees (see page 53).  The way we procure energy for our  buildings is a big consideration for our  environmental footprint. Buildings  account for about 40 percent of global  energy use and emit approximately  one-third of the GHG emissions.4 In 2016,  we established a contract to purchase  energy for our data center in Roanoke,  Texas. To accomplish this, we worked  with a retail energy provider and — for  the first time to meet our own energy  needs — our subsidiary, Citi Energy  Inc. (CEI). To ensure the sustainable  aspects of this transaction, Citi Realty  Services procured renewable energy  certificates for the entire data centers  load for 2017. CEI was an integral partner  to the success of this transaction.   Travel  There are a number of ways we work to  reduce the environmental impacts of  business travel and employee commuting.  -  Business Travel: We encourage  employees to use video and web  conferencing technologies rather  than traveling, whenever possible.  When travel is unavoidable, we ask  employees to group trips together  to manage costs and reduce the  number of trips taken, and we  offer employees the option of train  travel whenever it is a feasible  alternative. Citi reports our Scope  3 emissions from business travel.   -  Commuting: Many of our offices  are centrally located near public  transportation, which reduces the  need for employees to drive to work. In  the U.S., we offer benefits that enable  commuters to use pre-tax dollars  to cover the cost of commuting by  subway, bus, train, ferry and vanpool.  We also offer bike storage and bike  racks at a number of facilities and  sponsor bike share programs, known as  Citi Bike, in New York City, Jersey City  and Miami. We encourage participation  in New York Citys bike share program  through Citi Bike events at our New  York offices. At our car park in London  Citigroup Center, we offer a dozen  electric vehicle charging stations  for those driving electric vehicles. 4 United Nations Environment Programme, Sustainable Buildings and Climate Initiative website.

The building has  been awarded LEED Platinum  Certification, which contributes  to our goal of 33 percent of our  portfolio being LEED certified by  2020. Citi Towers environmentally  sustainable features include solar  control glass to help reduce the  use of energy for air conditioning,  efficient lighting and lighting  controls and low-VOC paints and  adhesives. Citi Tower is also the  first Citi project approved for  WELL Silver Precertification by  the International WELL Building  Institute. The WELL Standard  — which is separate from yet  highly complementary to LEED  certification — assesses buildings  for features related to health and  well-being. The Tower includes  many wellness-related benefits for  the over 3,000 Citi employees who  work at the facility, from water-  and air-quality testing to a fitness  center and workstations with  ergonomic features. CASE STUDY  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    53 RENOVATING CITIS  GLOBAL HEADQUARTERS  Work is well underway in transforming  Citis global headquarters in  New York City into a modern,  world-class facility that supports  our businesses and functions  and enables employees to work  more closely together and better  serve our clients and customers.   Nearly everything about our   redesigned headquarters — from   its design to its technology —   incorporates sustainability goals  and features, aligned with our  Sustainable Progress Strategy.  Some highlights of the many  sustainability improvements include: --  Reducing our annual carbon  footprint by 30 percent, in part  due to a new cogeneration  plant that will produce heat  and electrical power --  Diverting nearly 98 percent of  the waste from renovations to  facilities that recover, reuse  and recycle materials, to reduce  the amount of construction  and demolition waste that  we dispose of in landfills  and incineration facilities  --  Redesigning and renovating  the public plaza with new  walkways, a multitude of seating  options, and new landscaping  to create a more appealing  environment for our employees  and neighbors in Tribeca The renovated building will serve as  home for most of our New York City  employees by 2019.  CASE STUDY Rendering of the public plaza at the lobby entrance of Citis new headquarters at 388 Greenwich St.,   which will be rebuilt and re-landscaped with multiple outdoor seating areas.  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    54 Employee Engagement  Through our daily practices,  environmental efforts and volunteer-led  Green Teams, we work to engage  employees in achieving our environmental  sustainability objectives. Green Teams  are employee-led groups that design and  lead positive environmental initiatives  tailored to their workplaces and local  communities, such as recycling drives,  volunteer projects, informative lectures  and awareness campaigns. We have  17 Green Teams with more than 1,100  employees operating around the world. In  2016, these Green Teams held more than  250 volunteer and educational events,  resulting in more than 7,200 volunteer  hours dedicated to helping communities.    Companywide participation in global   environmental efforts plays an important  role in engaging employees. During  World Wildlife Funds Earth Hour in  March, more than 3,000 Citi facilities  in 94 countries participated in turning  the lights off between 8:30 and 9:30 pm  local time. This is the 9th consecutive  year that Citi has participated in  the event, and 2016 had the highest  participation rate from our facilities  since we joined Earth Hour in 2008. In April 2016, in support of Earth Week,  an annual campaign of environmental  and sustainability events to support the  globally recognized Earth Day, employees  organized more than 100 events across  10 countries in all four of Citis operating  regions. More than 2,600 employees  globally participated in environmentally  focused events, including educational  events, community projects and  park cleanups, and recycling and  environmental footprint reduction  initiatives. In Tampa, Citi volunteers  participated in a roadside cleanup with  Keep Tampa Bay Beautiful, a community  organization that combines education  and service project opportunities in  an effort to make the surrounding  community cleaner and greener.  Volunteers picked up 84 pounds of  recyclable trash and 180 pounds of  nonrecyclable trash. In Bangkok, 21 Citi  volunteers participated in a workshop  on improving their sustainability  at home through urban farming,  reducing consumption and recycling.             Citi Volunteers from Green Team in Tampa, Florida Citi volunteers in Bangkok, Thailand  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    55 CONNECTING WELLNESS  WITH ENVIRONMENTAL  SUSTAINABILITY  In addition to the importance  of energy efficiency and green  materials, were observing a shift  toward buildings that also promote  wellness as an important aspect of  sustainability in building design.  In keeping with this trend, we  have introduced initiatives for our  employees that emphasize the  intersection of personal well-being  and reduced environmental impact.  The Drink-Up initiative is just one  effort within a broader wellness  campaign for our employees. The  initiative promotes hydration,  but rather than stocking our  breakrooms with disposable plastic  water bottles, we have started  converting the water fountains  at our facilities to also work as  bottle-filling stations. Based on  the amount of water dispensed via  the bottle fillers, we estimate this  has avoided more than 36,000  water bottles between April and  December of 2016 at our global  headquarters in New York. For  more information about wellness  programs for our employees, see  the Talent and Diversity section. CASE STUDY  HOW WE DO BUSINESS    56 RESPONSIBLE SOURCING Many of the material issues weve  defined for our company — ethical  conduct, diversity, human rights,  and environmental and social risks  — have just as much relevance in our  supply chain as they do for the rest  of our business and operations.  Enterprise Supply Chain Our Enterprise Supply Chain (ESC)  team works with our business units to  support the supplier selection process,  implement sustainable supplier initiatives  and mitigate environmental and social  risks in our supply chain. In 2015, we  identified three priority areas in our  supply chain that we are working to  manage and measure as part of our  Sustainable Progress Strategy: paper  and paper products, information  technology (IT) hardware and e-waste  disposal, and travel and logistics. In  2016, we began additional education  and training for employees to ensure  global progress in these three areas.  Supplier Engagement and Evaluation Suppliers provide critical goods and  services our company needs to continue  operating, and we view partnerships  with our suppliers as an essential aspect  of operating responsibly, meeting our  sustainability goals and managing  expenses. Our Statement of Supplier  Principles outlines the ethical, human  rights and environmental standards we  expect from our suppliers. We continue  to build on this foundation, seeking out  suppliers that share our values and  communicating to suppliers about the  importance of these issues to Citi and  to society. Our suppliers are required to  abide by the Citi Statement on Human  Rights, and our Statement of Supplier  Principles further underscores our  strong commitment to human rights in  our supply chain. For more information  about our approach to human rights,  see the Human Rights section.  We use our Corporate Responsibility  Questionnaire (CRQ) to evaluate  suppliers adherence to our Statement   of Supplier Principles and Code of  Conduct and to gauge how well they  manage a range of issues, such as  environmental management, human  rights, labor practices, diversity  and health and safety. In addition,  we include questions related to  modern-day slavery in our Europe,  Middle East and Africa region to meet  the requirements of the U.K. Modern  Slavery Act and plan to roll out these  questions in other regions during 2017.  Our network of Global Champions  helps us adapt the questionnaire to  local cultures and business norms,  and we translate the CRQ into local  languages to make it easier for  suppliers to fill out and to enable  productive follow-up conversations.  If a suppliers CRQ score is low, we  communicate our concerns to the  supplier and our regional sourcing  manager. We typically ask suppliers   to fill out the CRQ every two years.  Suppliers who fall below 70 percent are  asked to take action steps to improve   and submit a CRQ again the following  year. We often find that additional  training and face-to-face dialogue can  help suppliers better understand the   CRQ and our expectations so they can  quickly address any issues that we have  flagged related to their responses.   In 2016, 90 potential suppliers scored   70 percent or lower on the CRQ. We met  with each of these suppliers to review  their CRQs, discuss the factors that led to  their scores and outline steps necessary  for them to improve their scores within  a year when they will resubmit. If the  necessary improvement is not achieved  within that year, we escalate review to  determine whether the contract should  be discontinued. To ensure a consistent  approach and understanding of the  CRQ process and supplier evaluation,  we provide training for our employees.  We also provide sustainability training  and education to suppliers. In 2016, we  hosted several supplier summits, during  which we offered training on the CRQ  to both new and established suppliers.

In addition, the Citi  Supply Chain Development, Inclusion  and Sustainability Program gives U.S.  small businesses and women-, veteran-,  disability- and minority-owned firms  access to business opportunities,  education, mentoring and training.  Working with a range of supplier- focused organizations, we identify  small and diverse suppliers that can  meet our supply chain needs and then  help build these suppliers capacity.  In 2015 and 2016, in partnership with  the New York and New Jersey Minority  Supplier Development Council, Citi  hosted a sustainability symposium for  suppliers and corporate sustainability  professionals in New York City. And in  2016, we hosted the Chief Procurement  Officer Summit for the third year  — an opportunity for Fortune 500  companies with an interest in supply  chain diversity and inclusion efforts  to share best practices and lessons  learned related to supplier selection,  third-party risk management concerns,  supplier relationship management  and cost savings, among other things.  We also partnered with several of our  financial services and insurance peers  to host the launch of the Global Supplier  Diversity Alliance, an effort by a range  of supplier diversity organizations  to promote global diversity. We are also working to expand the Citi  Supply Chain Development, Inclusion  and Sustainability Program beyond  the U.S. In 2016, we continued our  global engagement with Supply Nation  in Australia, entered into our second  year of membership with Minority  Supplier Development U.K. in the  United Kingdom, joined the Canadian  Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Council  and joined WEConnect International,  a global organization dedicated to  the advancement of women-owned  businesses. For each of these, there  is a designated regional champion to  oversee and support the relationship  on a local basis. Additionally, we are  working to drive awareness and support  for women entrepreneurs as part of  Citis broader partnership with UN  Women. See the Talent and Diversity  section for more information. Recognition for Supplier   Diversity Efforts in the U.S. The strategic focus we have placed  on our supply chain efforts, including  our spend, global reach, education,  training and development, led to the  following recognitions in 2016:  -  National Minority Supplier  Development Council Gazelle Award  -  National Minority Supplier  Development Council Corporate  Trailblazer Award  -  New York and New Jersey  Minority Supplier Development  Council Advocate of the Year  -  New York City & State CSR  Awards Sustainability honoree  -  New York State Sustainability honoree  -  Wheeler, Wilson & Johnson  Community Projects, Historically  Black Colleges and Universities  Corporate Trailblazer Award TOTAL TIER 1 AND TIER 2  diverse spend for 2016 was   $828 million, with   $476 million in Tier 1 direct  spend with diverse suppliers CONDUCTED   6 TRAINING SESSIONS   on our supplier diversity and  sustainability goals for our  ESC employees in 2016 IDENTIFIED   7 EMPLOYEE CHAMPIONS  who share best practices  and drive global awareness  on key supply chain issues  critical to our strategy Because Citi operates within a global  context, we must keep a constant  eye on our work to minimize our  environmental footprint across all of  our operations worldwide. We have  made significant progress in the last  year in incorporating considerations  of how sustainable design can  impact employee well-being, and we  will continue to look for cutting-edge  approaches in this regard.   In terms of our supply chain, we will  continue to focus on increasing the  diversity of our suppliers. We have  made progress in promoting global  diversity among our supplier base  in the U.S. and will continue to look  for ways to do so globally. One opportunity we see moving  forward is how we can source  more renewable energy to meet our  needs. We are also considering how  a renewable energy sourcing goal  could help us realize the impact  wed like to see in the coming  years. While these efforts could be  impacted by any shifts in the policy  landscape of the many countries in  which we operate, there is potential  to expand this work in line with our  broader sustainability goals.

SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    61 Society is facing the  interconnected challenges of  rising wealth inequality, rapid  urbanization and climate change.  As one of the worlds leading  financial services companies,  Citi is well-positioned to address  these complex challenges  through our core finance and  investment activities. Whether  it is providing capital for large  infrastructure projects or lending  to a small business owner, we  increasingly see these activities  as potential solutions to global  issues, delivering positive impact  for society and the environment  through products and services that  create value for individuals and  communities. There is still much  work to be done, but we believe  that by addressing the challenges  of today, we can find greater  opportunities for tomorrow. SOLUTIONS  FOR IMPACT  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    62 ENVIRONMENTAL FINANCE We feel strongly that Citi can, and must, make a positive  impact by using our banking products and services to finance  a more environmentally sustainable economy. One of the  pillars of our Sustainable Progress Strategy is Environmental  Finance, which focuses on Citis client offerings that help  combat climate change and provide other environmental  benefits. We track this activity throughout the company as  part of our flagship $100 Billion Environmental Finance Goal.    62 2016 HIGHLIGHTS FINANCED & FACILITATED $26.3 B as part of our $100 Billion  Environmental Finance Goal Faciliated $5.9 B IN GREEN BONDS  for environmentally  responsible projects Financed  FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND PROJECTS  like the Block Island Wind  Farm Project, the first OFFSHORE WIND FARM  in the U.S.  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    63 The Goal from a Global Perspective  Curtailing greenhouse gas emissions  through greater development of energy- efficient buildings, transportation  infrastructure and clean energy  sources will be a crucial part of global  commitments to climate action, including  the Sustainable Development Goals and  the Paris Agreement to keep the average  global temperature increase below 2C  compared to pre-industrial levels. There  is a large need for financial solutions to  fulfill these commitments, and Citi and  our clients can play an important role  in bringing such projects to fruition. In  relation to the SDGs, our environmental  finance efforts are directly aligned  with Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean  Energy) and Goal 13 (Climate Action). CITI'S $100 BILLION  ENVIRONMENTAL FINANCE GOAL In 2015, Citi announced our $100 Billion  Environmental Finance Goal to lend,  invest and facilitate $100 billion over  10 years in activities that reduce the  impacts of climate change and create  environmental solutions in collaboration  with our clients. Large-scale projects  that support renewable energy  generation, green building and mass  transit solutions — the types of activities  that are counted towards the goal  under our environmental criteria — are an integral part of the response by  both the private and public sectors to  address the challenge of climate change  and other environmental issues. Since announcing our goal, we have  recorded environmental finance activity  of $97.5 billion, $26.3 billion of which  took place in 2016. In fact, we have  nearly achieved our goal in three years  due to the unprecedented growth  of environmental finance markets —  including renewable energy finance  and green bonds — and the ambitions  of our clients. Although we are on track  to achieve our goal in 2017, we are  challenging ourselves by adopting a  new methodology that counts only Citis  share of a transaction rather than total  deal value. This approach is based on  established finance sector league table  accounting, rather than total deal value. This approach better captures the   direct impact of our work. Applying   this methodology, our 2016 share was  $17.9 billion, while our adjusted overall  finance activity since 2014 is $41.2 billion.   We will continue to measure environmental   and social impacts associated with the  deals counted toward the goal. These  measures reflect both our commitment  to addressing climate change through  our business, and a willingness to learn  and adapt as the field of environmental  finance continues to evolve.  When we launched the $100 Billion  Environmental Finance Goal, we  established environmental criteria  to identify activities that would  count toward the goal. Projects  may qualify toward the goal if  they finance one or more of the  following: 1. Renewable Energy  2. Energy Efficiency 3. Sustainable Transportation  4. Water Quality & Conservation 5. Clean Technology 6. Green Building CRITERIA FOR THE $100 BILLION  ENVIRONMENTAL FINANCE GOAL ACHIEVING OUR GOAL The Corporate Sustainability team   works in close partnership with a   range of Citi business units across   the firm to track, on a quarterly basis,  the deals that meet the goal's criteria.  These deals are carefully reviewed  and considered for inclusion. Although many deals under the   $100 Billion Environmental Finance  Goal reflect day-to-day business  activity that would have taken place  regardless, by setting this goal we have  been able to more proactively engage  and collaborate with clients and others  on the issues of climate change and  sustainability. The goal has also given  us the opportunity to begin measuring  the impacts of our environmental  finance activities and drive increased  dialogue on the value of environmental  finance among our customers,  competitors and other stakeholders.  There are a number of ways that our  business units contribute to our goal.  Two examples of Citis leadership  in environmental finance are our  engagement in alternative energy  finance and the growth of green bonds.   SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    64 Environmental Finance Our $100 Billion Environmental Finance Goal: To lend, invest and facilitate $100 billion over 10 years   toward activities that reduce the impacts of climate change and create environmental solutions. Alternative Energy Finance Citi provides a full range of financing  solutions for environmental projects  globally, and we continue to develop  innovative, end-to-end solutions to meet  our clients unique financing needs.  Our Alternative Energy Finance team  has developed extensive expertise in  financing solutions for a broad spectrum  of renewable energy technologies,  including wind, solar, geothermal and  biomass. For larger, utility-scale projects,  such as the Mariah North Wind Project  in Parmer County, Texas, we are able to  provide multiple services as a one- stop shop for our clients, providing  construction financing, commodities  hedging and tax equity on a single deal.  By accessing multiple services from  a single provider, our clients are able  to reduce transaction costs, thereby  enhancing project returns. Green Bonds Citi has been the second-largest  underwriter of corporate green bonds  globally for the past two years. We also  cofounded the Green Bond Principles,  which provides issuers with guidelines  encouraging transparency, and are  an active member of its Social Bond  Working Group. In 2016, as part of that  group, we worked on the release of  the Social Bond Guidance document  to support the growth of the emerging  social and sustainable bond market  and helped our clients raise $5.9 billion  through green bonds to meet their  environmental and commercial goals.

Citi helped  Trkiye Snai Kalknma Bankas  A.S. (TSKB), Turkeys first privately  owned development and investment  bank, issue the first-ever public  benchmark sustainability/green  bond for the Central and Eastern  Europe, Middle East and Africa  region, supporting its goal of  being a leading bank in Turkeys  sustainable development. Proceeds  from this bond will be allocated  toward refinancing and funding  new projects that address climate  change mitigation and adaptation,  as well as sustainable infrastructure.  The green nature of the offering  allowed TSKB to save up to 20 basis  points versus senior pricing on this  $300 million, five-year green bond.  This pioneering transaction won the  International Financing Reviews  2016 Socially Responsible Investing  Bond of the Year Award.

Greenhouse Gases Avoided (mt) $100 Billion Environmental Finance Goal  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    67 More companies are considering how  they can incorporate recycled product  and packaging materials back into their  supply chain to form a closed loop or  circular economy, but the challenge of  effective, economically viable recycling  continues to be a barrier to a truly  closed-loop approach.  rPlanet Earth is one company bringing  an innovative new approach to address  this barrier to a more sustainable  economy. With financing from Citi and  other investors, rPlanet Earth will build  its first polyethylene terephthalate  (PET) recycling facility in Vernon,  California. PET is a type of polyester  used in clothing, containers for food and  liquids, and a variety of other materials.  The  companys  technologically  advanced  and  highly  efficient  equipment is able to process a variety  of different types of PET — from raw  material feedstock to finished products  — without costly intermediaries,  enabling them to offer competitively  priced recycled PET suitable for bottles  and packaging to a range of consumer-  industry customers.  The new rPlanet Earth facility, expected  to open in 2017, will be the countrys first  vertically integrated PET recycling plant  and is expected to create over 100 high- quality jobs. Financing for the project  was structured through the New Market  Tax Credit Program, a federal initiative  designed to spur private investment in  support of low-income communities.  Citi invested over $14 million, while  New Markets Community Capital, MBS  Urban Initiatives and private investors  provided the remainder of the capital. CLOSING THE LOOP  CASE STUDY Environmental and Social Impacts  We measure the environmental and  social impacts associated with many  of the transactions that contribute  to our environmental finance goal.  Through a multi-stakeholder process,  we identified greenhouse gas emissions  reduced, jobs supported and additional  community benefits as key areas of  impact. We developed methodologies for  acquiring the necessary data and created  models to calculate estimated impacts.  These metrics represent the potential  positive environmental and social  benefits associated with our clients  environmental finance activity, and we  are closely tracking best practices in  impact measurement to see how we can  continue to develop our own approach.  In 2016, Citi provided tax equity  financing for residential rooftop  solar systems with approximately  159 megawatts in capacity to be  installed across the U.S. In addition  to providing financing solutions  in the residential rooftop space,  Citi successfully closed its first  Property Assessed Clean Energy  (PACE) tax equity transaction  in the Small and Medium-Sized  Businesses sector, representing  the first solar tax equity structure  that incorporates PACE mechanics. On utility-scale renewable projects,  Citi continues to be a key player  in the space, providing tax equity  financing for over 525 megawatts  of solar and wind projects across  the U.S. in 2016. For example, Citi  provided tax equity financing to  a solar PV facility developed by  Clenera. This is Idahos largest  solar project, Grand View Solar  Farm, at 108 MW DC. The project  is estimated to provide electrical  power to approximately 17,712  homes in Idaho while setting a  precedent for utility-scale projects  in Idahos emerging solar market. SOLAR AT ALL SIZES   67  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    68 BRINGING OFFSHORE   WIND POWER TO THE U.S. In October 2016, Citi provided  financing for the construction and  operation of Deepwater Winds   Block Island Wind Farm, the first-  ever U.S. offshore wind farm.   Citi participated in the construction   loan and provided tax equity   financing along with GE. Block  Island is a 30-megawatt wind farm,  which utilizes five GE turbines  and is located three miles off the  coast of Block Island, Rhode Island.  Each wind turbine is 600 feet   (180 meters) high and can withstand  a Category 3 storm. This is a landmark transaction in  U.S. renewable power history, and  representative of the continuing  growth of renewable energy  development.  The  offshore  installation took two years,   with more than 300 local  workers helping to develop, build  and commission the project,   according to Deepwater Wind. An  independent report by the local  Block Island government indicates  that the Block Island Wind Farm   will lower carbon dioxide emissions  by 40,000 tons each year and is  expected to save Block Islanders as  much as 40 percent on energy bills. The wind farm has executed a  20-year Power Purchase Agreement   with the Narragansett Electric  Company and started delivering  power in December 2016. CASE STUDY As companies and cities strive to   meet their own climate change  goals and contribute to national  government commitments to a  low-carbon economy under the   Paris Agreement, we expect the  renewable energy and energy  efficiency markets to continue to  grow. These shifts toward increased  climate action pose both challenges  and opportunities for Citi and our  public- and private-sector clients.  Finding ways to translate traditional  financing approaches into agile,  effective mechanisms that enable  sustainable technology projects will  be a continuing area of innovation  for Citi.  Renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency and clean tech solutions  are maturing rapidly, but are not  yet at the level needed to keep  warming to the 2C level. Emerging  solutions, such as community  solar and energy storage, are  becoming market-ready and  scalable, but they could require  new financing and risk structures  and will also require broader  energy sector transformation.  Meeting  these  challenges   will require increased skills  development internally, additional  collaboration with key partners  externally, and an ongoing  commitment to applying our core  expertise and activities to create  economic growth and progress. WHATS AHEAD Deepwater Wind's Block Island Wind Farm  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    69 INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES Increasing populations, a widening  wealth gap and aging infrastructure are  all significant hurdles to the ability of  communities to sustainably grow and  for residents to access opportunities for  economic advancement. At the same  time, the resources already present  in communities, including knowledge,  capital and diversity, are powerful  tools for creating innovative solutions  to these pressing issues. With this in  mind, we work to make communities  around the world stronger through  financing and direct investment, as well  as through collaborations with public,  private and community partners. Since our founding in 1812, Citi has been deeply invested  in the communities where we live and work. Its where  our employees children go to school and where our  customers open businesses and buy homes.  Through our business, including the  Municipal Securities Division and  the Public Sector Group, we provide  financing and support to governments  and institutions. Through specialized  functions — including Citi Community  Development, Citi Inclusive Finance and  our Global Government Affairs team, as  well as the work of the Citi Foundation  — we work with community partners,  policymakers and leading thinkers to  provide resources and expertise to test  new approaches and promote policies  that can catalyze economic opportunity.  Our engagement with clients and  community partners goes much deeper  than simply financing projects. We roll  up our sleeves and work with them to  develop and execute ideas that drive  progress. While not every idea leads to  a scalable solution, our objective is to  uncover new ideas and ways of working  that can strengthen communities.   69 2016 HIGHLIGHTS Launched the CITI FOUNDATION COMMUNITY  PROGRESS MAKERS FUND,  a two-year, $20 M initiative to support local  organizations working to build  more sustainable cities in the U.S. RANKED TOP U.S. AFFORDABLE  HOUSING LENDER FOR THE 7TH YEAR  Financed $5.75 B of affordable housing, totaling  nearly 50,000 units INCREASED SMALL BUSINESS LENDING  in the U.S. to more than $11 B, raising lending over the last  five years to nearly $50 billion  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    70 Citis sponsorship of our bike- sharing program began in New  York City, but has since expanded  to several cities across the U.S.,   helping more urban dwellers  decrease their carbon footprints and  expand their transportation options.

We have been  leaders and innovators in this space  since 2012, when we first helped a  client issue a socially responsible  investing corporate bond. In 2016, Citi helped the International  Finance Facility for Immunisation  to raise $500 million through a  three-year Vaccine Bond that gave  investors the opportunity to fund  immunization programs at Gavi,  the Vaccine Alliance, which delivers  vaccines that protect millions of  children in the worlds poorest  countries against preventable  diseases. We also financed nearly  $6 billion in green bonds. For more  information on green bonds, see  the  Environmental Finance section. Citi is also a member of the Green  Bond Principles Social Bond  Working Group, which developed  the document Guidance for Issuers  of Social Bonds in 2016. This  document expands the concepts  behind the Green Bond Principles to  help address other social objectives  beyond the environment. With this  guidance, we hope more clients will  leverage social thematic bonds as  a tool to raise capital to address  social challenges in the future. CHAMPIONING THEMATIC BONDS  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    71 SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES Companies with 250 employees or fewer   account for around 46 percent of the   countrys private-sector employment,5  yet many small businesses struggle to  access the capital that allows them to   grow and, in turn, help communities prosper.  Financing Small Businesses  Citi continues to deepen its commitment  to small businesses by responsibly  providing capital — through loans, lines   of credit and other products and services  — to as many small business customers  as possible to help their businesses  thrive. Citi increased small business  lending in the U.S. to more than $11  billion in 2016, raising lending over the  last five years to nearly $50 billion. Digital Financing Solutions Our digital financial solutions are also  connecting small businesses to new  opportunities by reducing costs and  creating efficiencies. For example,  Citi worked with the government of  Dubai in the United Arab Emirates to  introduce a smart payment solution  to improve the efficiency of their  payment and procurement processes.  The solution allowed suppliers to be  paid more quickly, which opened the  door for smaller suppliers and greater  overall diversity of companies working  in the government supply chain. Citis digital payment systems are also  providing formerly unbanked small  businesses access to the formal financial  sector. In Latin America, hundreds of  thousands of small business owners run  informal corner stores, called tiendas  de barrio, selling everyday consumer  products. Most of these business  owners do not have bank accounts  and instead rely on cash to pay for  inventory. As a result, they not only  struggle to save money and grow their  businesses, but are also often at risk  of theft when holding money to pay  distributors. Citi Latin America used  existing Citi payment systems and mobile  platform technology provided by PAQ,  a Guatemala-based company, to pilot a  secure mobile platform tailored for small  shop owners. Pilot users in Guatemala  and Peru can transmit mobile payments  through SMS messages, decreasing  the need to carry cash. The service not  only helps bring these small business  owners into the formal banking sector,  but also provides users the potential  for greater economic well-being.    Creating an Enabling Environment  Citi also supports programs that help  create an enabling environment for  the growth of small businesses. In  New York City, education, access to  capital and affordable space are all  obstacles to pursing formal businesses  for entrepreneurial New York City  Housing Authority (NYCHA) residents.  With support from Citi, NYCHA, the  largest public housing authority in  North America, created Food Business  Pathways, a free business accelerator  program that empowers these residents  to start and grow food businesses  by providing them with a range of  resources, including business training,  coaching and necessary permits, at no  cost. To date, 92 businesses have been  formed and 140 people — 90 percent  of them women — have graduated from  the program. This impactful approach  has been replicated for Childcare  Business Pathways, a program that  connects public housing residents with  the resources to launch home-based  childcare businesses across the city.  In the San Francisco Bay Area, Citi is  providing financial support to help  local nonprofit SFMade scale its work  in building a vibrant manufacturing  sector to create more entry-level and  middle-class jobs and opportunities for  business ownership. Besides funding  support, Citi fostered connections  between SFMade and municipal leaders  and advertised the organizations  and its members work in Citibank  branches in the San Francisco area.  In 2016, SFMade and the cities and  mayors of San Francisco, San Jose,  Oakland and Fremont announced a  three-year, Bay Area-wide manufacturing  initiative called the Bay Area Urban  Manufacturing Initiative, as well as the  results from the first-ever Bay Area  State of Urban Manufacturing Report.        BUILD RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE,  PROMOTE INCLUSIVE AND  SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRIALIZATION  AND FOSTER INNOVATION As a bank, we help to build economic  prosperity and support job growth in  communities around the world by financing  growth and progress every day. Access to  financial services for small businesses  is a core part of SDG 9. Target 8.3 of  SDG 8 and target 9.3 of SDG 9 are both  dedicated to increasing access to financial  services to the full range of enterprises,  micro- to small-scale industrial and others.   Small businesses are key drivers of growth,   innovation and job creation in many  parts of the world, but they face hurdles  to accessing financial services, and  we provide capital and other financial  services to companies of all sizes across all  industries. Citi and the Citi Foundation are  working to address the challenges faced  by micro and small businesses in accessing  capital and other resources. For example,  Citis Inclusive Finance unit is dedicated  to developing innovative solutions that  give unbanked and underbanked micro  and small businesses  access to financial  products and services. 5 Citi Global Perspectives and Solutions Report, Infrastructure for Growth, October 2016.  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    72 New York Citys LaGuardia Airport  is one of the nations busiest.  Passenger activity grew nearly   20 percent between 2011 and 2015,  straining the airports capacity and  facilities. In July 2015, based on  the recommendations of Governor  Cuomos Airport Advisory Council,  plans were announced to rebuild and  renovate the airport at a cost of around   $4 billion.  In  2016,  the  New  York  Transportation  Development  Corporation sold approximately  $2.5 billion of debt to finance  the redevelopment of Terminal  B, the airports main terminal.  Utilizing our experience developing  large-scale transportation projects  around the world, Citi served as the  bookrunning senior manager of this  deal, a public-private partnership  (PPP) between the Port Authority  of New York and New Jersey and the  LaGuardia Gateway Partnership. A  total of 150 investors participated  in the transaction, the largest-ever  PPP deal in the U.S. Once fully  operational, the new terminal will  be more than 60 percent larger  than the existing terminal and  will ease airport congestion and  improve the passenger experience. RESTORING LAGUARDIA AIRPORT INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE  AND INVESTMENT Globally, the amount spent on  infrastructure as a percentage of GDP  has declined in recent years even though   there is an enormous social need for  infrastructure investments, which have  the capacity to improve the lives of  those living in underserved areas and  stimulate local economies. Currently,  over 1.5 billion people live without  access to electricity, nearly 1 billion lack  safe drinking water and more than  2.5 billion have no access to basic  sanitation.6 As much as $59 trillion7 in  global infrastructure investment will be  needed over the next 15 years as current  infrastructure ages and the population  increases. Furthermore, outdated or  ineffective infrastructure can have a  negative impact on both the economic  and social health of communities. In a  Citi Global Perspectives and Solutions  (Citi GPS) report, Infrastructure for  Growth, published in October 2016,  we made the case for investment in  infrastructure and explored ways in  which we can overcome the barriers  to greater investment in global  infrastructure, including transportation,  telecommunications, energy and water  and sanitation. Citi finances and makes  direct investments in infrastructure  in cities and communities around the  world, funding $42.6 billion worth  of infrastructure projects in 2016. 6 Citi Global Perspectives and Solutions Report,  Infrastructure for Growth, October 2016.  7 Ibid.  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    73 While access to power across  South Africa is fairly widespread,  the reliability of the power is  often tenuous. In addition, access  is fairly limited in surrounding  nations. Citi, in partnership with  the African Development Bank  and various commercial lenders,  provided financing to Eskom,   South Africas power utility and  primary supplier of electricity, to  improve and expand its energy  transmission network. Financing will  ultimately allow Eskom to further  develop its electricity generation  capabilities in South Africa and  across the sub-Saharan region,  thus increasing industrialization  and job creation as well as energy  reliability and overall quality of  life for people in those areas. This  project is a part of the New Deal on  Energy for Africa, which aims to  achieve universal access to energy  in Africa by 2025. POWERING SOUTH AFRICA  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    74 Thematic bonds can play a  valuable role in helping municipal  leaders finance innovations  and opportunities for economic  progress in their communities.  Sound Transit, the regional public  transit authority, serving the urban  areas of King, Pierce and Snohomish  counties in Washington state, is  responsible for developing and  operating a regional, high-capacity  transit system in the high-growth  area of Seattle and the surrounding  metropolitan area. Over 2.9 million  people live in this region, which  continues to see significant  economic and population growth  along with significant congestion.  In 2016, Citi helped bring to market  a $400 million green bond that will  support the expansion of light rail,  commuter rail and bus operations  in the region, where the agencys  overall ridership increased by   27 percent from 2015 to 2016.  This bond financing will help to fund  vital expansions to points north,  south and east of the existing line.  Sound Transits planned use of bond  proceeds adheres to its Sustainability  Plan, which aims to reduce car  trips by carrying more transit  riders, supporting smart regional  growth, fostering transit-oriented  development, designing and building  greener projects, and operating  fleets and facilities more efficiently.  The expansion makes transportation  in the Seattle metropolitan region  more sustainable by saving its riders  15 million gallons of gasoline per  year by removing the equivalent of  28,400 cars from the road each year.  GREEN BOND FUNDS   TRANSIT GROWTH MAKE CITIES AND HUMAN  SETTLEMENTS INCLUSIVE, SAFE,  RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE It is estimated that significant infrastructure  investment will be needed to meet the  rising demand of a growing population and  to create climate-resilient cities — critical  elements of SDG 11. However, the cost and  complexity of this type of investment often  prevents cities from building the necessary  infrastructure.  In 2015, the Citi Foundation seeded a  partnership with the World Resources  Institutes Center for Sustainable Cities,  a leading environmental research think  tank, and C40 Cities, an organization  that connects 90 of the worlds greatest  cities to address climate change, to  form the Financing Sustainable Cities  Initiative. The initiative helps cities develop  business models that can accelerate the  implementation of sustainable urban  solutions in three ways: the development  of a learning community; the provision of  technical assistance; and the delivery of an  online engagement platform. It also aims  to identify and support the implementation  of an ongoing plan for sustainable urban  service investments in cities.  The Financing Sustainable Cities Initiative  promotes the financing of sustainable urban  development and contributes to a number  of targets within SDG 11, improving the  quality of life for citizens, delivering positive  environmental impacts and contributing to  local economic growth. SUPPORTING MUNICIPAL AND  COMMUNITY INNOVATION Local governments often face some of  the most complex urban issues: lack  of affordable housing, unemployment,  degraded infrastructure and strained  healthcare systems. But as budgets  tighten, municipal leaders and  community organizations are under  immense pressure to do more with less.  In order to meet the changing needs  of residents, particularly in lower- income communities, local governments  and community organizations  need to increase collaboration and  invest in new, efficient solutions. City Accelerator, an initiative of the  Citi Foundation and Living Cities, has  brought together municipal leaders from  12 U.S. cities to test new ways to drive  sustainable growth while increasing  economic opportunity for lower-income  residents since 2014. For example,  the city of Philadelphia — one of three  cities to finish the program in 2016 —  used the City Accelerator program to  explore new ways to increase citizen  participation in obtaining subsidies.  City officials tested the use of text  messages and innovative marketing  tactics to ensure low-income seniors  were signing up for subsidies offering a  25 percent reduction in their water bills.  As a result, participation in the program  doubled, and hundreds of Philadelphias  most vulnerable seniors are now  receiving a discount that will make  managing their household bills easier.  Community organizations also play a  critical role in making communities more  resilient. In 2016, the Citi Foundation  launched the Community Progress Makers  Fund — a two-year, $20 million initiative to  help these organizations scale, innovate  and impact more people. The inaugural  group of 40 grantees is working on a range  of issues, from economic development  and affordable housing to environmental  sustainability and financial inclusion, in  six major cities across the U.S. Grantees  receive general operating support grants  of $500,000 over two years, in addition  to access to skills-based, pro-bono Citi  volunteer teams and technical assistance  from a network of national experts.      SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    75 AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND   HOMEOWNERSHIP   Safe and affordable housing is a critical  need in communities, but demand  often exceeds existing supply as cities  experience rapid expansion in many  parts of the world. In the U.S., the  homeownership rate has fallen to the  lowest level in half a century8 and,  over the past five years, the median  new home price has increased by 35  percent,9 while wages have remained  nearly flat. With more and more  Americans renting rather than buying  homes, rental prices have gone up.  In 2016, the number of households  severely burdened by rental costs  (paying 50 percent or more of income)  hit an all-time high at 11.4 million.10  In many cities, these price rises have  disproportionately affected low-income  families and communities of color. Citi  works to finance the construction and  preservation of affordable rental housing  and community projects across the  U.S. while also working on development  models to build stronger affordable  housing markets from the ground up.  Financing Affordable Housing   Through Citi Community Capital (CCC),  we provide financing — including  municipal bonds, tax credits and  subsidies — for a range of affordable  rental housing projects. We focus on  developments that serve low-income  and special needs populations, including  seniors, those with disabilities and the  homeless. We also finance community  revitalization projects such as schools  and healthcare facilities, as well as  job-creating businesses to develop  services and resources most needed in  the community. In 2016, the CCC provided  over $5.75 billion in loans for affordable  rental projects, for nearly 50,000 units  in 204 cities. For the seventh consecutive  year, we were the leading financer  of affordable housing in the U.S.  8 Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies, The State of the Nation's Housing 2016.  9 Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Median Sales Price for New Houses Sold in the United States (Oct. 11-Oct 16) 10 Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies, The State of the Nations Housing 2016.  11 RealtyTrac, Midyear 2016 U.S. Foreclosure Market Report We also partner with and support other  organizations to create affordable  housing through Citi Community  Development. One population  disproportionately impacted by lack   of access to affordable housing is  veterans. Each year, an estimated  250,000 servicemen and women  transition out of the military to  embark on new chapters, careers and  opportunities. While the rate of veteran  homelessness has declined over the  past several years, estimates suggest  that as many as 100,000 vets in the  U.S. are homeless at some point during  a 12-month period. Bring them HOMES,  a partnership with the Local Initiative  Support Corporation and the National  Equity Fund, its investment affiliate,  is an initiative to build affordable  permanent, temporary and transitional  housing with supportive services for  Americas veterans. Even for those not  facing such dire circumstances, the  men and women of the military and  their families face many financial and  logistical challenges, especially during  the transition out of active duty. Over  the past four years, Citis funding has  helped bring to fruition nearly 2,000 units  of housing for homeless, at-risk and  low-income veterans and their families. Homeownership Preservation The Citi Office of Homeownership  Preservation works to prevent  foreclosures and promote affordable  and inclusive housing options for  Citi clients and the communities that  we serve. While foreclosure rates in  the U.S. have improved significantly  compared to the years immediately after  the recession, the rate of completed  foreclosures in the first half of 2016  was still above pre-recession levels.  Our efforts to address this challenge  include restructuring loans, training  housing counselors, scaling technological  efficiencies to coordinate loan servicing,  and investing in shared equity models.  New Financing Approaches Homeownership is increasingly out  of reach in communities across the  country as the cost of real estate  continues to rise while incomes are  stagnant. For example, the NYU Furman  Center/Citi Report on Homeownership  and Opportunity in New York City  found that more than half of New York  City homes are unaffordable to the  majority of households. New financing  approaches are required to create  affordable housing that is safe, well- maintained and financially viable over  the long term, moving homeownership  into reach for more people.  To address this, Citi is supporting the  launch of Community Land Trusts (CLTs)  in several cities across the country.  A CLT is a nonprofit corporation that  maintains ownership of a parcel of land,  but sells properties on that land at an  affordable rate. The arrangement allows  low- and moderate-income residents  to build equity and accrue the benefits  of homeownership, while saving on  property taxes and housing costs.   To ensure long-term affordability in the  community, CLTs typically cap property  resale prices. Projects are currently  underway in New York and Washington,  D.C., to develop CLTs that preserve  long-term affordability for local residents  and enable them to build their assets.   SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    76 Through innovative financing  and strategic partnerships, we  help create thousands of units  of affordable housing for New  Yorkers. We also partner with  nonprofit organizations to enable  financial stability among low- to  medium-income homeowners.  --  Over the past five years, Citi  has provided $5.2 billion in  financing for housing for low- to  medium-income New Yorkers. --  In 2016, the city of New York,  Citi and other contributing  partners launched a   $140 million extension of the  Community Preservation  Corporation (CPC) fund for   affordable housing. We worked   with the city and the CPC to  structure and arrange the initial  $350 million fund in 2014.  --  Citi also supports U.S.  Department of Housing  and Urban Development- approved housing counseling  organizations — including  NeighborWorks America, the  National Council of La Raza  and the National Community  Reinvestment Coalition —  to train counselors who  can provide education and  one-on-one counseling in  New York City communities  on financial capability,  property maintenance and  foreclosure prevention. PROVIDING AFFORDABLE  HOMES IN OUR HOME CITY   76  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    77 There  are  approximately   2.7 million grandparents in the U.S.  who are responsible for raising  their grandchildren. This family  structure, called a grandfamily, is  represented in all income levels,  but 21 percent of grandparents who  head these households live below  the federal poverty line. A Citi- sponsored report, The Resounding  Resiliency of Grandfamilies, aims  to develop a richer understanding  of these grandfamilies and  provide recommendations for  strengthening their financial lives.  In line with this report, ensuring  access to affordable housing for  grandfamilies is critical to their  long-term financial stability. In  2016, Citi closed an innovative  transaction in Washington, D.C.,  called Plaza West, which reserves  almost a quarter of available  units for, but not restricted to,  grandfamilies. This research and  innovative housing model, a first- of-its-kind concept in the D.C.  market, serves to shine a light  on the needs of households that  often provide alternatives to foster  care by providing stability and  community to youth. SUPPORTING THE FINANCIAL  STABILITY OF GRANDFAMILIES Increasing population pressure  will continue to present major  infrastructural  and  social  challenges for cities around  the world. Local budgets face  increasing stress, and municipal  leaders are hard-pressed to find the  financing and resources required  to meet local needs. Housing  affordability in cities is likely to  remain a significant challenge  for years to come, as population  growth and economic opportunity  become more concentrated in  urban centers. At the same time,  there is a clear need for sustained  support for small businesses to aid  in the resiliency of local economies.  Rightfully so, there is significant  attention on what can happen  at a community level to support  economic progress for all citizens.  The private sector can play an  important role in backing innovation  and new ways of working, while  also helping to appropriately scale  approaches that work. That is the  role we embrace in the communities  where we live and work, and we will  continue to use our core banking  skills and resources to enable  growth and progress. WHATS AHEAD  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    78 Citi protects peoples savings and helps them make purchases  — from everyday transactions to buying a home. Through our  products and services, we advise people on how to invest for  future needs and plan for upcoming life events. We also use  our capabilities and our scale to support people in building  their financial capability and resilience. This type of economic  empowerment is the backbone of a thriving economy.  FINANCIAL   RESILIENCE To do this, we need to help create  opportunities for individuals to earn  an income and access high-quality,  affordable financial products and  services to protect and grow their  wealth. The need to get this right  is particularly pressing for todays  youth, who face many obstacles to  employment and financial stability.  Through innovation, partnerships   and leveraging the time and expertise  of our employees — who volunteer in  the communities in which they live  and work — we're helping to foster  economic resiliency and strength  in communities around the world.  REACHING UNBANKED AND   UNDERBANKED COMMUNITIES Globally, some 2 billion adults,  largely in developing regions, remain  outside the formal banking sector,  affecting the resiliency of individuals  and communities. The issue extends  to developed countries as well.  In the U.S., around 7 percent of the  population does not have a bank  account and an additional 20 percent  are underbanked, according to the  FDIC, while half of all U.S. households  lack sufficient savings to sustain  three months without falling below  the poverty level in the event of  a sudden drop in their income. As  a result, during times of financial  distress many are pushed toward  options outside the traditional banking  sector, such as payday loans or other  predatory lenders, and wind up paying  more for less while not building their  credit history. This is coupled with a  historic mistrust of large institutions  and a lack of convenient geographic  access to bank branches and ATMs  among some populations. Citi pursues  solutions and partnerships to improve  access to banking services and  provide practical financial education  resources for low-income consumers.     78 2016 HIGHLIGHTS Launched  CITIBANAMEX FINANCIAL INCLUSION, a unit dedicated to broadening access to affordable and  appropriate financial products  in Mexico, as part of our new  $1 B investment in Citibanamex Piloted the Citi ATM Community  Network, providing FREE USE OF CITIS ATM NETWORK to over  300,000 CLIENTS  of participating minority-owned  banks and credit unions in the U.S. Met our Citi Foundation Pathways  to Progress goal to invest $50 M  AND REACH 100,000 YOUTH   with training, leadership and  entrepreneurship opportunities  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    79 Citi Salutes is our firmwide   initiative to meet the unique needs   of service members, veterans  and their families in the areas of  employment, financial capability  and housing. One initiative through   Citi Salutes in 2016 was in  partnership with Military.com —  the leading online platform for  service members and veterans —  to launch Transition, a free app  that assists military families with  the transition to civilian life. The  app offers hundreds of veteran- specific resources on issues such  as finance management, relocation  and employment. The app has been  downloaded more than 6,000 times  since its launch. SUPPORTING U.S. VETERANS STRENGTHEN THE MEANS OF  IMPLEMENTATION AND REVITALIZE  THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Global  partnerships  across  sectors, the focus of SDG 17, are  required to meet the scope, scale  and ambition of the sustainable  development goals. Our business is  about partnering — with our clients  and stakeholders — to provide  the financing solutions that meet  the needs of our clients and help  address global challenges. We  also participate in public-private  partnerships with organizations  such as the Overseas Private  Investment Corporation and the  World Bank to share risk, ideas and  best practices and to co-finance  or co-invest in projects that  promote environmental, social and  economic progress that none of us  can accomplish alone. Access to Financial  Products and Services Access to simple and affordable banking  products can improve peoples lives.   The Access Account, one of Citis   fastest-growing products within the  Global Consumer Bank in 2016, is one  example of how we are building viable  solutions for often-overlooked portions  of the U.S. market, including low-income  individuals, senior citizens and recent  immigrants. Introduced in 2014, the  Access Account is a checkless bank  account with no or low monthly fees,  no overdraft fees, the ability to link to  a savings account and access to Citis  digital banking network, retail and  ATM locations. Over 223,000 Access  Accounts have been opened since 2014. Financial inclusion also requires  an understanding of the needs of  a wide range of communities. For  example, studies show that low-income  communities of color still predominantly  use cash for transactions, making ATM  access and fees especially important.  This offered Citi, with our large ATM  network, an opportunity to leverage  our resources to improve banking  accessibility for all. In 2016, we  introduced the Citi ATM Community  Network pilot program, which gave  clients of minority-owned banks and  credit unions access to our national  network of ATMs. The program enables   more than 300,000 clients of participating  institutions to withdraw cash without  surcharge fees at 2,400 Citibank branch   ATMs in the U.S. By removing surcharge  fees and expanding the reach of local   institutions, we have reduced transaction  costs, expanded ATM access and improved   convenience for clients. When global and  local financial institutions collaborate  in this way, we can build a more  inclusive financial services industry  that expands access to unbanked  and underbanked populations. BUILDING ACCESS   ACROSS LATIN AMERICA  Transfer, a joint venture between  Citi and America Movil, the  largest telecommunications  company in Latin America, aims  to use mobile banking to expand  access to financial products to  all segments of the population  in Latin American countries,  particularly among low-income  communities. To date, Transfer   has more than 5 million active   accounts, 80 percent of  which belong to previously  unbanked customers.  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    80 Earned Income Tax Credit  Access and Awareness For many low-income households, tax  refunds such as the Earned Income Tax  Credit (EITC) are the largest lump-sum  payment they receive all year, making  tax season a key opportunity to pay  down debt, save money and start to  build assets for a secure financial future.  But far too many people are not aware  that this program exists, or are paying  to file instead of taking advantage of  free tax preparation services. For the  past three years, Citi has supported  New York Citys marketing campaign to  expand access to free tax preparation  services and the EITC, returning close  to $500 million in fee savings and  tax credits to 310,000 households.  Financial Capability Financial inclusion is not just about  access to affordable products and  services; it is also about having the  knowledge to use the products and  services in a safe and responsible way.  We are committed to ensuring that   our clients, as well as the extended  network of individuals and families   we work with, have the knowledge,   tools and resources needed to manage  their financial well-being. Citi offers a  number of free public online resources  that provide financial education. In   addition, we support numerous financial   capability programs around the world.  For example, Citi and the Citi Foundation  have contributed $1.6 million in funding  since 2008 to support the New York  City Office of Financial Empowerment  (OFE), to scale efforts to provide  knowledge and resources for low-income  households to overcome their financial  challenges and build a more resilient  financial future by saving money,  building credit and paying down debt.  The OFE has provided free financial  education, coaching and counseling to  more than 35,000 New Yorkers, and  Boston, Chicago, San Francisco and Los  Angeles County have since launched  Offices of Financial Empowerment.    U.S. FINANCIAL INCLUSION RESEARCH The Citi Foundation supports research efforts aimed at  helping financial education practitioners evolve their  interventions to maximize impact. The U.S. Financial Diaries  research uncovered new insights on how American families  make ends meet and how financial services and public  policy sometimes help and sometimes hinder their progress.  Another project, What Its Worth, is a collection of viewpoints  from 40 of the nations leading practitioners, policymakers,  legislators, researchers and business executives, including  Citi Foundation President Brandee McHale, on how to  improve the financial well-being of American families. Microfinance can be a valuable  tool in creating income-generating  opportunities that support the   livelihoods  of  low-income   individuals and their families.  Through a range of programs  and partnerships, Citi invests  in microfinance initiatives that  promote financial inclusion and  enable economic growth for  underserved market segments.  For example, Citi has maintained  a partnership with the U.S.  governments Overseas Private  Investment Corporation (OPIC)  that has enabled us to provide  funding to many micro and small  entrepreneurs in developing  markets around the world. By  risk-sharing and other guarantee  mechanisms, together with OPIC  we have provided more than  $417.4 million in financing to 46  microfinance institutions in 24  countries, reaching over 1.2 million  entrepreneurs, 92 percent of which  are women.  In addition, in October, Citi signed   an agreement with the Philippines-  based  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB) to facilitate up to   $100 million of local currency  loans to microfinance institutions   in the Asia Pacific region.  The agreement expands the   existing reach of ADBs Microfinance   Program, which has supported   more than 2 million borrowers,  mainly in India, Bangladesh   and Indonesia. ENABLING FINANCIAL INCLUSION  THROUGH MICRO-BUSINESSES  SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    81 Reaffirming Our Commitment  to Mexico Mexico is one of Citis largest markets  outside of the U.S. and also has a  notably high rate of unbanked citizens,  at close to 50 percent. In 2016, Citi  made a commitment to invest $1 billion  in Citibanamex, our Mexican subsidiary  and Mexicos second-largest retail bank.  This commitment aims to deliver a richer,  smarter, more intuitive experience to  everyone who does business with us.  A key part of the investment is the  creation of a Financial Inclusion   business unit at Citibanamex, dedicated  to expanding access to safe and  affordable financial services for the   38 million adults who remain outside the  mainstream banking system in Mexico.  These efforts build upon Citibanamexs  decades of experience supporting  microentrepreneurs, expanding mobile  banking tools and providing financial  education. Citibanamex Financial  Inclusion will also provide private-sector  expertise and resources to support the  Mexican governments newly announced  National Financial Inclusion Strategy.     CITI MICROENTREPRENEURSHIP AWARDS For more than a decade, the Citi Microentrepreneurship Awards  program has been a signature financial inclusion initiative of the  Citi Foundation focused on generating economic opportunities  for low-income entrepreneurs in approximately 30 countries. To date, more than 6,000 microentrepreneurs have received   more than $9 million in prizes.  One example is Vietnams 2016 Microentrepreneur of the Year,  Phung Thi Thuy, who used a $136 microfinance loan to lift her  family out of poverty in one of the poorest provinces in Vietnam.  Mrs. Thuys business now earns about $11,300 per year and  has created five new jobs. She is using her prize to expand her  business further and create even more jobs in her community.  My personal finances have changed  a lot. I did not know how to save —  whenever I had money in my pocket  I spent it right away.

SOLUTIONS FOR IMPACT    82 JOBS AND THE NEXT GENERATION The surest path to financial stability is  a steady, well-paying job, but that is out  of reach for many. Youth in particular  are experiencing high joblessness rates.  According to the U.S. Department of  Labor, the unemployment rate for young  people aged 16–24 is 10.8 percent,  with more than 6 million young people  disconnected from school and work.  Globally, the youth unemployment rate  remains stubbornly high at more than   13 percent,14 and in developing countries,  70 percent of youth live in extreme  poverty despite being employed. Todays  young people need an agile and versatile  skill set to compete for opportunities  that boost their individual well-being  and the overall stability and success  of communities and economies more  broadly. This younger demographic,  especially low-income minority youth,  faces significant hurdles to accessing  education and jobs. The Citi Foundation  focuses on expanding early exposure to  career-readiness programs to help ensure  that the next generation is prepared to  take advantage of future opportunities. Pathways to Progress  Competing in the 21st century job market  requires new thinking around job training  and career readiness. Through Pathways  to Progress, Citi and the Citi Foundation  are supporting the career readiness of  young people by equipping urban youth  from low-income backgrounds with the  skills and opportunities needed to build  a resilient financial future. The program  launched in 2014 with a three-year,   $50 million commitment to provide  summer employment, entrepreneurship  and leadership opportunities to 100,000  young people between the ages of 16 and  24 in 10 major U.S. cities. Citi volunteers  played an integral role in the program,  acting as mentors and coaches.  In 2016, we met our U.S. goal to  invest at least $50 million in training,  entrepreneurship and leadership  opportunities for 100,000 young people.  Based on this progress, in February 2017,  Citi and the Citi Foundation announced a  new global commitment under Pathways  to Progress. The Citi Foundation will  invest an additional $100 million to reach  500,000 youth by 2020, renewing our  investment in the U.S. and reinforcing  our commitment to promoting  opportunities for young people around  the world. In addition, we will leverage  the time and talent of 10,000 Citi  employee volunteers in projects that help  young people build their employability  skills and professional networks and  expand internships and other on-site  learning opportunities for youth at Citi. A first job is important to a young  persons future, but understanding  what to do with a paycheck and how to  use money responsibly is also critical  to their long-term economic prospects.  The Citi Foundation partnered with the  Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund  to create Summer Jobs Connect (SJC), a  program that offers youth paid summer  jobs, financial education and tools, as  well as access to safe and affordable  bank or credit union accounts to directly  deposit their paychecks and manage  their finances. This partnership is  helping set over 8,500 young people on  the path to economic success. As part  of their experience, participants receive  financial education and access to safe  and affordable banking products to help  create a relationship with mainstream  financial institutions as a foundation  for their financial future. SJC has  been held up as a model financial  inclusion effort and endorsed by  regulators and policymakers, including  the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau, the U.S. Presidents Advisory  Council on Financial Capability, the U.S.  Department of the Treasury and the  U.S. Department of Labor.

The prolonged economic  slowdown and foundational shifts  in the labor market are putting  new pressures on many families  to simply hold their place on the  economic ladder, rather than  striving to move upwards. Banks are  in a position to build better financial  tools for the financially insecure and  to work with a range of stakeholders  to develop professional training  and education programs that  prepare the next generation for a  rapidly shifting job market. Citi will  continue to focus on meeting people  where they are in regard to their  finances, to create the tools and  opportunities necessary to build  the financial resiliency of families  in a changing world.    WHATS AHEAD PROMOTE SUSTAINED,  INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE  ECONOMIC GROWTH, FULL AND  PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT  AND DECENT WORK FOR ALL A core focus of SDG 8 is decent  work and full employment for  youth, addressing the significant  barriers to job opportunities  that result in especially high  youth  unemployment  rates  around the world. The work of  the Citi Foundations Pathways  to Progress initiative to advance  economic opportunities for youth  directly contributes to SDG 8, in  particular target 8.6 which aims to  substantially reduce the proportion  of youth not in employment,  education or training by 2020. By  the end of 2016, we had supported  the career readiness of over  100,000 youth in the U.S. Over the  next three years, as part of our new  Pathways to Progress commitment,  we will connect another 500,000  youth around the world to training  and jobs.
