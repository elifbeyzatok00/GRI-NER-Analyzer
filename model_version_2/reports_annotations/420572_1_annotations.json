These investments are   just some of the ways we seek to  deliver on our promise — and create  the conditions for people to thrive. Here are a few of the highlights of  some of this year's efforts:   Launched new products and  materials designed for circularity  such as Steelcase Series 1, New  Black and Planked Veneer.   Invested in our communities   with over 46,000 employee  volunteer hours and $4 million in  donations, including $470,000 in  matching gifts.   Employee inclusion groups grew   to over 20 diverse networks of  people and topics including   multi-cultural, veterans, wellbeing,   young professionals, women, pride,   social responsibility committees  and more.   Expanded our end-of-use services  to help customers with their own  sustainability goals and divert  millions of furniture items from   the landfill. As we focus on growth, we continue  to identify new opportunities to help  organizations better manage their  space and resources. Commercial  buildings consume a tremendous  amount of energy, yet they're  often only 50-60% utilized. Our  developments in software and data  can help organizations create harder- working spaces – by optimizing their  real estate and energy footprint,  delivering value to employees,  customers and shareholders. Helping organizations use space  more effectively enhances the worker  experience and boosts engagement.  By creating spaces that allow  people to be productive and enjoy  their workday, they return home as  better partners, parents, friends and  community members. Some may think of Steelcase as a  furniture company, but we're really  in the people business. Our mission  is to unlock human promise. Were  pursuing this mission creatively,  passionately — and sustainably. Thanks for reading this year's report. James P. Keane  President and CEO Steelcase has been in   business for over a hundred  years. We know staying in  business for another hundred  will depend on our ability  to remain agile and grow  sustainably. Sustainable  growth initiatives protect our  people and our planet, and   I'm delighted they're integral   to our business strategy.  We live in a fast-paced  world with trends that move  quickly, blur lines and disrupt  ecosystems. People are drawn  to what's new, bigger, better,  brighter. This is certainly true   in our industry. Product quality  and life cycle performance can  often be sacrificed in the name  of a quick fix or a new trend.   But we don't think customers  should have to make those  tradeoffs. We're working  hard to build literacy around  these issues, and to play a  role in bringing sustainability  to everything people need in  today's workplace.  4 Promise + Progress Steelcase Our Vision 4 Promise + Progress Steelcase Our   Vision People are at the heart  of everything we do and  everything we create.  Recognizing and celebrating  this truth drives our approach   to sustainability.  With people at the center, we  can deliver meaningful, lasting   economic, environmental,   and social change through   the choices we make and   the behaviors and actions   we demonstrate.  5 Promise + Progress Steelcase 5 Promise + Progress Steelcase Our Vision Holding Ourselves   Accountable Sustainable business and   circular economy is core to  our strategy. There are three  important groups governing  our activities:   Our Board of Directors, a  hardworking combination  of proven business leaders  including third- and fourth- generation founding family  members, set the tone for   our companys future.    Our Executive Leadership team  is committed to our mission  to unlock human promise by  transforming work, worker and  workplace, deliver long-term  shareholder value and drive  sustainable business fitness.    Our Global Sustainability  Steering Committee is  responsible for building  a culture of sustainable  innovation, and developing  communication and processes  to advance our value  proposition, brand reputation  and business performance. The  Committee is charged with: -  Driving explicit connections   between sustainability,   corporate resilience and growth -  Sponsoring key initiatives   to design our companys   roadmap forward -  Fueling deeper engagement  across multiple levels and   disciplines within the organization. Sustainability In Action   Strengthening sustainable   development in our global   operations and those of  our supplier partners,  including a focus on  environmental and human  health, social responsibility  and economic prosperity.   Working to ensure our  operations protect the  environment and health of   employees, neighbors and  customers through actions   that conserve resources,  reduce waste and promote  closed loop business systems.   Investing in education to  increase stakeholder and  employee engagement.   Engaging with suppliers,  dealers, customers,  researchers and environmental  agencies to share and  distribute best practices  and discover new ideas. The formal governance  structure is important  to drive accountability.  However, each and every  Steelcase employee   is responsible for the   integration of social   and environmental  sustainability in his or  her particular role. No  matter their title or  responsibilities — they are  empowered to innovate  and drive sustainable  change, expected to be  responsible stewards and  contribute to the overall  safety and wellbeing  of fellow workers,  their communities and  the natural world.  Our Promise 6 Promise + Progress Steelcase Our   Sustainability   Promise Sustainability Beliefs   Businesses, communities and  people are inextricably linked  and more powerful when they  act with a shared purpose.   When you tell the truth,  you become part of the  solution. We work hard to be  transparent and authentic with  others and with ourselves.   Sustainability is a lens for  innovation and growth,  contributing to the  overall financial wellbeing  of our company.   There is no greater design  challenge than building a more  sustainable, circular economy.  It demands systems-level   design thinking in all aspects   of our business.  We have an opportunity  to use our assets and  influence to create  significant, positive  change in the world.   By fully leveraging our  assets to this end, we  will become an even  stronger partner and  an increasingly better- performing company. People are at the center   of sustainability; we begin   and end our product,  application and service   efforts with a commitment  to human-centered  design and sustainability. We unlock human promise   by transforming work, worker  and workplace. Delivering   on this purpose takes  continuous and coordinated  efforts. We believe our actions  can help create the social,   environmental and economic  conditions that allow  people and communities  to thrive. Were putting  those beliefs into action. Our Corporate Values Every day — from Michigan to Malaysia,  Dongguan to Cluj, Munich to Pune —   our values frame our beliefs and inform   our actions:  Act with integrity  Tell the truth  Keep commitments   Treat people with dignity   and respect  Promote positive relationships  Protect the environment  Excel.  7 Promise + Progress Steelcase Key Actions   Identified sustainability aspects  material to our business to  help us advance our social and  environmental performance to  align with the expectations of  our many stakeholders,   shareholders and partners.   Conducted a circular   economy-readiness   assessment to understand  current state, and developed  an eight-year roadmap  to drive towards a more  sustainable, circular economy.   Surveyed our customers and  studied their inquiries to   understand their corporate  sustainability priorities  relating to our business.   Partnered with leading   organizations to understand  and explore emerging issues  and opportunities  — as broad  as circular economy and as  critical as advanced materials.   Empowered employees  through education and   partnerships to understand  their role in advancing the  mission and goals of our  company — as well as those   of our partners, customers   and communities. Engaging With   Stakeholders Steelcase works diligently  to understand the potential  of sustainability through the  eyes of our stakeholders,  now and in the future.  8 Promise + Progress Steelcase Our Year   in Focus  9 Promise + Progress Steelcase Our sustainability aspirations  are ambitious, especially as we  work to drive value in a more  circular economy. Everyone  must be actively engaged in  strengthening our performance  and reaching our goals. This year, Steelcase celebrates  how innovation drives growth  for our people, our customers,  our communities and our  organization.

In our new Learning and Innovation Center  (LINC) in Munich, Germany, grassroots,  employee-driven committees for sports and  wellbeing, corporate social responsibility   and employee experience bring people  together around common interests and   help bridge gaps across cultures, languages  and backgrounds. These employee groups  are particularly important because only   half of our Munich-based employees are   German, with team members representing   25 nationalities.  At the company level, programs are available  to help connect employees to the Munich  community, to emerging ideas and to each  other. These include options like Live at  the LINC, where employees can hear from  speakers on an array of topics, and Language  Breakfasts, where employees can practice  their German or English in a relaxed setting.  Additionally, sports and outdoor activities  (including community soccer matches, skiing,  running groups, swimming and on-site yoga  classes) give all LINC employees a chance  to get involved and share their hobbies and  knowledge with co-workers. With so much diversity, LINC Munich is  strengthening the Steelcase community in  Europe — and around the world.

Promise + Progress 15 Steelcase Customers EcoServices is Steelcases asset recapture  and redeployment service in the Europe,  Middle East and Africa regions. In 2016,  we began a partnership with the real  estate division of Socit Gnrale  Group in France to help the organization  manage their furniture assets. In one year,  weve collaboratively managed a total of  six projects. Thanks to this trustworthy  relationship and efficient operations, over  1,800 workstations from Socit Gnrales  facilities have been reused and recycled.     The Steelcase and Socit Gnrale teams  continue to work together. This partnership  is one of many examples of EcoServices  helping customers to manage assets and  extending the useful life of products.

In 2016, we continued our  commitment to investing in  clean energy technologies by  announcing a twelve year virtual  power purchase agreement  (VPPA) for 25 megawatts of wind  power from Southern Company  subsidiary Southern Powers  Grant Plains Wind Facility   in Oklahoma.  The Grant Plains Wind Facility  officially began production in  December 2016.  Our Year in Focus 18 Promise + Progress Steelcase Boyce Middle School:  New Active Learning  Classroom Advances  STEAM Education   19 Promise + Progress Steelcase Customers Steelcase Education has a passion for  understanding how learning takes place, and  how smarter, active learning spaces can help  improve student engagement and success. Boyce Middle School near Pittsburgh,   Pennsylvania was a recipient of a Steelcase  Education Active Learning Center grant.  Boyce used grant funds to incorporate   mobile, adaptable furniture and space   design to propel their STEAM Design  program and increased students learning  opportunities in the core STEAM disciplines:  science, technology, engineering, arts   and math. The STEAM design classroom gives kids   the freedom that we cant quite give them   in a traditional classroom, said Matt   Henderson, STEAM Design Instructor,   Boyce Middle School. With the versatility  of the furniture, I can quickly move things  around to set up for various activities. Plus,  multiple outlets allow components to be  plugged in anywhere throughout the room  which helps our robotics and computer   science run smoothly.  20 Promise + Progress Steelcase In our manufacturing operations,  even scraps are valuable.  A unique collaboration with  suppliers helped one of our  manufacturing facilities find a  way to recover leftover material.  The fabric was transformed  into an elegant, durable and  sustainable fabric called   New Black. The New Black collection gives  life to previously used materials,  and works toward designing  textile waste out of the system.  To create New Black, we devised  a method that uses scrap panel  fabric from our Athens, Alabama  panel manufacturing facility.  This fabric is melted down and  mixed with PET from recycled  bottles to create yarn, which  is then dyed black and woven  into the New Black textiles.  The 100% recycled material is  available in five patterns which  bring a warm, comfortable,  human feeling — and thoughtful,  sustainable design — to the  workplace. Its just another   way closed-loop thinking   drives innovation and   sustainable solutions.  The industry recognized New  Black with an innovation award  at NeoCon 2016. New   Black: Scrap Fabric   Weaves   Award-winning   Textiles Our Year in Focus  21 Promise + Progress Steelcase Our Year in Focus Steelcase Series  1 The Steelcase Series 1 chair  demonstrates how thinking  backwards can lead to  innovation breakthroughs.  Instead of starting with a design  concept — and then discovering  later in the process it couldnt  meet the performance and value  goals — the Series 1 team tried  a different approach, convening  engineering, materials, marketing  and global supply chain experts  at the forefront of the project.  Working collaboratively, they  rapidly brainstormed ideas and  concepts for how a chair could  be created to meet demanding  criteria for quality, ergonomic  comfort, aesthetics, price  accessibility and sustainability.   In the process, they proved   that what are often considered  design constraints are really  untapped opportunities for  creative discovery.  Drawing on our deep expertise  in circular product design,  sustainability was intentionally  designed into the Series 1 chair:    Eliminating glue — making  refurbishing and recycling easier  Undergoing a life cycle assessment    Targeting five product   certifications globally  Up to 95% recyclable  Up to 23% recycled content.  Our Year in Focus 22 Promise + Progress Steelcase Girls Leading  our World Cluj, Romania  23 Promise + Progress Steelcase In July 2016, 25 teenage girls  and 10 Steelcase facilitators  from Cluj, Romania participated  in Camp GLOW (Girls Leading  Our World). A global gender  empowerment initiative  founded in 1995 by the Peace  Corps, GLOW aims to build  self-confidence, help girls  develop communication and  teamwork skills and create  an understanding of how to  lead positive change in their  communities and the world.  The same model was applied to  an all-boys camp, Camp BRO  (Boys Reaching Out) in 2015.  This years Camp GLOW in Cluj  included a working session  where both camps sent a video  to each other, so they could learn  from one another.  Our Year in Focus Alexandra Moldovan, the  Steelcase leader who headed the  camp this year, had previously  experienced GLOW as a teenage  camper and a counselor.   Sharing my experience and  knowledge to help these   motivated and determined young  girls become the positive change  they want to see in the world  was an experience of a lifetime.  Steelcase plans to continue  supporting youth leadership  development through the Cluj  GLOW camp and facilitated a  BRO camp during the summer  of 2017.  Steelcase works with  GLOW to help girls build  confidence and learn  how to lead change.   24 Promise + Progress Steelcase 24 Promise + Progress Steelcase Our Promises +  Progress  25 Promise + Progress Steelcase 25 Promise + Progress Steelcase Every day around the world,   we work to bring lasting   value to our customers,  employees, shareholders,  partners, communities and  the environment.

PROGRESS Continued leadership in  designing products for   a circular economy —  through materials   innovation, life cycle   performance and proof  of performance through  third-party certifications. For over 105 years, we have  been turning insights into  innovations that unlock the  promise of people at work.  We use three strategic lenses  when we design products:  we carefully select materials,  optimize lifecycle performance,  and enable life extension and  end-of-use strategies. We pair  sustainable products with an  ecosystem of spaces designed  to adapt and evolve over time,  optimizing real estate while  fostering higher levels of  employee engagement. Understanding Our Materials Steelcase takes a comprehensive  approach to understanding what  goes into our products. As a leader  in our industry, weve assessed over  1,800 materials in our portfolio and  are actively working with our supply  chain to phase out materials of  concern, even developing suitable  alternatives where they may not  yet exist. We continuously promote  better chemical standards through  public policy advocacy and research  partnerships with leading universities  and institutions.  Life Cycle Performance Using closed-loop thinking and  Life Cycle Assessments (LCA), we  use metric-based insights to drive  innovation opportunities and deliver  value at every step of the product  lifecycle — from product design and  manufacture to delivery, use and  end-of-use options. We conduct  research and uncover insights along  the way, sharing our findings with  partners, industry groups and   leading organizations to maximize  shared successes.  Closing the Loop Steelcase products reconfigure to  work in new ways as a customers  needs change. Many disassemble  with ease to replace worn parts.

PROGRESS Expanded existing  offerings and piloted  new services to support  ever-changing space  needs and pave   a path towards   a more sustainable,   circular economy. At Steelcase, were imagining  a more holistic approach  to workplace flexibility: an  ecosystem of spaces and  services designed to support an  organizations changing needs.  This circular mindset decouples  economic growth from resource  consumption. It goes beyond   diverting furniture from  landfills to presenting new,  innovative uses for hundreds of  thousands of products through  resale, redistribution, repair,  refurbishment, remanufacture  and material recovery. Were exploring ways to leverage  technology and emerging   purchasing models to help   customers quickly adapt their   spaces to constantly changing   business needs. Finding New Beginnings  at End-of-use Each year, over 8.5 million tons   of office furniture find their way   into landfills across the globe,  permanently removing useful  materials from the value stream.   Our goal is to intercept used furniture  assets, working collaboratively with  organizations and dealers to redirect  assets toward productive uses and  closed-loop systems.  Asset Recapture +   Redeployment Through our recapture and  redeployment programs,  EcoServices in France, Belgium,  Switzerland and Luxembourg, and  Phase 2 in North America, Steelcase  helps customers assess furniture  inventory and create optimized  redeployment plans. These programs  employ an extensive network of  partners to help with redeployment,  refurbishment, resale and donations  or transport to licensed recycling  facilities for material recovery. ReMarket In North America, the ReMarket  program redeploys customers  leased assets through our dealer  network, cleaning and repairing  gently-used furniture. This offering  makes high-quality furniture available  to a broader set of markets and  customers at affordable prices.    31 Promise + Progress Steelcase Customers Circular Services 5,320  WORKSTATIONS  SINCE 2016 55,000+   SINCE 2008 Last year, EcoServices  redeployed more than  5,000 workstations.

Through   a single point of accountability,   we apply our experience and  processes in furniture and asset  management to maximize real estate  utilization. This includes strategic  approaches to furniture acquisition,  moves and maintenance and  decommissioning solutions. This  partnership guarantees customers   a measurable and consistently high  level of service and accountability.  Alternatives to Ownership For over 20 years, Steelcase has  offered financing programs with   options to own or return assets.  These alternative-to-ownership  options help organizations conserve  capital, preserve borrowing power,  manage balance sheet and offer  flexibility to change. As we explore new and better   ways to serve organizations   through product-service systems,   we are testing and piloting new  business models including  subscription-like offerings and   pay-for-experience models. Event Experiences Today, organizations and meeting  planners are required to deliver  high-impact experiences. In the  development of events, the spatial  experience is key. Steelcase event  experiences helps transform event  spaces through experience design  and premium quality furniture to  create powerful, purposeful events.  This circular-economy inspired  business model is in its third year of  operation and continues to grow. Managing Assets  at Every Step of the  Customer Lifecycle EcoServices has a long-standing  partnership with the French Ministry  of Ecology, and continued their  work with them in 2016.

Dealers can access the  knowledge and expertise of dealers  across the globe through electronic  platforms, communities of practice  and peer-to-peer workshops. Dealer Diversity We continue our drive for diversity  within our dealerships by providing  programs for talent management  and leadership in the U.S. and  Canada. Steelcase assists  dealers with securing minority  council certifications, facilitating  strategic alliances with minority- and non-minority-owned dealers,  and recruiting women, veteran,  disabled and disadvantaged dealer  candidates, among other activities.  Recognizing Premier   Performance Every day, our dealer partners  deliver best-in-class Steelcase  experiences to customers across  the globe. Our dealer partners meet  our high standards for quality and  performance thanks to a number of  practices and policies we implement  around the world. In the U.S. and  Canada, the \"Blue Book\" outlines  the respective expectations, rights  and obligations of both Steelcase  and Steelcase dealers. In all other  markets, we have formal agreements  with our dealers.  Partners 34 Promise + Progress Steelcase Supplier Relationships PROMISE We work with our  suppliers – and our  suppliers suppliers –  ensuring the materials  and services they  provide meet our strict  standards for quality,  performance and  sustainability. PROGRESS Established global  guidelines, tools and  knowledge exchange  programs to ensure we  deliver the best value  to our stakeholders  through a diverse set   of suppliers.  Our suppliers help ensure we  provide inspiring and innovative  solutions for our customers by  delivering superior materials,  technology, expertise and  reliable performance. We  expect them to adhere to the  highest standards for safety,  quality and sustainability.  Global Alignment +  Collaboration As Steelcase operates in an  increasingly interconnected world,  promoting our common values helps  encourage consistent behaviors.  Together with our suppliers, we  exchange best practices through   our global supplier conference. We  work with our suppliers to monitor  and grow performance through a  system of common metrics on a  daily, weekly, monthly and   quarterly basis.  To set consistent standards globally,  we communicate our expectations  through a Supplier Code of Conduct.  The code outlines requirements for  organizational governance, human  rights, labor practices, environmental  stewardship, fair operating practices,  consumer issues and community  involvement and development.  Steelcase suppliers are required   to comply with the code under   the terms of their global contract  with Steelcase. Suppliers are  evaluated through questionnaires  and select site visits. We continue   to partner with them to continuously  improve their performance in areas  addressed within the code.  35 Promise + Progress Steelcase Partners Supplier   Relationships 10%  Steelcase suppliers in  the U.S. are minority- owned, women-owned  and veteran-owned   businesses First-of-Its-Kind Steelcase extended  our corporate discount  on renewable energy  to our suppliers —  believed to be the first  program of its kind Supplier Diversity Resiliency and success can only  happen when we cultivate a diversity  of perspectives, experiences and  ideas. For more than 25 years,  the Steelcase supplier diversity  program has focused on promoting  the growth and development of  minority-owned, women-owned,  service-disabled veteran-owned and  HUBzone businesses in the U.S. We  continue to invest in these business  relationships, which comprise  just over 10% of all supplier  relationships. We place emphasis  on infrastructure and reporting,  communication, networking, supplier  development and mentoring.  Partnering to Drive Innovation We continue to engage with multiple  levels of our supply chain to  innovate all aspects of product and  business systems. For example, a  key area of focus is understanding  the composition of materials,  avoiding chemicals of concern and  determining alternatives. Where  suitable alternatives dont exist, we  partner together to find solutions.  This deep work leads to innovations  in sustainability like our New Black  fabric collection and Steelcase  Series 1 chair.  Head over to the Our Year in Focus  section on p. 21 to learn more.  Communities 36 Promise + Progress Steelcase Social   Investment PROMISE Together, we join forces  with our employees to  share our time, skills   and resources to create  lasting change in  communities where we  live, work and serve. PROGRESS Expanded our global  community involvement.  In 2016, our employees  reported over 46,000  hours of volunteer  work, and Steelcase  Inc. and the Steelcase  Foundation donated  over $5.3 million to  organizations around   the world. To be a force for good and   affect positive change in our  communities, we work closely  with community organizations to  extend their offerings and further  their impact. We invest in the  following areas: - Human service  - Health  - Education  - Community development  - Arts  - Environment. Employee Impacts Steelcase employees are  encouraged to volunteer and support  the causes they care about. Global  volunteer hours reported in 2016 are  up more than 18% from the previous  year, with employees giving their  time to more than 160 community  organizations. And as a direct result  of employee giving, the Steelcase  Foundation donated over $470,000  in matching gifts. Meaningful Engagement Our long-standing involvement in  communities and charitable   organizations continues to produce  powerful results. At Steelcase  locations around the world, social  responsibility committees identify  pressing local needs and respond  with time and resources. The effects  of those investments have not only  impacted our communities but also  our business growth. We are proud  to be recognized as one of The  Civic 50 for the third year in a   row, an honor given to the most  community-minded companies in   the nation1. 1Awarded by Atlanta-based Points of Light, for  companies with annual revenues of at least $1 billion $5.3  Million Together, Steelcase  and the Steelcase  Foundation donated  over $5.3 million  to more than 100  organizations around  the world.  37 Promise + Progress Steelcase Communities Social Investment Growing Steam for   STEM at Cook Museum  of Natural History To encourage careers in science,  engineering and advanced  manufacturing, Steelcase has  increased its emphasis on STEM  education, focusing on underserved  geographies. A $125,000 investment  in the new Cook Museum of Natural  History in Northern Alabama  will provide science-centered  professional development, helping  local resource-strapped schools  inspire the next generation of young  people to pursue science- and math- based careers. Scheduled to open  in 2018, the museum is projected to  attract an added $50 million a year to  the local economy. Global Youth Forum This year, eight Steelcase leaders  in five countries participated in  the annual Global Youth Forum, a  seven-week design challenge that  connects teens with their peers  around the world to improve skills  in strategy, communication and  teamwork. Students from France,  Germany, Mexico, Romania and the  U.S. worked together to answer the  question, How might we design a  public transit stop to be a place for  deeper connections with others? At  the conclusion of the program, they  presented their solutions to business  and community leaders in Grand  Rapids, Michigan. Munich-based  Steelcase leader Andrea Morais said  The whole experience was amazing!  It was a great opportunity to connect  with new people from different  countries and backgrounds, [and] a  chance to develop new skills and be  in touch with brilliant minds. 46,000+ volunteer hours   Australia   Belgium   Brazil   Canada   China (Hong Kong)   France    Germany   India   Ireland   Malaysia    Mexico   Romania   Singapore   Spain   United Kingdom   United States In over 16 countries $1 Million Based on Independent Sectors estimated   average value of a volunteer hour, Steelcase   employees saved over $1 million USD for   charities and nonprofits around the world this year   2016 Employee Matching Gifts Total $470,658 Education $378,216 Arts & Culture $71,502 Other/Environmental   & Conservation $20,940 Other Arts &   Culture Education  Employees 38 Promise + Progress Steelcase Employee  Health +   Wellbeing PROMISE Create and maintain  a safe, healthy and  enriching workplace.  Provide ongoing  opportunities for all  employees to improve  their physical, cognitive,  emotional and   financial wellbeing.  PROGRESS Created work  environments to support  the multidimensional  nature of wellbeing  and safety, engaged  employees in proactively  planning for safety, and  launched programs  targeting nutrition,  exercise, life coaching,  stress management and   financial planning.  Good health, quality of life and  sound safety practices are as  important to us as production  efficiency and quality. To enhance  the health, safety and wellbeing  of all Steelcase employees in a  meaningful way, we are proactive  in embedding standards and  creating initiatives throughout our  organization. We regularly engage  our employees in the creation of  programs and the measurement  and evaluation of our progress  through surveys, focus groups   and interviews. For example, senior  executives host regular meetings  with groups of employees to listen  to their stories and experiences  working for Steelcase. These  roundtables complement research  efforts and uncover insights —   insights we translate into   initiatives to improve the   employee experience. Balancing Act Steelcase understands that work  and home continue to intersect  and overlap. Weve taken proactive  steps to support aspects of our  employees lives.   Each of our global locations integrates  wellbeing activities. Some examples  include on-site yoga classes, access  to company bicycles, language tables,  hosting speakers on a variety of topics,  and facilitating after-work outdoor  activities and team sports.   Work/life balance groups for grief  support, working moms and elderly care  offer Steelcase employees opportunities  to connect with coworkers.   In the U.S. all employees have a $100  wellness reimbursement account to  encourage healthy habits, like joining   a gym or trying out kickboxing classes.   In addition to standard family medical  leave and existing maternity leave  programs, all parents in the U.S. and  Canada are given three additional weeks  of paid bonding leave following the birth  or adoption of a child. Proactive Approaches We believe protecting and enhancing  the health and safety of our  employees is multidimensional and  holistic. Thats why were enacting  a variety of measures aimed at  involving employees in supporting  positive behaviors and promoting  clear lines of communication. Our hard work and continual  improvement is paying off. Were  proud to report our injury and  lost time rates are almost half the  industry standard. In fact, thanks to  our safety efforts, weve been able  to reduce our workplace incidents  by 40% over the past two years.  To achieve this, we engage with  employees about the importance  of identifying and reporting unsafe  conditions and behaviors before   they become injuries.   39 Promise + Progress Steelcase Employees 10+  Vendor partners available  to help employees navigate  and improve their physical,  mental, financial and  nutritional wellbeing $170,000  1,700 employees took  advantage of the $100  wellness reimbursement. 170+ More than 170 employees  took advantage of Steelcase's  paid bonding leave. Emphasizing the   Incident-free Workplace Our people are our priority. Learning  from near-misses (instances where  accidents could have happened,  but didnt) are crucial in preventing  future injuries. Building off of a  successful pilot project two years  ago, we issued a challenge to five  U.S. regional distribution centers  (RDCs) last year: whichever RDC  could identify, report and fix the most  near-misses before they turned into  more serious situations would win  lunch on the company. Zone leaders  were tasked with recording detailed  descriptions and photos of any near- misses in their plant. The challenge  was a success, helping employees  recognize how recording near-misses  creates a safer work environment  for all — moving us closer to an  incident-free workplace.  Phased Retirement   Works for Employees   and Business This year, 47 Steelcase employees  elected a phased retirement plan,  reducing their hours to ease the  transition into retired life. Phased  retirement plans are a win-win for  employees and teams, allowing  valuable skills and knowledge to be  transferred gradually while hobbies  and new opportunities for the future  can be more thoroughly explored —  and enjoyed. Employee   Health +   Wellbeing  Employees 40 Promise + Progress Steelcase Learning +   Development PROMISE Unlock the human  promise of all our  employees by  offering learning and  development programs. PROGRESS Expanded learning  opportunities and  introduced a new  coaching-based model  to drive employee  development. Steelcases approach to learning  fosters an environment where  we all teach — and we all learn.  We provide the tools, processes  and strategies that enable  employees to take ownership of  their learning and develop their  skills and competencies.  Across our global footprint,   we spread learning and   teaching through:  - Classes and online courses - Social learning - Speaker series - Conferences - Lunch and learn events - Mentoring and coaching. Steelcase Learning Group The Steelcase Learning Group offers  a variety of training and development  courses and programs on campus  and online. This enables employees  around the world to take courses  and track progress for their personal  and professional development. We  also provide a career development  tutorial to guide employees through  the process of identifying their career  ambitions, strengths, networks and  develop action plans to achieve   their goals.  We offer a retirement program to  help employees plan their career  transition, including financial   planning. U.S.-based employees  have access to a phased   retirement program.  For those who exited the company  due to position elimination and plant  closings, we offer services from a  professional outplacement company,  including career counseling, tools  and techniques for job searching   and courses to update skill sets.   We provide learning programs   to increase employability   outside Steelcase. Leadership at Every Level In an ever-changing business   climate, we recognize the need   for leadership throughout all parts  of the organization. In addition  to existing knowledge- and skill- sharing opportunities available to all  employees, a new program called  CONNECT was launched to help  inspire employees to lead where  they are — wherever they are in the  organization. With cohort groups in  all global regions, CONNECT brings  together high-performing, motivated  contributors through a series of three  in-person modules: Connecting to  Purpose, Growing your Influence,  and Leading with Impact.  Learning +   Development 41 Promise + Progress Steelcase Employees 94,000+ Training hours for   employees, contractors   and temporary workers 91% Employees who engaged  in Impact Coaching  conversation(s) said the time  they spent engaging in the  new process was valuable 30+  Thought Leaders  Hosted Thought leaders spoke to  employees about topics such  as digital transformation,  human performance, culture,  design thinking, biomimicry,  and social innovation through   our Curious Minds program. 500+  Learning Programs Covering the topics of  business acumen, human  resources, languages,  process quality, computer  skills, policy and compliance,  quality, leadership and  interpersonal skills, to   name a few New Coaching Approach We believe advancing our culture  requires our people to engage  in new ways. One example of  this is transitioning from annual  performance reviews to impact  coaching, which engages employees  and leaders in frequent, purposeful   dialogue to inspire continuous  achievement and growth. These  conversations shift focus away from  the mindset of simply meeting goals  and expectations to creating goals  and advancing development.   Impact coaching emphasizes:   Building a strong partnership   between leaders and employees   Collaborating on the   employees performance and  development objectives   Engaging in ongoing coaching   and feedback   Reflecting upon the employees key  accomplishment, challenges and   growth opportunities. Meaningful Progress We make progress when we  disagree or when we fail in new  and interesting ways, but only if  we learn from our mistakes. At  our Kentwood, Michigan plant, a  community of employees has been  forming around GTD: David Allen's  method of getting things done.  They are committed to improving  their own productivity, but also  tracking group progress in tangible  way. This movement is building  momentum, and in the past four  years theyve taken over 1,000  people through a customized training  program to help others get more  done, too. By celebrating progress  and emphasizing continued learning,  we unlock the human promise of our  people and ensure the future fitness  of our company.  Employees 42 Promise + Progress Steelcase Culture +   Engagement PROMISE Create and advance a  culture that embraces  diversity and inclusion  across our workforce,  within our partnerships  and throughout   our communities. PROGRESS Developed initiatives to  encourage and honor  diverse perspectives,  emphasize inclusivity  across our global  footprint and ensure   a promising future for   our employees and   our company. In our company, were fortunate  to have as many different  perspectives and passions as  there are people. We celebrate  this diversity — its what allows  us to challenge one another,  build upon each other's ideas  and innovate together. A Culture of Engagement To support employees as we  continue building a culture which  embraces innovation, inspiration   and inclusion, Steelcase introduced  five principles to act: 1. Speak up and take action 2. See the big picture 3. Follow the user 4. Chose inclusion 5.   Start small, learn quickly  and try again. These principles serve as a guide   for our culture, encouraging each  individual within our organization to  seek higher levels of accountability,   foster collaboration and   encourage experimentation. Diversity We foster an environment that  supports understanding and  openness to ideas and cultural  approaches different from our own  experiences, creating opportunities  for people to work well across   those differences and be better  because of them.  But valuing diversity as a business  driver isnt enough. We must  embrace it as individuals, and this   is difficult, deliberate work. One of  the ways we do this is by offering  global awareness training in order  to better understand other cultures  behaviors and norms. The interactive  sessions are available to employees  worldwide, providing a framework   to encourage dialogue and help   dispel stereotypes. Building a culture which encourages  each member of our organization to  broaden horizons, think critically   and uncover opportunities to  integrate new, diverse thinking is   the first step in achieving new,   more ambitious goals.  Culture + Engagement 43 Promise + Progress Steelcase Employees Inclusion Groups Foster   Deeper Connections Steelcase employees are  encouraged to take ownership of  diversity and inclusion. Employees  with common interests or at similar  life stages come together to discuss  challenges and opportunities,  conduct educational sessions and  communicate among themselves  and across the organization. Some   peer groups include:   Multicultural and inclusive   communities  Steelcase Pride  Social responsibility  Employees near retirement age  Veterans  Womens Innovative Network   Young professionals. Many groups have a Steelcase  Executive Team (SET) sponsor. In  addition to being on the committee,  the SET member shares feedback  and ideas generated by these  groups, continuing to shape a   culture of inclusion at Steelcase.

Womens Innovative  Network Launched in our Schiltigheim,  France location, the goal of the  Womens Innovative Network (WIN)  is to welcome, inspire and support  women working at Steelcase.  Though a series of networking  events, mentorship programs and  skill-sharing opportunities, WIN is  spreading awareness and building  competencies of employees around  the world. Since its founding in May 2016,  WIN has grown by 66% globally.  In addition to creating regional  chapters, WIN has focused on  developing its external network  through partnership with leading  organizations to network, share  experiences and highlight insights. 20%+ Steelcase was recognized as   a Winning W Company by  2020 Women on Boards, a  national campaign to increase  the percentage of women on  U.S. company boards to 20%   or greater by the year 2020   for six consecutive years. For the third year in a row,  Steelcase earned a perfect  100 score in all categories on  the Human Rights Campaigns  Corporate Equality Index,   and was named one of their  Best Places to Work for   LGBT Equality. 20+  Inclusion Groups,  Thousands Engaged Over 20 grassroots inclusion  groups represent thousands  of perspectives, passions and  progress looking forward 25  Nationalities  Represented in our   new Munich office  Environment 44 Promise + Progress Steelcase Energy +  Greenhouse  Gas Emissions PROMISE Reduce our global  greenhouse gas  emissions and cut  our energy use by  25% by 20201, while  continuing to invest in  100% renewable energy  equivalent to our global  electricity consumption. 1Based on 2010 baseline PROGRESS Reduced our global  energy use by 20%  since 2010 by carefully  measuring and  managing our energy  consumption. Continued  our investments in  renewable energy. We take a comprehensive  approach to optimizing energy  by continuously improving  tracking systems, honing in on  efficiency efforts and investing   in renewable energy. While  weve made great progress  on our reduction activities, we  continue to challenge ourselves  to do more.  Driving Efficiency Were actively tracking the energy  use of 150+ offices, showrooms and  manufacturing facilities worldwide.  One of the many strategies were  pursuing to meet our energy goals is  rolling out a new software program to  track our global energy consumption.  In collaboration with third-party  consultants, we are able to collect,  analyze and report our global energy  data more quickly and accurately  than ever before. This allows us to  respond to any issues and accurately  gauge our progression toward   our goals.  In 2016, we initiated a project at our  wood plant in Michigan to replace  more than 1,300 energy-intensive  light fixtures with 1,250 energy- efficient LED lights. To further  maximize energy and cost savings,  we paired the new fixtures with an  advanced, cloud-based control  system, allowing us to remotely  schedule, monitor and control light  conditions. This has translated into  energy savings by dimming fixtures  when appropriate and turning off  entire sections when they are   not needed.  Energy + Greenhouse Gas Emissions 45 Promise + Progress Steelcase Environment Investing in Renewables Steelcase continues its commitment  to invest in renewable energy  equivalent to our global electricity  usage in the regions where   we operate.  What started nearly a decade  ago as a collection of regional  investments is now a global,  cohesive clean energy portfolio  in the form of Renewable Energy  Credits (RECs) and a Virtual Power  Purchase Agreement (VPPA). In  2016, Steelcase executed a 12-year  VPPA for 25 megawatts of wind  power from Southern Company  subsidiary Southern Powers Grant  Plains Wind Facility in Oklahoma.  This new clean energy facility came  online in 2016 and has a capacity  of 147 megawatts. This purchase  represents nearly half of our global  renewable energy investments.  Check out our renewable energy  story featured on pp. 16–17 to   learn more.  Expanding our Impact One of our biggest opportunities to  drive energy efficiency is through  the millions of square feet of space  we furnish globally each year for our  customers. As a human-centered  company, we spend considerable  time and resources researching and  designing products and spaces  which help companies get the  most from their real estate, even  when space is compressed. An  optimized real estate footprint is a  more sustainable one – with less  construction cost and impact, less  energy use and fewer greenhouse  gas emissions. 2016 Total   Energy   Consumption Fuel Type  MWh Natural gas  224,787 Propane  1,769 Electric Power  190,144 Coal  – Diesel  13,216 Gasoline   (Petrol)  472 Liquefied   Petroleum   Gas (LPG)  2,962 Jet Fuel  (Jet A or A-1)  18,293 Steam  2,601 Total  454,244 Top 30 Were now the 26th largest 100% Green Power   User in the U.S., according to the EPAs Green   Power Partnership.

For more than fifteen years, Steelcase  has had global goals to reduce the  environmental footprint of our operations.  Thanks to the efforts of countless  employees around the world, weve  experimented and implemented initiatives  to reduce water consumption and waste  output at all of our owned and leased  facilities globally. Each Steelcase facility pursues initiatives to  reduce waste and water use in accordance  with their Environmental Management  Systems registered under ISO 14001. Some  plants in Europe also having an additional  EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme  (EMAS). As insights and successes are  uncovered, theyre added to a library of  best management practices shared by all  locations, so we can quickly implement and  scale efforts to drive results. Since 2010, weve reduced waste by 45%  and water consumption by 8%. This is our  second round of 25% footprint reduction  goals, having met our first set of goals in  2012. New thinking, new initiatives and  creative solutions are necessary to drive  success in these areas. Reducing by 25%  yet again is infinitely more difficult — but  we remain optimistic and are committed   to meeting our goal.  Planked Veneer In our Michigan wood plant, high  standards and specifications meant  wood with knots or uneven grain  wasnt always able to be used in  finished products, and had to be  recycled or resold. Two members of  the Steelcase operations team were  searching for how to utilize this extra  wood, and began experimenting with  a simple table design. At the same  time, a customer requested a unique  table. The prototype planked oak  table was shared with the customer,  and it happened to align with their  design aspirations perfectly. The  team turned concept into production  in a matter of weeks, and their work  led to a new material offering using  this previously discarded wood —  which is now available for everyone.   Waste + Water 47 Promise + Progress Steelcase Environment $1  Million  Using planked  veneer helped save  over $1 million and  400 trees. Scrap Supports   Shipments We continue to identify ways to  reduce material inputs and reuse,  recycle, compost or donate  materials for new use at nonprofits.  One notable example of creative  reuse came from the Steelcase  wood plant in Michigan: operations  team members were looking  for opportunities to use excess  melamine at the same time the  packaging team was looking to  better support a finished product  during shipment. The teams realized  they could use leftover melamine   to build better pallets on-site. In  addition to repurposing materials,  the new pallets have improved  support and protection for the   product during shipment. Clean Corporate   Citizen Designation  Notably in FY17, Steelcase Michigan  locations achieved the Clean  Corporate Citizen (C3) designation  from the State of Michigan. This  designation recognizes that we have  consistently demonstrated a strong  environmental ethic and stewardship  to carry out our environmental  protection responsibilities. The C3  program requires environmental  performance in three areas including  Environmental Management Systems  (EMS), pollution prevention and  environmental compliance related to  air quality, water quality and waste  management programs.

PROGRESS Ongoing efforts to   refine product  packaging and delivery  approaches. Recognized  for leadership in   commuter-friendly  and sustainable  transportation options. Steelcase continuously refines  its packaging and transportation  strategies to ensure products  arrive quickly, efficiently and  safely. We rely on research,  experienced logistics and   packaging specialists, as well   as partnerships with dealers   and transporters to inform our   approach and scale initiatives  and improvement. And we apply  these same insights as we  consider employee commutes,  business travel and more. Moving Products with           Care + Efficiency As our global footprint expands,  we remain committed to optimizing  delivery routes to shorten travel  distances and minimize fuel usage.  Steelcase transportation models  take into account unique weather  and transportation considerations for  nearly every continent and country,  from Australia to Iceland, Ecuador  to China. Our incident management  system allows real-time visibility  into weather and road conditions,  enabling adjustments that minimize  idle drive time. Steelcase packaging is subjected to  a rigorous testing model, determining  tolerances for temperature changes,  vibrations, crush tests and drops.   At times, well use a simulation   track to mimic actual road  conditions, whether theyre open  country roads or bustling city streets.   Were exploring new packaging  options and materials to uncover  innovative solutions and methods   to ensure products arrive safely to   our customers.

Transportation + Packaging 49 Promise + Progress Steelcase Environment 65  Since 2015, Steelcase Transportation  has completed over 65 projects in our  air, rail, road and water transportation  activities which have led to a reduction  in both cost and emissions. 8,514  Because of these 65 initiatives,  Steelcase was able to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions associated  with these transportation activities by  8,514 metric tons — equivalent to   the energy use of 1,276 homes for   one year. Moving People, Too Steelcase considers employee  transportation, from commuting  to business travel, as part of its  footprint reduction initiatives. This  year, Steelcases offices in Grand  Rapids received a Silver-level Bicycle  Friendly BusinessSM award from the  League of American Bicyclists for  making workplaces and communities  safer, happier, healthier and more  sustainable. To encourage two- wheeled commutes, Steelcase  employees have access to bike  racks, locker rooms and   shower facilities.

Areas  identified as material are those  which significantly impact our  ability to meet its strategic goals  and/or significantly influence   the decisions and evaluations   of stakeholders. The process   for identifying material issues  and defining reporting content   is outlined in the following  sections. It generally follows   GRI guidelines and adheres   to the Principles for Defining  Report content. Identification A list of potentially material   sustainability issues is   maintained through internal   and external research, including  benchmarking and reviewing  relevant reporting standards.   The Steelcase Sustainability  Steering Committee validates  this list, taking into account   the business and   sustainability strategy. Prioritization Each potentially material issue   is evaluated based on the  following criteria:   Influence on external   stakeholders decisions   and assessments  Impact on the business. These evaluations are based   on primary and secondary   research including surveys,   interviews and workshops, many  of which have been conducted  by third parties. The results are  plotted on a matrix to illustrate  the relationships of material  issues to business impacts   and influence on stakeholders  decisions and assessments.  Methods to engage with and  collect input from internal   and external stakeholders   are continually integrated into  ongoing engagement activities.  The sustainability materiality  assessment is updated as   additional research is   conducted and new data   and insights become available. Validation Key internal senior decision  makers validate the sustainability  materiality issues included within  this report. Review The sustainability materiality  assessment results and  supporting research is reviewed  annually. These findings inform  future assessments and   ensure alignment with  stakeholder expectations   and the business context.  52 Promise + Progress Steelcase GRI Report General Standard Disclosures General Standard Disclosures Strategy + Analysis  G4-1 Provide a statement from the most senior   decision-maker of the organization (such as   CEO, chair, or equivalent senior position)   about the relevance of sustainability to the  organization and the organizations strategy   for addressing sustainability.
