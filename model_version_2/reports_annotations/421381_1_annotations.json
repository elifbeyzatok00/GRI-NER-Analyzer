K Fishpaths In August 2017, we began a multi-year collaboration with the environmental organisation  WWF Finland to save endangered migratory fish. We will map out areas in Finland to  find obstacles in migratory fish spawning grounds, and in a spirit of cooperation with  landowners, local K-retailers and volunteers, make the spawning grounds once again  accessible to fish. Find out more. Challenges Supply chains  We purchase and sell responsibly and support our customers in making sustainable  choices. Our goal is to know the supply chains of all of our products and to ensure they  are sustainable. This is challenging, as our selections comprise tens of thousands of  products purchased from around the world. Moreover, food products, for example, often  contain a multitude of different ingredients. We pay special attention to human rights  issues and working conditions within the supply chain. Suppliers are monitored especially  in countries where the risk of violations of these rights is the greatest.   Find out more. Professional and committed personnel K Group, i.e. Kesko and the K-retailers, employs approximately 42,000 people. Roles  range from jobs at stores to retailer entrepreneurship and expert and manager positions  in various fields. Professional, committed personnel forms the basis for all our opera- tions. Tightening competition for skilled labour requires active development of employer  image, performance and competence management, and maintaining employee wellbeing  and working ability.

Together, we generate economic value added.   The K Code of Conduct steers all our operations.   We follow good corporate governance principles.   Together, we improve financial profitability. Topic Objective Progress of objectives 2017 Progress of objectives 2016 Progress of objectives 2015 K Code of Conduct All of our personnel act in  compliance with the K Code of  Conduct.   GRI 205-1, 205-2, 205-3 As of 2017, we oblige the entire personnel to annually  confirm their compliance with the K Code of Conduct  guidelines. By the end of 2017, 65% of personnel had  made the annual confirmation. We updated Our Responsible Working Principles  guidelines in 2016. The new guidelines were named  the K Code of Conduct and were published in the  languages of all our operating countries in October  2016. We named 20 K Code of Conduct ambassadors  as the messengers and contact persons. We will  update all new and renewed employment contracts to  include a clause about the requirement for personnel  to familiarise themselves and comply with the K  Code of Conduct. We will add a K Code of Conduct  contract clause to all agreements signed by Kesko  Group companies. As of 2017, we oblige the entire  personnel to annually acknowledge their compliance  with the K Code of Conduct guidelines. From the beginning of 2015, all of Kesko's Russian  business companies have had their own anti- corruption policies. We decided to update Our  Responsible Working Principles guidelines in 2016. We organise regular training on the  K Code of Conduct. GRI 205-1, 205-2, 205-3 We continued to communicate and implement  the K Code of Conduct in practice according to  the annual plan. Some 20 K Code of Conduct  ambassadors in different operating countries have  been appointed to act as messengers and contact  persons. Keskos Legal Affairs, Risk Management  and Internal Audit organised K Code of Conduct  training in the subsidiaries in Norway, Poland and  Sweden in 2017. The events focused especially on  corruption and fraud-related issues. The K Code of  Conduct eLearning programme targeted at the entire  personnel had been completed by 8,867 people by the  end of 2017. As part of the ongoing responsibility training,  a training event on the K Code of Conduct was  organised in Suomen Lhikauppa and two Russian  subsidiaries in 2016. The events focused largely on  corruption and fraud-related issues. The eLearning  training targeted at all personnel had been attended  by 3,159 people at the end of 2016. We drew an  annual plan for 2017 which includes procedures to  increase the personnel's awareness of the K Code of  Conduct such as communication and training events  for every quarter. The online training on responsibility, which  was published in 2015 and directed at all Kesko  employees, describes Our Responsible Working  Principles. As part of the ongoing responsibility  training, a training event on Our Responsible Working  Principles was organised for the key employees of  Keskos company in Belarus in 2015.

In 2017, the comparable return on capital employed  was 12.2% and the comparabe return on equity was  10.9%. The comparable return on capital employed was  11.9%, and the comparable return on equity was 9.8%. The comparable return on capital employed was  11.7%, and the comparable return on equity was 8.2%. Human rights We respect human rights and  take them into account in all our  operations. GRI 412-1, 412-2 We followed up our human rights assessment by  conducting a review of working conditions in the  supply chain of grapes in collaboration with the Trade  Union Solidarity Centre of Finland (SASK). The human  rights assessment will be reviewed every three years,  with the next review taking place in 2019. We published our human rights assessment and  human rights commitment on our website. We will  review and update it every three years. We will  construct our operating models so that respect for  human rights is observed in all our operations. We continued to assess human rights related impacts  in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights. During the extensive  report work, we heard the thoughts of customers and  personnel as well as employees in high-risk countries'  factories on human rights and how well they are  realised in K Group's operations. FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 5  Economic performance 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed Kesko's operations generate economic benefits for the different stakeholder groups in Keskos operat- ing countries and market areas. Key stakeholder groups include shareholders, customers, personnel,  retailers, suppliers of goods and providers of services, and society. Kesko promotes the growth of  welfare throughout its supply chain, including developing countries. The following tables show cash flows between Kesko and its stakeholders, as well as the distribution of  economic value added between stakeholder groups. The most important cash flows comprise revenue  from customers and retailers, purchases from suppliers of goods and providers of services, dividends  to shareholders, salaries and wages paid to personnel, taxes and capital expenditure. In June 2017, Kesko sold Indoor Group, which is responsible for the Asko and Sotka furniture trade  chains, and the K-maatalous agricultural business. K-maatalous is consolidated into Kesko Group up  until 31 May 2017 and Indoor Group up until 30 June 2017. In April 2016 Kesko acquired Suomen Lhikauppa Oy, in June 2016 Onninen Oy and in December  2016 Oy Autocarrera Ab. Suomen Lhikauppa Oy (currently K-Market Oy) has been consolidated  into Kesko Group as of 12 April 2016, Onninen Group as of 1 June 2016 and Oy Autocarrera Ab as of  1 December 2016. In 2016, Kesko disposed of the Russian grocery trade and the Russian Intersport  business. The Russian grocery trade business is included in the figures until 30 November 2016. In February 2018, Kesko announced it will discontinue its building and home improvement trade  operations in Russia. The Russian building and home improvement trade operations are included in the  2017 figures. Further information on the structural changes is available in note 3.2 to the financial statements.

Dividend policy According to its dividend policy, Kesko Corporation distributes at least 50% of its comparable earnings  per share as dividends, taking into account, however, the companys financial position and operating  strategy. Keskos Board of Directors proposes to the General Meeting to be held in April 2018 that a  total dividend of 219 million be paid for the year 2017, which would represent 84.9% of earnings per  share and 96.6% of comparable earnings per share. In 2017, Kesko distributed a total of 199 million as  dividends for the 2016 profit, which represented 201.3% of earnings per share and 99.5% of compara- ble earnings per share.

In June 2017, the Science Based Targets initiative approved the emission targets set by Kesko through  which Kesko shows its commitment to the target of below 2C global warming, as set by the Paris  Climate Agreement. Keskos operations are surveyed regularly by risk assessments, which also cover changes that may be  necessitated by climate change. The Groups risk map, the most significant risks and uncertainties,  as well as changes in and management responses to them are discussed by the Kesko Boards Audit  Committee when the interim reports and financial statements are handled. Read more about our risk management and control practices. FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 7  Climate change presents physical and regulatory risks and opportunities as  well as risks and opportunities affecting reputational factors Physical impacts   Extreme weather phenomena, such as storms and heavy rains, have consequences for the built  environment. Physical risks are related to both the physical store network and logistics. Unusual  weather patterns can cause interruptions in operations or problems in the availability of products  and changes in sales, particularly in the building and technical trade.   Climate change can affect the procurement sources and availability of products both within and  outside Europe. Due to drought and desertification, water has become less available in many  countries, reducing the productive potential of local economies. Agricultural production will suffer  if desertification and rising sea levels reduce arable land area. Drought or floods may destroy  agricultural harvests. Intensifying competition for raw materials may lead to higher prices.   The availability of energy sources and emission limits may affect energy prices.   Accidents and epidemics resulting from natural phenomena can cause damage or business  interruptions that cannot be prevented. Regulation   Climate change may have an impact in terms of risks involved in regulation, such as various permit  procedures, or costs arising from emission pricing and taxation.   The implementation of the EU and Finnish Government climate and energy policy will affect energy  solutions and may increase energy prices, adding to pressures for energy savings and energy  self-sufficiency. Customers   Customers are paying increasing attention to issues related to sustainability. Environmentally  friendly products, corporate responsibility communications, retail stores K-responsibility concept  and package labelling can help customers make purchasing decisions that mitigate climate change.  Any failures to implement responsible practices in this area may weaken Keskos reputation.   Kesko takes part in the development of circular economy by offering recycling services at its stores  and by taking part in innovative initiatives such as the Ham Trick campaign or the manufacture of  Pirkka products using biogas made from inedible biowaste collected from K-food stores. Opportunities and risks related to climate change are also described in the reports   Operating environment / Opportunities and Risks section. 201-3 Coverage of the organisation's defined benefit plan obligations The Group operates several pension plans in its different operating countries. In Finland, statutory  pension provision for personnel is organised through pension insurance companies and voluntary  supplementary pension provision is mainly organised through Kesko Pension Funds department A. At  the end of the year, the number of employees eligible to receive supplementary retirement benefits  from department A was 2,651. The statutory pension provision organised through a pension insurance company is a defined contribu- tion plan. The supplementary pension provision organised by Kesko Pension Fund is a defined benefit  plan. As at 31 December 2017, the defined benefit plan obligation was 266.6 million (302.3 million  in 2016), which is fully covered. Calculated under IFRS, the surplus amount was 207.5 million as at 31  December 2017 (164.7 million in 2016). Calculated under IFRS, the Groups total pension expenses  represent 13.9% of the amount of salaries (13.6% in 2016). Read more in the financial statements  section, note 3.8. In the other countries, pensions are arranged in compliance with local legislation. The former pension  plan operated in Norway was classified as a defined benefit plan, but the related liability expired during  the financial year 2017. 201-4 Financial assistance received from government In 2017, the Group received financial assistance of 1.4 million from the public sector. This amount  mainly consists of assistance received from Finland (1.1 million) and from Sweden (0.3 million). The  majority of public sector assistance in Finland is related to investments in the utilisation of solar power.   FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 8  Indirect economic impacts 203-2 Significant indirect economic impacts, including the extent of  impacts Kesko is a service sector company which has significant indirect impacts related to the production, use  and recyclability of products. Purchases by Kesko and the retailers have economic impacts on the suppliers and service providers,  such as an increase in the number of jobs. Furthermore, purchases from local producers affect regional  business activities. The salaries, taxes, social security expenses and capital expenditure paid by Kesko  and retailers have impacts on regional economic welfare. In 2017, Kesko operated in nine countries in which it is engaged in both retail and wholesale. On  16 February 2018, we announced we would discontinue our building and home improvement trade  operations in Russia.  It is one of Keskos principles that taxes on operating income and assets are always paid to the respec- tive operating country in compliance with local laws and regulations. Kesko is a significant tax payer. In 2017, the income taxes paid by Kesko to Finland totalled 46.5  million and to other countries 9.7 million. The Groups effective tax rate was 17.9%. Kesko paid  3.7 million in real estate taxes and net worth taxes to Finland and 2.8 million to its other operating  countries in 2017. Kesko collects, reports and remits also indirect taxes, such as value-added taxes and excise duties.  Kesko remits value-added taxes to tax recipients in its capacity as a company selling goods and  services. In 2017, Keskos value-added taxes payable in Finland amounted to 410.3 million, and 129.2  million in other countries. Kesko remits car taxes and excise duties on, for instance, confectionery,  alcohol and soft drinks. In 2017, Kesko remitted excise duties in Finland to a total amount of 61.1  million. Keskos measurable indirect impact on society, such as its employment impact, increased municipal tax  income, or income in the producer and supply chain, is evaluated case-by-case, in connection with the  establishment of a new store, for example.

Key risks, includ- ing risks related to corruption, are identified, assessed, managed, monitored and reported regularly as  part of business operations in all operating countries. Keskos anti-corruption principles are included in the K Code of Conduct guidelines published in 2016.  The guidelines and website have been published in the languages of all our operating countries. Kesko  employees and business partners have their own versions of the K Code of Conduct. Kesko has prepared a mandatory eLearning package for its employees to smoothly internalise the K  Code of Conduct. Kesko arranges K Code of Conduct sessions in its companies: in 2017, such events were organised  in the Norwegian, Polish and Swedish subsidiaries. The events focused largely on corruption and  fraud-related issues. In 2017, the prevention of malpractice was one of the focus areas for Keskos corporate security  function. During the year, individual cases of suspected malpractice came to our knowledge and the  corporate security unit assisted in investigating them. Towards the end of 2016, Kesko introduced the Group-wide SpeakUp channel through which  employees and business partners can report any violations of the K Code of Conduct. During 2017, 38  notices were submitted through the SpeakUp channel, related to e.g. managerial work, store staff and  customer service, and Keskos partnerships with its suppliers. In 2017, no corruption related lawsuits against any Kesko Group company came to our knowledge.

Labour/management relations 402-1 Minimum notice periods regarding operational changes Kesko complies with local legislation in all of its operating countries. In Finland, the key statutes  governing restructuring situations are included in the Act on Co-operation within Undertakings, which  stipulates that the employer must provide reasonable notice of decisions for consideration on the basis  of negotiations. The collective agreement for the trading sector does not specify any minimum notice  periods applying to restructuring situations. In Sweden, the statutory minimum notice period in the event of organisational changes is 8–24 weeks  depending on the nature of the change. The collective agreement applying to operations in Sweden  also does not specify minimum notice periods for restructuring situations. No specific minimum notice  period for organisational changes is defined in Norway, but both legislation and the collective agree- ment stipulate that personnel shall be informed of organisational changes at the earliest opportunity. Russian legislation states that personnel must be informed of restructuring 8.5 weeks before the new  structure takes effect. For major organisational changes concerning more than 20% of the personnel,  the authorities must also be informed 8–12 weeks prior to the change. In Estonia and Latvia, the  minimum notice period in restructuring situations is four weeks. The corresponding notice period in  Belarus is eight weeks. There are no collective agreements in these operating countries. In all its operating countries, Kesko applies the notice periods specified in local labour legislation. In  Finland, the notice period is from two weeks to six months depending on the duration of employment. Non-discrimination 406-1 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken There were no pending incidents of discrimination in 2017. Freedom of association and collective bargaining 407-1 Operations and suppliers in which the right to freedom of  association and collective bargaining may be at risk The freedom of association or the right to collective bargaining is not seen to be at risk in Keskos  operating countries within the EU (Finland, Sweden,  Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland) or Norway. Out of the total personnel, 44% are covered by collective agreements. So far, no binding industry-wide collective agreements have been drawn up in the Baltic countries and  Poland. The control of the association of suppliers employees in high-risk countries and corrective actions are  included in social responsibility audits. Human rights assessments 412-1 Operations that have been subject to human rights   reviews or impact assessments In September 2016, Kesko published its statement of commitment on human rights and impact assess- ment in compliance with the UN's Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The extensive survey involved listening to the views of customers, personnel and high-risk country  factory workers on human rights and on the implementation of human rights in K Group's operations.  The survey covered the customers of all of Keskos lines of business, and personnel in Finland. Surveys  in high-risk countries were carried out in China, India, Bangladesh and the Philippines. Read more  about Keskos commitment and impact assessment. In November 2017, Kesko followed up the assessment by publishing a study on working conditions in  the supply chain of grapes in Brazil, South Africa and India. The study showed that the human rights of  workers involved in the picking, packaging and transport of grapes are vulnerable to violations. Kesko  has proposed expanding amfori BSCI audits to cover also logistics in high-risk countries. Read more  about the study. FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 11  412-2 Employee training on human rights policies or procedures The K Code of Conduct guidelines include a section on human rights. The K Code of Conduct  eLearning programme targeted at the entire personnel had been completed by 8,867 people by the  end of 2017. Awareness of the K Code of Conduct is regularly promoted through communications and  training arranged by K Code of Conduct ambassadors. An article related to the #metoo campaign was  published in December 2017 on intranets in Keskos operating countries, noting the K Code of Conduct  guideline We treat one another equally and giving instructions on what to do if people notice  inappropriate behaviour at the workplace. Trainings in responsible purchasing continued in 2017. The trainings focused on the implementation  of human rights in global purchasing chains. A total of three trainings were organised in Finland for  people engaged in purchasing in Keskos grocery trade and building and technical trade. One training  was held for the personnel of the Kesko Onninen Purchasing Office in Shanghai, China.  The training  sessions discussed the amfori BSCI Code of Conduct principles, the assurance process in purchasing  from high-risk countries, and the social responsibility assessment systems approved by Kesko. The  trainings will continue in 2018. Public policy 415-1 Political contributions In election years, political parties and candidates are given equal opportunities to arrange campaign  events in the yards and entrance halls of K Group stores. In addition, Kesko may participate in  economic and tax policy seminars arranged by political parties, on content basis at its discretion and  without indicating partiality. Kesko does not make monetary donations to political parties. In 2017, Kesko did not participate in  political parties seminars subject to a charge and did not publish commercial advertisements in party  newspapers. Non-compliance concerning marketing communications 417-3 Incidents of non-compliance concerning marketing  communications Kesko constantly monitors the amendments to legislation and authorities recommendations related to  marketing communications and provides information about them to the staff responsible for marketing  in each unit. In 2017, there were no advertisements by Kesko or its subsidiaries submitted for consideration by  the Council of Ethics in Advertising or any incidents of non-compliance with legislation or voluntary  principles.   In June 2017, the Consumer Ombudsman imposed a prohibition order with a notice of a conditional  fine in a matter concerning Intersport Finland Oys offer marketing in 8/2016-1/2017. Kesko Senukai Lithuania received a caution from authorities in 2017 for sending direct marketing to  one customer who had prohibited it. Customer privacy 418-1 Substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer  privacy and losses of customer data In 2017, no information leaks or other personal data breaches were detected. Compliance 419-1 Non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and  economic area There were no non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and economic area in 2017.

Kesko's operations generate economic benefits for shareholders, personnel, retailers, suppliers of  goods and services and their employees and customers, as well as municipalities and states. The K Code of Conduct and reputation management Different aspects of responsibility, such as the ethicality of production and sourcing, the fair and  equal treatment of employees and environmental protection are increasingly important for customers.  Kesko's attitude to bribery and other malpractice is absolutely uncompromising. Responsible working  principles are essential for building trust between Kesko, K-stores, our customers and our business  partners. Public policy Kesko plays an active role in trade and industry organisations in Finland and in the European Union,  contributing its expertise to social development and legislative work. Kesko does not donate funds to  political parties. Customer privacy Customers' personal data is, for instance, processed in various personal data registers and online  stores' customer registers that are collected for the implementation of marketing activities. Further- more, Kesko manages and maintains the K-Plussa customer loyalty system, operated by K-chains and  K-Plussa partners. Using the information received from the K-Plussa customer loyalty system, we can  develop and tailor our operations to better suit our customers' needs.

The principles are the same for every  Kesko employee in all our operating countries. We also expect our business partners to operate  responsibly. Data protection policy   The data protection policy defines how Kesko Group strives for compliance with the law in the  processing of personal data and a high level of data protection in all of its operations and operating  countries. Monitoring and control systems Financial reporting and planning   Kesko's financial reporting and planning are based on the Kesko Group's management system.

FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 13  Risk management   Kesko has a uniform risk assessment and reporting system. Risk identification is based on business  objectives and opportunities and the defined risk appetite. Risks are prioritised on the basis of  their significance by evaluating their impact in financial terms and probability. When assessing the  impact of materialisation, the impacts on reputation, people's wellbeing and the environment are  considered in addition to the impact in euros. Risk management measures are assigned persons  in charge who are responsible for planning, implementing and monitoring the measures. The  measures defined are added in action plans and monitoring systems. Kesko's Internal Audit has  annually assessed the functioning and efficiency of Kesko's risk management system. Privacy protection   Personal data collected for various purposes on the grounds defined in the Finnish Personal Data  Act form separate person registers. For example, the customer information of K-Plussa cardholders  forms a customer database that is used, with the customer's permission, for managing customer  relationships, for customer contacts and the marketing purposes of the companies that have joined  the K-Plussa system. K-Plussa customers can prohibit the connection of product or product group  level information to their identified customer relationship. In compliance with the Personal Data  Act, the file description is available in Finnish at www.plussa.com.   Data controllers ensure that customer information is only used for the purposes specified in the file  description. Information on individual customers is secured by issuing instructions to personnel and  by using technical systems. Customer data is only disclosed to third parties if required by law.

We encourage our customers to make sustainable choices.   Topic Objective Progress of objectives 2017 Progress of objectives 2016 Progress of objectives 2015 Dialogue with  customers We constantly engage in dialogue  with customers in stores and social  medial channels. We conduct  surveys on customer satisfaction  and brand and utilise customer  views in the development of our  responsibility work.  Listening to our customers and utilising feedback  are key factors in Keskos strategy when it comes  to improving customer experience. We offer our  customers an easy-to-use digital feedback channel  Hymy. Some one million customer contacts happen  through Hymy each year.  We are testing Kyl, a new type of customer  community, to get our customers proactively involved  in the development of our operations and services.  Read more: Stakeholder perspective. In the spring of 2017, we conducted a qualitative  study concerning K Groups competitive advantage  and strong corporate responsibility to find out what  responsible and reliable operations of a trading sector  company mean to Finnish consumers. We used the  findings to further develop our operations. The human rights assessment generated invaluable  information for developing customer services. We  will investigate the possibility of implementing the  suggestions we received. We carried out an extensive study among grocery  trade experts, retailers, suppliers and K-Plussa  customers on the expected food trends and  phenomena of 2017. The significance of social media channels in customer  interaction has grown. In 2017, we will more actively  listen to our customers' opinions and carry out more  systematic and focused communication within social  media communities. As part of Kesko's human rights assessment, we  heard the stakeholders' views on how well they  thought human rights were realised, for example, in  customer service situations. The online questionnaire  was directed at both majority representatives as  well as special groups. Kesko was assessed as  slightly higher than the average Finnish company  in the materialisation of a variety of human rights  issues. However, the assessment given by special  groups was, with regards to certain aspects (e.g.  unrestricted access, accessibility, personnel diversity),  considerably poorer when compared to the answers  given by majority representatives.

In September, K-Rauta launched in Finland the  Remonttineuvonta renovation consultation service,  an example of a multichannel advice service for  customers. K Consumer Service responds to consumer feedback  concerning the own brand products (Pirkka, K-Menu,  Euro Shopper) and own imports of the grocery trade  division. In 2017, K Consumer Service gave 22,218  responses. Our key customer communication channels are  K Groups social media channels and Pirkka Media,  which comprises Pirkka magazine and the digital  channels Pirkka.fi and Pirkkas Facebook, Twitter and  Instagram. Pirkka magazine has a readership of 1.7  million (Kansallinen Mediatutkimus, a national media  survey, autumn 2016 / spring 2017). Customer feedback received through the new  customer feedback system, launched in summer  2016, increased significantly. The K Group's customer  magazine Pirkka was revamped.

Information about good products and responsible  actions was given in stores and marketing with the  help of the K-responsibility concept and its slogan  Lets do good. Together. Welfare We offer products and services that  promote health and wellbeing. In 2017, we began work to build a new health and  wellbeing store chain Hehku together with the  pharmaceutical distributor Oriola. Our goal is to  establish a chain of 100 Hehku stores and an online  store. If legislation changes, we will expand the  business to also include the sale of pharmaceuticals.  The first Hehku stores opened in January-February  2018. We joined the National Nutrition Council of Finlands  nutrition commitment by making a vegetable  commitment, which encourages K-food store  customers to increase their use of vegetables through  the following actions, which extend to year 2020:  By 2020, at least 400 K-food stores will have a  veggie shelf for vegetable protein products. In 2017,  250 K-food stores had dedicated veggie shelves.  We organise at least 250 vegetable-related  campaigns at K-food stores each year (2018-2020).  In 2017, K-food store chains organised 240 vegetable  campaigns.   We will add at least 50 new fruit or vegetable  products to our selections by 2020. In 2017, we added  55 new fruit and vegetable products to our selections.  In addition to the recipe search function, the K-food  mobile app gives the user suggestions about the  most popular recipes made with seasonal ingredients.  K-stores launched veggie shelves. The product  reformulation policy (less salt, sugar and fat) is to be  updated in 2017.  Cello indoor and outdoor paints received the Swan  label. Onninen Norway provides welfare technology- related solutions. Intersport organised sports training  during different seasons.  In 2015, K-ruoka.fi produced the Kevempi arki  customer programme consisting of recipes and ideas  that promote a healthier lifestyle and well-being.  Intersport's sports training offered expert tips,  inspiring content and exercise programmes for  people of different fitness levels.

In accordance with our plastics policy, we create  operating models that prevent plastics from  ending up in water bodies and elsewhere in the  environment. We strive to increase awareness of  the environmental impacts of plastic waste through  active communications in customer channels and at  our stores. In 2017, we removed environmentally  harmful microbeads from all our own brand cosmetic  products. During 2018, microplastics will also be  removed from all our own brand detergents. The  Pirkka ESSI circular economy bags were introduced  to K-food stores' shopping bag selections at the start  of 2017. The bags are made of over 90% recycled  materials, around half of which is plastic packaging  separately collected from households. In 2017, we took part in the second Ham Trick  campaign, where roasted ham fat is used to produce  renewable diesel. K-Citymarkets collected fat from  117,000 households, i.e. 81% of the total fat collected  in the campaign. We introduced two products in 2017 that reduce the  environmental load on the Baltic Sea: the Pirkka  fish patty, which is made from Baltic bream, and  the Pirkka Parhaat Benella Rainbow Trout, which is  farmed in Finland with feed made from Baltic herring  and sprat from the Baltic Sea. K Group has the most comprehensive neighbourhood  store network in Finland. We provide an extensive  and free charging network for electric cars. We  participated in the Kinkkutemppu campaign which  used the roasted ham fat to produce renewable  diesel. K-food stores participated in the Food Waste  Week campaign organised by the Consumers Union  Of Finland. At the start of 2017, Pirkka ESSI circular  economy bags were introduced in K-food stores.  K-food stores introduced shared vege shelves for all  vegetable protein products. We published our soy policy and committed to it; by  2020, all soy used in the production chain of own- brand products will be sustainably produced RTRS  or ProTerra certified soy. We published our plastics  policy and committed to introducing measures to  reduce the consumption of plastic bags. The K-responsibility concept theme \"Let's do  good. Together\" was an essential part of the  communication and marketing of the grocery trade,  as well as our building and home improvement stores  and agricultural stores. Our building and home  improvement stores offered their customers energy  efficient and environmentally friendly products and  services. K-food stores participated in the Food  Waste Week campaign organised by the Consumers  Union Of Finland. VV-Auto participated in the Finnish Transport  Agency's car scrapping reward trial. The range of  electric and hybrid cars available in car dealers  widened.

New features in the K-Ruoka mobile  application include product information and food  purchases via online store. We opened an entirely  redesigned online food store and new online stores  for Onninen and K-Rauta in Finland. In the car trade,  the Caara.fi service was complemented with a new  Caara Go service, where you can obtain a car for  temporary use, be it a month or a year, for a monthly  fee agreed upon beforehand. We launched Student K-Plussa, a loyalty programme  for higher education and university level students that  offers e.g. a 5% rebate on purchases at K-food stores.  Some 20,000 students joined the programme over the  first few months.  In the autumn of 2017, we began a collaboration  with the global online store operator Alibaba to sell  Finnish food brands in China. We export Finnish food  brands and our own Pirkka products to the growing  Chinese market. Almost 100 K-food stores nationwide offer locally  operating online grocery stores and click and collect  services. All K-Rauta stores have an online store  which also provides a delivery and click and collect  service. We developed the K-food mobile app  further. We developed a joint online store solution for  the business customers of building and home  improvement stores and Onninen. We launched a new  concept online: a used car store, Caara.fi. We opened a new K Digital unit and recruited  dozens of new digital experts. The five trainees that  completed the K Digital Trainee programme found  employment in various digital positions within the K  Group. Stores' click and collect services became more  common. We published a K-food mobile app, which  offers personalised benefits and shop-specific offers  and a smart shopping list. Sotka's online store was  opened. Management by  information Each K-store is customised to  meet its local customer demand by  utilising customer data. We created three new applications for all K-food  stores, which support store management by  information. New tools combined with our existing  customer data-based application that supports store- specific business ideas clearly improve the ability  to run stores based on customer insight and data.  The number of users for new tools aimed at store  management by information has tripled within a year. The retailers received a new application based on  customer data, among other things, that supports  store management and offers a tool for targeted  product ranges and marketing. We will revamp the K-food store chains. We will  revamp our entire hypermarket concept and all  K-Citymarkets by the end of 2018. We will revamp  the K-Rauta brand in all its countries of operation in  stages. Dozens of new ideas and operational models were  tested in K-Myllypuro over a year. The test store's  customers and customer jury were asked for feedback  on a regular basis. Based on customer wishes, the  test store became a K-Supermarket in August 2016.  The experiences gathered from the K-Myllypuro test  store were used in the planning of the renewal of the  K-Market chain. Using marketing based on customer  data, we offer our customers the  best customer experience in the  trading sector. We continued the systematic development  of K Groups marketing through marketing  process automation and increased investments  in the development and utilisation of marketing  technologies. Our objective is to utilise customer data  better in our marketing so we can offer our customers  a better, more personalised customer experience. In  2016, our own team of experts initiated programmatic  targeted marketing using customer data, and nearly  half of all digital marketing is now programmatic  marketing. We expanded the K Group's targeted marketing using  customer data and began carrying out programmatic  marketing relying on our own team of experts. Using  our customer data, we offer our customers more  personalised, interactive and multi-channel services.  The revamped K-Plussa loyal customer card ensures  personalised, targeted benefits for customers. We  developed the K-food mobile app further. Personalised marketing based on purchase history  means that customers receive benefits better suited  to them. After purchasing, customers receive service  messages, customer questionnaires or personalised  offers using their chosen channel.

The  estimate is based on the average breakdown of each euro spent on games in 2017. Due to the merger  of Finnish gaming companies on 1 January 2017, the figure is not comparable to the figures of previous  years. The estimate has been calculated by Veikkaus Oy. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the  Ministry of Education and Culture, and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health distribute the revenue  in its entirety to beneficiaries in Finland. 204-1 Proportion of spending on local suppliers Kesko assesses the economic benefit it generates by reporting its purchases by operating country  and the companys country of domicile. Kesko also reports both its own as well as K-retailers direct  purchases of goods in Finland. Most of the economic benefit generated by Keskos operations – approximately 84% of Keskos net  sales – flows to suppliers of goods, from which purchases were valued at 9.0 billion in 2017. The  purchases of all Kesko companies from suppliers operating in Finland totalled 5,821 million, account- ing for 65.0% (65.9% in 2016) of the Groups total purchases. In 2017, Kesko had around 26,300 suppliers and service providers from whom purchases were valued  at a minimum of 1,000 during the year. Of these, around 12,600 operated in Finland, around 10,900  in Keskos other operating countries, and around 2,800 elsewhere. The 10 largest suppliers accounted for 26.4% (24.3% in 2016) of the Groups purchases of goods, and  the 100 largest suppliers for 59.8% (54.4% in 2016). Of the 10 largest suppliers, seven were Finnish  food industry companies, one an import company operating in Finland, and two German car manufac- turers. The purchases of goods by Kesko Groups Finnish companies totalled 7,175 million. Of these pur- chases, 80.5% were from suppliers operating in Finland and 19.5% from other countries. It should be  noted that because some of the suppliers operating in Finland are import companies, reliable statistics  cannot be compiled on the origin of goods supplied by them.

In 2014–2017, Kesko and Ruokatieto ry, an association that promotes Finnish food culture, organised  Local Food Date (Lhiruokatreffit) events that bring together local food producers and K-retailers. The  purpose is networking as well as improving the supply of local products in the K-food stores in the area  and thereby supporting Finnish work. The 'Thank the Producer' operating model provides customers with an easy way to support Finnish  food producers. K-food stores had 10 'Thank the Producer' products in their selections, for which  KGroup paid more than 350,000 extra directly to the food producers in 2017. FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 26  Capital expenditure Keskos capital expenditure has a positive financial impact on the operations of building firms, building  sector service companies, and suppliers of fixtures, equipment and information systems, for example. In 2017, Keskos capital expenditure totalled 350 million (743 million in 2016), or 3.3% of net sales  (7.3% in 2016). Capital expenditure in store sites was 256 million (217 million in 2016). Capital  expenditure in foreign operations accounted for 14.5% (15.2% in 2016) of the total capital expenditure.  In 2016, Kesko Group acquired Onninen Oy, Suomen Lhikauppa Oy and Oy Autocarrera Ab. The  total capital expenditure on the acquisitions was 445.5 million. In addition to Kesko, K-retailers make capital expenditures in the fixtures of stores. These figures  included, K Groups total capital expenditure in Finland was around 423 million in 2017. GRI management approach Material aspects   Purchase practices Local presence has an impact on the whole of society The retail trade plays a significant role in local communities. It serves and employs local people. In  addition to the direct employment impact, the retail trade also employs a significant number of people  indirectly through suppliers and business partners. Retailers, supported by Kesko's district organisations, represent local activities. A K-retailer entre- preneur is responsible for his or her store's staff and customer satisfaction. Listening to the wishes of  local customers and making use of customer data, K-retailers put together a selection of products and  services that meet customer needs. We develop our business through interaction with our customers. Kesko purchases the majority of the products it sells from Finland and encourages K-retailers to  include locally produced products in their selections. The impact of Finnish products on employment is  significant; for example, Pirkka products are produced in 175 companies all over Finland. Policies and commitments Kesko's grocery trade and Kespro are committed to the grocery store chain's good trading practices.  Kesko requires that its business partners act in compliance with the K Code of Conduct. We add a  KCode of Conduct contract clause to agreements signed by Kesko Group companies under which the  Group companies purchase products or services from parties outside the Group. Monitoring and control systems Changes in the operating environment and in K Group are taken into account by adjusting objectives,  operating principles, monitoring systems and/or resources. Responsibilities and resources   K-retailers and K-Retailers' Association   Kesko's district organisations   Steering group for responsible purchasing and Kesko's buyers   Division Management Boards Programmes, projects and initiatives In September 2017, K Group began to offer a new nationwide student benefit, in which higher   education and university level students receive 10 times the normal Plussa benefit on purchases.  This means a 5% rebate on groceries bought in the previous month. The rebate is paid as Plussa  money. K Group wants to enable students to also make high-quality, sustainable consumer choices. In the renewal of the K-Rauta chain, discarded work clothes, flags and other textiles were collected  from 140 stores and recycled. Discarded work clothes from rebranded stores were processed into  material that can be utilised, for example, by the car industry.

We continued to employ young people by offering  summer jobs to approximately 5,000. As part of the  Finland's Mentors project, we carried out a K Trainee  Programme.  We surveyed views and opinions from current and  potential employees, as well as expectations towards  K Group as an employer and general expectations  of working life. Based on the findings, we redefined  our plans for improving employee experience and our  recruitment process. We initiated pilots to increase  agility in our work practices. We adopted a common  operating practice for mapping out employees career  aspirations, skills and competencies and willingness to  evolve and take on more challenging positions within  the company. The employee engagement index was 61%. The  percentage of employees who would recommend  the K Group as an employer has gone up to  68%, according to the personnel survey (56% in  the previous survey in 2014). In the Universum  Professionals survey, Kesko's ranking was 38. We continued to employ young people by offering  summer jobs to approximately 5,500 young people.  We organised a K Digital Trainee programme, and,  through that, employed five graduates in business  development jobs. Together with FIBS we conducted a diversity  management starting point analysis in Finland and we  will utilise its outcomes to develop our operations. We determined our employer promise and, in  accordance with it, we will develop, for example, our  cooperation with educational establishments and  reinforce our recruitment and induction processes. We launched the K-job programme, the purpose of  which is to provide those aged under 30 with channels  to find a job in the K Group. We particularly focused  on guiding Learn and Earn trainees, young people in  short-term work orientation, and summer employees.  In the Universum Professionals survey, Kesko's  ranking was 31.

GRI 404-3 We introduced a new performance management  model and K SuccessFactors, a system supporting  the model, for support functions in Finland, Sweden,  Norway and Russia. The model comprises target  setting linked to strategy and follow up, personal  development reviews and development plan, and  performance evaluation tied to performance bonus.  We will use the model to systematically guide the  performance of employees and the organisation to  implement our strategy, reward good performance,  develop employee competencies, support target  achievement, and prepare for future challenges. In 2017, we launch, in stages, the new performance  management model and the K Success Factors  systems that support it. Wellbeing at work  and occupational  ability We improve work motivation and  satisfaction. GRI 403-1, 403-2 The key focus area was to develop our Occupational  Health and Safety (OHS) operations through  management by information supporting business.  We systematically monitored key OHS indicators  and developed different areas from a business  perspective. We launched international OHS and  wellbeing principles in K Group.  We improved stress management skills among  personnel through mindfulness training. We  continued health training and introduced wellbeing  programmes directed at managers.   We launched common occupational safety principles  and operating models in Finland, and carried out  pilots to improve occupational safety. We streamlined  the labour protection organisation to reflect our  current operating premises and organisation  structure. The focal point of the wellbeing at work programme  was the comprehensive and business-oriented  development of OHS (Occupational Health and  Safety) operations. We enforced the monitoring of  key figures to improve proactive work and to support  management by information. Furthermore, we  implemented other proactive measures, such as new  health training. We also launched an occupational safety project  whose aim is to further develop our occupational  safety culture and shared operating models. We  also made labour protection more systematic and  developed the ways in which it is organised. We support our employees' leisure time fitness  activities in all our operating countries. The Finnish  companies, for example, provide vouchers for physical  exercise and cultural benefits. The focal point of the wellbeing at work programme  was to support employees' health and reduce  sickness absences, developing safety at work and  strengthening the role of labour protection as well as  promoting employee engagement and implementing  the people principles. We reduce sick leave, accidents at  work and premature retirement due  to disability. GRI 403-2 We continued to focus on decreasing sick leaves,  accidents at work and premature retirement due  to disability. Although the numbers for premature  retirement due to disability are well under control  considering the size of the company, we are paying  more attention to the management of risks for  occupational ability and the related costs. Training for the Let's Talk About Work operating  model is part of the occupational ability management  training for managers. We focused on reducing sick leave, accidents at work  and premature retirement due to disability. The Let's  Talk About Work training for managers continued and  over the last five years, more than 1,000 managers  have been trained. We piloted work induction services. We will reduce  sick leave in the long term with a project which has  a systematic take on labour protection and safety  at work. We developed a unified accident insurance  management model, which we will launch in 2017. We focused on reducing the number of sick leave and  premature retirements due to disability by means of  occupational health service activities, the Let's Talk  About Work training for managers, work revision,  occupational rehabilitation and the work done by  the Work Ability Manager working in the OHS  team. The Work Ability Managers activities support  the employees return to work, while considering  various options for continuing at work. Sick leave has  continued to decrease.

Read more in  Performance management and 404-3. The performance and development reviews were  used in all Kesko Group companies and operating  countries. The performance and development reviews  were carried out at least twice, in the spring and/or  in the autumn. In 2017, we launch, in stages, the new  performance management model and the K Success  Factors systems that support it. In the future, we will  record the development reviews in the K Success  Factors systems. Performance and development reviews apply to all  employees, and in 2015, they were carried out twice:  in the spring and in the autumn. The realisation of the  discussions was requested in the personnel survey  that was conducted in the beginning of 2016. The  response rate to the survey was 85%. A total of  80%  of employees that responded to the survey had had  their reviews carried out during 2015. We will regularly train our managers. GRI 404-1, 404-2 The consistent development of managerial work  continued in support of our strategy. Manager  training included the K Way training programme for  new and experienced managers, the international K  Way Middle Management Leader programme, and  training related to the performance management  model. A total of 727 managers took part in manager  training. We will continue to systematically develop  our training portfolio to meet future needs. In 2018,  we will update our manager training and expand the  concept to Poland and Norway. We continued the K-Way new managers training  programmes, K-Way experienced managers training  programmes and Let's Talk About Work training  programmes. In total, 363 managers participated in  these training programmes.  The topic for the new Mindfulness training was  understanding and training your own mind as well as  efficiency. 17 managers from Finland participated in  the training. The objective of the new K-Way Middle  Management Leader training programme was to  strengthen the skills for strategy implementation and  business competence. The training programme had a  total of 22 participants from all operating countries.  In Russia, we started a new K-Way Leader training  programme that aims to strengthen management  competence and managerial skills in the K Group. The  training programme was attended by 12 managers. In 2017, we will continue to organise the K-Way  managerial trainings and start a new development  programme for top management. We will continue  spreading the coaching and mentoring processes that  support managerial work. The emphasis was on the implementation of the K  Groups operating principles, challenging situations  faced by managers, leading a new team, effective  management and how to use the personnel survey  results to develop the team. The first training programme promoting the K Groups  new management culture was entitled K-Way new  managers and was piloted towards the end of the  year. Managerial training for Kesko's personnel was  taken a total of nearly 700 times. Online training  modules for managers were completed approximately  3,700 times.

In Finland,  employees on permanent, fixed-term and part-time contracts are offered the following:   Occupational health care   Insurance against occupational injuries and occupational diseases   Parental leave   Retirement benefits   Versatile shopping benefits in K Group stores and staff stores for both employees and Kesko  pensioners In all operating countries, Kesko supports its employees leisure activities in different ways. The Finnish  companies, for example, provide benefits for physical exercise, cultural activities and work commute.  Some of the companies operating in Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania also give financial support to  their employees through different situations in life, such as when a child is born, during a child's first  year at school, in the event of the death of a close relative and in other special situations. Employees  are also provided with a diverse range of shopping benefits that apply in K Group stores and staff  shops. A company phone and car are also provided if required for the job. Performance bonuses and share compensation plan The performance bonus schemes cover the entire personnel, with the exception of sales assistant jobs  and jobs covered by other types of bonus or commission systems. The indicators of the performance  bonus scheme include, for example, the Groups and the divisions operating profit, the sales and profit  of the employees own unit and customer satisfaction or market share. Depending on role, personal  performance bonus targets may also be set. In spring 2017, around 11.4 million (11.5 million in 2016)  was paid in Finland in bonuses under the 2016 performance bonus schemes, accounting for approxi- mately 3.0% (3.7% in 2016) of the total payroll. In 2017, the total remuneration paid in the form of performance bonuses, sales commissions and other  corresponding monetary remuneration was as follows:   In Finland, 18.1 million (14.5 million in 2016)   In the other operating countries, 5.2 million (8.3 million in 2016) The maximum performance bonus amounts vary depending on the profit impact of the persons role  and are equivalent to 10-67% of the persons annual salary. Kesko operates a share-based compensation scheme for some 140 members of management and  other specified key personnel. Keskos share-based compensation scheme comprises three share- based incentive plans, which were communicated in a stock exchange release on 2 February 2017. The  Performance Share Plan (PSP) consists of individual annually commencing share plans, each with a  two-year performance period and a two-year commitment period following the payment of the poten- tial share award. The Bridge Plan is a one-off, four-year plan aimed at covering the transitional phase  from Kesko's previous long-term incentive scheme to the new incentive scheme adopted in 2017, with  a two-year performance period. The PSP and the Bridge Plan are complemented by a Restricted Share  Pool (RSP), a plan that consists of annually commencing share plans. Each RSP includes a three-year  commitment period, after which the potentially granted share awards of the individual plan will be  paid to the participants in Keskos B shares, provided that the participants employment or service  relationship with Kesko Group continues until the payment of the awards. In February 2017, the Board decided to grant a total of 192,822 Company B shares to 130 members of  Keskos management and other key personnel based on the fulfilment of the performance criteria for  the 2016 performance period of the share plan. Pensions New pensions were granted to 291 people (271 in 2016) in Kesko Group in Finland. The figure includes  employees retiring on part-time pensions, partial disability pensions and rehabilitation benefits in addi- tion to those who retired on old-age pensions and disability pensions.

Rehabilitation benefits were granted for the purpose of retraining or work trials to 111  people (87 in 2016) who were at a clear risk of losing their working capacity within a few years. The  average retirement age of employees in 2017 was 56 (60 in 2016). Notably, the average retirement age  for old-age and disability pensions was 62. In the other operating countries 29 (28 in 2016) employees  retired. Occupational health and safety 403-1 Workers' representation in formal joint management-worker  health and safety committees Labour protection activities are arranged separately for each company, region or place of business in  compliance with local legislation. Labour protection activity in Finland has been made more effective  by testing regional committees and by combining worker health and safety committees in the Greater  Helsinki region in preparation for the move to common operating premises. Outside the Nordic coun- tries, labour protection matters are handled by OHS (Occupational Health and Safety) committees.  Kesko's HR functions arrange occupational safety training for Kesko employees and K-retailers. Group  companies also arranged training sessions tailored to their specific needs. 403-2 Types of injury and rates of injury, occupational diseases, lost  days, and absenteeism, and number of work-related fatalities Within Kesko Group, the occupational health service's normal operations include providing advice  and counselling related to employees health and wellbeing at work, analysing health risks related to  work and preventing illnesses, and providing treatment – even in the event of serious illnesses – in  collaboration with primary health care practitioners and specialist health care providers. In Finland,  12,600 (15,000 in 2016) Kesko Group employees were covered by Keskos own occupational health  services. Kesko's occupational health service purchases occupational healthcare from one provider for  employees in Finland outside the Greater Helsinki area. Centralised and target-oriented management  enables consistent content and operating methods in occupational health service. In other countries,  occupational health care is arranged in compliance with local legislation and practice. A total of 6.2 million (7.5 million in 2016) was spent on occupational health care in Finland in 2017.  Kela (the Social Insurance Institution) reimbursed Kesko for approximately 3.5 million (3.7 million  in 2016) of this sum. In 2017, Keskos occupational health service spent 494 (499 in 2016) per  employee on maintaining employees working capacity and providing medical care.

We piloted trainings on LEAN and Agile development meth- ods for management and managers, organised morning sessions for the whole personnel discussing  the latest trends in digital development, and set up a digital agent network for the K-Rauta chain to  support the implementation of digital services and tools at the stores. We developed a new training portal for store staff: all training available can now be easily found in  K-Academy. We developed customer service in the building and technical trade through a Rautaliiga  programme for retailers and staff. For B2B sales, we developed an ABC programme for sales staff in  Onninen Express. The Master Sales Assistant customer service and sales training for all chains was organised for  the 57th time. Store personnel were also offered vocational training and the opportunity to obtain  vocational qualifications. Our acquisitions were also reflected in competence building. By the end of 2017, 407 Siwas and  Valintatalos had been converted into K-Markets. Each transfer entailed plenty of training for both the  retailers and the staff. Future K-food retailers are trained in our K-food retailer training. In 2017, 66 new retailers completed  the K-food retailer training. As the number of K-Markets grew, there was also an increasing number  of retailers who were in charge of multiple stores, and we designed and launched a specific Luotsi  leadership training programme to support them. 40 retailers took part in the training during the latter  part of the year. The programme will continue on 2018. We promoted the continuous development of existing retailers' competences by offering supplemen- tary training. Internal job rotation opens up possibilities for various careers options. In Finland, approximately 1,992  (4,837 in 2016) internal transfers took place in 2017, while the combined figure for the other operating  countries was 2,637 (2,923 in 2016) (figures excluding internal transfers within K-Market Oy). In Finland, K Group's recruitment is supported by the K Trainee and retailer coaching programmes.  The seventh K Trainee programme began in May 2017 with 12 trainees, who have obtained permanent  positions via the programme. Distribution by education at 31 Dec. 2017, %   404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and  career development reviews Performance and career development reviews and performance assessment of key personnel are  carried out at all Kesko Group companies and operating countries. In the performance and career  development reviews, the performance of the past period is evaluated and targets are set for the  upcoming period, including a discussion on the development of the employee, managerial work and  the working community. The implementation of performance and career development reviews was  surveyed in conjunction with the personnel survey conducted at the end of 2017. The response rate to  the personnel survey was 71%. Of the respondents, 80% had discussed their objectives and develop- ment with their manager during the past year. The objective of performance evaluation is to give feedback on performance in the previous year,  support the person's development and encourage enhanced performance. Uniform evaluation criteria  enable equitable evaluation of performance and competence for all employees.

FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 35  Job satisfaction The personnel survey is one of the key tools for developing internal operating practices and developing  the quality of managerial work. The whole personnel is given the chance to take part in the survey: the  Groups common personnel survey is conducted simultaneously within the Kesko Group and some of  the K-stores in Finland and other operating countries. A separate survey has been created for stores  that do not take part in the Groups common survey, covering the same issues but comprising less  questions. The survey seeks to identify the commitment of personnel to the organisation, the operating methods  that enable good work performance, the implementation of our shared operating principles, the  occupational wellbeing of personnel, and satisfaction with the work of immediate managers and  management. The survey results are used as the basis for agreeing upon development measures,  which are integrated into the annual operational and personnel plan and the implementation of which  is monitored. We made changes to our personnel survey in 2017, adopting a new system that enables result  monitoring both at group level and flexibly based on unit needs. In 2017, 13,400 employees from all our  operating countries took part in the personnel survey (71% of target group). Results showed positive  development in all eight question categories. Diversity and equal opportunity 405-1 Diversity of governance bodies and employees Equal opportunities, justice, non-discrimination and equality are important principles that are observed  at Kesko. Kesko Corporation and its subsidiaries in Finland draw up statutory company-specific  HR, training, equality and non-discrimination plans and define objectives for improvement. At the  beginning of 2017, Kesko established the TASY gender equality working group in accordance with  the non-discrimination plan, tasked with handling matters related to non-discrimination and equality  within the Group. The working group includes representatives of the employer, personnel and labour  protection functions. The working group analyses recruitment, career development and training,  remuneration and the reconciliation of work and family life. Of Kesko employees in Finland, 55.5% were women and 44.5% were men. In the other operating  countries, the figures were 46.7% and 53.3%, respectively. In Finland, the average age of employees  was 37 in 2017. In the other countries, the average age of employees varied from 35 to 46 years.   Lengths of employee careers: under 10 years 66% and over 10 years 34% in Finland and 83% and  17% respectively in the other countries. Long careers are not rare: 1,173 employees have worked at  Kesko for over 25 years.   Two of the seven members of Keskos Board of Directors were women.   Two of the nine members of the Group Management Board were women.   In the subsidiaries engaged in retailing in Finland, the proportion of women in managerial duties  was significant: 89% of the department managers at K-Citymarket hypermarkets were women.   At the end of 2017, 46% of all managers in Finland were women (46% in 2016) and 54% were men  (54% in 2016). The corresponding figures for other countries were 47% and 53%, respectively. In recent years, K Group has initiated projects to employ members of special groups:   In 2012, the K-Retailers' Association started a project named Many kinds of performers in  collaboration with the Finnish Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (FAIDD).  A permanent operating model was created for employing people with developmental disabilities.  Many of the people with developmental disabilities who were employed as part of the project are  still working at K Group.   In 2013, Kesko and the K-Retailers Association launched the Youth Guarantee in K Group  programme, which aimed to provide a job, a work trial or an apprenticeship in K Group by the end  of 2014 for 1,000 young people under 30, who were at high risk of social exclusion. The target  group also included young immigrants and young people with disabilities. The employment of  young people and special groups continues as a permanent operating model. The support for  Keskos managers and retailers in issues related to employing young people and special groups was  moved to Keskos centralised service centre in 2017. By the end of 2017, more than 3,800 young  people from the target group had received a position in K Group with the help of a work trial, pay  subsidy or apprenticeship training. FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 36  Equal opportunity for men and women 405-2 Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men The average annual salary of Kesko employees was 40,275 in Finland, 44,385 in the other Nordic  countries, and 11,680 in the Baltic countries, Russia, Poland and Belarus. As the Kesko Group  operates in many lines of business, the average salary is not a good indicator of salary level or struc- ture. The wage groups and tables specified in the collective agreement are applied to jobs covered  by the agreement, such as sales assistants and warehouse workers. Salaries are also influenced by  role-based responsibility bonuses, years of experience and the cost-of-living category of the locality.  Besides the role and its requirements, the salary of a senior clerical employee is determined by  competence, experience, performance and results. Equality in remuneration is considered as part of  annual company-specific equality plans. Gender is not a factor which influences remuneration, and no  significant differences between comparable jobs have been detected. Equality plans strive to promote  pay equality in jobs where comparisons can be made.

GRI 414-1, 414-2 A total of 157 of Keskos suppliers' factories or  plantations underwent full amfori BSCI audits. In  addition, 146 suppliers factories or plantations  underwent amfori BSCI follow-up audits.  At the  beginning of 2018, Keskos suppliers in high-risk  countries had a total of 423 valid social responsibility  audits. Two responsibility trainings were arranged for the  ICA Global Sourcing (IGS) suppliers: 24 suppliers  took part in the Hangzhou training in China and 23  suppliers in the Delhi training in India. As part of our  cooperation with Plan International Finland, three  amfori BSCI supplier trainings were arranged in  Bangkok, Thailand. A total of 25 suppliers from the  Thai fishing industry took part in the trainings. Continuing our human rights assessment we  conducted a review of working conditions in the  supply chain of grapes in collaboration with the Trade  Union Solidarity Centre of Finland (SASK). 210 BSCI full audits and 60 BSCI re-audits were  conducted in the factories and farms of Keskos  suppliers in high-risk countries. At the beginning of  2017, Keskos suppliers in high-risk countries had a  total of 386 valid social responsibility audits. The  social responsibility of the production of Keskos  grocery trade's own direct imports from high-risk  countries was 100% assured. Kesko Onninen Purchasing Office (KOPO) started  operations in Shanghai, China. Keskos grocery  trade and ICA Global Sourcing launched a sourcing  cooperation in the home and speciality trade. As part of the human rights assessment, we  conducted a human rights survey at factories in  high-risk countries in cooperation with the Trade  Union Solidarity Centre of Finland (SASK). The  country-specific reports by SASK provided valuable  information for the development of our operations.  We forwarded the information received to BSCI in  order to develop the audit procedure.  Kesko's suppliers in high-risk countries had 200  factories or farms within the scope of the BSCI  process. 107 BSCI full audits and 80 BSCI re-audits  were conducted in the factories and farms of suppliers  in high-risk countries. The social responsibility of  the production of Kesko's grocery trade's own direct  imports from high-risk countries was 100% assured. We continued our work related to the human rights  impact assessment. We published the manufacturing  plants of private label and own import clothes,  accessories, shoes and bags operating in high-risk  countries on our website. FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 40  Topic Objective Progress of objectives 2017 Progress of objectives 2016 Progress of objectives 2015 We assure the responsibility of the  ingredients (Tier 2) of private label  Pirkka and K-Menu food products. GRI 414-1, 414-2 The responsibility of ingredients used in 150 new  Pirkka and K-Menu food products was assessed  using our own risk analysis tool. Based on the risk  analysis, 20 products contained ingredients which  require further investigation in terms of the social  responsibility of the producer. Our analysis of ingredients in our own brand products  received recognition at the annual meeting of amfori  (previously Foreign Trade Association, FTA). Thanks  to the risk analysis, Kesko was elected among the top  three finalists of the FTA member of the year award. We continued work in order to assure the  responsibility of ingredients in the own-brand grocery  products. We conducted ingredient risk assessments  on 160 new Pirkka or K-Menu food products. Among  these, 29 products contained ingredients which  require further investigation in terms of responsibility. Using the risk assessment tool, we started the process  of assuring the responsibility of the ingredients of  Pirkka and K-Menu products. We established the  origin of the ingredients of 1,923 own-brand grocery  products. Among these, 233 contained ingredients  which require further investigation concerning the  responsibility of the ingredient manufacturer based on  the risk assessment. We identify and take account of  water risks in our supply chain. Our water risk assessment work continued and we aim  to use the results to plan actions. The water risk assessment is in progress and the aim  is to use the results to plan actions. We initiated a water risk assessment for our own  brand products in order to identify the water basins  most affected by water scarcity and contamination  issues in our supply chain.  The target is to conclude  the water risk assessment in 2016. Statements and  policies Fish and shellfish: The selections  of Keskos grocery trade and K-food  stores do not include species on the  red list of the WWFs fish guide.  Keskos grocery trade and K-food  stores promote green list species  in their selections. When making  decisions concerning selections, we  favour sustainable stocks of fish and  MSC- and ASC-certified suppliers.  KGroup's fish and shellfish policy  has been in effect since 2008. The retail selection of Keskos grocery trade included  196 MSC-certified fish products, of which 41 were  Pirkka products and 1 K-Menu product. Our selections  had 7 ASC-certified products, of which 4 were Pirkka  products.  Kespros HoReCa selection had a total of 304 MSC- certified products, of which 30 were Menu products.  Kespro's selection had 10 ASC-certified products, of  which 2 were Menu products. The retail selection of Keskos grocery trade included  178 MSC-certified fish products, of which 37 were  Pirkka products. Kespro was granted MSC and ASC  traceability certificates. All stages of Kespros fish  and shellfish supply chain have been audited, and  Kespro and its certified customer restaurants can use  the MSC and ASC ecolabelling in their marketing.  Kespros HoReCa selections included nearly 300  MSC- and ASC-certified products, and the number  continues to grow. Kespro's Menu range had more  than 25 MSC-certified products and 2 ASC-certified  ones. The Pirkka range included 41 MSC-certified fish  products. Palm oil: By 2020, all palm oil in  our own brand groceries will be  responsibly produced (CSPO). Some 82% of the palm oil in Kespros Menu food  products sold in 2017 was sustainably produced  (CSPO), of which 0.2% was Identity Preserved, 74.3%  Segregated, 20.7% Mass Balance, and 4.9% RSPO  credits. Some 43% of the palm oil in Pirkka and K-Menu food  products sold in 2017 was sustainably produced  (CSPO), of which 19% was Segregated, 79% Mass  Balance, and 2% RSPO credits. Approximately 34% of the palm oil in our own brand  groceries (Pirkka, K-Menu and Kespros Menu) was  certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO). Approximately 20% of the palm oil in the Pirkka food  products was certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO).

The policy  concerns ingredients of soy origin  in grocery trades own brand food  products and soy fodder used in the  production of products of animal  origin. We reviewed the share of responsibly produced soy in  our own brand food products and their supply chain.  The soy used in our own brand food products (Pirkka,  K-Menu and Kespros Menu) sold in 2017 and their  supply chain was not yet responsibly produced. We were a founding member in the Finnish soy  commitment group, which started operations in  February 2016. The members of the Finnish soy  commitment group pledge to ensure that by 2020 all  the soy used in the production chain of their private  label products will be responsibly produced, and be  either RTRS or ProTerra certified. The commitment  covers both the Finnish production chain and sourcing  from other countries. We joined the Round Table on  Responsible Soy (RTRS) and thereby committed to  promote responsibility in the production chain of soy  on a long-term and target-oriented basis.  The objective was added in 2016. Timber and paper: By 2025, there  will be only sustainable origin  timber and paper products in  Kesko's product range. Timber  and paper products will be FSC or  PEFC certified or made of recycled  materials. In the grocery trade, the  policy applies to our own brand  products. In 2013, Keskos building and technical trade was  awarded the PEFC certificate, which covers sawn pine  and spruce timber and processed timber as well as  the wholesale distribution of MDF boards in Finland  (percentage-based method). The average PEFC  certification percentage in 2017 was 89.7% for pine  and 85.5% for spruce. Of the timber and paper products in the grocery  trades Pirkka and K-Menu ranges, 54% contained  sustainable raw material. In Kespros Menu range, 14%  of timber and paper products contained sustainable  raw material. The average PEFC certification percentage was 91.2%  for pine and 84.6% for spruce. We are investigating  the opportunities to expand the timber policy to cover  the entire Group. The PEFC certification percentage is announced  monthly at Kesko's web pages.

We create  operating models that prevent  plastics from ending up in the  environment. We seek alternatives  to plastic as a packaging material. By  means of consumer communications,  we will increase the sales share of  alternative shopping bags (cotton  bags, reusable bags and jute bags)  and cardboard boxes to 10% by  2025. We look for solutions to  replace PVC as a material. We removed environmentally harmful microbeads  from all our own brand cosmetic products. During  2018, microplastics will be removed from all our own  brand detergents. The Pirkka ESSI circular economy  bags were introduced to K-food stores' shopping  bag selections at the start of 2017. The bags are  made of over 90% recycled materials, around half of  which is plastic packaging separately collected from  households. By the end of 2017, small thin plastic bags  were only available at checkouts by request for e.g.  flowers. We reduced the consumption of small plastic  bags by 20% in 2017. We successfully piloted the new wood fibre-based  EcoFishBox produced by Stora Enso in K-food stores.  Since 2017, K Group gift cards have been made  from PVC-free materials. In Onninen Express stores  in Finland, regular customers have been handed  shopping baskets that the customers can use to carry  products to their construction site and bring back the  next time the visit the store. We published our plastics policy in October 2016 and  pledged to implement measures aiming at reducing  the use of plastic bags. Plastic bags have been subject  to a charge in the K Group's grocery stores as well as  building and home improvement stores, and, at the  beginning of 207, they became subject to a charge  in the agricultural and machinery stores as well as in  furniture stores. By the end of 2017, thin small plastic  bags will no longer be available at the checkout. Our  selections offer alternatives to plastic bags; reusable  bags, cotton bags, jute bags as well as paper bags  and bags made of recycled plastic. The share of paper  bags in the sales of all different shopping bags was  approximately 1.5% and that of reusable bags was  approximately 1.5%. In spring 2017, we included the  Pirkka ESSI circular economy bags made by Amerplast  Oy in our selections. They are manufactured from  plastic packaging waste recycled by households  through the Rinki eco-points. We will discontinue the  use of microplastics in our private label cosmetics  brand products in 2017. The packaging of our private  label cosmetics does not contain PVC. We will  discontinue using PVC as the material for Keskos gift  cards in 2017. We will work to eliminate PVC from the  material of the K-Plussa card in 2017. More reusable bag alternatives were added to the  grocery store selections: a new Vallila design, a  Summer Day bag, and a Red Nose Day bag.

High-risk countries typically produce clothing and home textiles, shoes and other leather goods, fur- niture, interior decoration items, tools, sports equipment, toys, agricultural products (such as coffee,  tea, cocoa, fruit, vegetables, wines) and canned fish, fruit and vegetables. Kesko annually publishes on its website a list of factories that operate in high-risk countries manufac- turing Keskos own-brand clothing and shoes to be directly imported by Kesko. The list is updated once  a year, most recently on 31 August 2017. Social responsibility audits of suppliers in high-risk countries Kesko is a member of amfori, a leading global association dedicated to promoting open and sus- tainable trade. Kesko takes part in amfori BSCI and recommends the use of amfori BSCI audits in  the assessment of social responsibility of suppliers in high-risk countries. Kesko also accepts other  assessment systems of social responsibility if their criteria correspond to those of amfori BSCI auditing  and if the audit is conducted by an independent party. As part of the sourcing cooperation between Keskos grocery trade and ICA Global Sourcing, Kesko  also accepts the ICA Social Audit. In that case, however, suppliers are required to adopt a third-party  auditing approved by Kesko after a maximum of two ICA audits. The social responsibility auditing systems accepted by Kesko are listed in the section Monitoring and  control systems. Some of Keskos suppliers are themselves amfori members and thus promote amfori  BSCI audits in their own supply chains. At the beginning of 2018, the factories and farms of Keskos suppliers in high-risk countries had:   291 (start of 2017: 274) valid amfori BSCI audits   15 (start of 2017: 13) valid SA8000 certifications   30 (start of 2017: 24) valid SMETA audits   45 (start of 2017: 24) valid ICA Social Audits   22 (start of 2017: 22) valid SIZA audits   11 (start of 2017: 11) valid Fairtrade certifications   2 (start of 2017: 5) valid ICS audits   5 (start of 2017: 11) valid ICTI CARE certifications   1 (start of 2017: 2) valid WRAP certification   1 valid WIETA certification Keskos principle in high-risk countries is to collaborate only with suppliers that are already included in  the scope of social responsibility audits or that start the process when the cooperation begins. Keskos  grocery trade requires all of its suppliers in high-risk countries to have been audited. It will not enter  into collaboration with new suppliers unless they have passed an acceptable audit.

In addition, 146 (2016: 60) suppliers factories or plantations underwent amfori BSCI  follow-up audits. The results of the 2017 amfori BSCI audits of Keskos suppliers factories and farms are shown below.  The majority of the deficiencies occurred in management practices, observance of working time  regulations, and matters related to occupational health and safety. Corrective actions and monitoring  are included in the audit process. In accordance with the amfori BSCI operating model, a full audit is  conducted at factories every two years to assess every sub-area of the auditing protocol. If a factory  receives an audit result of C, D or E, a follow-up audit within 12 months must be arranged to assess the  deficiencies identified in the full audit and the corrective measures implemented to address them. Kesko does not terminate cooperation with a supplier that undertakes to resolve the grievances  specified in the audit report. In 2017, Kesko decided to terminate cooperation with six factories due  to ambiguities related to social responsibility. A consensus could not be reached with the factories  regarding necessary corrective actions.

Fairtrade products Kesko's grocery trade has an extensive collaboration agreement with Fairtrade Finland. The K-food  trade chain concepts and K-retailers determine the selections of Fairtrade products at store level.   In 2017, Kesko's grocery trade selections included 300 (2016: 367) Fairtrade products, of which 37  (2016: 36) were Pirkka products and 4 (2016: 7) were Kespro's Menu products.   In 2017, the products sold by Kesko's grocery trade generated Fairtrade premiums for social  development projects amounting to 719,225 (2016: 649,459). In 2017, the products generating the largest Fairtrade premiums were Fairtrade flowers (271,672),  coffee (224,537) and fruit (142,975). According to Faitrade statistics, the Fairtrade coffees sold by  Kesko grocery trade in 2017 employed approximately 800 small-scale coffee farmers on Fairtrade's  terms. Kesko and Plans collaboration in Thailand Kesko and Plan International Finland, an organisation promoting childrens rights, cooperate to  improve the responsibility of the Thai fishing industry and the position of migrant workers. The  collaboration has been agreed for the period of 2015-2018, and it is part of a larger project funded by  the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and the American Richard and  Helen DeVos Foundation in Thailand and Cambodia. The project aims to improve the working conditions of Cambodian migrant workers, as well as  education and protection for their children in Thailand. The collaboration with Plan also improves the  transparency of the supply chain of Keskos fish products. As part of the project, two learning centres were established for children of migrant workers in the  Rayong and Trat provinces in 2015. The learning centres provide the children with the skills they need  to attend public schools in Thailand and support them in continuing their studies. In 2017, 50 girls and  38 boys aged between 4 and 17 were registered at the learning centres. The project helped 40 girls and  60 boys move onto public schools in Thailand. Between 2015 and 2017, a total of 944 children have  registered at the learning centres and 212 children have moved onto public schools. Amfori BSCI training for suppliers continued in 2017: there were two general training sessions and one  advanced-level training in Bangkok. A total of 25 suppliers from the Thai fishing industry took part  in the trainings. The general training covered the amfori BSCI Code of Conduct, UN and ILO human  rights and labour conventions, and the Thailand national labour protection legislation. The advanced  training gave the suppliers tools for their own promotion and supervision of social issues. Supplier  training will continue in 2018. Read more about our collaboration with Plan. Supplier training in China and India Kesko and the Swedish ICA have worked together on sourcing via ICA Global Sourcing (IGS) in Asia  since 2016. The cooperation concentrates on the sourcing of home and speciality goods sold at K-food  stores. Assuring the social responsibility of suppliers factories and securing product quality form a  central part of the purchasing process. IGS has offices in China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Bangladesh and  India. The local IGS corporate responsibility team is, together with Kesko, in charge of assuring the  social responsibility of factories. In 2017, responsibility training was arranged for IGS suppliers in Hangzhou, China and Delhi, India. The  training covered Keskos social responsibility requirements for suppliers, the factory auditing process,  and requirements related to product quality and safety. Questions from the suppliers concerning  responsibility were also addressed. 24 suppliers took part in the Hangzhou training and 23 suppliers in the Delhi training. Representatives  of IGS and Keskos responsibility unit were also present. Read more about our cooperation with IGS. Risk assessment of ingredients in Pirkka and K-Menu food products Keskos objective is to identify the entire supply chain of products and to assure the social responsibil- ity of their ingredients. The work to analyse the origins of the ingredients of Pirkka and K-Menu food  products and related risk analysis began in 2015 and continued in 2017. The responsibility of ingredients used in 150 new Pirkka and K-Menu food products was assessed in  2017 using our own risk analysis tool. Based on the risk analysis, 20 products contained ingredients  which require further investigation in terms of the social responsibility of the producer. Between 2015  and 2017, a risk analysis has been conducted on the ingredients of 2,233 own brand food products. In summer 2017, Keskos risk analysis of ingredients in its own brand products received recognition at  the annual meeting of amfori (previously Foreign Trade Association, FTA). Thanks to the risk analysis,  Kesko was elected among the top three finalists of the FTA member of the year award. The study of the ingredients of own brand food products will continue in 2018. Based on the results,  we intend to decide upon ingredient-specific follow-up measures to promote the sustainability of the  supply chains of Pirkka and K-Menu products.

Manufacturers of Keskos own brand food products must have  international certifications that assure product safety. The standards approved by Keskos grocery  trade include: BRC, IFS, FSSC 22000 and GlobalGAP. In 2017, the total number of certified suppliers  was 581 (561 in 2016). This number also includes old audits conducted according to Keskos grocery  trades own audit guidelines. A total of 7,350 product samples were analysed (7,770 in 2016). Most of them were related to the  product development of own brands. A total of 2,395 own control samples were analysed (2016:  2,387). When developing own brand products, Keskos grocery trade pays special attention, in line with its  strategy, to the health aspects of the products. As proposed in The EC White Paper on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity-related Health Issues,  sugar, saturated fat and salt were reduced in more than 150 Pirkka products during the period  2007–2013. The health aspects of new Pirkka products are taken into account at the product develop- ment stage. The National Nutrition Council of Finland published its nutrition commitment operating model in June  2017. The nutrition commitment is the Finnish contribution to the EU Roadmap for Action on Food  Product Improvement frameworks reformulation programme. K Group joined the nutrition commitment by making a vegetable commitment, which encourages  K-food store customers to increase their use of vegetables through the following actions, which extend  to year 2020:   By 2020, at least 400 K-food stores will have dedicated veggie shelves for vegetable protein  products. In 2017, some 250 K-food stores had a veggie shelf.   We will organise at least 250 vegetable-related campaigns at K-food stores each year (2018–2020).  In 2017, K-food store chains organised 240 vegetable campaigns.    We will add at least 50 new fruit or vegetable products to our selections by 2020. In 2017, we  added 55 new fruit and vegetable products to our selections.  In 2016 and 2017, a study on the likelihood of food fraud was conducted and a fraud control plan was  prepared (Vulnerability Assessment and Critical Control Points, VACCP). 77 threats of fraud were  identified. Six of them were assessed to be critical control points, which are analytically monitored by  fraud control on a regular basis, in addition to normal product and supplier assurances. In 2017, there were 140 product recalls in Keskos grocery trade (99 in 2016). Of these, 33 were Keskos  grocery trades own brand products (26 in 2016). In the other cases, Product Research assisted the  manufacturers in recalls. There were 4 public recalls involving a potential health hazard resulting from  product flaws or defects in Keskos grocery trades own brand products in 2017 (2 in 2016). K-Rauta had two (1 in 2016) and Onninen three (4 in 2016) recalls in 2017. Konekesko had one public  recall in 2017 (0 in 2016), which constituted the only public recall for the building and technical trade  division that year. In 2017, there were no legal proceedings or fines related to product health or safety. Marketing communications and product information 417-1 Requirements for product and service information and labelling On the product labelling of its own brand products and imports, Kesko complies with all related  legislation.

As  ingredients, meat and dairy are labelled in accordance with the national decree MMM 218/2017. In addition to statutory package labelling, voluntary labelling can be added to inform the consumer of  matters related to corporate responsibility. Such labelling may include organic labels and ecolabelling,  as well as labelling indicating social responsibility. The own brand products of Keskos grocery trade bear material symbols on their packaging. These  symbols help and guide consumers to recycle packaging materials. Chemicals that are hazardous to  the environment have warning labelling in accordance with the CLP regulation. 417-2 Incidents of non-compliance concerning product and service  information and labelling Engine software adjusting nitrogen oxides In September 2015, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) uncovered engine software that adjusted nitrogen oxides in Volkswagen Groups type  EA 189 cars with 1.2 litre, 1.6 litre and 2.0 litre diesel engines. As far as the brands represented by VV-Auto are concerned, the number of such cars in Finland was  identified at 53,000. The case applies to all of the brands imported by VV-Auto: Volkswagen, Audi,  SEAT and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles. The recalls and repairs of Volkswagen, Audi and SEAT 2.0, 1.6 and 1.2 litre EA 189 diesel cars (SEAT  service campaign) proceeded at the planned schedule in Finland in 2017. By the end of the year, a software update was available for all of the approximately 53,000 cars, and  some 47,000 cars (88.4%) had been fully updated. After the corrective measures, the cars meet the requirements of the EU5 emissions standard. The  corrective measures do not affect the car's fuel consumption, engine power, CO2 emissions, driving  behaviour or acoustics. Product recalls resulting from defective product labelling On the product labelling of its own brand products and imports, Kesko complies with EU and Finnish  legislation. In 2017, there were 39 product recalls resulting from defective product labelling (24 in 2016), of which  9 (7 in 2016) were Keskos own brand products.

The principles are based on national labour protection legislation and corresponding conventions of  the International Labour Organization (ILO), which are applied when national legislation does not  correspond to the same level. In its operations, Kesko pays special attention to human rights issues  and working conditions in its supply chain and, in monitoring these, primarily focuses on suppliers  in high-risk countries. In accordance with the amfori BSCI (Business Social Compliance Initiative),  high-risk countries are countries and areas where there is a risk of human rights and workers' rights  violations. The classification is based on the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators. Kesko and K Group stores are responsible to the products' end-users for ensuring that the products  comply with all the requirements of Finnish and EU legislation, are safe for users and meet quality  and other promises. Kesko's product labelling and marketing communications comply with legislative  requirements and the recommendations of authorities. Kesko and K Group stores want to support customers in making sustainable choices and offer a wide  selection of products with responsibility criteria. Kesko's policy on chemicals applies to home textiles, clothing, leather goods, shoes and upholstered  furniture. Based on EU and Finnish legislation, it lists the chemicals which are prohibited or the  quantity of which is restricted in the products supplied to Kesko. In addition, for substances of very  high concern, Kesko sets restrictions that are stricter than those set in legislation. Keskos plastics policy promotes recycling and the reuse of plastics. The objective of the operating  model is to prevent plastics from ending up in bodies of water and elsewhere in the natural environ- ment. Various product group-specific responsibility policies and statements, such as the palm oil policy,  the fish and shellfish statement, the timber and paper policy, and the stand on the sandblasting of  jeans, have been prepared to support purchasing operations. Programmes, projects and initiatives   'Principles and Practice of Socially Responsible Trading' guide Responsible choices are communicated to customers in stores according to the K-responsibility  concept within-store communications, such as shelf labelling and product labelling. The selection and  marketing policies of organic, eco-labelled and Fairtrade certified products are included in K-food  stores' chain concepts. The K responsibility concept is in use in K-food stores and K-Rauta stores. In 2016, Kesko joined the amfori BSCI Sustainable Wine Programme programme. The programme  focuses on improving the social responsibility and environmental responsibility of wine production and  its goal is to increase transparency and traceability in wine production.

The objective was set in 2016 Logistics emissions We will reduce the emissions of  Kesko Logistics transports relative  to the net sales index by 10% by  2020 from the 2011 level. GRI 305-5 The relative emissions had decreased by 16.2% from  the base level. In 2017, emissions decreased by 11.2%  compared to 2016. The decrease was impacted by  new emission factors, which include diesels bio  component share. Emissions decreased even though  transport kilometres increased. As in 2016, this can be  attributed to the increased number of stores resulting  from the acquisition of Suomen Lhikauppa and the  conversion of the stores to K-Markets. The relative emissions had decreased by 1.9% from  thebase level. In 2016, emissions increased by 3.8%  compared to 2015. The increase in emissions can  be attributed to the increased number of stores  caused by the acquisition of Suomen Lhikauppa. At  first, only Keskos own brand Pirkka products were  delivered to the new stores and as the conversion of  the stores to K-Markets advanced, refill loads were  delivered to the stores as separate deliveries. Relative emissions have decreased by 5.5% from the  starting level due to new solutions in transportation  management and fleet organisation.

Food waste Keskos grocery trade aims to  minimise the food waste resulting  from its operations and utilise  inevitably accumulated organic  waste. By 2020 we will reduce  identified food waste relative to  sales by 10% from the 2013 level. Food waste K-food stores have reduced food waste by 7.1% from  the 2013 base level. Some 90% of K-food stores donate edible food  products they no longer can sell to local charities,  which then distribute the products as food aid to  those in need. The amount of food products donated  increased by nearly 930,000 kg from the previous  year. K Group and Gasum cooperate in producing biogas  from inedible food waste from K-food stores. Food  waste unfit for human consumption is now collected  from 200 K-food stores and Kesko Logistics central  warehouse and made into biogas, which is then used  as energy in the manufacture of new Pirkka products.  Approximately 4,000 tonnes of organic waste  was transformed into 3,000 MWh of biogas. CO2  emissions were reduced by 594 tonnes compared to  natural gas and by 800 tonnes compared to fuel oil. By the end of 2016, K-food stores had reduced  identified food waste by 3.5% from thebase level. Approximately 90% of K-food stores work together  with local charities. The amount of food products  donated increased by 1.8 million kg from the previous  year. We continued cooperation with Gasum, Myllyn  Paras and Wursti to utilise biogas produced from  inedible organic waste collected from retail stores as  energy in the manufacture of new Pirkka products. In  2016, approximately 3,700 tonnes of organic waste  was transformed into 2,800 MWh of biogas. CO2  emissions were reduced by 550 tonnes compared to  natural gas and by 740 tonnes compared to fuel oil. We started acooperation with Gasum, Myllyn Paras  and Wursti to utilise biogas produced from inedible  organic waste collected from retail stores as energy in  the manufacture of new Pirkka products. Many K-food  stores donate food to charity.

The waste  recovery rate for stores included in the circular  economy agreement in Finland was 100%. In the renewal of the K-Rauta chain, discarded work  clothes, flags and other textiles were collected from  140 stores and recycled. Discarded work clothes from  rebranded stores were processed into material that  can be utilised, for example, by the car industry. In Finland, the recovery rate was 99% and in other  operating countries, it was 48%. The waste recovery  rate of retail stores in southern Finland covered by the  waste management agreement was 100%. The waste recovery rate in the grocery trade was  99%, in the home improvement and speciality goods  trade 99.4%, and in the car trade 99.9%. In other  operating countries, the waste recovery rate was 46%.  The waste recovery rate of retail stores in southern  Finland covered by the waste management agreement  was around 98%. Biodiversity K Fishpaths collaboration with  WWF Finland: We will remove  at least 50 barriers preventing  endangered migratory fish from  swimming upstream and create  at least 100 spawning grounds in  Finland between 2017 and 2021.  We will increase awareness of the  endangered nature of migratory fish  and arrange volunteer events. GRI 304-3 The K Fishpaths collaboration between Kesko and  WWF Finland was launched with an extensive media  and social media campaign in August 2017. We  promoted the collaboration with the slogan Mating  belongs to all. On social media, the launch campaign  reached 900,000 people, and volunteer events  received good coverage in local media. In autumn 2017, we cleared nine barriers in rivers and  streams around Finland and created 40 new spawning  grounds for endangered migratory fish. We carried  out restoration work together with local operators and  volunteers at six locations. We opened up a total of  20,000 metres of new spawning grounds and habitat. The K Fishpaths collaboration will continue and  expand in 2018. The objective was set in 2017. The objective was set in 2017. FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 56  Energy 302-1 Energy consumption within the organization Kesko participates in mitigating climate change by increasing renewable energy purchases and own  production and increasing energy efficiency. Renewable electricity Kesko has purchased electricity produced with 100% renewable energy from the beginning of 2017  in Finland. Kesko purchased 504 GWh of electricity for use in K-stores and other Kesko properties in  2017 with Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) from the Nordic countries. In 2017, the  purchased electricity was produced with Finnish bioenergy, which utilises by-products from the forest  industry and wood based fuels, for example. Solar power plants at K-stores Since 2016, Kesko has made significant investments in the construction of solar power plants. By the  end of 2017, Kesko had 19 solar power plants on the rooftops of store properties it manages. A total of  3.0 GWh of electricity was produced with solar power for use in its own stores in 2017. The combined  power output of the solar power plants is approximately 5.5 MWp. If three K-retailers' own solar  power plants are included, K Group is the biggest producer and consumer of solar power in Finland.  Investments in solar power utilisation will continue.

The total area of the property portfolio decreased by  4% due to the divestment of Indoor Group. The majority of properties used district heat, but in addition 3.3% of the heat energy was self-pro- duced. In 2017, the heat energy produced with natural gas and oil at properties in Finland totaled 39.52  TJ (11 GWh). The electricity consumption of Kesko in Finland includes only electricity purchased by Kesko. Heat  consumption is reported for all properties managed by Kesko. Calculation methods and electricity and  heating consumption statistics by property type and changes in properties in Finland are available in the  Energy consumption tracking and Environmental profile reports. Energy consumption in properties in other operating countries The heat energy was partly self-produced with natural gas and oil. In Belarus, a small amount of timber  (1,467 MWh) and peat (102 MWh) were also used for heating. In addition, a total of 4,055 MWh of  electricity was produced with oil in Russia. In 2017, the fuels used for self-produced heat and electricity  totaled 130.7 TJ (36.3 GWh). Subsidiaries outside of Finland report their fuel and purchased energy consumptions to Kesko and  statistics per country are compiled from this data. The heat energy data is not reported for some  properties (6%, and store sites of Onninen Sweden and Norway) because it is included in the lease or  data is not available. Primary energy consumption The primary energy consumption for purchased energy in all operating countries in 2017:   Renewable: 2,315 TJ (63%)   Nuclear power: 79 TJ (2%)   Non-renewable: 1,262 TJ (35%) FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 57  Fuel consumption of logistics in Finland The energy consumed by Kesko Logistics' own transportation or that under its direct control was 645  TJ in 2017 (503.9 TJ in 2016). The fuel used was diesel. In 2017, the total distance driven by Kesko  Logistics was 34.9 million km (32.3 million km in 2016). Energy consumption was calculated using data on kilometres driven, volumetric efficiencies and the  transportation fleet. The calculation was made according to the Lipasto calculation system of the VTT  Technical Research Centre of Finland. Fuel consumption of logistics in other operating countries Most of Keskos subsidiaries have outsourced logistics operations. In 2017, the logistics in Estonia and  Belarus consumed 25.3 TJ of fuel (diesel and gasoline). Total energy consumption In 2017, Keskos energy consumption in all operating countries totaled 4,173 TJ. A total of 835.2 TJ of fuels from non-renewable sources were used for transportation as well as  self-produced heat and electricity of properties.

In accordance with the agreement, K Group commits to reducing its energy consumption by  7.5% through various energy saving measures. All K Group store chains are included in the agreement.  At the time of publication of the Annual Report, installed solar energy and the known reported actions  will allow annual energy savings of 12.4 GWh, which is 29.6% of the interim target for 2020 and 15.8%  of the target for 2025. During the previous trading sector energy efficiency agreement for the period 2008–2016, K Group  was committed to improving its annual energy consumption by 65 GWh by the end of 2016. Due to  determined actions K Group was able to surpass the target and improve its energy efficiency by 67  GWh. FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 58  1. Lighting LED lights are used in all lighting solutions of property development projects. Adjustable, correctly  directed LED-lighting can help save up to 60% of electricity consumed compared to traditional  fluorescent tube and metal halide lighting solutions. 2. Lids and doors on refrigeration units In food stores, the consumption of refrigeration systems can account for more than half of the  total electricity consumption at small store sites. Lids on freezer chests save 40% of the electricity  consumed by uncovered equipment. Doors on dairy and juice cabinets also help save electricity. 3. Real estate managers Kesko has around 45 Real Estate Managers to help K-stores find ways in which to make their energy  consumption more efficient. Regular monitoring, technical supervision and comparison of reports  from different properties are used to maintain an optimal level of energy consumption. Real Estate  Managers also help stores with long-term planning. Renovation programmes contain estimates of the  refurbishment that should be made within five to six years. 4. Remote monitoring In February 2017, the building automation of 214 Kesko facilities was monitored by a remote energy  management centre. The set points of properties and equipment running hours can be changed from  the management centre as necessary, which also enables rapid response to disturbances. Setting the  correct running times and set points is the easiest and most effective way to improve energy efficiency.  Remote monitoring enables refrigeration equipment to be adjusted for optimum temperatures and  defrosting cycles. In addition, deviations can be responded to immediately. 5. Condensation heat recovery Condensation heat from refrigeration equipment is recovered at nearly all K-food stores, which means  additional heat energy is needed only during very low sub-zero temperatures. Increasingly many K-food stores also save energy by using carbon dioxide recovered from industrial  processes as the refrigerant in their refrigeration equipment. Carbon dioxide is an environmentally  friendly refrigerant. 6. Solar power Solar power plants are becoming more widely used on the rooftops of K-stores. The electricity  consumption of food stores is greatest during the summer, when the stores and their refrigeration  equipment require a lot of electricity for cooling. On a sunny summer day, solar power can cover as  much as 60% of the food store's current consumption. The solar panels installed on K-food store roofs cover around 10–15% of the stores annual electricity  consumption. The life cycle of a solar power plant is as long as 35 years. Modern technology enables  solar power production even in overcast weather and during wintertime.

However, due to the large consumption of imported processed  goods and the virtual water footprint associated with them, almost half (47%) of the water footprint  of Finnish consumption falls outside of Finland. Keskos most significant impacts from water consump- tion are thus caused by imported products for sale which originate from areas suffering from water  scarcity or contamination. Kesko has initiated a water risk assessment for its own brand products in order to identify the water  basins most affected by water scarcity or contamination issues in its supply chain. The water risk  assessment is in progress and results will be used to plan actions. 303-1 Water withdrawal by source Properties managed by Kesko use water from municipal water supplies in all operating countries. In  addition, a few wells are in use on properties in Estonia, Lithuania and Belarus. However, water from  these wells accounts for only a minor portion (3%) of total water consumption and is thus reported  with the municipal water consumption. Waste water from Kesko's operations goes to municipal sewer  systems.

Maintaining a high level of  hygiene is particularly important in food stores and legal requirements for hygiene must be fulfilled.  Car wash facilities at Neste K service stations in Finland are big individual consumers of water. The consumption of water at Finnish properties increased in 2017 especially in shopping centres,  VV-Autotalot and K-Supermarkets. Water consumption statistics by property type and changes in the  property portfolio in Finland are available in the Energy consumption tracking report. The divestment of the grocery trade business in Russia at the end of 2016 resulted in a significant  decrease in water consumption in Russia in 2017. The water consumption data from other countries  is compiled from figures reported by the companies, which are based on water billing or consumption  data. At some stores located in leased properties, water consumption is included in the lease and data  is not available for reporting (4% of locations in other operating countries). Consumption data is also  not available for Onninens store properties in Sweden and Norway. Biodiversity Kesko has identified biodiversity impacts and opportunities in its operations. The objective is to reduce  adverse biodiversity impacts in the supply chain and to take part in projects that promote biodiversity  in cooperation with other operators. Kesko participates in the Business & Biodiversity Finland  programme, organised jointly by the Corporate Responsibility Network FIBS and the Ministry of the  Environment Finland. 304-2 Significant impacts of activities, products, and services on  biodiversity Supply chain Keskos greatest impacts on biodiversity occur throughout the lifecycle of the products on sale. Raw  materials critical to biodiversity in Keskos supply chain include fish and shellfish, timber, palm oil, and  soy. Their sustainable sourcing is guided by sourcing policies. Read more about the objectives of the  sourcing policies in our responsibility programme. In April 2017, Kesko added the Pirkka fish patty to the selections of K-food stores. The Pirkka fish  patty is made from bream caught in John Nurminen Foundations Local Fishing Project, which aims  to promote sustainable fishing. Baltic bream has not been used as extensively in consumer products  before. The use of bream effectively reduces the environmental burden on the Baltic Sea. Plastics K Groups objective is to reduce plastics ending up in water bodies and elsewhere in the environment.  K Group is creating operating models to promote the recycling and reuse of plastic. In its plastics policy K Group commits to measures to reduce the consumption of plastic bags. In 2017,  Kesko removed microbeads from its own brand cosmetic products.

Food waste and climate change Minimising food waste throughout the whole food chain from agriculture all the way to the end  consumer reduces the need for primary production and thereby impacts on biodiversity. When food  ends up in waste, all environmental impacts and emissions from its production, transportation, sales,  storage and preparation have been useless. Climate change also impacts biodiversity, especially as areas of drought expand.

Of Finnish  migratory fish, the maraena whitefish, salmon, trout and eel are endangered. Their situation is dire  because obstacles in rivers and streams are preventing the fish from swimming to suitable spawning  grounds. The swimming of fish upstream can be stopped by a single culvert or an old mill dam. The objective of the K Fishpaths collaboration is to remove such obstacles in a spirit of cooperation  with local operators, landowners, K-retailers and volunteers. The removal of a single obstacle may  help open up several kilometres of flowing watercourses suitable for spawning.  In addition to obstacle  removal, the collaboration also involves restoring spawning grounds and habitats for migratory fish. It  is estimated there are tens of thousands of such barriers in Finland. K Group and WWF Finlands objective is to remove at least 50 barriers and to create at least one hun- dred spawning grounds for endangered migratory fish in Finland between 2017 and 2021. K Fishpaths  also aims to increase awareness of the endangered status of migratory fish, and to organise events for  volunteer work. In 2017, nine barriers in rivers and streams around Finland were removed and 40 new spawning  grounds for fish created. Restoration took place together with local operators at the Ingarskilanjoki  river in Inkoo, Syvnoja in Suomusjrvi, Koirajoki in Tuusniemi,  Unterniskanjoki in Imatra, Vaalimaan- joki in Luumki and Juottimenoja in Perni. As a result, a total of 20,000 metres of new spawning  grounds and habitat were opened up. Read the NGO perspective by WWF Finland. Store sites Kesko builds store sites only in areas planned by municipalities for business properties. Surveys of con- taminated land are made annually in connection with construction work and real estate transactions. In  2017, two Kesko sites were restored. A soil remediation project was carried out at one of Keskos sites in Vantaa, where a total of approx- imately 4,049 tonnes of contaminated soil was removed from a 16,700 m2 lot. The remediation work  was completed when the target concentrations set by the Uusimaa ELY centre were achieved; in other  words, when soil exceeding the higher reference values had been removed from the site. Concentra- tions of contaminants which exceeded the lower reference values but remained below the remediation  targets still exist in some areas of the walls and bottoms of excavations. A carwash is being planned for  the site, so the contaminant levels that exceed the lower reference values will not require any further  action based on the current use of the lot.  Another Kesko site underwent soil remediation measures in Turku. A total of 2,299 tonnes of soil that  contained elevated levels of hydrocarbons were removed from a 6,072 m2 lot. Based on the residual  concentration samples taken from the excavation sites, the north edge of the property still had soil in  which the higher reference values for hydrocarbons were exceeded. A bentonite mat was installed as  an insulating structure at the pipeline on the wall. The other residual concentration samples did not  contain hydrocarbons exceeding the reference values. The soil remediation work was carried out in  accordance with the principles agreed on with the City of Turku Environmental Protection Department,  and no further environmental engineering measures are necessary in the area. Kesko does not have protected habitats of its own.

Emissions from logistics in the other operating countries were reported for Belarus and Estonia in 2017.  Most of the logistics in the other operating countries are outsourced. The transportation of goods for Kesko's grocery trade in Finland is managed by Kesko Logistics and  includes its own transportation and that under its direct control. Kesko Logistics emissions were cal- culated based on data including kilometres driven, volumetric efficiencies, and the transportation fleet  using the Lipasto calculation system developed by the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The  emissions for logistics operations in Belarus and Estonia were calculated based on fuel consumption. Scope 2 Kesko has purchased electricity produced with 100% renewable energy from the beginning of 2017  in Finland.

The emissions from purchased electricity for the other operating countries increased by approximately  13% due to emission factor updates, although electricity consumption decreased significantly due to  the divestment of the grocery trade in Russia in 2016. The calculation principles and more detailed calculations for Scope 1 and 2 emissions attributed to  properties managed by Kesko can be found in the Environmental profile reports for Finland and the  other operating countries. 305-3 Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions SCOPE 3 GHG EMISSIONS Tonnes CO2e 2017 2016 2015 Upstream Purchased goods and services 7,698,000 6,910,000 5,936,000 Capital goods (buildings) 33,500 35,200 18,200 Indirect emissions of purchased energy   (other than Scope 1 and Scope 2) 30,900 49,400 69,300 Transport and distribution of goods  14,400 18,400 18,300 Waste 10,300 11,400 9,000 Business travel  3,100 3,000 2,700 Employee commuting  20,800 21,000 6,700 Downstream Customer commuting (shopping trips)  164,900 157,400 154,400 Use of sold products 1,771,000 1,685,800 852,900 End-of-life treatment of sold products 38,600 36,500 16,300 Franchises (retailer entrepreneurs) 102,700 114,700 22,800 The greatest other indirect emissions of Kesko are caused in the supply chain of the products for sale  (78%), in the use phase of the products (18%) and by the shopping commutes of customers (2%).

The emissions targets set in line with two degree climate warming were approved in June  2017. Kesko commits to reduce its direct and indirect (Scope 1 and 2) emissions 18% by 2025 from base  year 2015. In addition, Kesko is committed to reduce its supply chain emissions so that 90% of its key  suppliers will set their own GHG emissions reduction targets by 2025.  In 2017, the direct and indirect emissions had increased by 14% from base year 2015, due to the  acquisitions of Suomen Lhikauppa and Onninen in 2016. Out of Keskos key suppliers of 2016, 33%  had set their own emission reduction targets by the end of 2017. Renewable energy and energy efficiency Since the beginning of 2017, Kesko has purchased electricity produced with 100% renewable energy  in Finland and invested in solar power plants on the rooftops of its stores in the past few years as well.  Read more in the Energy section. K Group participates in the 2017–2025 action plan of the commerce sector Energy Efficiency Agree- ment and is committed to reducing its energy consumption by 7.5% through various energy savings  measures. During the trading sector energy efficiency agreement for the period 2008-2016, K Groups target was  to improve its annual energy consumption by 65 GWh. Due to determined actions K Group was able  to surpass the target and improve its energy efficiency by 67 GWh. Logistics The target of Kesko Logistics is to reduce CO2 emissions relative to the net sales index by 10% during  2012–2020 from the 2011 base year. By the end of 2017, the relative emissions had decreased by 16.2%  from the base level. In 2017, the emissions decreased by 11.2% in comparison to 2016. The decrease in  emissions was affected by new emission factors, which include the biocomponent of diesel fuel. The  emissions decreased while the driven kilometres increased, which was due to the increase in the num- ber of stores resulting from the acquisition of Suomen Lhikauppa and their conversion to K-Markets  similar to the previous year. Kesko Logistics works ambitiously to reduce emissions:   Efficiency of logistics: centralised distribution, optimisation of delivery routes and high volumetric  efficiency   Efficient reverse logistics: collection of purchase loads, carrier trays, pallets, roll containers and  recycled bottles and cans on the return route   Economical driving courses: all of Kesko Logistics more than 500 contract drivers have been  trained   New replacements in the vehicle fleet: eleven two-tier trailers and one extra-long HCT Ecotruck  in use in long-distance transportation between main warehouses; in 2018 two new HCT-trailers will  be added FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 64  EFFICIENT LOGISTICS FLEET Scope 3 emissions reductions Products for sale By far, the greatest indirect emissions of Kesko are caused in the supply chain and during the use  phase of the products for sale. These emissions can be influenced by offering selections of products  and services causing less emissions and by customer communications. Grocery trade Customers are increasingly aware of the environmental impacts of their consumption choices. By  reducing the amount of animal-based products and household food waste consumers can reduce  the environmental impact of their food consumption. Vegan products increased in popularity in the  shopping baskets of Finns in 2017. The number of plant-based Pirkka products increased by 16 new  products in 2017 and the selection now numbers over one hundred. By the end of 2017, around 250  Efficient logistics fleet Traditional full-trailer combination 90 roll containers 120 roll containers 189 roll containers Two-tier trailer combination Extra-long Ecotruck K-food stores already had a 'Veggie shelf\", which gathers plant-based products in one place to make  choosing environmentally friendly products easier for the customer. Additionally, the K-Ruoka media  offers diverse recipes and tips for cooking vegetarian meals. K Group and Gasum cooperate to produce biogas from inedible food waste collected from K-food  stores. The inedible organic waste from around 200 K-food stores and the Kesko Logistics central  warehouse  is utilised as energy in the manufacture of new Pirkka products. In 2017, approximately  4,000 tonnes (3,700 tonnes in 2016) of organic waste was transformed into 3,000 MWh (2,800 MWh  in 2016) of biogas. CO2 emissions were reduced by 594 tonnes compared to natural gas (calculated  with emission factor 198 g CO2/kWh) and by 800 tonnes compared to fuel oil (calculated with emis- sion factor 267 g CO2/kWh). The cooperation is rapidly growing into a nationwide operating model as  the network of biogas plants expands. In 2017, K Group participated again in the Ham Trick campaign, in which customers could donate fat  from roasting their Christmas hams to collection points at K-food stores. The fat was used to make  renewable diesel. A total of 44 tonnes of ham fat was collected, of which around 81% was collected at  K-Citymarket stores. Read more about our work to reduce food waste. Building and technical trade The building and technical trade offers consumers and business customers diverse product selections  and expertise for improving the energy efficiency of building and renovation projects. The K-Rauta  stores and Onninen offer environmentally friendly solutions for homes and properties from practical  energy saving tips to intelligent energy management systems solutions. These include heating, cooling,  solar and wind energy solutions. Car trade In February 2018, the selection of VV-Auto included six plug-in hybrid car models (PHEV) and two  electric cars. In addition, the selection included seven car models using natural gas or biogas as fuel.  In 2017, the registrations of Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche plug-in hybrids in Finland increased 54.1%  compared to the previous year. FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 65  Customer shopping commutes The emissions caused by customer shopping commutes are a significant source of indirect emissions  for Kesko. The majority of shopping commutes are made by car. Kesko is building an extensive network of electric vehicle charging points adjacent to K Group stores in  order to progress the electrification of cars. In February 2018, already 23 K Group stores and 13 Neste  K service stations offered a total of 121 electric and hybrid charging points for customer use. The aim is  to build charging stations at all Neste K stations and 10–15 charging stations at K-Citymarket parking  lots annually during the next few years. K Group has the largest private network of electric vehicle  charging points in Finland. K Group offers Finlands most comprehensive network of neighbourhood stores with the best services.  The stores are tailored to each stores own customer demand. When the nearby neighbourhood store  offers a selection suited for its customers, shopping commutes are shortened and they can be travelled  more often by foot, bicycle or public transportation, especially in cities. The extra services available at  K-stores reduce emissions caused by customer commuting, because many errands can be run during  the same shopping trip. Increasingly, online shopping also reduces customer commuting. Employee commuting and business travel In December 2016, a survey on commuting to work was conducted for the Helsinki area office workers  by using the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) commuting calculator. According to the survey, the  average emissions per employee were 8.8 kg CO2/working day. The results of the survey will be used  as a basis for developing the employee commuting for Kesko's new K-kampus main office building. An  employee commuting plan will be made in order to encourage commuting to the K-kampus which is  sustainable and improves the wellbeing of employees. At the end of 2017, Kesko had 668 company cars in use in Finland (690 in 2016).   2 ethanol-fueled cars (6 in 2016)   329 petrol-fueled cars (312 in 2016)   336 diesel-fueled cars (370 in 2016)   1 natural gas car (2 in 2016) According to Kesko's company car policy, Keskos company cars have an emission level below 150 g  CO2/km. Since December 2017, the employees pay share will be discounted by 10% of the tax value if  the emission level of the company car is below 105 g CO2/km. In 2017, the average emission level was  122 g CO2/km (122 g CO2/km in 2016) and the emissions from company cars totalled 2,477 CO2 tonnes  (2,648 CO2 tonnes in 2016). This calculation also includes private use of company cars. In 2017, the air miles of Kesko employees travelling for business totalled 9.8 million (8.2 million in  2016). Encouraging the use of virtual meetings is one of the ways Kesko endeavours to decrease the  amount of air travel. The amount of virtual meetings held via the Skype for Business application has  increased by approximately 3% since the previous year. In 2017, a total of 69,858 hours of Skype  meetings were held (67,842 hours in 2016). At the end of 2017, the Kesko Group had 28 Videra video  conferencing facilities in use and the total duration of all video meetings between two or more facilities  was 1,494 hours (1,793 hours in 2016). 305-7 Nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur oxides (SOX), and other  significant air emissions The electricity and heating energy consumed in properties managed by Kesko in Finland in 2017  caused: 134 tonnes of NOx emissions (130 t in 2016) 119 tonnes of SO2 emissions (115 t in 2016) 0 tonnes of radioactive waste (1.2 t in 2016) The calculation principles and more detailed calculations are available in the Environmental profile  report. The figures for 2016 have been adjusted for improved accuracy since the last report. Only CO2  emissions data is collected for transportation of goods. Effluents and waste Circular economy Shifting to a circular economy requires increasingly efficient circulation of materials. Kesko provides  customers with diversified recycling services for waste and discarded items and develops innovative  circular economy solutions in cooperation with other operators. Recycling services for customers In December 2017, there were 399 Rinki eco take-back points intended for recycling consumer pack- ages (fibre, glass, metal) in connection with K-food stores. Plastic was collected at 173 eco take-back  points (160 in 2016). Since January 2017, Pirkka ESSI circular economy bags have been made from  plastic recycled by customers. In connection with K Group stores, customers can also return deposit beverage containers, batteries  and accumulators, WEEE, lead accumulators, impregnated timber and discarded clothing for recycling.

K Groups goal is to minimise the food waste resulting from its operations  and utilise the inevitably accumulated organic waste. Our objective is to reduce identified food waste  relative to sales by 10% from the 2013 level by 2020. K GROUP FOOD WASTE HIERARCHY Food waste prevention K Groups primary means of reducing food waste is selection management. K-food stores maintain  selections that suit their customer base, and complement the selections through forecast-based  requirements planning. Efficient transport and store logistics, self-control system and staff training  also help to prevent wastage. The optimisation and continuous development of packaging features  play a key role in reducing wastage. At the store Stores are instructed to pay special attention to the expiration dates of fresh foods and foods with  short expiration times.

The deregulation of store opening hours in Finland in 2016 has had an  impact on food waste: as stores are open for longer, sales are steadier and there is less wastage. Food donations Some 90% of K-food stores donate edible food products they no longer can sell to local charities,  which then distribute the products as food aid to those in need. In 2017, the amount of food products  donated increased by nearly 930,000 kg. Some food waste is also given to farms for animal feed. Energy from organic waste K Group and Gasum cooperate in producing biogas from inedible food waste collected from K-food  stores. By the end of 2017, organic waste was being collected from 200 K-food stores and the Kesko  Logistics central warehouse. The biogas produced is transmitted to Gasums gas network, and then  utilised as energy in the production of new Pirkka products. As the biogas transmission network  expands, the operating model is quickly becoming nationwide. In 2017, some 4,000 tonnes of organic waste was turned into some 3,000 MWh of biogas, with three  manufacturers of Pirkka products included in the operating model.

K Group's key business partners are also expected to  observe corresponding environmental management principles. Environmental management is part of K Group's management system and is based on the ICC Business  Charter for Sustainable Development, environmental management standards, as well as requirements  set by legislation and the authorities. Kesko is committed to UN's Global Compact initiative and Sustainable Development Goals. Monitoring and control systems Kesko Group's Corporate Responsibility Advisory Board defines the main policies for environmental  work and the target levels. The divisions specify the main policies of their environmental work into  environmental action programmes which support their business operations. The action programmes  are monitored and updated annually as part of the strategy work. Kesko's maintenance partners monitor the energy consumption of properties with the help of the  EnerKey.com system supplied by Enegia Oy. Enegia remotely reads energy consumption measurement  terminals located in properties and records the data in the database by the hour. The consumption  figures for properties where the data are collected manually are also saved in the EnerKey system. The  EnerKey programme responds to even minor location-specific changes in consumption and sends an  alarm to the person in charge. Water consumption monitoring is part of consumption monitoring in the properties. Kesko's goal is to  maintain a high level of water consumption efficiency in all operations. Environmental systems at Kesko All of Onninen's operations in all operating countries are ISO 14001 certified. The operations of Kesko Logistics are ISO 14001 certified. In the food stores and the building and home improvement stores, environmental management is  based on the K-responsibility concept. For K-Citymarkets, K-Supermarkets and K-Markets, the K-re- sponsibility concept is a requirement for inclusion in the chain. A K-responsibility concept inspection is  carried out every three years at the K-Rauta stores by an independent external partner.

The materiality assessment guides Keskos corporate responsibility  work and stakeholder work and defines actions to meet stakeholder expectations. Keskos material corporate responsibility topics are presented in the matrix below, where the vertical  axis shows the level of concern for stakeholders and the horizontal axis the current or potential  economic, environmental or social impact of Kesko's operations. The level of concern for stakeholders  has been assessed as a whole, which is why the stakeholder specific weightings are not reflected in the  matrix. The materiality assessment was last updated in 2012. In 2017, the material topics for reporting were  defined in compliance with the requirements of the new GRI standards. The identified topics are  included in Keskos current materiality assessment, and no need was seen to update the materiality  matrix.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals are a worldwide action plan – the 2030 UN Agenda – to end  poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. We promote the UN Sustainable Development Goals in our strategy and sustainability work. Our  operations contribute to all of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. We have recognised three goals as most material for our operations and stakeholders: SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production at Kesko encompasses sustainability throughout  supply chains, selections, customer communications and use of products. SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth includes issues such as compliance with the K Code of  Conduct and Kesko as a responsible employer of 25,000 employees in eight countries. Management of  human rights in supply chains as well as promoting domestic production in Finland contribute towards  SDG 8 also. SDG 13: Climate action includes reducing emissions and increasing energy efficiency in our own oper- ations such as store operations and logistics. We also work to reduce emissions in supply chains and  selections of products and services as well as to promote more sustainable consumption to customers. Up to date details of our work towards each of the SDGs can be found at the Kesko.fi website.  The GRI, UNGC and SDG index of Keskos Annual Report includes SDGs for the relevant disclosures.  In addition, the Responsibility Programme connects the appropriate SDGs to each theme.

The Sustainabil- ity section in Keskos integrated Annual Report is prepared in accordance with the GRI standards and it  covers the key areas of economic, social and environmental responsibility. For each reported standard,  the GRI, UNGC and SDG index refers to the year of the version used. In our operations, we apply the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles: stakeholder inclusivity, identifica- tion of material aspects and responsiveness to stakeholders. Kesko has taken account of the ISO 26000 standard as a source document providing guidelines for  corporate responsibility. The Sustainability section of the Annual Report has been divided into three subsections: Responsibility  programme, Responsibility management and Report profile. The report is published only online, in  Finnish and in English. This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. Topic-specific  Disclosures are reported with respect to the material topics for Kesko. A comparison of the contents  of the report and the GRI standards is given in the GRI, UNGC and SDG index. Assurance of reporting An independent third party, PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy, has provided assurance for the performance  indicators on economic, social and environmental responsibility in the Finnish language Sustainability  section of the Annual Report. The congruence between responsibility information presented in the  Finnish and English versions has been checked. The conclusions, observations and recommendations by PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy are detailed  in the assurance report. The assurance is commissioned by the operative management of Kesko  Corporation. Global Compact reporting The report describes Keskos progress on the 10 principles of the Global Compact initiative. The GRI,  UNGC and SDG index shows which General Disclosures and Topic-specific Disclosures have been  used for evaluating performance in fulfilling human rights, labour rights, environment principles and  anti-corruption principles. Integrated Annual Report Since 2014, Kesko has taken account of the IIRC (International Integrated Reporting Council) <IR>  Framework in its annual reporting. Report stakeholders Various stakeholders use the report as their source of information when assessing Keskos results in  the different areas of responsibility. The most important target groups for the report include investors,  owners, analysts and rating agencies, as well as society (the media, authorities, NGOs and other  organisations, and trade unions). Reporting period and contact information This report describes the progress and results of responsibility work in 2017. It includes some informa- tion from January to March 2018.

In terms of the Companys GRI Standards reporting and GRI content index, the scope of the assurance  has covered economic, social and environmental disclosures listed within the Topic-specific Standards  as well as Disclosures 102-8, 102-41 and 102-54 of the Universal Standards. Furthermore, the assurance engagement has covered Kesko Corporations adherence to the AA1000  AccountAbility Principles with moderate (limited) level of assurance. Managements responsibility The Management of Kesko Corporation is responsible for preparing the CR Information in accordance  with the Reporting criteria as set out in the Companys reporting instructions and the GRI Standards  of the Global Reporting Initiative. The Management of Kesko Corporation is also responsible for such  internal control as the management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the CR  Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Management of Kesko Corporation is also responsible for the Companys adherence to the  AA1000 AccountAbility Principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness as set out in Account- Abilitys AA1000 AccountAbility Principles Standard 2008. Practitioners responsibility Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the CR Information and on the  Companys adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles based on the procedures we have  performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our work in accordance with the  International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements  Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information. That Standard requires that we plan  and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the CR Information is free  from material misstatement. In addition, we have conducted our work in accordance with the AA1000 Assurance Standard 2008.  For conducting a Type 2 assurance engagement as agreed with the Company, this Standard requires  planning and performing of the assurance engagement to obtain moderate (limited) assurance on  whether any matters come to our attention that cause us to believe that Kesko Corporation does not  adhere, in all material respects, to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles and that the CR Information  is not reliable, in all material respects, based on the Reporting criteria. In a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a  reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable  assurance engagement. An assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence  about the amounts and other disclosures in the CR Information, and about the Companys adherence  to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles. The procedures selected depend on the practitioners  judgement, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the CR Information and  an assessment of the risks of the Companys material nonadherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility  Principles. Our work consisted of, amongst others, the following procedures:   Interviewing senior management of the Company.   Interviewing employees from various organisational levels of the Company with regards to  materiality, stakeholder expectations, meeting of those expectations, as well as stakeholder  engagement.   Assessing stakeholder inclusivity and responsiveness based on the Companys documentation and  internal communication.   Assessing the Companys defined material corporate responsibility aspects as well as assessing the  CR Information based on these aspects.   Analysing references to the Company from the reporting period in online media.   Visiting the Companys Head Office as well as one site in Finland.   Interviewing employees responsible for collecting and reporting the CR Information at the Group  level and at the site where our visit took place.   Assessing how Group employees apply the reporting instructions and procedures of the Company.   Testing the accuracy and completeness of the information from original documents and systems on  a sample basis.   Testing the consolidation of information and performing recalculations on a sample basis. FINANCIAL   STATEMENTS SUSTAINABILITY CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE STRATEGY KESKO'S YEAR 2017 89  Limited assurance conclusion Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come  to our attention that causes us to believe that Kesko Corporation does not adhere, in all material  respects, to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles. Furthermore nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that Kesko Corporations CR  Information for the reporting period ended 31 December 2017 is not properly prepared, in all material  respects, in accordance with the Reporting criteria, or that the CR Information is not reliable, in all  material respects, based on the Reporting criteria. When reading our assurance report, the inherent limitations to the accuracy and completeness of  corporate responsibility information should be taken into consideration. Our assurance report has been prepared in accordance with the terms of our engagement. We do not  accept, or assume responsibility to anyone else, except to Kesko Corporation for our work, for this  report, or for the conclusions that we have reached. Observations and recommendations Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, we provide the  following observations and recommendations in relation to Kesko Corporations adherence to the  AA1000 AccountAbility Principles. These observations and recommendations do not affect the  conclusions presented earlier.   Inclusivity: The Company has processes in place for stakeholder inclusivity, collection of feedback  and stakeholder engagement. During the past reporting period, the Company has developed the  collection of feedback and customer engagement in digital channels. We recommend that the  Company continues to develop its digital activities related to stakeholder inclusivity.   Materiality: The Company has a process in place to evaluate and determine the materiality of  corporate responsibility aspects. We recommend that the Company assesses the need to update its  materiality assessment taking into consideration changes in the business environment which might  have occurred since the last update.   Responsiveness: The Company takes its stakeholders expectations into account in its operations  and responds to them through the continuous development of its activities. During 2017, the  Company has further increased the coverage and availability of information on the sustainability  and origin of its products. We recommend that the Company further widens the offering of  information to customers and other stakeholders on the measures the Company has undertaken to  ensure the sustainability of its products. Practitioners independence, qualifications and quality control We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for  Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which  is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care,  confidentiality and professional behaviour.
