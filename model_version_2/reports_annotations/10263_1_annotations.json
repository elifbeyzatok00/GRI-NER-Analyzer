CEO Message  KDHC Korea District Heating Corp. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 03 Ceaseless endeavor for customer satisfaction Since the introduction of the enterprise-level CS management, KDHC with its customer-centric open management has been ceaselessly endeavoring toward customer satisfaction by providing customer satisfaction services until the day when all customers are happy. We believe that customer satisfaction -- as a core element in all management activities -- is an essential source of competitive power in sustainable management. Accordingly, we have set as our mission to “impress customers beyond satisfying them”; therefore, we are exerting our best effort toward customer-centric management. To strengthen our relationship with customers, we listen to their voices through online and offline channels and actively reflect them on our policies. Through direct and personal service, we are conducting activities for our customers. KDHC is conducting its own customer satisfaction survey on a regular basis. In 2009, it was rated excellent in customer satisfaction by the government and awarded accordingly. In addition, KDHC is the first among public enterprises to have been selected for 5 consecutive years as the grand prize winner at the Customer Satisfaction Management Awards; it was also given the honor and prestige of having its name listed in the Hall of Fame. In the days ahead, KDHC shall endeavor to protect the rights and interests of customers. Through customer satisfaction, KDHC shall advance as an energy company of sustainable growth together with customers.  Open mind, open management KDHC is providing equal education and promotion opportunities to all employees according to their abilities and qualifications. To protect the rights and interests of our employees as well as enhance their social and economic positions and respond to their various needs, we offer selective welfare and various educational programs so that a happy, exciting workplace may be created. In addition, we are improving employees’satisfaction by activating communication through the labor-management committee, open discussion room, and hotline channels. Through such continuous efforts, KDHC is creating a more energetic “energy world”by establishing a partnership with its employees. As mid- to long-term plans for sustainable growth, we are promoting projects to develop key business areas into global standard, accelerate future businesses, incubate new ones, maintain the profit rates of infrastructure businesses, and optimize the global strategic bases. These projects are expected to increase values for KDHC and its stakeholders and share such values through win-win partnership in keeping with KDHC’ s sustainable management strategies.  Transparent, respected public enterprise KDHC is operating a management process system for social sustainability: customer satisfaction management, contribution to local communities, and transparent·ethical management. Recognizing stakeholders as our partners in joint growth, we are searching for ways of mutual advancement. To deliver safer and cleaner energy to customers, KDHC is maintaining cooperative relationships with partners. In addition, by introducing the e-contract system and strict qualification criteria, we have increased transparency in selecting our partners. Furthermore, to eradicate unfair transactions, KDHC is implementing the “integrity contract system.”As a result, KDHC was ranked no. 1 in the ethical management status survey and selected as an outstanding company in the public enterprise integrity assessment. As such, KDHC is being recognized for its corporate value in a number of fields.  Culture of practicing love and sharing  KDHC is genuinely practicing love and sharing for local communities to fulfill its social responsibilities and roles as a public enterprise. We are making various efforts to support the socially neglected as well as to protect the environment and narrow the gap between rural and urban areas by offering educational and cultural support. To alleviate the burdens carried by people in the low-income class, KDHC has minimized the factors leading to the increase in heat rates by comprehensively lowering the costs. In addition, we are actively practicing energy welfare by waiving the entire amount of the basic heat rates for the low-income class living in social welfare facilities and leased housing. With the “Sharing Happiness Team”and “ARIUM”as the center of its efforts toward social contribution activities, KDHC is leading the culture of sharing love with neighbors. Furthermore, KDHC is promoting voluntary activities to educate elementary school students in closed-mine villages.  Sustainable growth via environment-friendly management In line with the government’s low carbon, green growth policy, KDHC is endeavoring to realize environment-friendly management. In 1996, we obtained the environmental management mark for the first time among public enterprises and consequently implemented the enterprise-level environmental management system. For the systematic control of the environmental management system, we are pursuing the environmental goals we have established. KDHC is paying particular attention to air, water, and soil quality management to minimize impacts on the environment. In addition, by establishing greenhouse gas reduction plans to prevent global warming and securing the system for minimizing environmental impacts, KDHC is taking active initiatives in responding to the requirements of UNFCCC. At the same time, KDHC has designated the new and renewable energy business as its new growth engine.  Accordingly, we are going all-out in making investments in energy diversification by using new and renewable energy sources such as heat from waste incineration, landfill gas, solar energy, woodchip, heat pump, RDF, IGCC, and water from sewage treatment. In the future, KDHC shall promote the diversification of its business fields such as expansion of the local heating·cooling business, new technology development, electric power business, and new and renewable energy business. As a result, we shall supply local heating to 2 million customers nationwide by 2015 and advance as a “world- class general energy company”producing KRW 2500 billion in sales. Furthermore, as a public enterprise, KDHC shall fulfill its social responsibilities. We shall continuously endeavor to become a clean energy company that is loved and trusted by the nation and the deliverer of happiness and warmth to customers.   Hope, happiness, trust, and love  These are the names of energy in KDHC. KDHC is realizing the value of sustainable growth  for the happiness of customers. Your support and encouragement are the energy for KDHC,  the Best Environment-friendly Energy Company. Four Seasons of Happy Energy  KDHC Sustainable Highlights Increased transparency  in contracts To increase the transparency of contracts with external suppliers, KDHC has been operating the “integrity contract system”since June 2004. In particular, we have revised the integrity contract system in November 2008; as a result, we have newly established a clause that prevents contract conclusion without the submission of the integrity contract fulfillment agreement. Our employees are also required to write pledges, i.e., that they will not receive the gift of money or other articles. On the other hand, KDHC is operating the internal report system. We have also opened a cyber report center in our website in an effort to eradicate unfair transactions. In September 2009, KDHC established the “criteria for contract operations with foreign companies.”Therefore, it is endeavoring to conclude contracts with foreign companies based on clear guidelines. Customer communication KDHC is making efforts to listen to the voices of customers and to reflect them on its policies. Customers can express their opinions through online and offline channels including the customer service centers. We started operating the IT-based integrated VOC (voice of customer) operation system in 2009. In 2010, we are planning to operate online branches one by one. Thanks to efforts to improve VOC such as regular VOC inspection system and reflection of VOC fulfillment rates on management assessment, KDHC has been able to improve the daily customer response rate from 93.8% in 2008 to 99.6% in 2009. Promoting business overseas KDHC participated in the project of local heating and water supply facility implementation (Mar. 2008 ~ Oct. 2009) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.  We successfully fulfilled our role as project management company, supervising the project of replacing the local heating machine room facilities in 44 areas and disseminating advanced technologies. Currently, KDHC is actively promoting new public development support projects to improve the heat supply system in Khorezm,  Uzbekistan and to install the heating  and hot water supply system in Barunurt, Mongolia.  New and renewable  energy business KDHC is pursuing the new and renewable energy business using woodchip, RDF (refuse derived fuel), heat from waste incineration, and LFG (landfill gas). Since 2009, we have been securing forest byproducts (approx. 3,000 tons/year) such as wood damaged by pine wilt disease  to develop woodchip fuels. In addition, we have concluded an MOU for the recycling of forest tree wastes (approx. 3,000 tons/year) with Gyeongsangbuk-do Development Corp. Furthermore, KDHC is promoting the RDF fuel production project using domestic wastes through joint efforts with the local governments of Daegu City, Chungcheong Province, and Gwangju City. Our goal is to replace 12.1% of the total energy supply with new and renewable energy by 2022.   Family-friendly management KDHC is operating diverse maternity protection programs to address the problem of low birth rate and to ease the burden of child rearing expenses. Since 2007, KDHC has been operating a number of support policies and programs such as childcare facility operation (49 infants and toddlers), childbirth encouragement fund, vacation and leave programs to encourage childbirth, operation of maternity protection rest area, etc. In 2009, we increased the period of childcare  leave to 3 years. This period is recognized  as  part of career so that our employees are not placed at a disadvantage when using their  childcare leaves.  ARIUM: residence for the elderly  While conducting voluntary service activities to repair houses and deliver briquettes to low-income households in Seongnam, KDHC’s “Share Happiness Team”decided to promote the establishment of “ARIUM”as a means of providing fundamental support and help to the elderly living by themselves. With financial support from the Kumho Asiana Group, ARIUM was built as a 6-story building on the city land of Seongnam in Seongnam-dong in February 2009. The Share Happiness Team visits ARIUM monthly and carries out voluntary service activities customized to the elderly, such as cleaning, making Kimchi, and giving billiards lessons. Enterprise-level ethical management practice system KDHC is promoting ethical management in keeping with the sustainable management strategies established in 2007. In addition, KDHC has executed the enterprise- level ethical management tasks for each of the 37 divisions in 2008 and 36 divisions in 2009. Furthermore, we are operating the IT-based ethical management system. In October 2008, KDHC started the  E&S (ethics & sustainability) decision-making system to assess the fulfillment of corporate ethics, environmental responsibilities, and social responsibilities in the process of examining important documents. As a result, the assessment of 603 cases was completed by 2009. KDHC is spreading the ethical paradigm in all areas of its operation.  2009 Highlights Responding to climate changes KDHC is expanding the use of clean energy. In particular, we have reduced the use of bunker C oil and low sulfur oil whose air pollutants emission is relatively high and increased the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and landfill gas (LFG) as clean fuels. As a result, the rate of using LNG was increased from 38% in 2007 to as high as 78% in 2009. In addition, to respond actively to environmental policies, KDHC is administering emission control in accordance with the total air pollution load management system in the metropolitan regions. Our Daegu and Cheongju offices have also installed denitrification facilities.  Furthermore, in preparation for the post-Kyoto era, KDHC actively participated in 3 CDM (clean development mechanism) projects including the installation of photovoltaic power generation facilities in Jeungdo, Sinan and consequently secured CER (certified emission reduction). The CDM and K-CDM projects record greenhouse gas reduction of 162,000 ton/ year as of 2009.   Through sustainable growth, KDHC shall advance as a company  that gives the best satisfaction and value to its stakeholders - customers, stockholders, employees, local communities, environments, and government.

KDHC Korea District Heating Corp. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 19 ➜ Environment (Professor ooo of the Univ. of Seoul) District heating is an environment-friendly business that effectively reduces greenhouse gas emission caused by individual heating. The expansion of district heating is one way of responding to climate changes. KDHC has been making greater investments in a number of facilities to improve the environment. Since the district heating business is centralized in metropolitan regions, however, there is a need to increase the investment in pollution prevention facilities so that high air quality can be maintained. In addition, considering the reduction of pollutants or greenhouse gas, expanding the use of natural fuels is necessary. Furthermore, the continuous supplementation of environmental experts is required to expand the scope of the district heating business and to handle climate changes in the future.  KDHC KDHC has established internal control criteria that are stricter than the environmental criteria. In addition, we are continuously expanding investments in the protection of our environment. For the improvement of air quality in the metropolitan regions, KDHC has introduced the unused new and renewable energy such as heat from waste incineration and sewage treatment. In addition, we have additionally installed LNG fuel conversion and denitrification facilities. Furthermore, by increasing LNG use in new facilities, we have improved the rate of LNG use from 38% in 2007 up to 68% in 2009. Based on its mid- to long-term management strategy (Happy Energy 2015), KDHC is operating expert training programs for the creation of a new environment-friendly market.  ➜ Society (Branch Head ooo of Good Neighbors) Good Neighbors is a child protection specialist located in Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do. Since 2001, employees of KDHC have been voluntarily participating in the activities. For social contribution activities, businesses are required to create an atmosphere that encourages continuous participation by their employees, to support employees in practicing the virtue of sharing, and to provide incentives to the participating employees. In addition, the needs of the local communities must be identified through regular communication. Instead of a single-directional support strategy from the company, a feedback system for problems must be operated through interactive communication.   KDHC Recognizing that we can be respected by fulfilling our social responsibilities as a public enterprise, we at KDHC are conducting social contribution activities for our local communities and customers. KDHC’s  ⌜Share Happiness Team⌟and ⌜Stepping Stones⌟the voluntary service teams participated in by employees to share warmth and love with neighbors in need, are carrying out activities to support the neglected, to protect the environment, and to provide educational support according to the characteristics of each community. The activities are funded by members’ donations and 1:1 matching grant from KDHC. KDHC is conducting customized service activities by personally visiting the support targets in connection with local communities, residents, and related organizations.  ➜ Economy (Associate Manager ooo of Korea Environment Corp.) KDHC is a company with countless innovative accom-plishments such as employing improvement ideas and operating a science education program for management advancement. In particular, the project of using wood damaged by pine wilt disease is regarded as an example of responding to climate changes using new and renewable energy.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 22 Effects of the Integrated Energy Business  ● Outstanding Energy Saving Effect The integrated energy business increases the efficiency of using energy by approximately 30% compared to general power generation methods through combined cycle power generation.  ● Environment-friendly Advanced Energy  KDHC has reduced air pollutants such as SOx, NOx and dust and greenhouse gas emission by 39% and 45%, respectively, in 2009 through energy saving at the source and by installing state-of- the-art pollution prevention facilities. In particular, district heating, which supplies cooling by using hot water, has the effect of lowering the peak power load in summer. Moreover, district heating is environment-friendly since it does not use substances to destroy the ozone layer such as Freon gas, etc.  ● Convenient, Pleasant Energy  District heating does not require the installation of individual boilers in each household and complex. Therefore, it is safe and clean. Furthermore, district heating maintains a consistent indoor temperature 24 hours a day for pleasant, convenient living.  District heating is economical with its low heating rates. The service can be used at the time and temperature level desired by the customer. The heating charge is imposed according to the amount of heating used. In addition, district heating is cheaper than other heating methods by approximately 16%, thanks to the use of networks and low-price energy sources such as waste incineration heat. Therefore, district heating is contributing to economical living with every use.

While conducting internal environmental review each year according to the ISO 14001 standard, we receive follow-up management and renewal reviews by external organizations. In addition, for the successful operation of the environmental management system, KDHC is internally conducting environmental impact assessment once every three years -- even though it is not subject to the mandatory environmental impact assessment -- to assess the direct and indirect impacts on the environment of the various activities carried out within our business premises. As a result of our efforts, there has never been any violation of the environment- related laws or fine imposition. Operating Environment-friendly Facilities To respond actively to the government’s green growth policy, KDHC has introduced environment-friendly, high-efficiency facilities to enhance its competitiveness. First, we increased economic efficiency by turning unused energies into resources through the application of the heat pump to the cooling water system. In the past, the main cooling water system used low-temperature water; hence the low efficiency. Note, however, that the application of the heat pump enabled high-temperature water use and consequently high- efficiency operation. This translated into additional heat production by 16,000Gcal a year. Second, we are promoting the development of condensing boiler for co-generation to recover potential heat by condensing the vapors contained in the boiler exhaust gas using the recovered water in district heating. Third, we are saving on the cost of water for co-generation by introducing the wastewater recycling system. Finally, for the construction of a green & clean heat transportation pipeline, we are increasing the use of the green pipe for supply and return through a single line. Compared to general pipes, the green pipe reduces CO2 by 26%, NOx by 21%, and SOx by 43%; thus contributing to the reduction of environmentally harmful substances.  Environmental Accounting  Environmental accounting is a standardized procedure for estimating the cost and benefit of minimizing the environmental impact; this is a way of delivering reliable environmental information to the stakeholders. KDHC is practicing environmental accounting for transparent environmental management. To control environment-related expenses more efficiently, KDHC is calculating the environmental cost annually based on the environmental KDHC Korea District Heating Corp.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 39 Environment-friendly Management  For air pollutant control, KDHC is installing and operating the stack TMS to measure pollutant discharge on a real-time basis. The discharged pollutants are measured, and the data are sent to the head office and Korea Environment Corporation for monitoring. In addition, to reduce air pollutants discharged from power plants, KDHC is operating low NOx burners, flue gas denitrification facilities, electric dust collectors, and flue gas desulfurization facilities. In preparation for the enforcement of the Clean Air Conservation Act wherein the allowable level of air pollutant discharge will become stricter, KDHC has installed denitrification facilities in the Daegu and Cheongju Branches.  KDHC assures the prevention of soil contamination due to oil leak from fuel storage facilities. A total of 7 branches including the Bundang Branch are equipped with low sulfur oil, bunker C oil, and light oil tanks. Thanks to continuous safety check, we have yet to experience an incident caused by fuel leak. In the mean time, the wastewater generated in the courses of heat· electricity production, deionized·soft water production, and denitrification facility operation is appropriately treated at wastewater treatment plants using physical and chemical methods. Waste with safe water quality is then discharged.  Environment-friendly and Preventive Environmental Management Laws concerning water quality such as the Water Quality and Ecosystem Conservation Act are strengthened. In addition, the combined cycle plant in Hwaseong has been completed. Therefore, the need for strict system water quality control is raised. KDHC installed the general chemical laboratory in 2009. In addition, KDHC obtained KOLAS certification in the water quality analysis category as the first among public enterprises to do so. By operating our own test laboratory, we have secured the testing and analysis capacities. Moreover, it produced the effect of lowering the analysis cost and period. KDHC is recycling water resources to respond actively to regulations and to prevent the discharge of water pollutants. In particular, we are planning to install a sewage discharge water recycling facility in our Yongin Branch. In the future, we shall further expand the resource saving and recycling businesses.  As part of our preventive environmental management activities, we are estimating the effects of energy saving and environmental improvement produced by district heating compared to individual heating. The amount of energy saving in 2009 was 983,000 TOE (25%). We also recorded greenhouse gas reduction of 5,343,000 tons (45%).  Recycling Wastes and Byproducts  The wastes generated by KDHC are dust produced after heavy oil combustion and sludge generated in the process of wastewater treatment as well as waste oil, waste insulator, and waste synthetic resin generated in the process of facility repair. KDHC is appropriately treating these wastes according to the Wastes Control Act. In particular, dust and plaster as the byproducts of denitrification are recycled from the entire quantities; thus contributing to resource saving. The 280 tons of dust generated by all of our branches in 2009 is being recycled as supplementary fuel in cement manufacturing. The entire quantity of denitrified plaster is also used as ingredient for cement.  ▼ Water Resource Management (unit: 1,000m3) 2007 2008 2009 ●Water collection amount   ●Wastewater discharge amount   ●Amount recycled 1,085 293 52 1,949 271 19 1,833 266 20 ▼ Waste Treatment and Recycling (unit: ton) 2007 2008 2009 ●Dust treatment amount   ●Denitrified plaster treatment amount 345 4,379 347 5,617 280 5,853 ▼ Water Quality Item Branch Unit Allowable Discharge Level Internal Control Criteria COD Gangnam, Cheongju, Hwaseong, Yangsan ㎎/ 130 20 Suwon, Yongin ㎎/ 90 20 Daegu ㎎/ 40 20 SS Gangnam, Cheongju, Hwaseong, Yangsan ㎎/ 120 20 Suwon, Yongin ㎎/ 80 20 Daegu ㎎/ 30 20 pH All branches - 5.8~8.6 6.5~8.0 N-Hexane All branches ㎎/ 5 1.5 T-N All branches ㎎/ 60 40 T-P All branches ㎎/ 8 6  New and Renewable Energy Strategies  The new and renewable energy promotion strategies center on the active response to the government’s green growth policy, expansion and distribution of new and renewable energy, continuous development of new and renewable energy sources that can be linked to integrated energy, and R&D for business promotion. In particular, for the expansion of new and renewable energy, KDHC has set priorities in securing energy resources; therefore, it is endeavoring to secure competitive power through specialized resource development. Waste incineration heat and LFG are new and renewable energy sources that are cheaper in terms of production cost than LNG. RDF and woodchip are economically efficient, and they can be linked to the integrated energy business. Wind power and marine energy as means of RPS fulfillment are low in electricity production cost. Fuel cell and solar power have high growth potentials according to the technology levels.  KDHC Korea District Heating Corp. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 40 Guided by the goal of expanding the distribution rate of new and renewable energy out of the total energy production, KDHC produced 2.33% of electricity and 16.11% of heat from new and renewable energy in 2009. This is tantamount to replacing 202,940 TOE of petroleum import and is equivalent to 616,870 tons of CO2 reduction per year. By 2022, KDHC will increase the percentage of new and renewable energy out of the total energy production to 12.10%.  New and Renewable  Energy  ▼ New and Renewable Energy Business Environment Government’s Green Growth Policy  Actively responding to the government’s new and renewable energy expansion policy, KDHC is contributing to green growth by expanding the new and renewable energy distribution. By faithfully fulfilling the government’s 1st RPA (Renewable Portfolio Agreement, 2006~2008), KDHC became the only RPA organization to achieve the target investment. In addition, by investing approximately KRW 131.8 billion through participation in the 2nd RPA (2009~ 2011), KDHC shall produce approximately 9.37% of the overall energy production as new and renewable energy. In preparation for the RPS (Renewable Portfolio Standard) to be put into effect in 2012, KDHC has established basic new and renewable energy plans and organized the Green Growth Committee to discover new and renewable energy businesses.

In addition, we have consulted related organizations such as the Ministry of Environment on the ways of using waste wood for successful woodchip procurement. In 2008, KDHC improved the restrictions on RDF use in areas where the use of clean fuel is mandatory. R&D for New and Renewable Energy  In accordance with the increase in production cost due to the rise in oil price, fuel diversification and procurement of energy sources by discovering new and renewable energy sources have become important issues. As such, KDHC is attempting to improve the applicability and economic efficiency of integrated energy by securing the technological basis of the new and renewable energy business. At the same time, we shall implement the mid- to long-term technological roadmap for systematic new and renewable energy R&D and invest a total of KRW 53.1 billion until 2017 in 5 of the new energy (fuel cell, IGCC) and recycled energy (waste, bio, solar heat) fields.  Our major achievements in 2009 were the development of and patent application for the fuel cell system using biogas. With this, we have secured economic efficiency as well as the basis for our business promotion. To respond to RPS and fuel diversification, KDHC is discovering unused new and renewable energy sources and reviewing applicability. Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) involves a number of heat exchanges to discard waste heat during the gasification process. Therefore, this technology maximizes the efficiency of district heating. In addition, we have analyzed the possibility of creating fuel out of the wastes generated during bio fuel production using agar- agar. Currently, KDHC is analyzing the possibility of using waste heat generated from landfills in the metropolitan regions and promoting the development of related technologies.  ▼ Biogas Fuel Cell System  of both integrated energy and new and renewable energy; therefore, it is in line with the government’s energy policy. In 2009, we have additionally secured waste incineration heat from the Cheongju, Pangyo, and Eunpyeong incineration plants. In addition, a woodchip new and renewable energy facility will be completed in November 2010 in Daegu. As such, the percentage of using new and renewable energy is being expanded continuously. In June 2009, KDHC has completed the sewage heat recycled energy facility in Yongin and developed the unused energy of sewage treatment water as energy for heating. As a result, 2% of the district heating energy in Yongin City comes from sewage heat energy.  In relation to the waste to energy project in Daegu, KDHC is devising ways of diversifying the project promotion methods by developing the private investment business model as the first among public energy enterprises to do so. Following the closing of the Seongseo Incineration Plant, which accounted for 18.22% of heat production in the Daegu Branch, KDHC is participating in the project to secure alternative heat source using the BTO (build-transfer-operate) method. In 2009, the feasibilities of the BTO project model and RDF co-generation facility were reviewed. Afterward, by forming a consortium with POSCO, etc., KDHC concluded an agreement for the joint promotion of the BTO project. In addition, for precision analysis and risk control for the BTO project, KDHC received consulting from external experts and from an accounting firm.  Discovering and Expanding the New and Renewable Energy Business  Participating in the government’s waste to energy project, KDHC is using 600 tons/day of domestic wastes generated in the 6 areas of Gwangju and Jeollanam-do as energy sources. In addition, we are promoting the domestic waste to energy project in Daegu and the happy city RDF project. To make woodchip fuels, we secured 11,500 tons of woodchips in 2009 through collaboration with Gyeongsangbukdo Development Corporation. By establishing annual plans of woodchip use, KDHC will utilize 123,000 tons of woodchips per year after 2013. For the biogas business, we have concluded an MOU in May 2010 with the Nanji Water Recycling Center, and we shall complete the facility in 2011. In terms of the wind power business, we have concluded an agreement with Jeollanam-do in 2009 for cooperation in investment in the 5GW wind power project. To expand solar power generation, we shall install photovoltaic power generation facilities in our branches in 2010 and start operating the facilities in 2011. For the fuel cell business, we are planning to secure project sites where the price of LNG supply is low.  KDHC is improving related systems for the expansion of the new and renewable energy business. First, in relation to the RDF business in Gwangju, we have proposed the RDF quality criteria ▼ Energy Supply Plan to Gwangju Innovative City  Employees are the future of KDHC.

The heat supply regulations reinforce customer information security. Each employee is given differentiated information access authorities. The first Tuesday of each month is our “Information Security Check Day.” After inspection, we promptly improve on any and all weaknesses found. Thanks to strict customer information security management, no complaints have ever been raised in relation to any violation of consumer privacy.  In addition, KDHC is carrying out public service advertising to provide information on the methods of saving energy and the correct methods of using the heating service. KDHC strictly observes the regulations of autonomous advertising review. As such, it has never violated any of the advertising-and marketing- related laws and regulations.

To collect opinions on rates, service improvement, and policies, KDHC is operating the Open Public Enterprise Committee and Open CS Promotion Committee in each branch. In addition, to support and monitor customer satisfaction activities, KDHC is conducting a questionnaire survey on customers, organizing a customer proposal festival, and investigating customers’needs for the district heating user’s manual. KDHC Korea District Heating Corp. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 56 Pursuing the philosophy to “Create a Happy Energy World,” KDHC has set the ultimate goal of management as “customer.” Toward this end, we intend to become an energy company that designs and plans human-friendly and environment-friendly energy. The basis of our customer satisfaction management is the delivery of happiness to our customers, environment, and entire human race through energy.  Customer Satisfaction Strategies  ▼ VOC Handling Cases VOC I would like customers to participate directly in the rate adjustment process so that customers’ acceptance of the heat rates will increase. Improvement Before the application of the adjusted heat rates, we inform our customers of the details. In December 2009, we improved the system to enable direct participation by customers’representatives together with accountants, energy specialists, and citizens’groups in the Fuel Adjustment Mechanism Verification Committee. VOC It is difficult for housewives to use district heating because it involves handling the valve or temperature controller. I would like to learn the methods of using it more conveniently. Improvement We have published and distributed to customers 443,167 copies of a customized manual containing photos of the heating facilities installed in households. Likewise, easy-to-understand instructions on using district heating in 3D format are available in our website, Internet blog, and control office. VOC for the Socially Disadvantaged As a public enterprise, I would like KDHC to reduce heating rates further for the socially disadvantaged. Improvement Since February 2006, we have been operating the energy welfare system to waive the entire basic rates for social welfare facilities and leased apartments measuring 60㎡ or less. In 2009, we further expanded the scope of the heat rate reduction system to include the disabled, war veterans, and second highest class. Upon application, KRW 5.5 billion in heat rates will be supported for as many as approximately 150,000 households. aVOC for Machine Room Operators We need regular training to operate the district heating system efficiently. Please set up an education system that provides training at all times in addition to the group technical training. Improvement We have included education on the basic theory of district heating in the cyber technical training course. The education is provided quarterly. In effect, we have implemented a regular learning system. VOC Status in KDHC ● Online VOC Operation  The highest count of VOCs received online for 3 years from 2007 to 2009 dealt with customer facility/quality and heat rates/ construction charges. Considering the rates per VOC type and frequency, KDHC is endeavoring to improve the FAQ (frequently asked questions) to resolve the repetitively occurring VOC and to standardize service by producing “District Heating from 1 to 100,” the customer handling manual focusing on case studies. To handle complaints concerning the heat rates, KDHC has introduced the maximum rate adjustment system to enhance customers’ acceptance of heat rates; it is also operating the system of notifying customers of the heat rates in advance.    KDHC Korea District Heating Corp. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 57 Fostering a Customer-oriented Organization Culture To improve the quality of service provided to the final consumer and to enhance customer satisfaction, KDHC is providing various forms of support for the development of customer handling abilities and improvement of expertise among machine room operators while promoting a customer-oriented mindset among its internal employees. There are a number of customer participation bodies such as the Open Public Enterprise Committee and Open CS Promotion Committee. As of 2009, approximately 340 customers nationwide participate in the advisory team to inquire about and monitor KDHC’s service improvement.  Customer Service Charter In 1999, KDHC established the Service Charter. In December 2005, it was amended to Customer Service Charter dealing with the improvement of quality, service, and quality of customers’ living. In December 2008, KDHC again amended it to the ECO Customer Service Charter by reflecting the ECO (economy, ecology) service as the core values and upgrading the core service standards. To fulfill the customer service declaration, we have established the detailed service fulfillment standards. The results are checked quarterly to reflect the areas requiring improvement on our management activities as much as possible. The related information is disclosed through our website twice a year.

The value created is invested in R&D and training for and distribution of the integrated energy business. In addition, it is distributed to stakeholders including local community contribution activities, government, stockholders, and partners and as interest to creditors.  Supporting  the Growth  of Partners  Partner Management System KDHC is protecting the rights and interests of partners by reflecting the provisions of the Framework Act on the Construction Industry and the Fair Transactions in Subcontracting Act. In addition, we are endeavoring to secure construction quality by promoting the protection and development of small-scale construction companies. Pursuant to the Fair Transactions in Subcontracting Act, the contracted parties must faithfully fulfill the contents of the submitted subcontracting management plans. Otherwise, immediate correction is required as stipulated in related regulations for partner protection.  Expanding the Purchase of Products  of Small-scale Manufacturers and Supporting the Research Fund KDHC is endeavoring to expand the purchase of technologies and products of small-scale companies by specifying the “preferential purchase of technological development products of small businesses” as a special contract condition. In 2009, we purchased a total of 16 items including switchboard hoist for KRW 6.7 billion. We are planning to expand the scope of purchase further. In the meantime, to enhance the reliability of the district heating business, KDHC is supporting small and medium businesses with research fund to accelerate technological development. In addition, KDHC is protecting and developing small construction companies by directly placing orders for heat piping installation projects at the estimated cost of less than KRW 5 billion to small-scale construction companies. KDHC shall gradually increase the scope of small business protection and encourage participation by a greater number of companies in the future.  ● New Product Development Project Under the Condition of Purchase To support stable growth and technological development of small- and medium-scale businesses, KDHC is implementing the “new product development project under the condition of purchase” and “R&D cost support product.” Through these projects, KDHC is supporting small businesses in their technological development for new products and outsourced items.

In addition, as a means of supporting stable sales routes in relation to projects completed by small and medium businesses, KDHC is carrying out the preferential purchasing of products for 2 years after the successful completion of the projects.  ● Overseas Marketing Support Project  KDHC is supporting small and medium businesses manufacturing parts and instruments for district heating with overseas marketing activities. With fund of up to KRW 5 million provided per company, KDHC expects this support project to enhance the overseas marketing abilities of small and medium businesses and increase national competitiveness.  ● Financial Support to Partners Based on the business tieup with banks in September 2006, KDHC is operating the financial support system to loan operation fund without collateral to its partner companies according to their credit ratings. This program enabled financial support to the small and medium businesses working with KDHC. Without the additional burden of financing, KDHC can support the fund required by its partners and consequently secure items stably. Through financial support provided in the scale of KRW 11 billion to a total of 11 companies since 2007, KDHC has been enabling partners to carry out stable management activities. We shall actively publicize the financial support system to our existing and new partners and further expand the financial support in the future.  ● Performance Sharing System KDHC and its partners have been jointly promoting innovation activities. As a result, we started operating the “performance sharing system” in 2007 to share the results of cost reduction, quality improvement, and new product development. Through the agreement to allow the execution of the patent for the wireless communication heat piping monitoring system, KDHC is imposing royalty amounting to 3% of new product sales. In addition, our partners are creating new sales by manufacturing products using the execution right. Over the period of 2 years, KDHC imposed royalty of KRW 99 million.

In 2009, KDHC improved and upgraded the electronic contract system through the electronic contract system advancement promotion project. As a result, KDHC enabled its partners to use the electronic contract system more conveniently and stably. For one, the electronic contract system was improved to enable electronic bidding for double-insulation pipe, which had previously been carried out as on-site bidding. Eligibility Examination Criteria  KDHC is operating the eligibility examination criteria it has prepared in the fields of construction, service, and purchase to determine the wholesomeness of bidding companies, establish the basis for high-quality heat supply, and take part in spreading the corporate culture of social contribution activities. Eligibility examination criteria have been established based on the  KDHC Korea District Heating Corp. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 63 accounting regulations of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance and by reflecting the detailed rules of the eligibility examination of the Public Procurement Service. In addition, the key assessment areas are construction abilities, technological competencies, management status, and credit standing. In assessing the credit standing, we are giving additional points to companies that are outstanding in social contribution activities such as in terms of female employment and supporting businesses run by female owners, employment of the disabled, and new recruitment and to those selected as “excellent company in new labor-management culture” as selected by the Ministry of Labor. On the other hand, points are deducted for companies subject to administrative measures due to any violation of the Wastes Control Act.  Integrity Contract System The code of ethics of KDHC prescribes the prohibition of giving and receiving money and other articles between partners and employees. In November 2008, we prepared special notes for integrity contract bidding and consequently established a clause prohibiting bidding and contract conclusion without the submission of the integrity contract fulfillment pledge. The contract handling staff of KDHC are also required to draw up written pledges not to receive gifts of money and other articles. As such, KDHC is endeavoring to fulfill the integrity contract system.  KDHC has introduced “Hotline,” the internal reporting system, and “HelpLine,” the counseling channel. By opening the Cyber Report Center in its website, KDHC is endeavoring to prevent unfair transaction activities. In addition, we have drawn up “special notes for integrity contract bidding” and “integrity contract fulfillment pledge” in English so as to execute the integrity contract when dealing with foreign companies. In September 2009, KDHC established the “criteria for contract operations with foreign companies” and consequently ensured that contract operations with foreign companies are carried out based on clearer guidelines and criteria. Communication with Partners KDHC is organizing talks with partners annually to strengthen partnerships through communication. Agendas derived by the talks are preferentially handled whenever applicable and reflected on our management policies. In 2009, a total of 6 talks were organized, and 16 agendas were raised in relation to the reflection of price fluctuation due to the increase in the prices of raw materials. KDHC has deliberated on and made adjustments for issues of reflecting price fluctuation and payment before delivery. For specialized VOC collection and improvement activities with partners, KDHC carries out responsible management happy call by branch heads on a regular basis to investigate partners’ satisfaction with its operation processes.  To practice ethical management with partners, KDHC is operating the Cyber Report Center (all-year round) and clean call survey (twice a year). In addition, we are sending out the CEO’s integrity letter and organizing training sessions on UNGS’s 10 principles. In 2009, KDHC held 6 talks and ethical management trainings attended by 57 people from partners.  Partner Satisfaction Survey  In 2009, KDHC’s partner satisfaction survey point increased by 0.14 compared to the previous year. In the non-metric category, we garnered points for having no experience in corruption. The insufficiency in convenience of lodging complaints was pointed out as a weakness, however. In 2009, KDHC improved the system including the corruption impact assessment. In the future, the survey results shall be shared throughout the company, and the routes of lodging complaints shall be checked. This way, KDHC shall continuously endeavor to improve partner satisfaction.  ● Talks with Partners ▼ Partner Satisfaction Survey (out of 10 points) 2008 2009 Partner satisfaction survey 9.32 9.46  KDHC hopes for a sustainable future of  coexistence with the local communities.

Since February 2006, KDHC has been waiving the basic heat rates for social welfare facilities and rental housing (permanent rental housing included) measuring less than 60㎡. In 2008, KDHC waived heat rates of approximately KRW 1.6 billion for 63,000 households in rental apartments and approximately KRW 160 million for 31 social welfare facilities. In 2009, heat rates of KRW 1.8 billion were waived for 85,000 households in rental apartments and KRW 98 million, for 31 social welfare facilities. In 2010, KDHC expanded the scope of heat rate reduction to include war veterans, basic welfare recipients, disabled (class 1 ~ 3), and households with 3 or more children. In addition, KDHC is part of the  “Heating Cost Support” campaign in conjunction with MBC’s radio program titled “Age of Women.” Listeners of this program send in stories of people suffering difficulties with the heating cost, and KDHC then selects stories from the “Age of Women” web board. After investigation and assessment, KDHC provides the fund for heating cost to the social welfare facilities families in need. In 2008, KDHC provided KRW 150 million in support to 72 social welfare facilities and 62 households. In 2009, KRW 100 million was provided to support the heating cost in 30 welfare facilities and 41 households.  Cognizant of the fact that the ultimate goal of “a world of happy energy”is to create a world where everyone is happy, KDHC’ s employees and officers have been ceaselessly making efforts to practice the substantial management of sharing. KDHC is continuously promoting the realization of energy welfare, provision of social support to narrow the gaps between social classes and between rural and urban communities in terms of culture, education, and employment rate, ethical management alongside service activities voluntarily participated in by employees and officers, and achievement of environment-friendly management.  Management of Sharing for Local Communities  ▼ Social Contribution Vision and Mission Classification Details Vision “We create a happy energy world together with the local communities.” Mission Employees and officers of KDHC keenly recognize the social responsibilities of KDHC as a public enterprise and consequently practice the management of sharing to create a society where everyone is happy.

In particular, our social contribution activities were further activated following the establishment of strategies and systems for the effective promotion of social contribution activities in 2006.  Social Contribution Promotion Strategies  KDHC is pursuing social contribution in three areas: business activities, local communities, and voluntary service activities.  1. Business Activities: Realizing energy welfare KDHC believes that social contribution activities are aimed at stably supplying high-quality, economical energy with huge effects of energy saving and air quality improvement and faithfully fulfilling the objective of its establishment. Based on this, we are continuously expanding our social contribution activities. In addition, we are endeavoring to realize energy welfare by reducing the heat rates for the low-income glass and to support  KDHC Korea District Heating Corp.

Local Communities: Cooperating with and supporting local communities KDHC is addressing the gaps in education, culture, and employment by continuously supporting the socially neglected in and outside its business areas. In particular, KDHC is endeavoring to improve fundamentally the quality of living for the socially neglected by assisting them in achieving economic and social independence.  Supporting HR Development in Closed Mine Villages Having interest in children in the neglected regions, KDHC concluded an agreement for HR development support project operation in March 2006 with Yemi Elementary School in Yemi-ri, Sindong-eup, Jeongseon-gun of Gangwon-do to improve the inferior educational environments. Big cities are filled with private English education institutes for elementary school students. Likewise, there is a boom in studying abroad. Note, however, that students of Yemi Elementary School, which is located in a remote village -- hardly enjoy the benefits of foreign language education. Focusing on improving the education environments, KDHC invited native English instructors to offer conversation classes twice a week after school. The students took in the knowledge just like dry sponge absorbing moisture. To measure the results of English education over a year, KDHC has been organizing the annual English speech contest, with the students continuously displaying remarkable improvements. After five years of English study, the students are now stably settling down and showing improvements in their English competencies. These students are also performing superbly, winning prizes in various English speech contests. The press took notice of these students from a small village school as they competed neck- and-neck with the students from big cities. This visible result was made possible by the strong support from the “Yemi Guardian Angel,” a voluntary service team of KDHC’s employees serving as mentors and supporters of the students of Yemi Elementary School.  At the same time, KDHC is organizing city culture experience programs for the 3rd~6th graders of Yemi Elementary School once a year to narrow the cultural gap between urban and rural communities. Touring through Seoul, students experience the urban ( traditional culture and enjoy cultural performances for 3 days. In 2008, the students visited Aerospace Museum, enjoyed a musical performance, and had a day of great fun at a theme park. In 2009, the students visited the wetland in Ganghwa-do to experience the mysteries of wetland and the precious value of nature.  ARIUM : a Third Sector Development Welfare Facility for the Elderly ARIUM began from the spirit of sharing. The “Share Happiness Team,” a voluntary service team of KDHC’s employees, carried out voluntary service activities in Seongnam during winter seasonsfor low-income class households by replacing wall papers, delivering briquettes, and repairing boilers. This was the beginning of “ARIUM.” While delivering briquettes to old people who had difficulties in moving, the team members noticed that the homes with their torn wallpapers and the cold wind seeping in through the cracks of the old windows were sheer torture for the elderly with their weak jointsduring winter. Although they immediately began discussing measures to repair the homes of the elderly, a social service worker explained to them that the landlords would increase the rent once the homes were repaired;thus eventually driving the old people without money from their homes. As a way to find a more fundamental solution to securing comfortable space for the elderly, the team came up with the idea of “ARIUM.” To complete the project effectively within the limited budget, KDHC found the answer in the third sector development system. For this project, KDHC concluded a social contribution agreement with Seongnam City, a local government, and Kumho Asiana Group, a private enterprise, in October 2007.  Tenants began moving in at ARIUM in April 2009. A total of 19 people became the residents. ARIUM has a number of environment-friendly motifs in line with the concept of KDHC, an energy company. It was designed considering stability and convenience of the elderly. All spaces in all levels have natural lighting. Moreover, a solar heat facilitywas installed on the rooftop to supply hot water, and a ventilation system based on waste heat recovery was installed to minimize heatloss. In effect, ARIUM is an environment-friendly residential welfare facility established under the concept of passive house. Levels 3 ~ 6 consist of individual rooms for 19 residents. Level 2 is an open hall for the elderly from the local areas. In Level 1, Maman Bakery is operated to create jobs for the elderly. KDHC’s Share Happiness Team visits ARIUM monthly to provide continuous services to the residents. ARIUM is a social contribution of a new type; KDHC hopes that this will spread to other companies and serve as a social contribution model throughout the country.   KDHC Korea District Heating Corp.

To address the cultural gap, and to activate the economy in farming villages, KDHC has concluded the 1 company, 1 village sisterhood relationship with Sinheung 2-ri of Namwon-eup, Jeju-do (Nov. 2005) and Jeungdo-myeon of Sinan-gun, Jeollanam-do (Jul. 2007). Each year, KDHC engages in the campaign to encourage the purchase of Korean agricultural products. In 2008 and 2009, residents of Sinheung 2-ri visited KDHC and sold local specialties such as tangerines grown outdoors and Hallabong to the employees. For its part, to take part in publicizing “Camellia Village”as the symbolic brand of Sinheung 2-ri and to participate in the CO2 offsetting project as part of the government’s carbon neutral program, KDHC promoted the project to build a camellia forest along the roadsides in Sinheung 2-ri. For this project, KDHC purchased and planted camellia trees in a 1:1 matching grant method. Messages of hope written by KDHC’s employees were attached to each of the trees planted. In 2008 and 2009, KDHC planted 522 and 500 camellia trees to secure CER of 58 tons and 56 tons, respectively. As such, KDHC is endeavoring to realize harmonious relations between the urban and rural areas by promoting projects considering the characteristics of the sister villages. Donations and Sponsorship  In addition, KDHC supports the socially neglected and social welfare facilities in the areas of head office and branches during the holiday seasons to fulfill its social responsibilities as a public enterprise. KDHC is also supporting patients in hospices or elderly with difficulties in movement by allowing them to enjoy outings. Furthermore, we make donations and send relief goods during disasters and provide regular support to study rooms established for the children of needy families.

Voluntary Service Activities: Voluntary participation by employees and officers  In December 2004, KDHC founded the “Hanan Share Happiness Team,”a voluntary service team based on the voluntary participation of employees and officers. The service team is performing in the areas of support for the socially neglected, environmental protection, and educational support. “Share Happiness Account” consists of the members’wage deductions and donations by KDHC in a 1:1 matching grant method. In 2008 and 2009, KRW 230 million in fund was raised annually.  As a voluntary service community of KDHC,“Stepping Stone” was organized independently by KDHC’s employees. With sponsorship from 150 people, this community has approximately 20 members doing voluntary service activities. “Stepping Stone”supports victims of child violence by subsidizing their educational expenses. The members also visit the children for learning guidance. Furthermore, “Stepping Stone” operates an English class for children of Philippine families and helps children and parents of multicultural families.  Members of the “Yemi Guardian Angel” perform as mentors for the children of Yemi Elementary School with which KDHC has concluded the HR development support project operation agreement. The members help these children, who do not enjoy educational benefits such as educational guidance, program development, and improvement of educational environments. The “Yemi Guardian Angel” consisting of “Yes, I Can,”a team of native English instructors, science learning team, “CC Team”as an urban culture experience team, and “Share IT”team is a great team of support for the children of Yemi Elementary School.  Interview with an ARIUM Resident  Dressed neatly in a suit, Mr. Ji Bong-yul in room 601 is 85 years old. Mr. Ji is a man of surprisingly youthful spirit. “I had to go through a time of loneliness and difficulties for over 50 years, living by myself without a home. But now, I can read the newspaper and take a nap in this clean, comfortable house. I sometimes take a stroll around the village. It is a beautiful and happy home for us, isn’t it? We had no hope, just counting the days until we die. But this place gave us new hope. I finally have hope in my life at the age of 85. I feel as though I am cured of all sicknesses. Now, I have a home, and my life begins today. I would like to thank the people who have given me such hope and courage. Thank you.” June 2009 “KDHC Add Sharing,“ the “District Heating“ house journal  KDHC Korea District Heating Corp. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 69 Interview with Teacher Jang Hye-rim of Yemi Elementary School “The children were most excited about the wetland experience. This is something we cannot experience in Jeongseon. We learned about the organisms that live in the wetland before we came here. To experience them here in reality, even I was able to learn new things. It was a very meaningful time. Each year, our children look forward to June so much when they can come to this cultural experience. Many of them are not well off. Thus, an opportunity like this is all the more precious and special to them.” July 2009 “KDHC Add Sharing,” the “District Heating“ house journal  Interview with Principal Sohn Eui-gon of Bongyang Elementary School “This is the third English camp. Our children have improved their English skills considerably. Not only the children, but their parents are also very much interested in the English camp. We are always thankful to KDHC for their support. For the school, we are also benefiting from the English camp very much. I hope the children will gain confidence in English by attending the English camp and produce greater results in the future.” August 2009 “KDHC Add Sharing,“ the “District Heating“ house journal ➜ � � ● ARIUM Residents ● Bongyang Elementary School Summer English Camp ● Yemi Elementary School Cultural Experience   (Wetland Experience)  KDHC aspires to be a respected company that shares good values with the people of Korea.  Fulfilling responsibilities as a corporate citizen and enhancing management efficiency and objective reliability, KDHC shall continuously advance into the future.  Stakeholder Happy energy of our society: Government  Mission and Strategic Tasks Guided by the goal of aggressively and proactively promoting advancement and management efficiency, KDHC is responding to the government’s policy by pursuing the tasks of selling off its equities and those of its subsidiaries, achieving efficiency in organization management, adjusting the wages of employees and officers, and promoting enterprise-level cost reduction.  Key Issues ● Stock Market Listing  As per the government’s advancement policy, KDHC listed 25% of the stocks issued in the KRX securities market in January 2010 using the method of invitation of the public to new stocks within the range of maintaining 51% of public equity. Therefore, by maintaining 54.1% of public equity (government and KDPCO) with only a fluctuation in the equity rate, the stock market listing did not cause any fluctuation in the public interest of KDHC and the interest and rights of the residents.   ● Selling off Subsidiaries  This was a stock sale of invested companies pursuant to the government’s public organization advancement policy. By expanding the private sector’s market participation, a substantial competition system for the integrated energy business was established. In addition, KDHC achieved management efficiency by spreading the private management techniques and improvement of financial structure through the reestablishment and optimization of the investment structure. ● Efficiency of Organization and HR Management According to the government’s 4th public organization advancement plan, KDHC performed organization diagnosis together with the government and cut down on the use of organization and human resources to estimate the appropriate HR for new businesses and increase the efficiency of organization management.  ● Leadership of Public Enterprise With the integrated energy business entering the phase of growth, the basis of political support is gradually shrinking. To respond actively to the rapidly changing management conditions and the government’s political direction, KDHC is establishing and operating the 10-year mid- to long-term management plans every three years according to its internal rules. Through the strategic execution of management plans, KDHC is ceaselessly endeavoring to create new growth engines of the future that will ensure growth, public interest, and profitability.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 72 According to the government’s 3rd public organization advancement plan (Oct. 10, 2008), KDHC listed 25% of the total stocks issued (2,895,000 stocks) in the KRX securities market using the method of invitation of the public to new stocks within the range of maintaining 51% of the public equity rate (Jan. 29, 2010). At the time of listing, the competition in public subscription was 127.3:1, which was very high. In addition, KRW 2.50 trillion was deposited as subscription payment alone, indicating the market’s high assessment of expectation of KDHC. Therefore, with the exception of fluctuation in the equity rate, there was no fluctuation whatsoever in the public interest and the interest and rights of residents since the public equity (government and KEPCO) was kept at the 54.1% level.

KDHC experienced numerous difficulties in the course of promoting equity selloff due to the stakeholders’ objections with regard to employment instability and damage to public interest. Through conversation and cooperation, however, KDHC successfully completed the procedures under the conditions of realizing mutual benefits. The subsidiary selloff led to the expansion of market participation by the private sector, and this enabled us to establish the system for substantial competition in the integrated energy business. In addition, the equity selloff brought about positive effects for us in terms of realizing management efficiency according to the expansion of private management techniques and improving operation efficiency, such as the improvement of financial structure through the reestablishment and optimization of investment structure.  Efficiency of Organization and  HR Management  According to the government’s 4th public organization advancement plan (Dec. 2008), KDHC restructured the organization into a system of 2 headquarters, 2 divisions, and 1 branch and reduced the staff count by 123. The reduced personnel were transferred to the new business fields in Paju and Pangyo. In addition, KDHC, together with the government, performed organization diagnosis (Oct. 2009~Jan. 2010) to increase operation efficiency and estimate the appropriate personnel for the new business fields. According to the results of the diagnosis, the organization was further reduced to 1 headquarters, 1 branch, and 79 staff. On the other hand, 2 branches (Samsong and Gwanggyo) were installed, and 288 staff were increased in the new business fields. ▼ Persuading the Stakeholders Objecting to the Stock Market Listing KDHC Korea District Heating Corp. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 73 Communication with Stakeholders  KDHC’s advancement process began amid apprehension and objections by stakeholders because it was mistakenly perceived as a stage toward privatization, one that will result in the increase in heat rates and damage to residents’ rights and interests. As such, KDHC organized a number of presentations and talks with the stakeholders to inform them of the necessity of stock market listing and to obtain their consent. In addition, by receiving the government’s definite promise on maintaining the public equity to 51% or higher and legislating the restriction on stockholding by the same person, KDHC was able to complete the stock market listing successfully with the consent of all stakeholders.  ▼ Organization and HR Management Efficiency (unit: KRW 1 million) Classification Reduction Amount Wage return by all employees and officers to overcome the economic crisis 617 Reasonable holiday and leave system (put into effect in 2010) 1,635 Change of the prescribed monthly working hours (184h/month 209h/month) 633 Substituting overtime work with off-duty 489 Change of bonus payment standards 165 Total 3,539 •Improving the financial structure and reducing the financial cost due to capital expansion •Possibility of using new investments due to stable fund supply through the stock market •Preventing infringement on the residents’ rights and interests by securing 51% of public equity ▼ Expected Benefits of Stock Market Listing Management Efficiency Through Compensation Adjustment  In line with the government’s political direction, KDHC has been making all-out efforts to fulfill its social responsibilities as a public enterprise to increase the transparency of the compensation system and to overcome the economic crisis through rational wage and welfare system operation. To overcome the economic crisis in particular, all employees and officers voluntarily returned wages to raise a fund with which jobs were created for the socially neglected (ECO Service Team). In addition, KDHC decreased the duty-off days by improving the holiday and leave system, reduced the overtime work payment by simplifying the prescribed monthly working hours, which serve as the basis of overtime work payment, and substituting overtime work with off-duty hours and lowered the labor cost by improving the bonus payment standards and increasing the depth of gradation. Through these efforts, KDHC achieved the result of saving approximately KRW 3.5 billion in labor cost.  ▼ Economic Effects of Management Advancement Quota 2008 2009 (Advancement)a 2010 (Organization Diagnosis)b Fluctuation (b-a)  Basic Organization 1,057 934 855 ▲79 New Business 59 59 347 288 Total 1,116 993 1,202 209  KDHC Korea District Heating Corp. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 74 Government’s Political Direction  Although the government is continuously pursuing the integrated energy expansion and distribution policies to increase national energy efficiency and to respond to the UNFCCC, the basis of political support is gradually shrinking as the integrated energy business enters a phase of growth. Accordingly, the burden of cost is expected to increase due to the alleviation of the integrated energy zone designation system and annulment of the electric power industry infrastructure fund support for co-generation plants. In addition, for competition requirements, KDHC’s participation in new businesses will be limited, and private participation will be encouraged. This will lead to KDHC’ s market share shrinking to a certain degree. Nonetheless, KDHC plans to promote substantial business expansion in case it is beneficial to the national economy for KDHC to promote businesses in areas where there are no participants or participants falling out by the wayside. In the meantime, KDHC’s district heating activation to lower the peak power load during the summer season and new and renewable energy expansion and distribution policy to reduce greenhouse gas emission will be yet another opportunity of advancement.  ● Response by KDHC To handle promptly the rapidly changing management conditions and to respond actively to the government’s political directions, KDHC is establishing and operating the 10-year mid- to long-term management plans every three years according to its internal rules. Our mid- to long-term management plans consist of management objectives, strategic directions, 9 strategies, and 25 strategic tasks under the corporate philosophy and vision based on the execution of the president’s management policies. Through the strategic execution of the plans, KDHC is ceaselessly endeavoring to create new growth engines of the future that will ensure growth, public interest and profitability. As of the end of 2009, 23 companies are supplying the integrated energy service to 1.87 million households in apt. buildings. The distribution rate is approx. 13% compared to the total housing count (14,388,000). As such, the integrated energy business is about to enter the stage of growth. Accordingly, the competition is becoming fiercer as power generation subsidiaries, city gas companies, and construction companies actively participate in the integrated energy business.

All material findings of the Assurance Provider are provided herein, and detailed findings and recommendations have been submitted to the management of KDHC. [Application Level of the GRI Standard]  It has been confirmed that the Report meets the requirements for Application Level of “A+.”  [Fulfillment Relative to the BEST Guidelines]  In view of the level of reporting rigor and intensity of information provided, the Report meets 94.5% of the reporting requirements for a Level 4 Report among Levels 1 to 5.

Reporting Year 2007 2008 2010 Publications 1st 2nd 3rd Level Level 3 Level 4 Level 4 Fulfillment 96.7% 92.6% 94.5% The Assurance Provider found the KDHC to be aware of the importance of stakeholder communications, and confirmed efforts by the company to collect stakeholder views by developing diverse channels of communication. The company has carried out key stakeholder questionnaires and satisfaction surveys, while providing enhanced coverage of its communication findings in the Report, accompanied by the company’s response and outcomes, as well as stakeholder satisfaction toward the company’s response.  In the future, however, The Assurance Provider recommends setting more segmented targets and strategies for each of the specific dimensions and issues so that the Report can offer a concrete collection of responses that can satisfy the demands of its internal and external stakeholders alike. [Responsiveness] Does the Report address the demand and interest of the stakeholders in an appropriate manner? Q A The Assurance Provider believes the Report to contain information and data of material importance to the KDHC and its stakeholders. The Assurance Provider took note of work by the KDHC to identify sustainability issues of material interest to both its internal and external stakeholders by undertaking analysis of media reports, benchmarking best practice companies, analysis of sustainability standards and guidelines, stakeholder surveys, expert interviews, etc. The Assurance Provider took particular note of the KDHC’s concrete commitment to incorporate key issues identified to be of material stakeholder interest into its management activities, with the Report outlining the company’s intended response to the various issues by dimension. However, as the section on materiality was not broken down into respective stakeholders, it was difficult to assess which set of requirements or issues pertained to which stakeholder group. In the future, The Assurance Provider suggests that the KDHC provide a breakdown of the material issues and the company response not only by sustainability dimension but also by stakeholder as well, in the interest of providing a fuller account of its stakeholder engagement findings and outcomes in its future sustainability management reports. [Materiality] Does the Report cover economic, social and environmental issues of the greatest importance to KDHC and its stakeholders? Q A The Assurance Provider verified efforts by the KDHC to collect stakeholder views and reflect them in its management activities by putting an adequate stakeholder participation process in place designed to engage key stakeholders as defined by the company. The Assurance Provider was highly impressed to see that the company has structured its Report around stakeholder requirements and interests as identified through regular channels of communication specific to each of the stakeholder groups, while providing an in-depth report on those issues as well as the current status of the company’s response. Going forward, however, it is the Auditor’s recommendation that the KDHC put broader company-wide strategies and processes in place to further strengthen its stakeholder engagement, while building a more systematic process of feedback and dialogue between the various business departments collecting the various stakeholder comments and the sustainability management initiatives group so that those engagement findings can be reflected in shaping the company’s sustainability management strategies.  [Inclusivity] Are there appropriate strategies and processes in place for KDHC’s stakeholder engagement with its sustainable growth? Q A  KDHC Korea District Heating Corp. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 78 Appendix Third Party Assurance Statement Glossary     Response to the ISO 26000     GRI Index     Membership Status      About the Sustainable Management TFT Recommendations Relative to the prior year’s report, The Assurance Provider found the KDHC’s “2009 Sustainability Report” to be highly commendable on the following counts. 1) The KDHC acted on the Auditor’s recommendation to provide more coverage on key stakeholder views as assessed through various communication channels as well as the company’s response through case study examples; 2) provided an easy-to-understand snapshot view of its major achievements during the reporting period by presenting a separate section on 2009 sustainability highlights; and 3) offered a detailed account of the company’s response for each of the key dimension-specific issues allowing readers an inside look into the company’s efforts toward sustainability management. We recommend the following factors to be considered for the future publications: •Establish a system for the integrated management of data from each of the three economic, social, and environmental dimensions, to support on-going management of performance data through regular assessments and management of performance relative to targets.  •Adopt a system whereupon the management team has immediate actionable access to issues of high stakeholder interest and risk that can be reflected into actual management strategies rather than merely being reported upon to the Board of Directors.   •Provide case studies of current practices and actual application for system implementations as well as improvements rather than merely listing outcomes or providing a summary outline to present KDHC’s activities and performance more objectively.  •Produce accurate and comparable performance data to satisfy stakeholders’ right to be informed. •Strengthen reporting on negative as well as positive outcomes in the interest of objectivity and credibility. •For repetitive Report items, present summary outlines alongside links to websites containing full reported content.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 80 Appendix Third Party Assurance Statement    Glossary     Response to the ISO 26000 GRI Index     Membership Status      About the Sustainable Management TFT Response to the ISO 26000 ■ Overview of ISO 26000 ISO 26000 (Guidance on Social Responsibility) was decided as standard development by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) in 2004 in accordance with the need for a new paradigm for resolving issues in international society -- such as poverty and inequality caused by globalization -- in handling the environmental risks resulting from economic growth and development and for the sustainable existence and prosperity of the human race. This international standard on social responsibility developed for a period of 5 years from the 1st WG meeting in March 2005 to the 8th in May 2010 is scheduled for release at the end of this year.  This international standard was prepared by the representative experts of stakeholders in the 6 areas of consumers, government, indostry, labor, NGO, and other service·support·research and others to provides the guidance on the underlying principles of social responsiblity, the core subjects and issues pertaining to social responsibility and on ways to integrate into the organization. In other words, ISO 26000 is intended to assist organizations in contributing sustainable development and applies to all types of organizations regardless of their size or location.  ISO 26000 is not a management system standard subject to third party certification, but a guidence. It is intended to encourage them voluntary to go beyond legal compliance, respect for stakeholder and continuous improvement process. Note, however, that this standard recommends the fulfillment of social responsibility not only by the organization itself but also within the sphere of the organization’s influence. Therefore, ISO 26000 is to be used widely as partner registration management standard by global enterprises intending to satisfy the high expectations of stakeholders or as an assessment, monitoring standard by consumers and NGOs. Accordingly, in actively responding to the publication of ISO 26000, KDHC is advised to identify the impacts on society and environment by the company’s decisions and activities and to secure competitiveness and sustainability through the identification of stakeholders and establishment of the social responsibility management system. ▼ ISO 26000 Clause 1 Scope Guidance to all types  of organizations, regardless of their size or location Clause 2 Terms and definition definitions of key terms Clause 3 Understanding social responsibility History and characteristics; relationship between socia responsibility and sustainable development Clause 4 Principles of social responsibility Accountability Transparency Ethical behavior Respect for stakeholder interests Respect for the rule of law Respect for the international  norms of behavior Respect for human rights  Two fundamental practices of social responsibility Clause 5 Clause 7 Social responsibility core subjects Clause 6 Recognizing social responsibility Organizational governance Stakeholder identification and engagement Human rights Labor practices The environment Fair operating practices Consumer issues community involvement and development Related actions and expectations Communication on social responsibility Practices for integrating social responsibility throughout an organization  Reviewing and improving an organization’s actions and practices related to social responsibility Enhancing credibility regarding social responsibility Understanding the social responsibility of the organization the Relationship of an organization’s characteristics to social responsibility Bibliography : Authoritative sources and additional guidance Appendix : Examples of voluntary initiatives and tools for social responsibility  � � � � � � � � � � Maximizing an organization’s contribution to  Sustainable development Integrating social  responsibility  throughout an  organization Voluntary initiative for social responsibility  KDHC Korea District Heating Corp. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT·2009 81 Appendix Third Party Assurance Statement    Glossary     Response to the ISO 26000 GRI Index     Membership Status      About the Sustainable Management TFT ■ Assessment of ISO 26000 Fulfillment Level of KDHC The Korean Standards Association assessed the social responsibility management system of KDHC by dividing the process of social responsibility fulfillment into 8 stages pursuant to the ISO 26000/DIS (Draft international standard) and the performance levels for each of the 7 core subjects.  KDHC is executing the social responsibility management system implementation strategies it has established, guided by the vision of becoming the Best Environment-friendly Energy Company. Recognizing its social responsibilities, KDHC has operated various channels of communication with stakeholders to reduce the negative impacts on the society and environment. Through these channels, KDHC is identifying key issues. In addition, KDHC is endeavoring to make use of the core competencies and resources while considering the expectations and interests of society.  To enhance transparency and satisfy accountability, KDHC should further strengthen the process of implementing the relationship of reliability with stakeholders. In other words, KDHC should improve its activities and operating practices by reflecting stakeholders’ opinions in the decision-making process and structure. In addition, KDHC is advised to establish a system through which it can enhance performance by strategically executing activities promoting the social responsibilities of other organizations not only within the company but also within the range of its influence.
