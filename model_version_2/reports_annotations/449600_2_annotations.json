We have multidimensional and  effective risk management systems  in place  The Board of Directors primary  responsibility is to establish and  execute Akbanks Risk Management  System. The Board of Directors,  with the assistance of the Audit  Committee and the Executive  Risk Committee, assess current  developments and determine  Akbanks main risk categories. The Risk Management, Information  Risk Management, Internal Control,  Compliance, and the Inspection  Board, which report directly to  the Board of Directors, perform  coordination and assessment  functions to ensure the expected  efficacy. Market risk Market risks emerging due to  fluctuations in foreign exchange  rates, interest rates, and market  prices of stocks are measured by  using internationally-recognized  models. Limits are identified and  compliance with these limits is  continuously monitored.  While the Board regularly reviews  the limits, the Risk Management  function as appointed by the Board  is in charge of making necessary  changes as per market conditions  and strategies. The regular meetings held by the  Market Risk Committee at the level  of Senior Management ensure that  material events in terms of market  risk are addressed and necessary  action is taken. In 2019, Akbank successfully  fulfilled the Risk Management  Function under the responsibility of  the Board of Directors. The Board of  Directors, which evaluates current  developments in collaboration  with the Audit Committee and the  Executive Risk Committee, played  a decisive role in determining the  risk categories of the Bank and  taking the necessary measures.  The Risk Management, Internal  Control, Compliance, and Inspection  Board, which report to the Board of  Directors, successfully fulfilled their  coordination and assessment role,  delivering the expected efficiency. Risk management processes fully  supported by our employees  At Akbank, we shape our activities  in line with our long-term strategy  and objectives. We adopt a multi- dimensional approach involving  risk management, legal compliance  and environmental & social impact  analyses in key matters such  as credit allocation, portfolio/ investment preferences, and new  product and activity decisions.  In line with this approach, our   48 RISK MANAGEMENT AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE Our risk management processes We establish limits at various levels including company,  group, sector and country so as to closely monitor and  control our credit risk. Furthermore, global developments  are closely monitored, and innovative studies are  conducted accordingly. Liquidity risk  We established a liquidity  management framework for  maintaining required liquidity  resources to perform legal liabilities  in a timely manner to depositors,  creditors and institutions that  Akbank has made a commitment  to. Akbank protects itself from any  negative impacts to be caused  by liquidity risks thanks to its  widespread deposit base, robust  capital structure, and diversified  domestic and foreign borrowing  sources. In addition, extra liquidity  sources are made available with  limits allocated by the Central Bank,  BIST Repo Market, Settlement  and Custody Bank Money Market  and the banks as well as the liquid  securities portfolio in hand. By being  cautious in foreign currency liquidity  management, reserves sufficient  to fulfill liquidity needs are  maintained and swap transactions  are effectively used. The liquidity  status is continuously monitored  through liquidity stress tests  performed periodically. The results  of the stress test guide Akbanks  liquidity risk management strategy  and policy. Akbank manages its  liquidity risk in compliance with the  liquidity risk appetite described in  this framework policy.  and disruptions in information  technology systems, and natural  disasters. Akbank makes efficient  use of mechanisms such as  differentiated and diversified  controls, insurance, and limitation  to manage operational risks  associated with all risk categories,  primarily legal risk and compliance  risk. The Operational Risk  Committee, which was established  at the senior management level in  2011, discusses subjects that are of  importance from an operational risk  perspective and actively monitors  the actions taken at its regularly  held meetings.  Reputation Risk  Reputation risk is a significant  risk in terms of sustainability  management. All Akbank  employees, notably the Board  of Directors, are responsible for  the management of this risk.  As part of the management of  this risk, policies and practices  were identified in such areas as  full compliance with legislation,  establishing and exercising  trust-based relationships with  stakeholders, efficient and fast  solutions to customer complaints.  These have been put down in  writing. Akbank Ethical Principles  serve as an important guide in this  sense. Credit risk All banking products bearing  credit risk are managed with the  assistance from prudent loan  policies and procedures in Akbank.  Akbank also utilizes internal rating  notes and scores, calculated by the  internal models developed to assess  new loan requests, regularly monitor  the existing loan portfolio, and  determine the provisions to be set  aside for loans. We establish limits at various  levels including company, group,  sector and country so as to closely  monitor and control our credit risk.  Furthermore, global developments  are closely monitored, and  innovative studies are conducted  accordingly. Machine learning  techniques are incorporated into  model development and validation  processes, and efficiency of such  processes is enhanced. Operational risk Another area considered to be a  risk category for Akbanks core  activities is operational risk.  According to Akbank, the sources  for operational risk are overlooking  errors and irregularities during the  controls of business processes,  senior managements or employees  failure to act in accordance with  the time and conditions, mistakes   49 AKBANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 Legal Risk  Operating flawlessly in terms of  compliance with legislation is  number one priority for us. For  following legislation related to the  banking sector and adaptation  to developments and changes,  various departments work to ensure  compliance in the Banks systemic  infrastructure, business processes,  rules, and limits. New Product and Service Risk In addition to the risks identified  in existing products and activities,  risks that may arise from the  development of new products  and services are also assessed.  Potential financial, operational,  legal and reputational risks of  newly-developed products or  services; methods to be used in  measuring and managing these  risks; and control mechanisms  to be established are identified  with the contribution from related  departments of the Bank. Since 2011, the New Product and  Service Evaluation Committee,  comprising managers of all  departments involved in product  development, decides on the  suitability of all products and  services in terms of legislation  and technical qualifications.  New products and services are  introduced once the Board of  Directors approves the extensive  risk assessment made by the  Committee.  Clean Banking Risk At Akbank, Clean Banking Risk  is defined as the Banks and its  employees unfair practices or  behaviors that affect customers,  stakeholders or markets, and lead  to damage to customers, financial  penalties or loss of reputation.  As part of Clean Banking efforts,  Akbanks and its employees  behavior not only complies with  applicable legislation but also  uphold customers interests.  We believe that Clean Banking  Principles are important in terms of  the better managing of operational  and reputational risks, eliminating of  possible legal risks and establishing  sustainable customer relations.     Conformity: Services or  products provided or sold to  customers, and product/service  recommendations should  conform to the customers risk  profile, expectations and needs,  financial condition, and financial  literacy level.      Disclosure: Customers should  be provided with detailed  information on our products/ services, before, during and  after sales; the information  thus provided should be  comprehensible by customers  with a low level of financial  literacy.     Customer Approval: For  products/ services, customer  approval documents should  be clear and understandable;  customers confirmation must  be received for unclear issues;  necessary screens/flows should  be designed to receive clear  approval from the customer  for products/ services offered  through distant channels;  voice records and other audit  trace records of customer  confirmation must be kept.      Terms and Conditions:  Customers should be informed in  a timely, accurate, complete and  transparent manner as regards  contract terms and conditions,  and risks related to products/ services; customers rights and  responsibilities should be clearly  stated, and there should be no  misleading information about  the terms and conditions.     Pricing: Setting, declaring and  implementing prices according  to our policies (the Bank  may refrain from announcing  interest rates for risk premium,  profitability and other   purposes - except for retail  customers); standardization  of fee/commission/expense  collection and return processes.     Discrimination: There can be no  discrimination among customers  on the basis of religion, language,  race, age, gender, political  orientation, and the like and our  product/service quality cannot  vary according to these criteria.      Market Integrity: Market integrity  and public interest must be held  in all transactions performed;  transactions that harm  competition and market integrity  shall not be performed.      Care for Vulnerable Customers:  Customers who can understand  and use the content, return and  risk information of our banking  products and services to a  limited extent due to their age,  health condition, education level,  income status or language are  defined as vulnerable customers.  We place extra emphasis on  vulnerable customers with  higher exposure to Clean  Banking risks. We also think  that incompetence in financial  matters (2.4/a Inherent Factors)  - an inherent factor constituting  a Clean Banking risk - sets the  ground for customer vulnerability. Information Risk Management At Akbank, we pay utmost attention  to the management of cyber and  fraud risks in a digitalized and  globalized world. To this end, we  take a stakeholder approach to  information risk management,  adopting the principle of effective  management of information risks  relating to the Bank, customers,  investors, business partners and the  sector. We take all the necessary  measures for data security and  privacy in accordance with all  applicable laws - first and foremost,  Personal Data Protection Law  (PDPL) - to provide the most secure  banking services for our customers.  50 RISK MANAGEMENT AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE Our risk management processes Our Cyber Security Center is operational on a 24/7 basis  to monitor, respond to, and handle cyber threats, incidents  and security vulnerabilities. Established to ensure information  security risks and fraud risks are  supervised directly by the Board,  Information Risk Management  directly reports to the Board.  Akbank is one of the few companies  worldwide to implement this  model, and the only bank to do so  in the Turkish banking industry.  This model provides an effective,  holistic and independent approach  to information risk, by gathering  information security risks and  fraud risks under a single umbrella  and separating them from other  technology risks. As part of this  structure, we have also established  the Information Risk Management  Committee where such risks are  managed with the involvement of  the Senior Management. Our Cyber Security Center is  operational on a 24/7 basis to  monitor, respond to, and handle  cyber threats, incidents and  security vulnerabilities. The  maturity level of the Cyber Security  Center is regularly evaluated by  international firms, and Akbank  attains positive, above-the-sector  results globally in these evaluations.  We make use of the best  technologies in this field to  guarantee data security and  confidentiality. Measures related  with data security and privacy are  become more complex – depends  not only on technology but also  people. Therefore, we work with  experienced professionals and human  resources who constantly learn and  practice in the field of information  risk management. We achieve that  goal with efforts undertaken in  collaboration with the People and  Culture Department. We work to ensure that employees  take precautions against cybercrime,  and to enhance the Banks protection  against cyber threats, through  awareness-raising programs for  all employees. We also regularly  undertake efforts to increase the  awareness of customers against risks  while they are using digital banking  products. By focusing on customers  in these efforts, we made significant  progress in minimizing the risks and  losses resulting directly from fraud. The Information Risk Controls team,  formed to perform controls solely  in this field, regularly monitors the  effectiveness of activities aimed  at managing cyber and fraud risks  and information security & privacy  measures.  We also collaborate with public  enterprises, the market and  associations so as to safeguard  the sector through a stakeholder  approach. incorporated into all our processes.  We also make sure to implement  necessary security measures at the  time of use, storage and internal/ external transfer of sensitive data,  as identified in data classification  (such as minimum authorization/ encryption/encipherment/ anonymization/monitoring the  access, use and transfer). We  consider the information risk of new  services, and the security of our  technology systems infrastructure  that enables these services, at  the initial design and development  stage. This is how we can provide  services with minimized risks right  on the first day.  In addition to ongoing  improvements and upgrades to  prevent cyber and fraud threats, we  focus on capabilities and processes  in overcoming an incident with  minimum harm. To this end, we  revise the processes continuously.  We established integrated and  coordinated processes to keep the  impact of a detected incident at  minimum while completing needed  upgrades at all relevant points. As a  result of such effective processes,  losses caused by fraud remain  below the sector average. Effective management of  information risk and fraud – which  constantly change, evolve, and   51 AKBANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 Our internal audit  infrastructure The effective functioning of our internal control and audit  infrastructure is a responsibility of all Akbank staff, first  and foremost the Board. Audit Committees function is to  aid the Board of Directors in its  activities in this context.  The control environment has been  defined as per the applicable rules  and structured in a manner to  contribute to all business processes. To this end, the Banks internal  control efficiency was secured with  mechanisms such as:      Identification of functional  differences, separation of the  functions of marketing and  operations,     Documentation of job definitions  and specific responsibilities  in the control system of each  employee at every level,     Documentation of all workflows  and checkpoints throughout  the Bank via Business Process  Management (BPM),     Establishment of information  systems that are in compliance  with the volume and quality of  our activities,     Establishment of effective and  comprehensive communication  channels,     Receiving and implementing  employee opinions regarding  processes and activities.

Branch controls and monitoring  systems In 2019, we also adopted an  innovative and risk-oriented  mindset and performed branch  controls that involved all the  banking processes set forth by the  BRSA. Following a risk-oriented  approach, we checked in-branch  transactions, as well as transactions  performed on digital banking and  non-branch channels, and led the  relevant improvement efforts.

We also provide necessary  information for SMEs to access  special sources of funding.  In 2019, we continued to implement  CaseCampus, a young entrepreneur  program organized together with  Endeavor Foundation, in a four- day bootcamp format. During the  CaseCampus program, participants  had the opportunity to become  closely acquainted with the world of  entrepreneurship via workshops and  trainings focused on entrepreneurial  thinking.  We also organized the  StartUpCampus Entrepreneurship  Program in 2019. Launched in 2018,  StartUpCampus enables growth  for young entrepreneurs who have  recently started their own business  and launched their products to  the market. In cooperation with  Endeavor Foundation, we provided  training, workshop, and mentorship  support to entrepreneurs for 10  weeks starting from November.

In addition  to the existing environmental  and social provisions in our credit  contracts, we provide for other  environmental and social conditions  specific to the funded project. We expand the scope of the  Environmental and Social Impact  Assessment (ESIA) for a better  control over the impacts. We reduced our threshold for ESIA  to USD 10 million by the end of 2019,  from USD 20 million in 2018 and  USD 50 million in 2017. This is how  we intend to keep the environmental  and social impact of all the projects  we pursue under control in the  coming period. We perform detailed  analyses and measurements on the  environmental and social impacts of  investment credits of over USD 50  million. In 2019, we examined four projects  thoroughly under ESIA. As a result  of examinations, one project was  categorized as high-risk, two as  medium-risk and one as low- risk. We decided to finance two  renewable energy projects, worth  USD 194 million in total, which were  in the medium-risk category, and  assigned independent consultants  to measure the environmental  and social impacts of these  projects. Working with independent  consultants, we formulated plans  and procedures to identify these  projects environmental and  social impact and minimize them.  Independent consultants monitor  the projects also in the construction  and operation phases.  In 2019, Akbanks ESIA team  took part in visits for nine project  sites and examined them first  hand together with independent  consultants. During the site visits,  our ESIA team also had talks with  the local communities affected  by the projects and thus had the  chance to better understand their  environmental and social impact. Assessment of non-financing  activities list in loan allocation  process We evaluate all the loans regardless  of amount as per the Akbank  Environmental and Social Lending  Policies and analyze each  commercial loan we extend as to  whether they fall under the Non- Financing Activities List, which  is an integral part of Akbanks  environmental and social policy. We  have established effective control  Akbank has a robust environmental  and social lending policy in place  so as to manage the environmental  and social risks arising from lending  activities. We pay attention  to environmental, social and  governance elements of all our  business models. We perform a  comprehensive environmental  and social risk assessment for the  loans we extend to the customers  in the Corporate and Commercial  Banking segments. Furthermore,  we have a distinctive position  vis-a-vis general sector-wide  practices thanks to the social and  environmental risk assessments  we conduct for all SME customers.  Priority is given to lending to  projects that improve environmental  conditions, such as renewable  energy investments, waste recycling  investments, carbon emission  reduction, and productivity  increasing investments.  We revise our environmental and  social lending policies in line with  local and global developments In an effort to minimize the  negative impact we may create on  communities and the environment  due to our lending activities, we  revise our environmental and social  lending policies every year in line  At Akbank, our aim is to keep the environmental and social  impact of all the projects we pursue under control in the  coming period.  62 VALUE ADDED TO OUR CUSTOMERS Our environmental and social  risk management for lending processes mechanisms in this area thanks to  the infrastructure improvements in  2019. Through systemic controls, we  identify the customers who may be  involved in such restricted sectors,  and visit them on site to perform  detailed analyses before making a  decision of allocation. In 2019, this  new system allowed us to identify  31 credit applications as activities  not to be credited from among  170 applications and rejected the  credit allocation requests for these  projects. You may reach Akbanks Non- Financing Activities List at https:// www.akbankinvestorrelations.com/ en/images/pdf/NON_FINANCING_ ACTIVITIES_LIST.pdf Environmental and social impact  assessment factors in credit  allocation processes We seek the following criteria as  part of the Environmental and  Social Impact Assessment System:  New investment projects requesting  finance (or credit requests) are  classified as high, medium and low  risk as a result of an assessment of  their potential environmental and  social impacts.  The Bank demands an  Environmental and Social  Assessment Report and Action Plan  to be issued by an independent  consultant for all projects and loan  requests with high and medium  risk. This Environmental and Social  Action Plan (List of Environmental  and Social Commitments) is also  included in the agreement reached  with the client. In efforts to manage environmental  and social risks in high and medium  risk projects, we take into account  the following issues:     Stakeholder engagement and  complaint mechanism processes,      Company compliance with  Occupational Health and Safety  (OHS) legal and regulatory  requirements during both  current business activities and  investment activities,     Proximity of the project to the  wetlands identified under the  RAMSAR Convention,      Presence of a Resettlement  Action Plan in land acquisition  projects involving physical or  economic resettlement,      Presence of a plan to minimize  tree cutting in projects, and if  tree cutting is inevitable, a plan  to compensate for the trees and  forest areas to be destroyed,  Additional assessment criteria  that differ from sector to sector  are applied in sectors with  high environmental and social  risks. Within this scope, mining,  energy, chemicals (including  petrochemicals), infrastructure  & transport, and production  (machinery, equipment, food and  fishing) are identified as high  risk industries in terms of their  environmental and social impacts.  Regardless of the industry, a  project finance/investment loan is  considered risky if;     There is an ongoing lawsuit on  their environmental or social  impact,      Its impact on local communities  results in a strong resistance  among society,     It affects critical habitat,      It involves a large-scale  resettlement/expropriation,     It is located near sensitive or  protected sites.  The environmental and social risks  arising from the activities currently  performed by the company  requesting a loan, and how these  risks are managed are also taken  into account in this evaluation  process.  The environmental and social risks arising from the  activities currently performed by the company requesting  a loan, and the manner to manage these risks are taken  into account in risk assessment.  63 AKBANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019     Amount of additional  greenhouse gas emissions and  the ensuing carbon cost in  operation time of projects with  high carbon emission risk,     Processes to assess the impact  on biodiversity,     Customers existing or work- in-progress Environmental and  Social Management Systems. We work with independent  consultants, experts in their  respective fields, to keep the  environmental and social impact of  the projects we fund under control For high and medium risk projects,  we work with independent  consultants who are experts in their  respective fields, demonstrating  their proficiency with references.  We seek compliance with not  only Turkish laws but also with  international standards in  independent consultants reports. The independent consultant issues  an Environmental and Social  Situation Report after the detailed  analysis of the EIA/ESIA report on  the project to be funded. The report  provides a gap analysis in line with  the local laws and best practices in  the world. For the matters identified  in the gap analysis to be tackled,  action plans are developed and  monitored by experts.  We continue capacity-building  initiatives through closely  monitoring national and  international developments In order to monitor the  developments on environmental and  social issues closely, we continued  to participate in numerous training  courses, conferences, webinars,  working groups and workshops  on the management of such  risks in the sector, while getting  actively involved in discussions  and providing opinion during these  events in 2019.  social impact of projects and  investment activities, from the  construction phase to the operation  phase, and even the sign-off phase  in certain sectors (such as mining). We care about the sensitivities of  local communities We investigate the issues related  with the projects we fund, such as  the local communitys reactions  to the project. Organizing  stakeholder engagement meetings,  we make sure to keep the local  community informed, encourage  the establishment of complaint  mechanisms and take the opinions  and expectations into account.  During the project, the main  focus shifts to compliance with  occupational health and safety  standards. We audit the working  conditions of workers on site and  support the improvement of existing  conditions.  Accurate assessment process in  high risk projects  In the credit allocation processes  of medium and high-risk projects,  Akbank evaluates whether the  company has an environmental and  social policy. The Bank analyzes  whether a company with such a  policy possesses Environmental  and Social Management Systems  and the adequate human resources  organization to carry out the  efforts defined by these systems  at the point of application. When  necessary, Akbank offers capacity  development opportunities to its  clients.  Via the Environmental and Social  Management System (ESMS),  we manage SME customers  environmental and social risks  together with them. As part of the loan contract  we signed with IFC in 2010,  we established the Akbank  Environmental & Social  Management System (ESMS),  Measuring and monitoring the  environmental and social risks of  the companies that are extended a  loan, and equipping our employees  with the competencies required in  this area are among our priorities.  In this regard, 30 employees in  the project finance and credit  allocation units were delivered  thorough in-class training on the  Turkish legislation, international  standards and best practices  related with environmental, social  and OHS topics in 2019. In 2019,  310 fieldworkers also took the  online training modules developed  as part of our environmental and  social lending policies and practices  and revised in light of recent  developments. Utilizing in-class and  online training models, we continue  to deliver awareness training on  best practices in the world and  sustainability topics to thousands  of employees. Assessment under the responsibility  of Credit Allocation and relevant  business units  The Environmental and Social  Impact Assessment Team, Akbank  branches, Corporate, Commercial,  Retail, Investment Banking, and  Credit Allocation Business Units  are responsible for the evaluation of  loans in terms of compliance with  the policies and preparation of the  required action plans. Loans are  approved by the Credit Committee  within the Board of Directors or  any other allocation unit that is  authorized by the Board.

We have also  successfully continued system  enhancements since the same  year. This process has become  quantifiable and assessable upon  the assignment of a Social and  Environmental Risk Score to each  SME borrower via the Decision  Making Matrix added to the system  infrastructure.  In the meanwhile, we evaluate the  necessary measures and develop  action plans to minimize existing  risks together with the SME  borrowers while extending loans  to those borrowers we consider  risky. Customer representatives  and Regional ESMS Officers  conduct regular customer visits  to monitor first hand whether the  commitments within such action  plans are fulfilled. The Regional ESMS Officers pay  regular visits to examine customers  environmental and social risks  on-site and support them to take  corrective actions. Participation  in the ESMS teams is provided  by the Treasury Business Unit on  matters related to funds secured  from overseas institutions; by the  Legal Department on applications  of the Turkish Environmental Laws  and potential amendments to  the legislation; and by the Human  Resources Department on issues  concerning the Labor Law and  worker safety.

In parallel with the increasing  investments in this field, the Bank  plans to continue to formulate  compelling funding options in terms  of maturity and cost in the coming  period. Energy efficiency loan by OPIC  In an effort to ensure the  sustainability of the Banks support  for renewable energy projects,  Akbank signed an agreement  for a 15-year, USD 175 million  credit facility with Overseas  Private Investment Corporation  (OPIC), the development finance  institution of the United States,  in October 2014. Through this  attractive loan package, Akbank  financed customers energy  efficiency investments in addition  to machinery and equipment  purchases that achieve energy  savings of at least 20% as well as  Renewable Energy investments. Allocation of MidSEFF funds from  EBRD to renewable energy projects In October 2015 and June 2016, we  signed agreements with the EBRD  for two loans totaling USD 220  million with a maturity of 12 years,  in order to continue our support  for renewable energy projects.  With this loan package, which  offers attractive opportunities for  investors, we financed renewable  energy investments totaling USD  208 million in 2015-2017. We  continued to extend the remainder  of the loan throughout 2019.  100% of energy project financing  goes to renewable energy projects At Akbank, we adopt a responsible  investment approach to combat  environmental problems, climate  change in particular. We reduced  the threshold for Environmental and  Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) to  USD 10 million by the end of 2019,  from USD 20 million in 2018 and  USD 50 million in 2017. This way, we  aim at keeping the environmental  and social impact of all the projects  we fund under control in the coming  period. We evaluate investment  credits of USD 50 million and above,  regardless of credit amount and  maturity limits, by measuring their  environmental and social impacts  with detailed analyses. We also  evaluate all the extended loans as  per our Environmental and Social  Lending Policy and check whether  We are the supporter of  investments in Turkeys sustainable  development At Akbank, we use our own  resources as well as borrowings  from international funding facilities  to develop financing solutions for  energy efficiency and renewable  energy projects, which we consider  as crucial areas in terms of  sustainability initiatives. We support the development of  the energy sector in Turkey, and  thus the minimization of reliance on  foreign energy resources. Observing  the environmental impact in project  financing activities, we have  undertaken exemplary initiatives in  the sector in 2019. We prioritize lending to renewable  energy projects Foreign reliance on energy  plays an important role in the  current account deficit, one of  Turkeys biggest problems. For  this reason, energy investments  that will decrease reliance on  imported energy resources such  as natural gas and coal are of  huge importance.

The digital transformation hub:  Akbank Innovation Center Akbank Innovation Center (Akbank  LAB) was established in late 2016  with a view towards developing  innovative projects suited for  the needs of business units,  achieving perfect digital customer  experience by integrating globally  proven financial solutions into the  Banks processes, and reaching  our goal of impeccable customer  experience. With this structure, we  not only started to prepare for the  technology of the future from today,  but also took steps to ensure that  innovation becomes an integral  part of the Banks culture and the  innovation ecosystem in Turkey is  supported.  Akbank LAB has a central team  coordinating the innovation  processes open to the entire  organizational structure. Business  units develop ideas in line with the  focus areas and targets set by the  Bank. These ideas are then turned  into projects to deliver value-added  financial services. Ideas deemed to  be successful after undergoing a  series of assessments proceed to  the PoC (proof of concept) phase.  At this stage, the feasibility of these  ideas is tested and possible gains  for customers and the Bank are  calculated. We have undertaken  around 20 projects to date in  various fields, including machine  learning, blockchain and facial  recognition, and implemented most  of them. We have a host of fintech  companies in Turkey and abroad,  which act as our solution partners.  Trail-blazing projects with high  added-value in the sector - such  as customized smart tips launched  within Akbank Mobile in 2019 and  use of machine learning in credit  processes - were deployed thanks  to such partnerships in coordination  with Akbank LAB. Akbank LAB  also aims to become an important  player within the innovation and  entrepreneurship ecosystem by  We establish solution partnerships with a group of FinTechs  in and outside Turkey.

Akbanks transparent and flexible  Performance Management System  is capable of responding to changing  needs and conducive to improvement  in managing the individual expertise  and experience of its employees  effectively in accordance with  its corporate goals. To sustain  the Banks successful financial  performance, Akbank Head Office  employees have performance  evaluations once a year while field  staff are evaluated twice each year.  As a result of this evaluation, areas  of development are identified for  employees and various training  and development opportunities  are organized in these areas to  support their career development.  Accordingly, employees get the  opportunity to continue their Akbank  careers in other business units based  on organizational needs and their  own preferences. The goals of the Performance  Management System, which is  developed with a management  approach that supports and  encourages high-level performance,  are to:     Enable Akbank employees to  realize our corporate goals  and to increase our corporate  performance,     Guide and develop employees in  order to meet their changing and  evolving needs better, upon the transparency, simplicity  and accurate measurement of the  system. In addition, an efficient  performance management system  should have the capability to provide  staff members with accurate  feedback and allow them to monitor  their performance easily. Thanks  to the new system developed to  respond to these requirements,  employees can track their  performance via the mobile channel. Effective mechanisms for the  evaluation of senior managements  performance  The performance evaluation of  Akbanks senior management is  based on both the Banks overall  year-end performance and  success criteria that support long- term sustainable performance.  Accordingly, Senior Managements  performance is measured based  on criteria such as financial, risk,  service quality and human resources.  Therefore, senior managements  indicators of goals and success also  include performance criteria such as  customer satisfaction and employee  satisfaction, in addition to financial  criteria. Sustainable career management  policy  The career management function  plays a strategic business partner  role in supporting the realization     Align the Banks goals with the  personal goals of employees,     Ensure that employees  understand what is expected of  them better, get involved with  their jobs and stay motivated to  attain their targets,     Encourage continuous  development via open  communication and regular  feedback and to increase  motivation,     Evaluate contributions and the  performance of employees in a  fair and objective manner and to  shape their competences in line  with our requirements,     Make correct decisions about  career planning, training and  other HR processes of employees  and to ensure their personal  development in line with such  processes. Staff productivity on the rise with  self-assessment and self-targeting  We revamped our Performance  Management System to boost  its efficiency and employee  productivity. One innovation  introduced is allowing employees  to set their own targets, share  their views about their targets  with the respective managers  all the year round, and receive  feedback from managers. We  believe that the efficiency of the  performance system depends  Performance management  focused on continuous  development  81 AKBANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 of the Banks objectives. To this  end, Akbanks priority is to position  the efficient and systematic HR  activities and the existing human  resources in the right way while  creating effective medium- and  long-term career plans to ensure the  development of the Bank and the  employee.  Our fair and effective performance  management Pursuing a career development  policy that gives priority to  promotions and transfers from  within the organization, Akbank  successfully continued efforts  to develop a fair and effective  performance management function;  identify, monitor and develop skills;  and provide career opportunities for  employees where they can prove  themselves in 2019. To ensure the  continuity of the organization in  the future, we devised succession  plans for each position based on the  level of experience, competencies  and technical skills of employees;  implemented the training and  development programs to prepare  the related employees for the  envisioned positions; and closely  monitored the course of action in  conjunction with the business unit.  In addition, branches and units were  visited to make career interviews,  paving the way for effective  communication in terms of career  development.  Special career maps for employees  Career maps that encompass career  steps for our employees are posted  on the portal Bizbize (Among  Us). As a result, Akbank staff can  receive detailed information on  career maps and job families as  well as the contact information  of the Career Advisor assigned to  support them and consult with them  regarding their career development.  Furthermore, employees can view  the position they apply for, their  application status, track, and seize  the career opportunities announced  within the organization.

Some  14% of this is deducted from the  employees salary and 19.5% is the  contribution of Akbank. In addition,  premiums amounting to 2% of total  annual revenues of employees are  deposited by Akbank to the Trusts  account, again on condition that  these are within the stated limits. In order to earn the right to benefit  from retirement, employees  should fulfill requirements such  as completing a certain period  of insurance, having fully paid  premiums for the required number  of days, and having reached a  certain age. Employees who fulfill  these conditions are provided with  pension by Akbank Staff Retirement  Fund Trust upon their request. In  calculating the pension, the main  parameters are the working period  of the employee, total income  within this period and age, as well  as consumer price index change  rates and development rates in  our country. Due to such variable  parameters, monthly pensions may  differ for each employee. Optional Private Pension System  with corporate contributions  In addition to the Aksandk pension,  Akbank employees are also offered  Private Pension System (PPS)  Services with some corporate  contribution. Employees on the  determined level are included in this  PPS plan with corporate contribution  option. Our Bank contributes to  savings of such employees by  making additional payments to  the PPS contracts of the above- mentioned employees at a certain  ratio of their monthly gross salary.  Thus, we help Akbank employees  make savings and continue with  the same living standards in their  retirement. In order to improve employee  loyalty and motivation, we attach  special importance to the PPS with  corporate contribution and try to  increase the number of employees  participating in this plan. As a result  of such efforts, the number of  employees participating in PPS with  corporate contribution reached 5,774  at year-end 2019. Akbank Employee: Mirror of the Future With the talent management and  skill development program, Akbank  Employee: Mirror of the Future, we  developed a new approach equipped  with tools that would enable Akbank  employees to develop new skills,  support their personal development  and transform their potential into  performance.  Akbank Employee: Mirror of the  Future offers all Akbank employees  a complete toolkit to explore  themselves, capitalize on their  strengths and identify areas for  improvement. The program enables  our leaders, as well as employees  themselves, to closely monitor Akbank  staffs competencies and skills.

Continuous development and  training to achieve shared goals  Akbanks training system, which  has strategic significance for the  Bank, supports the development  of all employees and aims to  increase their motivation and job  satisfaction. In full awareness  of the fact that information is a  significant asset and well-equipped  human resources is a major  competitive advantage, we organize  training activities to contribute  to the personal and professional  development of employees. We  design our training courses in  accordance with corporate goals  and strategies, the needs of the  sector, and areas of development  that were identified based upon  employee potential and preferences  and the business needs of the  future. Lifelong learning and information  Creating awareness is essential to  make a difference in sustainability,  just as in every aspect of life. For an  awareness that makes an impact,  we believe that employees must,  first and foremost, be involved  in this journey. Institutions that  enable easy access to information  play a critical role for us to  transform into sustainable societies  and drive a change in people.  Accordingly, we look into the link  between information society and  of Academy Social bringing them  together with experts from various  sectors throughout the year. In 2019,  we held a total 79 events where  thematic topics such as technology,  art, innovation, life, healthcare,  psychology and sustainability were  presented to Akbank employees. Training programs designed for  today The academic structure we  developed allows us to assist  employees perform their duties  successfully and prepare for  the position they apply for.

Akbank Academy designs  development programs shaped by  the needs of today and the future.  In this regard, we continued our  efforts to extend customized and  easily accessible training methods  by focusing on the Akbank staffs  improvement areas. Owing to  Akbanks investment in training, 36  hours of training was provided per  employee by the end of 2019. 30%  of total training time was online  training during the year. The number  of employees who received in- class and e-learning sustainability  courses is 30 and 1,283, respectively.  In the meantime, employees who  attended the summits, conferences  and seminars in and outside Turkey  had the chance to keep a close  watch on the developments in the  sector and around the world. In 2019,  the library at Sabanc Center was  renamed as Academy Social under  the leadership of Akbank Academy  and transformed into a life center  where employees are able to spend  their time more socially. To raise  employees cultural awareness  and introduce a multidisciplinary  perspective, we held the Akbanker  Get-togethers under the umbrella  Our development and training  opportunities  84 OUR OUTSTANDING TALENT Akbank managers are supported via classroom training,  one-to-one consulting and online tools in executive  development training programs to groom the leaders of  tomorrow. It is critical that Akbank employees  whose positions require professional  certifications possess Capital  Markets Board (CMB), Insurance  Training Center (SEGEM), and  Private Pension System (PPS)  licenses, both to comply with the  legal mandates and to support  their development. We encourage  broad participation in exams  and support the licensing exam  preparation efforts of employees  by administering classroom  training, e-learning, practice  tests, mobile applications and by  making available question banks.  In 2019, 798 Akbank employees  were granted BES, SEGEM or SPK  certification.  Some of Akbanks training is  subject to the certification system,  where employees attend specified  training programs and take exams  to be certified. Personnel who  participate in such activities as  homework, project presentation  and online simulation in pursuit of  a certification also move forward  on their career development  roadmaps. The certification system  grooms well-equipped, competent,  innovative, and high performing  employees in terms of professional  and managerial skills, striving  to build a corporate culture that  creates its own leaders. teller transactions, document  protection, detection and prevention  of fraud, and operational risk are  administered to the appropriate  audience by assignment.  We support the Akbank staff in  their access to career opportunities  through customized development  journeys Ongoing systemic works and  training content revision efforts  continued in 2019 to make sure  that current career diplomas are  more compact, exclusive to the  needs, the person, without any  time or location limitations, and  are rendered simpler to provide  easier access to information. The  Development Journey Project  which transforms the learning  experience of employees into a  holistic development journey was  implemented in the Commercial  Banking segment. While our  employees complete technical  training programs - which are  re-designed based on next-gen  learning methods - online, our aim  is to help them practice, reinforce  and develop their skills through in- class trainings. Upon the launch of  the Development Journey Project  in all segments, the diploma system  will cede its place to a holistic  development journey.  Our anti-corruption training The banking sector faces corruption  risks due to its global size and  the magnitude of monetary  transactions. Corruption can be  prevented to a significant extent  through audits and training. Armed  with this awareness, Akbank  organizes internal classroom  training sessions and e-learning  applications on technical issues as  well as on actions to be taken and  those to be avoided. We create the content of these  training programs as per the needs  of the target group and pay utmost  attention to the participation of  each and every employee in these  programs. The majority of the  anti-corruption trainings are for  the employees working in Akbank  branches, but all employees also  attend training on the Code of  Ethics, Information Security, Data  Leakage, and Law on the Protection  of Personal Data. International  Sanctions/Combating Proceeds  of Crime training is conducted for  related Head Office and branch  personnel in classroom and online  training formats. We continuously  review and reevaluate the topics  and contents of our anti-corruption  training programs based on the  developments and needs in this  area. Critical training such as risky  Our development and training  opportunities  85 AKBANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 Employee welfare and talent  development Akbank organizes personal  development courses on  customer-centric service, phone  communications, presentation  techniques, negotiation techniques,  innovation, creative thinking  techniques and management  techniques, among others.  They can attend these courses,  designed to help them adapt to  professional life and benefit them  in their personal life in the areas  of stress management, creative  thinking codes, analytical thinking  skills, persuasion and perception  management, communication  techniques and team spirit. We highlighted the content in the  areas of parenting, health, physical  and mental wellbeing, and created  a development catalogue serving  these purposes only, and held  events. Our aim is to enrich the  efforts in these areas and foster  employee welfare.  Programs we design for the future New, advanced technologies are  increasingly important in todays  world. Investing in these emerging  technologies and also properly  training the employees who will use  technologies are major subjects  of consideration. To translate  these emerging technologies  into the workplace and foster a  shared discourse, we continued the  development program entitled We  are Ready for the Future in 2019.  The Advanced Analytics Program is  intended to help generate relevant  results from big data, do modelling,  and have a command of AI and  machine learning practices. This  five-month program delivered on  a weekly basis allows participants  to perform group project works on  real-life business practices.    With the Design Thinking Program,  our aim is to disseminate a working  methodology that is centered on  customers in products, services and  processes. With these programs,  we raise design thinking coaches  internally, and cooperate with them  in subsequent programs.  in order to develop the leaders  of today and cultivate those of  tomorrow. During these efforts, we  aim to ensure that the processes  in competence development  programs are designed in an  efficient and transparent way. As  part of initiatives carried out under  talent management development,  the Assessment Center identifies  needs and formulates a personal  development plan by using various  tools such as surveys. Competence  Development, tailored for the  Bank and the employee in line with  individual development plans and  competencies, is expanded with new  training courses.  As for in-class training plans,  we developed an analytical  model based on such variables  as the educational background,  attendance performance and  career road map of the employee.  Now called Interaction Priority  Score, this model helps us plan and  assign training courses to relevant  employees. This is how we also  guarantee equal opportunities in  training. We are aware that feedback  from participants is of critical  importance for the effectiveness  and success of the training  efforts. All feedback is submitted  to Akbank Academy by way of  online surveys. The results of these  surveys have a defining role for the  evaluation and improvement of  training content, trainers and the  training environment. Questions,  suggestions and opinions  regarding the training programs  can be submitted at akbank. akademi@akbank.com. In 2019,  we continued training evaluation  and measurement efforts. At the  end of critical training programs,  their impact on business results is  measured via ROI methods that  isolate external factors, which helps  us design the programs for the next  period in a more effective manner.  With a perspective extending to  the next three years, the Academy  Dashboard was developed on a  monthly basis so as to track the  trainings administered and take  actions that improve training  efforts. We launched the Private Banking  Development program for the Head  Office and branch staff in private  banking. We designed this program  as a long-lasting development  journey that brings the experts of  customer experience, culture of life  and art together with our employees  to foster relations and encourage  the generation of innovative ideas.  Learning methods and platforms The Akbank Academy portal was  restructured with new generation  infrastructure and technology. It is a  platform that continuously supports  the development of employees  where they can manage their  training planning in accordance  with their career progression.  Akbank employees can continue  their development 24/7 at home  or in the office via the Akbank  Academy Portal, which contains  all employee e-training modules  and can be reached online at any  time from any location. Employees  can see their individual training  calendar, request training, and get  information on questionnaires, exam  results, e-learning and training  organizations via the portal.  We support our learning channels  with current trends in the world -  gamification, social learning, digital  catalogue, and advanced Corporate  TV. We launched the infrastructure  for Training Journey, which allows  the employees to keep track of  their training schedule in a single  flow, in previous years. In parallel  with the common learning trends in  the world, we focused on learning  functions that boost collaboration  in 2019. We turned the Academy  web portal into a social, interactive  wall, and launched You are the  Expert platform where Akbankers  can shoot and post their videos on  the subject they wish.  To assist employees swift  adaptation to the work environment,  we also introduced a virtual reality  application that allows them to  browse around the physical spaces  of the Bank and get information. Equal opportunities and  transparency in training We conduct varied and ongoing  programs, including solutions  tailored to meet individual needs,   86 OUR OUTSTANDING TALENT In 2019, we introduced the Internal Coaching program  and ensured that more Akbank employees benefit from the  coaching process. In addition, employees who have  expertise and teaching skills in their  respective fields and the retired  Akbank employees can become  internal instructors. Know-how  and experience of retired Akbank  employees are highly valuable for the  Bank. In particular, almost all of the  Core Banking training classes for new  recruits are administered by retiree  instructors. At Akbank, we support our  employees in obtaining certifications  especially those that are  internationally recognized in their  areas of specialization. Fees for  such exams are covered by Akbank  pursuant to certain criteria. In 2018,  there were 207 exam/certificate  reimbursement applications in total,  and 140 were endorsed by the Bank. Every year a certain number of  Akbank employees are selected  as future leaders due to their high  performance and potential. They  get the opportunity to attend  the Sabanc University Executive  MBA program with full scholarship.  113 employees have attended  this program since 2001 and six  employees are currently enrolled  in the program for the 2019-2020  academic year. Akbank staff can  also attend the MA programs in Data  Analytics and Cyber Security at  Sabanc University as per their area  of specialization. Our aim is to help the Akbank staff  to attain learning agility, reach  the information they need and  develop the capability of putting  it into practice. In an effort to  support learning agility - which is  an indispensable part of our culture  - and the culture of learning from  one another, we focus on on-the-job  trainings, mentoring and coaching  that boost exchange of experiences.  We also support employees  continuous learning journeys through  memberships in online training  platforms. There are training programs and  professional coaching practices  designed to help Heads of  Department and Managers at  Akbank headquarters, regional  directors and regional sales  managers with expertise in Retail,  Affluent, Commercial and SME  Banking segments to improve  competencies in technical banking,  sales and management. Through  such trainings, managers can  coach their teams in an effective  and target-oriented way. The Bank  administers a one-on-one coaching  program for branch managers  who are newly assigned to the  position of a hybrid commercial  branch manager covering various  subjects – including branch analysis,  planning, implementation, and  staff management – to accelerate  adaptation to the new job. Lifelong learning and other  opportunities Akbank employees who  have a high performance  and potential, and  are designated as the  managers of the future  are given the chance to  participate in Sabanc  University Executive  MBA Program with full  scholarship.  87 AKBANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 In line with their roles and  responsibilities, some staff members  attended summits, conferences and  seminars both in Turkey and abroad.  In 2019, 247 employees attended  seminars, conferences and training  courses abroad and 945 attended  seminars, conferences and training  courses in Turkey. The Mentoring Program for  management trainees and on-the- job trainings for assistants is aimed  at completing the adaptation of  new graduate employees to the  organization as soon as possible  and having them embrace the  experience, know-how and corporate  culture within the Bank. We conduct  a Field Mentorship Program where  experienced managers and customer  relationship managers provide  mentorship support to newly  appointed Branch Managers and  Customer Relationship Managers  to help their quick adaptation and  support them in technical issues.  With the Switch Reverse Mentorship  Program, which is run since 2014, we  allow young employees to evaluate  the current trends and popular  practices with senior managers and  share their opinions. In 2019, we launched the In-House  Coaching program with the in- house coaches who successfully  completed the internationally- recognized coaching certification  program in 2018. This enables more  Akbank employees to benefit from  coaching, while providing a chance  for managers to develop themselves  in coaching.  Internal communication and  activities at Akbank  We organize communication  activities and events via different  corporate channels to facilitate  communication among Akbank  staff, foster team spirit, boost  employee motivation and the sense  of belonging, and contribute to the  internalization of the objectives and  strategies of the management. Akbanks intra-company  communication and events are  guided by the following goals:      Creating an effective  communication strategy and  communicating this strategy with  the right tone, at the right time  and through the right channels;  encouraging them to operate with  a customer-centric approach.  Internal communication portal, the  mobile app of the portal, Corporate  TV, e-mails, and quarterly Live  Broadcasts accessible to all  employees are the most widely-used  internal communication channels.  We announce the events we organize  to the employees via e-mail, the  portal and mobile application. Special  discounts for Akbank staff are also  communicated via e-mail, the portal  and mobile application.  Breakfast talks with the CEO  Once a month, Akbank employees  from various segments and/or units  who display successful performances  attend a breakfast meeting with  Akbanks CEO, around specific  topics, projects or awards. At the  breakfast gathering, employees  share their opinions and suggestions  about the topic with the CEO.  Senior Managements messages via  live broadcasts Live broadcast sessions are  organized in order to establish closer  and more regular communication  between the Senior Management  and employees, either face-to-face  or through other communication  tools as well as to reach the teams in  the branches. This common ground  keeps the internal interaction and  synergy dynamic and reinforces  mutual communication and increases  employee motivation to achieve  common targets. We share the CEOs  messages on quarterly performance  assessment and strategic topics with  employees via live broadcasts. The  questions of employees are collected  before and during the broadcast, and  the CEO and relevant Executive Vice  Presidents answer these questions  live in person during or after the  event. The intranet system facilitating  Akbank staffs effective and easy  access to information Akbank employs an internal intranet  system in order to ensure effective  and easy access to information  by employees and to reinforce  communication. We introduced few  infrastructure improvements to  Akbanks Among Us portal, which  now serves as a platform with  more interactive areas. The aim  of this effort was to allow internal  and external information transfer;  while encouraging employees  to use the right communication  channel,     Making employees feel our  brand spirit and turning them  into natural representatives of  the brand, and conveying and  enriching the corporate culture  with the right messages,     Ensuring the continuity of  supporting organizations  and practices geared toward  solidifying team spirit. Future Club Future Club is a new platform where  young Akbank staff who take a close  interest in technology, digitalization  and artificial intelligence convene  with the CEO and relevant Executive  Vice Presidents. Encouraging  learning from one another, the Future  Club platform allows the Akbank  employees to examine important  developments and practices and  develop their own ideas. Akbank  employees share ideas with our  leaders and are supported with in- house and external trainers.  Shadow Young Akbankers spend a day with  our leaders and gain experience  in areas other than their business  functions. Throughout the program,  young Akbankers get the chance  to foster communication with  other Akbank staff in different  units. The program enables them  to observe the opportunities and  challenges of leadership, spending a  day with our leaders. 24 employees  have attended Shadow, which we  introduced in May 2019, to date.  Coffee talks We have held 46 coffee talks with  488 Akbank employees from the day  the event was first organized to the  end of 2019. We organized the event,  formerly held in Istanbul until June  2019, also in Ankara, Bursa, zmir,  Antalya and Adana. We continue  reaching more Akbank employees  across Turkey with the online talks  on Webex which started in April  2020. Effective internal communication  channels  Our intra-company communication  initiatives are aimed at informing  employees about the Banks  goals and strategies, bolstering  the corporate culture, and   88 OUR OUTSTANDING TALENT     Interactive pages of social clubs,     Bulletin boards on which  employees put various items and  property on sale,     The well-being column where  the news, tips, training and  event information to add value  to employees well-being and  health are shared. Mechanisms that allow employees  to express their opinions and  suggestions  We have established various  mechanisms for employees to share  their opinions and suggestions  with the senior management.  Employee expectations, opinions  and suggestions are conveyed to  the Senior Management through  the Employee Satisfaction Survey  conducted annually.  Employees can also share their  suggestions about business  processes through the 1001  Suggestions system on the  corporate portal. In addition, the  Ethics Line is a tool that enables  employees to express issues which  they believe should be resolved  within their departments but cannot  share with their direct managers;  and to provide support and advice  to employees in such circumstances  when necessary. In-house activities We continued to organize social  events and communication activities  on special occasions in order to  improve employee engagement and  motivation, and to reinforce team spirit  and internal communications in 2019.  Employee engagement  We acknowledge that employee  engagement is key to ensuring  business continuity and attaining  long-term goals and conduct an  Employee Engagement Survey every  year. We use the survey results to  support and disseminate the good  practices at Akbank. In addition, we  conduct the Pulse Questionnaires  in order to broaden the dialogue with  employees in different channels and  provide continuous communication  and feedback. Both of these studies  are conducted by an independent  research company, in line with the  principle of research confidentiality.  Necessary improvement and  development initiatives are carried out  based on the survey results.  Armed with the knowledge of the  close relationship between happy  employees and high corporate  performance, we believe in bolstering  loyalty through awareness of the  staffs feelings, opinions, and  expectations, their priorities related  to human resources and management  policies, and their areas of satisfaction  and dissatisfaction. increase operational efficiency  in all processes thanks to state- of-the-art technologies; create a  common platform for information;  and to ensure easy and effective  access to information.

In addition to encouraging the use of digital channels, we also offer new-generation Akbank branch facilities for  customers who prefer the branch channel. Our self-service, lean, digital and mobile customer experiences minimize  the use of paper. We implemented numerous innovations to reduce paper consumption under the New Generation  Sales Service Model:  By replacing printed contracts with online versions via Akbank Mobile, we have offered customers a paper-free  experience, saving 12 million sheets of paper and around 1,000 trees in the fiscal year of 2019.  Document approvals received via Akbank Mobile allowed us to eliminate the need for physical signature, scanning  and physical archiving procedures, while CRMs in and outside the branch had the chance to provide end-to-end,  digital and fast customer experience.  In the meantime, customers are now able to perform self-service transactions at the Counter Extras placed as a  new point of service in the branches, instead of waiting at the counter. This way, we saved 15 million printed receipts  corresponding to some 640 trees in 2019.      Finish with Mobile, a function which enables physical documents to be approved via Akbank Mobile, helped  us save paper and perform digital archiving tasks and transactions paper-free and quickly in and outside the  branches.      Running the controls of the document and signature receivers on the system thanks to the OCR technology, we  reduced the manual approval load on employees and accelerated our processes by minimizing the risk.     Our customers are now able to perform their transactions self-service thanks to Counter Extras.     The iPad integration based on the principle of mobility-focused solutions and designs, CRMs are able to offer  services at the place and time customers wish. In addition to paper conservation, we are engaged in paper recycling and thus continued to reduce our environmental  footprint steadily in 2019. At the Knal Archives Center, where all branch and Head Office archives are kept, 812 tons  of paper were disposed and recycled in 2019 after their legal preservation period ended. In this way, 13,800 trees were  saved. In addition to the paper sent to be recycled by the Archives Center, in branches some valuable papers are slit  and regular paper is used on both sides when possible, which are then collected in the containers provided by NGOs  such as TEMA and recovered later. Our water consumption Effective natural resource consumption strategies  Akbank shapes all its activities in light of its strategy of the effective consumption of natural resources. Our Banks  bulk water consumption includes employees water usage, cleaning activities, and irrigation of green space. As an  institution that uses municipal water, Akbank has limited water consumption compared to manufacturing companies.  Our water consumption does not have significant impact on a specific water source. 2017 2018 2019 Water Consumption (m3/year) 112,052 120,648 300,544  94 OUR OPERATIONS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Recycling-oriented waste  management policy  Akbank uses a great number and  variety of electric and electronic  devices due to the nature of  banking operations, which require  electronic means in a number  of transactions. These devices  contain not only valuable metals  that should be brought back to the  economy, but also environmentally  harmful materials. Therefore, we  have several measures to ensure  recovery of devices that have gone  out of use within the economy or  to reduce potential environmental  impact. In our main buildings, we  sort and collect waste to deliver  them to recycling companies. For  instance, used paper, plastics,  glass and metals are collected in  designated containers and sent to  recycling. In addition, oil retainers  are placed between the wastewater  line and the city sewer lines in the  kitchens to collect waste oils. These  waste oils are sent to oil recovery  stations to be recycled. When  floor coverings in our buildings  need to be replaced, we take the  environmental performance of new  carpets and other floor coverings  into consideration.  Recycling toner cartridges Empty toner cartridges of  printers have negative impacts  on the environment if they are not  disposed of properly. In order to  minimize this effect, a recycling  project was initiated in August  2010 to recycle the empty toner  cartridges from the printers used at  the Bank. From this date onwards,  all empty cartridges, including  those from Akbank branches, are  shipped to a company that recycles  electronic waste. In 2018, we  became a member of the Integrated  Environmental Information System  Electronic devices that are no longer appropriate for use  according to Akbanks standards are sold to companies in  Turkey, as scrap or second-hand products for recovery of  the metals and electronic parts. with Environmental Identity Number  256713150. Waste toner cartridges  are received from Akbank Banking  Center by the recycling company by  making a transport request via the  system.  In 2019, a total of 7,998 empty toner  cartridges were sent to the said  recycling company. Technological waste is recycled  back to the economy  Electronic devices that are no  longer appropriate for use according  to Akbanks standards are sold to  companies in Turkey, as scrap or  second-hand products for recovery  of the metals and electronic parts.  In addition, some of these devices  are donated as per the requests  made to the Bank.

Our key principles in procurement  activities are described below:     Compliance with Akbanks published policies, code of ethics and principles is sought in all procurement processes.      An effective mechanism is run by the Procurement Department and the business functions with procurement  authorities to prevent conflicts of interest.      Business units with procurement authorities determine and communicate the general ethical principles binding  for the suppliers in their activities with suppliers.     Akbank follows the following principles:    Akbank receives the suppliers commitment to implement all the elements of the UN Global Compact;    Prioritizes the suppliers who deploy environmentally and socially responsive systems in the procurement of  services;    Strives to obtain the commitment and annual survey form in Appendix 4 from the supplier to evaluate the labor  and working conditions of the employees hired by third party service providers under their commitments to  international organizations.     Procurement processes must be transparent and based on accountability.     Product and service procurement of all types is performed within the financial limits set forth by the Board.     It is essential for requestors to procure the service and/or product sufficient to meet their needs and with the  optimum balance of quality and price from the suppliers as per the needs of business units and the interests of  the Bank.     The right price, the right quantity, the right source, the right quality and the right time are the indispensable  elements of procurement.    96 OUR OPERATIONS AND THE ENVIRONMENT Our contribution  to society  97 AKBANK SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 We encourage all Akbank employees to perform  volunteering works in the social initiatives we undertake.
