Dear Stakeholders,  2017 has been a very eventful year for our Group,  with major milestones reached, extraordinary  business results delivered and new development  opportunities opening up for our personnel.  Maire Tecnimont listed on the Milan Stock  Exchange ten years ago. This major step brought a  deeper awareness of the impacts of our operations  on the broad scope of outside stakeholders.   More public exposure implied more accountability,  increased regulation, more transparency and a  more objective tool of measurement. This path   has led us to become the Group we are today:  solid, reliable and responsible.  Our role as a corporate citizen has grown in  complexity and in terms of responsibility along  with the expansion of our business. We therefore  made an international-level commitment,  supporting the UN Global Compact and  embedding the Sustainable Development   Goals into our operations.  Fabrizio Di Amato   Maire Tecnimont Chairman and Major Shareholder LETTER FROM   THE CHAIRMAN Ten years on, the global business environment   has changed faster and more extensively than  anyone could have ever imagined and  sustainability has increasingly become a pillar   of business decision-making.  More demanding market requirements and stricter  legal obligations have put ESGs on the agenda   of international players such as Maire Tecnimont.  This document responds to the non-financial  reporting demands of all our stakeholders.   The reporting process, resulting in our  Sustainability Report, has been a valuable  opportunity to present the complexity of our world  and our extended commitment to sustainability,  both as a creator and distributor of value in  different geographies. In undertaking this process,  we became more and more aware of the key role  we can play in such environments, offering not  only high-level services to our clients but also   local development opportunities.  The capability   of our   organization   to react  in advance.  LETTER FROM   THE CEO Dear Stakeholders,  The Maire Tecnimont Group has grown steadily  over recent years both in size, adding 1,200  employees in the last three years, and in terms of  financial results, reporting in 2017 an order intake  of 4,323.7 million. Such extraordinary  development in an ever-changing international  environment and a challenging market  demonstrates the capability of our organization   to react in advance and an ability to turn  uncertainties into opportunities. Our business is not directly linked to oil. As we  operate in the downstream (petrochemicals,  oil&gas refining and fertilizers) the factors that  drive our business are based on global demand for  polyethylene and polypropylene. We are thus  closely tied to the demand for petrochemical  products and fertilizers, which in turn depends   on demographic and developmental factors,   in addition to industrialization. In this sense,   our role as a general contractor with a highly  technological DNA enables us to have an impact  on the territories in which we operate. Sustainability is therefore truly the cornerstone   of the Group value system, both in economic   and ethical terms, leading us to consider new  business development opportunities in   response to market demands. We can play a significant role in the approaching  energy transition, developing and offering new  technologies amid altered environmental  conditions and climate change.  Pierroberto Folgiero  Maire Tecnimont Group CEO and Managing Director We are working on what I would call  \"technological adjacencies\": encouraging signs  have already emerged from two investments in the  U.S. - namely Siluria and Pursell Agri-Tech i.e. two  start-up companies focused on more sustainable  solutions for gas transformation and agricultural  fertilizers. Looking to the non-fossil sector, we are  ready to tap into new market trends and are  developing our expertise in biochemicals and  bioplastics.  We are increasingly interested in renewable energy  generation. The generation of energy from non- renewable sources is growing significantly globally.  The sector is of interest to us as recently  demonstrating consistent growth: the shift from  20-MW plants to plants ranging from 150 to 200  MW is ongoing, requiring construction by large  companies capable of managing complex logistics.  The growing international focus on sustainability  and social development in the wake of the Paris  Agreement and the launch of the new Sustainable  Development Goals in 2016 have made us  increasingly aware that the SDGs need to become  a core feature of daily operations for enterprises to  thrive in this future environment. A real and clear  commitment on this, along with continuous  support for the UN Global Compact is the only   way to ensure consistency with the principles  underpinning our work as a high technological  content international contractor with a deeply  embedded involvement in multi-geography   local contexts.  2005 2007 1963 INCORPORATION  OF MAIRE TECNIMONT 1899 FIAT GROUP  1972 Incorporation of  FIAT ENGINEERING  2001 Acquisition of FIAT Avios Electric Design & Construction Business 2004 Acquisition of FIAT ENGINEERING 2005 Maire Group acquires Tecnimont 1973 Incorporation of TECNIMONT  1966 Incorporation of MONTEDISON 1884 EDISON  Power Supply 1958 Incorporation of ICB Pvt  Ltd as consulting firm in  the plant sector in Mumbai 1977 Creation of the first JV  between ICB and  Tecnimont 1990s Tecnimont acquires  50% of the Indian  company renamed as  Tecnimont ICB Pvt Ltd  (TICB) 1888 MONTECATINI Mines and Chemicals 100% ACQUISITION OF  THE INDIAN SUBSIDIARY  TECNIMONT PVT.

SUSTAINABILITY AT  MAIRE TECNIMONT  OUR GROUP PLACES   THE SAME FOCUS ON  SUSTAINABILITY AS IT   DOES OTHER CORE BUSINESS  ISSUES, AS LONG-TERM   VALUE CREATION IS ONLY  POSSIBLE THROUGH AN  AWARENESS AND SENSITIVITY  TO THE IMPACTS OF OUR  BUSINESS AT ALL LEVELS. A broad sustainability strategy,  but concentrated on clear  objectives, reduces our exposure  to external stresses and makes  us more resilient and capable   of preserving value for our  stakeholders, maximizing at the  same time the possibility to tap  into opportunities emerging  from the ongoing energy  transition. In this regard, key issues raised  from the materiality assessment  carried out as part of the  reporting process, have helped  to define a group of priorities  from which concrete activities  may be planned in a smoother  and more effective way. This is  the only way to embed the  Group sustainability strategy  into our everyday work.  As a compass for our  sustainability strategy, the  Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) help us to stay focused  to our environmental, social and  governance (ESG) efforts,  contributing to a more balanced  and organic development   of how we do business across   all spheres.  The first step in Maire  Tecnimonts sustainability  strategy, concretely achieved in  this Report, is the necessary  change in corporate culture in  terms of the set of indicators  used to measure Group value  creation.  Clearly, for Maire Tecnimont  value creation primarily means  profit generation capacity in the  long run, particularly in a cyclical  industry like hydrocarbon  processing.Technical excellence,  global footprint, flexibility in the  range of services offered,  accountable project-based  risk-management, an asset-light  model and financial discipline  are among the pillars of the  Group business strategy to build  long-term economic growth.   Periodic results are transparently  assessed thanks to a set   of economic and financial  indicators typical   of a listed company. The quality of human capital is a  pivotal and differentiating factor  for Maire Tecnimonts economic  value creation. As the  engineering and contracting  industry is a people business,  the Group has strengthened its  people strategy to foster and  nurture talent, continuously  upgrading the skills of its  personnel, adapting its welfare  schemes, adopting smart  working approach and  enhancing the participation   of the employees to the Group  results (Employees Share  Ownership Plan).  This strategy contributes   not only to Group  competitiveness but also  reinforces the sense   of belonging to the company,  as a professional community  and in terms of the   value of the individual  in the workplace. With this Report, ESG criteria  have officially become part of  the monitoring dashboard, thus  enabling a broader evaluation of  company performance. Maire  Tecnimont should be measured  in terms of its capacity to  mitigate negative impacts and  facilitate positive impacts from its  business activities on the natural  and human environment in which  it operates.  ESG criteria highlight a way of  doing business which is deeply  connected with the corporate  DNA as a technology-oriented  engineering contractor, in which  our approach to innovation is  applied not only within the  confines of the company or its  32  projects, but extends also to   the external local environment. A second, more far-reaching  step in Maire Tecnimonts  sustainability strategy concerns  the enhancement of local  content, wherever we work,  whenever possible. As a general  contractor for large industrial  plants, the potential of our  business decisions, the impacts  on our supply chain and our  high-level expertise allow us to  play a significant role in the  development of the territories in  which we operate. Globally, we  are capable of generating value  in different forms through our  projects across a range of social  and economic contexts.  The capacity of the Group   in terms of local content  dynamization is significant.   For this reason, we have  dedicated a significant part of  the Sustainability Reporting  process to the extraction of data  from the main projects under  execution, measuring the extent  of the supply chain, the  subcontracting companies  involved, the workers mobilized,  the salaries paid, the training  hours and the actions favouring  local communities. This analytical  data mining is a hallmark of our  approach and will become part  of the companys approach to  presenting its way of doing  business to third parties (clients,  governments, partners, media, etc). The third and most powerful  strategic sustainability step   for Maire Tecnimont is its open  approach to a fast-changing  market. The global energy  market is in transition.   The Group sustainability vision   in fact will stem from its capacity  to become a processing  engineer for the new forms of  energy and raw materials for  manufacturing emerging  globally. Traditionally, the  downstream business, where   the Groups best experience lies,  connects the energy sector   (oil and gas resources) and  manufacturing (intermediate  chemical products acting as the  building bricks for a countless  number of industrial  applications, from automotive to  IT, from packaging to clothes,  from furniture and household  products).   As new forms of energy  production and bio-chemical  processing evolve, there will be  room for renewed engineering  players capable of processing  these new materials and  industrializing new plants.  Thanks to its research and  development, Maire Tecnimont  as a technological player is  already focusing on adapting its  skills of natural resource  processing to this new market  reality, from bio-chemistry to  renewable power stations,  preparing for a new demand  02.  SUSTAINABILITY AT  MAIRE TECNIMONT cycle and at the same time  contributing to international  collective actions to address  climate change.

THE THREE ASPECTS   OF MAIRE TECNIMONTS  SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY  ARE A POWERFUL  ACCELERATOR FOR THE  COMPANYS LONG-TERM  GROWTH FOCUSED BUSINESS  STRATEGY.     THEY WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE   TO REINFORCING THE  GROUPS REPUTATION AS   A RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN  COMMITTED TO CONTRIBUTING  TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT MODEL. 33  It is a clear commitment   to public accountability and  transparency that we renew  every year through the  Communication on Progress  document, which summarises  our actions to embed   the UN principles into   our everyday work. The Maire  Tecnimont Group also welcomes  and supports the Sustainable  Development Goals and their  focus on achieving a more  sustainable world. The Group   is aware of the fundamental  contribution that each company  can make and has incorporated  the values and principles of  social and environmental  responsibility into its business  model. The Group, taking into  consideration its business  activities and a strong  commitment to concretely  support the achievement of the  SDGs at a global level, has  identified the goals to which it  can contribute most through  extensive internal engagement,  involving all the significant  functions of each Group  company.  GROUP COMMITMENT  TO THE SDGs AND   UN GLOBAL COMPACT IN 2011, THE MAIRE TECNIMONT GROUP  PLEDGED ITS SUPPORT TO   THE TEN PRINCIPLES   BEHIND THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT,   THE UNS LARGEST   CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP  AND SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVE  AND BECAME ONE OF ITS MORE   THAN 12,000 PARTICIPANTS.  2.1 GROUP COMMITMENT   TO THE SDGs AND   UN GLOBAL COMPACT 34  With the final approval of   Group Top Management,   Maire Tecnimont then clearly  defined its Sustainability Vision  and, accordingly, its specific  commitment and goals - which  are closely linked with the  business strategy - for each SDG.  Furthermore, the Group has  been constructing a solid data  baseline that will help to  measure and monitor, through  specific KPIs, the achievement  of the abovementioned goals:  this broad infrastructure will  steer day-to-day operations and  the Groups Corporate  Responsibility initiatives,  presently and in the future and  marks a milestone on the Groups  sustainable development path.  Each SDG applicable to the  Group is presented above, along  with its consequences in  business terms. The chapters  that follow will provide further  details on Group actions in  pursuit of the Goals and the  related performances. Moreover,   the introduction to each chapter  will cite the chapter-related  SDGs, as well as the issues  emerging from the materiality  analysis, in terms of the   business strategy.   — TO PROMOTE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEN AND WOMEN   — TO STRENGTHEN RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR PRESENCE   — TO PROMOTE R&D ACTIVITIES PURSUING TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION   — TO REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THE GROUP AND ITS CLIENTS   — TO PROTECT THE ECOSYSTEMS AFFECTED BY CONSTRUCTION SITE OPERATIONS   — TO STEP UP INVOLVEMENT IN WORKING TABLES ON SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES   — TO PROMOTE AND CONSOLIDATE UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIPS   — TO PROMOTE AND CONSOLIDATE INNOVATION PARTNERSHIPS   — TO PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE,   ALSO WITH A LONG-TERM OUTLOOK   — TO APPLY INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES AND BAT TO REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS   OF PRODUCTION (BAT JUSTIFICATION REPORT WORK INSTRUCTION AVAILABLE AS TCM     GUIDELINE)   — TO PROMOTE THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN AND WORKERS RIGHTS   — TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE  THE COMPANY OPERATES   — TO ENABLE THE WORLD TO ACHIEVE FOOD SECURITY   — TO IMPROVE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE BY INCREASING CROP YIELDS AND IMPROVING   THE USE OF SUSTAINABLE MACRO- AND MICRO-NUTRIENTS   — TO STRENGTHEN THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS OF THE ENTIRE WORKFORCE   — TO PROTECT WORKERS SAFETY   — TO PROMOTE WORKERS HEALTH   — TO PROMOTE A MORE SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN 35  Sustainable growth over time is  closely linked to the ability of  the Group to identify and  respond to changes in the  market and in society.   The identification, engagement  and thus enhancement of  relations with stakeholders   and the entities or individuals,  that can reasonably be expected  to affect the ability of the Group  to successfully implement its  strategies and achieve its  objectives, is therefore one   of the primary aspects   of the Group's strategy. STAKEHOLDER  ENGAGEMENT ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING OVER  TIME A STEADY DIALOGUE WITH  STAKEHOLDERS ALLOWS THE GROUP  TO IDENTIFY THE MOST IMPORTANT  SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES AND TO ASSESS  HOW TO BEST INCORPORATE THEM  INTO BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT  OPERATIONS.

At corporate level, the risks are  assessed and reviewed on a  quarterly basis for  comprehensive control   of the enterprise risks,   providing therefore a reasonable   assurance that corporate  objectives can be achieved. At project level, in order to  ensure the analysis and  monitoring of risks throughout  all the phases of the project life  cycle and to prioritize the level  of focus/attention on the  subsequent phases of Tendering  and Execution, a Macro Risk  Rating is calculated from the  pre-tendering phase for every  commercial initiative.

Maire Tecnimont requires its  employees to constantly bear in  mind as they go about their daily  business the most important value  of the Group: ethical conduct. The Maire Tecnimont Group  considers it essential to conduct  business in full compliance with  the law, regulations, statutory  provisions and self-regulatory  codes and ethical integrity   and fairness. Acting in compliance with law  - whether local, national or  regional - and with ethical  integrity has always been, and  always will be, fundamental to  the Maire Tecnimont Group in  protecting and improving its  business performance and  setting the Group apart in   the marketplace. 3.2 ETHICS   AND COMPLIANCE 52  CUSTOMER  COMMITMENT FLEXIBILITY EQUAL  OPPORTUNITIES  HEALTH   AND SAFETY  AT THE  WORKPLACE SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT RESPONSIBILITY  TOWARDS THE  COMMUNITY GROUP'S  VALUES 9 10 1 LEGALITY,  TRANSPARENCY  AND FAIRNESS 7 8 2 3 4 5 6 KNOWLEDGE  MANAGEMENT RESPECT FOR   THE INDIVIDUAL INNOVATION 53  The Group Code of Ethics  applies to the Board of Directors,  Auditors, all employees and  outside collaborators  (consultants, business partners  etc.), suppliers, sub-contractors,  clients and any other parties  who at any level come in contact  with Maire Tecnimont or act for  and on its behalf 2.  The Board of Directors of Maire  Tecnimont SpA has adopted its  own 231 Model, thus responding  to the need to ensure fairness  and transparency in the conduct  of business and the management  of company operations. The  Board of Directors has therefore  appointed a 231 Supervisory  Body with autonomous powers  of initiative and control.  Moreover, the Italian companies  directly controlled and fully- owned by Maire Tecnimont SpA  (i.e. \"sister companies\") have  also their own 231 Model and  Supervisory Body. Aside from the Group Code of  Ethics, the 231 Model establishes a  set of rules and principles of  control and conduct to be  adopted and implemented in  order to mitigate the risk of  committing the offences referred  to in Italian Legislative Decree  231/2001, including corruption   and the violation of environmental  protection and workers health  and safety rules. The rules of the   231 Model integrate with those   of the Group Code of Ethics, which  must be adopted by all Group  subsidiaries, both in Italy and  abroad to ensure that the conduct  of business and the management  of company operations have  carried out always and everywhere  in compliance with ethics   and integrity.  The Groups Internal Audit and 231  Supervisory Bodies are,  respectively, the representatives  for monitoring the effective  implementation of the Group Code  of Ethics and the 231 Model. Maire Tecnimont Group  personnel, and those acting on  its behalf, are responsible for  understanding the applicable  rules and must act in compliance  with internal regulatory  instruments such as the Group  Code of Ethics, the 231 Model  and corporate standards and  procedures. Such instruments,  which also include rules and  principles concerning   anti-corruption policies,   are communicated to all   Group employees and   Interested Parties. Responsibility for group  compliance activities lies with  Group Corporate Affairs,  Governance & Compliance  Department. Specifically, the  Group Corporate Affairs,  Governance & Compliance  Department of Maire Tecnimont  manages all activities for the  adoption and implementation   of an ethics and compliance  program, including the 231  Model of the Maire Tecnimont  Group companies incorporated  under Italian law and supports  the 231 Supervisory Body of the  companies for monitoring the  effective implementation of the  231 Model and observance of its  provisions. Moreover, the   Group Corporate Affairs,  Governance & Compliance  Department together with the  relevant Functions also develops  and revises Group procedures   to reduce the risk of   non-compliance. MAIRE TECNIMONT HAS SET OUT  THESE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES  IN THE GROUP CODE OF ETHICS 1 AND IN ITS CORPORATE STANDARDS  AND PROCEDURES. 2 Recipients of the Group Code of Ethics will hereafter be referred to as Interested Parties. 1 The Group Code of Ethics   is a single document applicable  to the entire Maire Tecnimont  Group, available in Italian   and English and published in  the \"Governance\" section   of the www.mairetecnimont.it  website.

PEOPLE   AT THE CENTER - EMPLOYMENT - DIVERSITY  - INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS - HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT - HUMAN RIGHTS MATERIAL TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THIS CHAPTER SDGs STAKEHOLDER TO WHOM IT CONCERNS PROFESSIONAL /CATEGORY  ASSOCIATION LOCAL  ORGANIZATIONS  & NGOs CLIENTS EMPLOYEES LOCAL  AUTHORITIES   & GOVERNMENTS CONTRACTORS & SUB- CONTRACTORS  Our business strategy is  perfectly in line with SDGs   Nr. 4 and Nr. 5: Skills and  competencies development   of our People, equal  opportunities and respect for  Human Rights are indeed core  pillars of how we do business  and deliver value every day.  AS OUTLINED BELOW,  SPECIFIC SKILL  IMPROVEMENT GOALS HAVE  BEEN SET BY THE GROUP IN  ORDER TO FOSTER THE  DEVELOPMENT OF ITS  HUMAN CAPITAL - A KEY  SUCCESS FACTOR IN AN  INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE  ENVIRONMENT.  Our commitment to these  aspects is also reflected in the  ongoing improvement of our  working environment and in the  guarantee for the respect of  workers rights, as well as for   the fair and equal treatment   of women and men. Several initiatives and programs  have also been promoted and  rolled out regarding professional  development and work-life  balance, as well as to address  specific areas of interest,  supporting their contribution   to the achievement   of Group objectives.  We firmly believe in this  approach, on which our culture  has always been based and  which is also a feature of our risk  management approach, while  also attracting and retaining  personnel capable of playing   an active and significant role   in the creation of Group  sustainable value.  Human Capital is one of the  principal assets of our Group:   as mentioned above, skilled   and committed resources are  considered essential elements   in an increasingly competitive  and complex market. Excellence, innovation,  accountability and team  collaboration are key features   of Maire Tecnimont Group and  our identity. Operating in more than   40 countries, through  approximately 50 corporate  vehicles, strengthening our  employer brand and enhancing  and keeping alive the sense of  belonging and engagement   of our People are essential  requirements.  In this regard, in 2016 the Group  launched its new engagement  policy to boost employee  participation through various  levers, such as the Employee  Share Ownership Plan and the  Flexible Benefits Plan. In general, depending on the  labor regulations applicable   and the workforce employed   in each country, Group practice  is to offer competitive wage  levels and compensation  packages, as well as a corporate  welfare system which responds  to the needs of employees   and their family members.  64  In this regard, the main measures  are: transportation facilitations,   life and accident insurance,  supplementary pension benefits  and food allowance.   The remuneration system,   at all levels, both in terms   of compensation and benefits,   is based on the unique principle  of assessing the specific level   of professional competence,   the acquired experience,   the demonstrated merit,  objectives achieved and   the level of growth attained.  The Group moreover recognizes  all forms of free association  between employees in  compliance with the laws in  force in the Country of interest.  The Maire Tecnimont Group is  constantly committed to  guaranteeing full compliance  with the relative national and  international laws, in promoting  initiatives which encourage and  consolidate a safety and health  culture among employees in  their workplaces, in addition to  prevention and training  initiatives, in order to guarantee  workplace safety and safeguard  the health and psycho-physical  integrity of its People. IN ADDITION, WE ARE  COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING  A WELCOMING AND  STIMULATING WORK  ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS  ENCOURAGING DIALOGUE  AND THE EXCHANGE OF  DIFFERENT VIEWS, TO  CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE  WORK LIFE AND SUPPORT  BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT. As further confirmation of this, in  2017 the Group launched for the  workforce employed at the Milan  headquarters the BE  ADAPTIVE! Working Smart in  Maire Tecnimont Group (Be  Adaptive) Program, involving  also the trade unions, as  specified below.  Their involvement in drawing up  and rolling out the Be Adaptive  Program, as well as the signing  of other major supplementary  union agreements in Italy and in  the Netherlands, are testament  to the good quality of the  relationship, based on ongoing  dialogue, mutual respect and  continuous cooperation, as well  as on full respect of obligations,  also in terms of prior  communication to the union  representatives - who are always  involved - whenever a major  organizational change occurs.  Such an industrial relations  approach has facilitated the  signing of some very innovative  agreements, both in terms of  welfare and work time flexibility.  In this regard, a particular focus  is reserved for the highly  innovative trade union  agreement for implementation  of the Be Adaptive Program,  signed with the Workers'  Representatives on September  6, 2017, which provides for  extensive application, with  particular reference to work time  flexibility, of the recent Smart  Working Italian legislation.   In addition, in 2017 further various  additional union agreements   were signed, concerning,   by way of example,   funded training, scholarship  awards criteria and the  participation bonus.  To support the Group growth  and diversification strategy, in  terms of projects and  engineering technology services,  as well as geographical reach,   in 2017 Maire Tecnimont started  the implementation of SAPs  Success Factor, a Human Capital  Management cloud-based  platform, permitting not only   a consolidated global view  of the entire Group workforce -  enabling better and fast HR  analytics - but also greater  consistency on how resources  are developed and managed  across the countries   where we operate, adopting   a comprehensive talent  management tool which  combines the e-learning  management system (LMS)   with performance management  to facilitate the international  mobility and the management   of development plans. Through the platform,  employees will have direct  access to all their information:  from the employment contract  to the e-learning training,   as well as the appraisal   and the related scores. 04.

Account should be taken of the   nature of Group business which,   as a contracting company, works on  large projects with variable durations  and natural fluctuations connected   to the various operational phases   of the projects. Considering only permanent  employees, in 2017 the number   of hires was 378 and the turnover   rate for voluntary reasons   was 2.9%. 2,333 1,864 190 59 456 54 2,161 1,721 41 55 2,381 600 18 1,791 415 49 681 126 TOT 4,596 M 3,757 W 839 TOT 4,956 M 4,035 W 921 TOT 5,443 M 4,440 W 1,003 69  PEOPLE ENGAGEMENT  AND REWARD Knowing the importance   of the elements that drive   and determine the level of  engagement and motivation   of our People is a key factor   of Group Human Resources  policies. For this reason, in 2013  Maire Tecnimont carried out the  first Engagement Survey of the  Group (YOUR VOICE), so as  to better understand employee  opinions on their working  experience, collecting a lot of  positive feedback as well as  some suggestions on possible  areas of improvement.   Thereafter and during the  following years the Group has  responded to the feedback,  shaping various initiatives and  programs to maintain and  enhance the sense of belonging  and the high level of  engagement of its People,   as described below. In terms of Reward, the  remuneration policy of the  Company is in full compliance  with applicable legislation and  matches best practice, while also  based on the principles of fair  pay and sustainability.  EVERY YEAR, THE COMPANIES   OF THE GROUP PROMOTE   THE COMPENSATION POLICY,   IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CORPORATE  GUIDELINES, IN ORDER TO REWARD  MERIT AND FOSTER THE COMMITMENT  TOWARDS THE REALIZATION OF THE  GROUP MISSION, CONSIDERING  INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCES, COMPANY  GOALS AND MARKET TRENDS.  4.2 PEOPLE ENGAGEMENT   AND REWARD 70  2016 2017 4,084  PARTICIPATIONS 4,182  PARTICIPATIONS CYCLE OF AWARD   OF RIGHTS 96% 97% FIRST CYCLE SECOND CYCLE EMPLOYEES SHARE  OWNERSHIP PLAN In order to establish an even  more extensive and innovative  reward policy, the Group  implemented an initiative which  can be considered pioneering  within our business sector: the  2016-2018 Employees Share  Ownership Plan.   The Plan is designed to  encourage involvement of the  employees in the Companys  value growth and pursuit of  Corporate objectives, supporting  the Groups development, also  through reinforcing motivation  and the sense of belonging and  loyalty over the long-term.   The Employees Share Ownership  Plan envisages a cycle of award   of rights for each year of  duration (2016-2017-2018) and  the possibility to be granted  Maire Tecnimont shares for free   on the basis of the overall  profitability of the Group. Almost all personnel involved  participated in the First Cycle  (2016), i.e. 96%, with 4,084  participations; the Plan  performance was equal   to 109%, allowing the grant   of a corresponding   number of shares. The Second Cycle (2017)  surpassed the First, with  participation by 97% of the  employees involved (4,182). This Plan is accessible for  employees with a permanent  contract, since, as already  mentioned, considered   a lever for strengthening   the engagement and the   sense of belonging to   the Group over the long-term. The Compensation Policy  consists of salary increases and  variable bonuses, that are  always based on and rewarding  of professionalism and individual  contributions to achieving the  Group goals. As an additional  reward initiative, the Group  launched the Engagement and  Incentive Policy 2016-2018,   to strengthen further peoples  commitment towards   Company challenges. 71  MAIRE4YOU THE REIMBURSEMENT  OF MEDICAL AND  EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES ACCESS TO GOODS  AND SERVICES  INTEREST ON  MORTGAGES FUNDING OF A  SUPPLEMENTARY  PENSION SCHEME  VOUCHERS MAIRE4YOU Also under the Engagement and  Incentive Policy 2016-2018, the  Group launched for most of its  Italian Companies a Flexible  Benefits Plan called  MAIRE4YOU, in line with the  most innovative compensation  policies. The Plan recognises to  beneficiaries a personal flexible  benefits fund to be utilized   for a vast range of services,  such as the reimbursement   of medical and educational  expenses, interest on mortgages,  funding of a supplementary  pension scheme, access to  various goods and services   and, lastly, vouchers. The beneficiaries can access their  flexible benefits fund through a  dedicated platform, enabling the  creation of a package of goods  and services satisfying personal  and household needs, while at  the same time optimizing  spending capacity thanks to tax  and contribution advantages  under Italian law. The  MAIRE4YOU Plan has also  been agreed with the Trade  Unions and represents another  significant confirmation   of the Groups willingness   to value people as a fundamental  asset for its success, in the  common and shared effort  towards the achievement   of Group objectives. BE ADAPTIVE!   WORKING SMART IN   MAIRE TECNIMONT GROUP The Be Adaptive Program,  launched in December 2016, has  introduced a new way of working  in Maire Tecnimont Group,  implementing a smart working  approach. This Program was  carried out in close collaboration  with the Research Center of the  Polytechnic of Milan, with the  main goal of keeping our People  at the center, giving them the real  possibility of improving their  work-life balance and work  efficiency by choosing proactively  their own best place to work.  To achieve sustainable growth,   the Program introduces new  ways of developing working  processes and managing human  resources, as well as an innovative  organizational model which  combines business and individual  needs, facilitating the growth of  the sense of responsibility and   the sharing in achieving Company  business objectives.  Since the very beginning of the  Program, the Company has fully  involved employees by giving  them the opportunity to identify  and propose new solutions,  participating in an ideas contest  called \"BE ADAPTIVE! – Think  Tank. Overall, 148 people  participated in the contest,  presenting a total of 58 business  cases, 5 of which were selected   as the most complete and closely  associated with the Company  profile, receiving an award   at a dedicated ceremony.  Following this contest, the  Company launched the   BE ADAPTIVE! Working Smart  in Maire Tecnimont Group  Program. While responding  directly to a growing trend which  our Group is ready for, Maire  Tecnimont decided on   an approach which is both  innovative and specific.   In fact, the employees involved   in the initiative benefit from   the extreme flexibility of the  Program, choosing, according to  the relative activity, their own  right place to work for up to 4  days per week. In order to meet  colleagues face-to-face and keep  contact with the Company,  employees have to guarantee   at least one day at the office.  Another distinctive trait of the   Be Adaptive Program -  compared to other organizations  approaches - is the involvement  of the greatest possible number  of employees: the Program is  open to every contract type and  category, both short-term and  part-time contracts. As  anticipated, these and all the  other features of the Program  were discussed together with the  Trade Unions, thus ensuring  shared value and foundations. Such a major change is strongly  supported by an extensive  change management program  that involves both managers and  their people, facilitating the  transition to the new work  approach, through specific  development paths tailored to  the different roles. In 2017,  training initiatives were offered  to the employees involved in the  first pilot of the Program, in  addition to coaching sessions  for the managers focused on  the new way of coordinating  People and the related  leadership styles.   4.2 PEOPLE ENGAGEMENT   AND REWARD 72  The objective of the training  initiatives and of the overall  change management program   is to develop and strengthen   a culture of personal  accountability, based on trust   and solid planning capabilities   that will enable people to focus  their way of working on a result- oriented approach.  The Be Adaptive Program can  further improve Company  performances through increasing  operational and planning  autonomy, reducing costs and  improving work/life balance.   At the same time, the  environment and the local  communities will benefit from  the CO2 reduction generated by  the choice of working from  home or from co-working areas  – thus significantly reducing the  usage of public and private  transportation. Together with  people engagement, the Group   is investing in transforming   its physical spaces.   In order to value the meeting and  working opportunities offered by  the Hall of the Milan Group  headquarters in the Garibaldi  Complex, 1,200 m2 will become  MEETinG, a new co-working hub.  This area is in addition to the space  hosting the canteen which, thanks  to an important requalification  initiative, is no longer only the place  where to eat but an actual working  and meeting space. MANAGEMENT MEETING   – CASCADING PROCESS Every year several initiatives are  organized with the purpose of  engaging our People in Company  objectives and enhancing their  sense of belonging to the Group.  Top Management meets   the Executives team, sharing   the annual managerial   and development priorities   and launching the cascading  process within the Company   to ensure - through their adoption  and uniform application across   the Group - the goals achievement.  Diversity involves recognizing  and valuing the unique  contribution people can offer  thanks to their individual and  cultural background, as well   as different skills, experiences  and perspectives.  The Group highly appreciates  and promotes the value of  diversity, as well as the  importance of creating and  maintaining an inclusive and  collaborative workplace culture,  to guarantee high level   of competitiveness and  sustainability to the organization.  This is testified by the fact that  over the years of analysis the  number of differing nationalities  employed at the Group has  increased from 58 in 2015   to 70 in 2017.  At the Groups Milan  headquarters, after Italians,   the largest contingent has always  been Indian. For this reason, from  2015, the Group decided to  organize at the Milan headquarters  events to celebrate the Diwali  Festival with Indian colleagues. With a particular focus on  gender diversity and beginning  with the Milan headquarters,   the Group introduced a specific  policy to support the return to  work from maternity leave and,  in general, to assure equal  opportunities in respect   to employment.  At the Mumbai offices, it has  been formed the Internal  Complaint Committee (ICC)  in order to keep the work  environment free from sexual  harassment and gender  discrimination and in charge  of considering and redressing  notified complaints of Sexual  Harassment. The ICC has five  members, three females   and two males. One female  member is the Chairperson   of the Committee and one  female member is from a   non-government organization. 4.3 DIVERSITY DIVERSITY 74  PARENTAL LEAVE 2015 2016 2017 Women Men TOTAL Women Men TOTAL Women Men TOTAL Total number of employees   that took parental leave 4 38 42 3 35 38 0 44 44 Total number of employees that  returned to work after parental  leave ended and were still  employed 12 months after their  return to work 1 35 36 3 23 26 2 42 44 Total number of employees that  did not return to work after  parental leave ended 0 3 3 1 0 1 0 1 1 Total number of employees that  returned to work after parental   leave ended 3 23 26 2 42 44 0 42 42 TERMINATION RATE 0% 11.5% 10.3% 33.3% 0% 2.2% 0% 2.33% 2.33% RETURN TO WORK RATE  (REPORTING PERIOD) 0% 88.5% 89.7% 66.7% 100% 97.8% 0% 97.7% 97.7% Maire Tecnimont protects work   and family balance, granting also  parental leave to its employees.

Having said that, the gender  pay gap is influenced by the dynamics  and by the peculiarity of our  operations (plants located in remote  geographies) therefore we decided to  limit the gender pay gap analysis   to the primary Italian companies   of our Group.  The table above shows that less  women are still employed than men  (particularly so in the Executive  category), but the salary gap is  significantly lower than national  4 Data refer to employees of the italian group companies, with registered office in Italy. average. This is particularly pertinent  in view of the latest Global Gender  Gap Report results, according   to which in Italy female annual   work income is 52% of males,   with the same percentage (51%)   for salaries related to similar jobs. The table also indicates how the salary  gap has been closed over time with  reference to basic salaries in the  clusters – Executive, Middle  Management and White Collar - age  range 31-50, showing a gender salary  gap that on average is less than 10%.  Finally, it has to be highlighted that the  gender pay gap referred to employees  at the White Collar level under 30  years old is almost zero (less than 1%).

The  initiatives are focused on technical  updates, Project Management  methods and techniques, Risk  Management and Analysis,  Contract Management, Economic  and Financial issues, intercultural  awareness in the working  relationships and managerial   and communication skills. A particular focus is placed on   the latter as the Group strongly  supports the acquisition   of the tools required to improve the  effectiveness of conduct,  enhancing interaction among  colleagues and between managers  and their staff, strengthening  communication and work dynamics  within a team becoming more and  more multicultural.   This is why training initiatives   are organized on intercultural  awareness and diversity - which  deserve constant attention   and make the Group unique. Almost all the above-mentioned  initiatives are designed and  delivered in collaboration with  In order to maintain a high level of  expertise at the Group, developing  human capital skills and keeping it  in line with business needs, Maire  Tecnimont Group offers its  employees dedicated training   and development plans.

Partnering with the local NGO  CORP, our Group for the third  year in a row promoted the active  participation of Indian women in  the economic life of their  communities thanks to vocational  courses able to generate quality  employment and/or micro  enterprises (tailoring, beautician,  teachers training, computer  literacy and income generation  programmes). The project involved more than  900 women in 13 disadvantaged  neighborhoods of Greater  Mumbai. It encompassed specific  skill training as well as education  on womens rights and  empowerment, providing at the  same time proper support  services (creches and preschool  for womens children) so   to maximize women attendance.  According to the participant  reviews and follow-ups, the more  women were economically  independent the more they  increased investment on their  children education, so activating  a virtuous circle with   an additional long term   positive effect. The outcomes of the initiative  covered a wide range of positive  returns: the approach to social  and economic issues in an  integrated but very pragmatic  way, allowed to touch at the same  time key topics in line with the  UN Sustainable Development  Goals our Group decided to  embrace (SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 4,  SDG 5, SDG 8). Moreover, the  involvement of local communities  not only as attendees but also as  partners in designing the training  courses was a plus guaranteed by  the local NGO CORP. Rights, the ILO conventions,  international Human Rights  norms and domestic labour law,  sets voluntary benchmarks to be  met by employers in the  workplace, regarding workers  rights, workplace conditions and  the management system,  through a risk-based approach  identifying and prioritizing   areas of current or potential   non-compliance. The Group policy is based   on the following key principles:  respect for all applicable laws, ILO  conventions, regulations and voluntary  agreements on human and   workers rights;  viewing employees as a strategic  resource by guaranteeing respect for  their rights and promoting their  professional and personal development;  recognizing dialogue as a basic tool  for pursuing and improving Social  Responsibility, through involving and  consulting with workers, also through  the SA8000 representatives;  selecting and promoting suppliers  and contractors in accordance with   this policy;  targeted training courses   and information for all employees;  involving and consulting with   all stakeholders;  ongoing monitoring of the  Management System for Social  Responsibility by defining specific areas  for improvement and verification   of related objectives. All information from monitoring  activities is used by the Group  to redefine policies, actions and  conduct to ensure full respect  for Human Rights in our  operating environments.

The risk  assessment is conducted on   the basis of the Enterprise Risk  Management methodology.  The activities involve risk  mapping, risk identification for  each company function and risk  owner, probability assessments  and impacts for active risks and  the identification of risk control  measures. Furthermore, at each  Group Sister Company an  SA8000 Workers representative  has been elected to facilitate  workers contact with company  management on matters related  to Social Responsibility. On site, Construction  Management plays a lead role   in increasing awareness   and monitoring of Human  Rights. All site personnel receive  Social Responsibility training,  both in a traditional classroom  setting and through e-learning  video clips.  A central aspect of our vision is  to listen and give voice to the  various Group internal and  external stakeholders. We have  therefore created a channel for  all our stakeholders to send/ receive reports, as a direct way  of receiving insights   and suggestions to improve  daily working life.  These channels differ depending  on the type of stakeholder  involved and are all managed  through applying thorough  analysis and transparency.  In particular, alongside  dedicated SA8000 Management  Team and Worker  Representative mailboxes,   the Group has developed more  structured ways to access   the channels and ensure the  anonymity of the complainant,  as per the previously mentioned  grievance mechanism.  A special section of the  corporate website allows both  internal and external  stakeholders to report alleged  breaches of company policies  and/or of SA8000   standard requirements.

The  Maire Tecnimont Group therefore  in 2016 acquired a minority  holding in Siluria Technologies Inc. Siluria is a technology company  based in San Francisco which  has developed innovative  industrial technologies for the  production of chemicals and fuel  made from natural gas. The  technologies are based on an  innovative and proprietary  OCM (Oxidative Coupling of  Methane) process for the direct  conversion of methane into  ethylene and propylene. With this investment, the Maire  Tecnimont Group becomes  Silurias exclusive partner for the  development, commercialization  and licensing of this innovative  technology. The Maire Tecnimont Group and  Siluria have combined their  respective technologies and  expertise to develop and  commercialize the GAS TO  PROPYLENE Technology, a  unique and paradigm-breaking  process to directly convert gases  rich in methane into one of the  most important base chemical  products - Propylene. The technology is now ready for  commercialization. The first  industrial plant is expected to  open by the end of 2020. The  largest demonstration plant is  located in Texas. Propylene is one of the main  building blocks for the global  petrochemical industry, with a  total market of approx. 100  Million tons per year. For decades, propylene has  been produced through a  high-energy and capital intense  process. The significant Capex  required and the low energy  efficiency of these technologies  has historically resulted in the  construction of large scale  plants (millions of tons per year  capacity and multi-billion dollar  outlay). Our GAS TO PROPYLENE  Technology makes the  production of propylene possible  via an innovative process at far  higher energy efficiency.   This means lower temperatures,  the reduced consumption of  fossil fuels and ultimately lower  greenhouse gases. A TRANSFORMATIVE INNOVATION PROJECT: SILURIA TECNOLOGIES Major results have also been  delivered in the field of  thermodynamic solar through  the European Commission  funded R&D MATS project,  focusing on the use of solar  power for the production   of electricity, combined   with the production of  desalinated water.  SOLAR The project involves the  construction of an industrial  scale prototype in 2017 and is an  important milestone for the  commercialization of this novel  technology within the next five  years. The demonstration plant,  located in Alexandria, Egypt,  produces 1 MWe and 250 m3/d  of desalinated water.  NATURAL GAS THERMODYNAMIC SOLAR GAS TO PROPYLENE Technology  makes the production of propylene  possible via an innovative process  at far higher energy efficiency.

MATERIAL INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION 99  KT has focused on the use of  renewable sources for hydrogen  and fuel production based on  upgrading biogas plant to  produce bio-hydrogen according  to steam reforming technology,  autothermal reforming and  reforming coupled with  membrane technology. KT has  studied also the production of  hydrogen starting from water/ ethanol mixtures for centralized  and distributed applications.   In order to reduce further its  carbon footprint, over the last  two years KT has started to work  on Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG)  production starting from carbon  dioxide and hydrogen. A pilot  plant has been designed,  constructed and tested at the  Scientific and Technological Park  of Abruzzo. The results confirm  the possibility to store excess  energy in a high density molecule  like methane. BIOFUELS PRODUCTION NOVEL CHEMICALS AND INTERMEDIATES PRODUCTION As a follow up to the   European Commission funded  R&D Project CARENA,   KT proceeded with the  experimental activities at pilot  level on the application of  membrane reactors for the  production of propylene   via propane selective  dehydrogenation. The research  was performed in collaboration  with the University of Salerno.  As part of the selection of  innovative sustainable projects,  the Group promoted the \"Acid  Gas\" technology, an innovative  process for the separation, by  means of cryogenic distillation,   of the acid components  contained in natural gas streams. Many natural gas fields contain a  significant amount of CO2: to  make the gas suitable for  commercialization and usage,  this compound has to be  removed. This CO2, after being  recovered by means of traditional  technologies, is currently vented  into the atmosphere since, in  many cases, re-injection costs  make this choice unfeasible. The  Acid Gas technology, jointly  developed by Tecnimont and the  Politecnico di Milano, permits the  development of these natural gas  fields in a more economical and  sustainable way. The intrinsic  characteristics of the Acid Gas  technology would considerably  reduce natural gas production  costs and CO2 re-injection   costs, thus developing these  challenging fields while limiting  greenhouse gas emissions. Following thorough  thermodynamic studies,  modeling and simulations, in 2016  a laboratory scale pilot plant was  built and put into operation.   With the execution of a year-long  experimental campaign, the   Acid Gas technology has been  successfully demonstrated and  validated. During 2017, the main  activities focused on the  execution of further experimental  tests, on the development of a  technology design package for  an industrial plant, and on the  search for an Industrial Partner  with whom to collaborate for the  scale-up to an industrial size pilot  plant, thus allowing the start-up  of licensing activities. NEW TECNOLOGY TO SEPARATE ACID COMPONENTS IN THE NATURAL GAS STREAM  HYDROGEN, CARBON DIOXIDE NATURAL GAS KT has started to work on Synthetic  Natural Gas (SNG) production  starting from carbon dioxide   and renewable Hydrogen. \"Acid Gas\" technology, a process for the separation of the acid components contained  in natural gas streams, would  considerably reduce natural gas  production costs and CO2   re-injection costs. MATERIAL INNOVATION MATERIAL INNOVATION 100  Maire Tecnimont Groups R&D  and innovation strategy focuses  on the continuous pursuit of new  ideas and new applications of  existing knowledge, utilising  pilot plant for validation of the  innovative developed concepts. Sustainability is the driver of KTs  activities, with the Company  strongly committed to creating  new industrial standards with high  added value capable of  minimizing energy consumption  and environmental impact. Most  of KTs pilot plants are installed  and operated at the Scientific and  Technological Park of Abruzzo,  where KT is an industrial partner  and has a testing facility area of  approx. 1000 m2. The Scientific and Technological  Park of Abruzzo is a strategic  asset for KT R&D; it is also  recognized by the European  scientific community as an  example of technological  excellence. Over recent years,  the park has also been  considered a focal point for  training and technological  networking.  For the experimental validation  and demonstration of the   Acid Gas technology, in 2015  Tecnimont committed to the  design and construction of a  laboratory scale pilot plant.   This plant has been installed   and operated in Piacenza at   the facilities of a company  specialized in running  experimental and research  plants. The plant was first  commissioned and put in  operation in 2016. Fed by gas bottles, the pilot  plant has been designed to test  a wide range of feed gas  compositions, recovering a  treated, saleable, natural gas  stream and a high-pressure   CO2 by-product.  PILOT PLANTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES The successful validation of   the technology during the first  experimental campaign   paved the way for a second  experimental campaign to,   inter alia, explore the energetic  optimization of the process. \"ACID GAS\" LABORATORY   SCALE PILOT PLANT The pilot plant has been designed  to test a wide range of feed gas  compositions, recovering a treated,  saleable, natural gas stream and a  high-pressure CO2 by-product. TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION 101  PROCESS   INNOVATION In particular, cost reduction   and improved engineering  methodologies are being targeted.  This has generated a large  number of ideas, many of which  have been developed and are  being applied to EPC projects  (Design To Cost).  SINCE 2014 THE SUBSIDIARY TECNIMONT   HAS HELD AN INTERNAL   PROCESS INNOVATION PROGRAM  DRIVEN BY COMPETITION   WITHIN THE MARKET   TO ESTABLISH BETTER   ENGINEERING PRACTICES AND   TECHNOLOGY AS AN ADDED VALUE. The Group constantly focuses  on stimulating the generation  of innovative ideas.  Several Lesson Learnt have also  emerged and new Company  Standardsand codes as well as  new Work Instructions have  been issued.    In particular, a project for the  customization and use of BIM,   an innovative building design  system, has been launched   to extend BIM application to  industrial design and in  particular the design of   industrial plant. 5.4 PROCESS   INNOVATION 102  Interaction with  local communities,  reinforcement  of supply chain,  creation of value  for clients to deliver   sustainable value.  - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT - LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT - CUSTOMER RELATIONS - RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN MATERIAL TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THIS CHAPTER SDGs STAKEHOLDER TO WHOM IT CONCERNS BUSINESS PARTNERS TECHNOLOGICAL PARTNERS CLIENTS PROFESSIONAL /CATEGORY  ASSOCIATIONS CONTRACTORS & SUB- CONTRACTORS SUPPLIERS 06.   CREATING  SUSTAINABLE  VALUE  MAIRE TECNIMONT IS   AWARE THAT CORPORATE  RESPONSIBILITY IMPLIES NOT  ONLY THE GENERATION OF  ECONOMIC RESULTS, BUT  ALSO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT  SPECIFIC LOCAL COMMUNITY  AND LOCAL ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT NEEDS,  ALONGSIDE STRONG AND  RELIABLE SUPPLY CHAIN  RELATIONSHIPS AND  TRUSTING CUSTOMER  RELATIONS. Interacting with local communities  and institutions, reinforcing the  supply system and creating value  for clients are fundamental  aspects of Maire Tecnimonts  strategy to deliver sustainable  value. This is viewed by the   Group as a multi-dimensional  opportunity - simultaneously  bringing economic, social,   and environmental benefits   to stakeholders.  This approach allows the Group  not only to create and deliver  sustainable value – considering  the importance of projects, the  size of plant and the operating  locations – but also builds trust  in the communities where the  Group operates and helps clients  to solve complex needs.  The presence of the Group in  more than 40 countries  worldwide diversifies revenue  streams and minimizes exposure  risks to a particular region.  Moreover, the introduction of a  structured supplier qualification  process (including a social &  environmental screening)  significantly reduces the risk of  technical or financial capacity  deficiencies and of supplier  non-compliance. In addition,  Maire Tecnimonts focus on  developing local communities  through ad-hoc capacity  building activities allows the  Group to find the right set of  local skills to develop our  complex plants. 06.   CREATING  SUSTAINABLE  VALUE 107  We let our business speak for  itself: in 2017, Maire Tecnimont  generated Economic Value of  3,557.5 million, increasing   49% on 2016. This mainly   follows the progress made   on major projects in the Middle  East, Russia, Europe and America.  This value is distributed for  3,465.4 million, with an  increase of 51% on 2016, among  the components as shown in   the following page.  The Economic Value retained   in 2017 amounts to 92.1 million.

The event has been crucial in sharpening the focus on Social and  Environmental issues. More than 120 chief executive officers and sales  directors of Italian and international multinationals attended the event,  representing more than 520 billion of turnover and a workforce of more  than 2 million around the world. SPEED, INTELLIGENCE AND COOPERATION IN PROCUREMENT:  THE E2Y PROGRAM    In 2015, Maire Tecnimont launched the E2Y procurement platform to  enable a more effective, proactive, and integrated procurement cycle.   All the phases of the procurement process are now electronically  managed in compliance with both Group procedures and local and  geographic needs. It enhances negotiation process transparency,  ensuring a more efficient integration among Engineering, Procurement  and Construction and faster negotiation - without compromising the  quality of the supplier. The Maire Tecnimont Groups  sustainable supply chain is  managed in accordance with   the procurement cycle of the  relationship through the  following steps:  Supplier qualification via  questionnaires on the E2Y platform  and on-site audits  On-site inspections  Tender management (negotiation  + order)  Performance measurement and  evaluation THE QUALIFICATION PROCESS  IS THE GATE   The first part of the procurement  process is vendor qualification,  assessing the applicant by  focusing on a range of areas:  Industrial information  Financials  Quality management  Health, Safety and Environment  Human Rights  Compliance (code of ethics,  anti-corruption, anti-terrorism) SINCE 2016, ALL INFORMATION   ARE HANDLED THROUGH   THE E2Y PLATFORM   THAT ENSURES THE TRACEABILITY   AND CONSISTENCY   OF THE DATA EXCHANGED. 117  Only after passing the  assessment may the supplier  qualify for the specific  commodity and receive orders. At present 100% of new  suppliers are screened on  environmental and social  criteria. Depending on product/ service offered, suppliers are  subjected to due diligence to  evaluate their compliance   in the following area: THE MAIRE TECNIMONT GROUP  QUALIFICATION PROCESS,  WHICH IS MANDATORY  ONLY FOR SPECIFIC TYPES OF  MATERIALS AND SERVICES PURCHASED,  REQUIRES THE POTENTIAL SUPPLIER  TO REGISTER AND FILL IN QUESTIONNAIRES ON THE WEB,  INCLUDING INFORMATION  ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT,   SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY   AND HEALTH AND SAFETY.

Wherever it operates in the  world, Maire Tecnimont plays an  active role in local community  development, contributing to  the social and economic  wellbeing of a territory.   This means creating local  employment, strengthening  local suppliers, increasing   local ownership in the industry,  promoting enterprise  development, accelerating   the transfer of skills and  technologies and prioritizing  the employment and training   of local citizens. On the other hand, during  construction operations the local  communities may suffer minor  environmental or social impacts  such as an higher waste  production or greater CO2   and noise emissions, both  localized at construction   areas and on public roads where  the traffic is heavy.     However, any real or potential  impact is temporary and is, in  any case, proactively managed  in order to reduce the exposure  of the population and to comply  with local regulations and  Client's expectations. 6.4 DEVELOPING   LOCAL COMMUNITIES 120  OPERATIVE OBJECTIVE GENERAL OBJECTIVE ACTIONS ENHANCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITIES   FOR LOCAL LABOUR FORCE TRAINING AND PROGRESSION   FOR LOCAL PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL SUPPLIERS INVESTMENTS IN FIXED ASSETS NEARBY  CONSTRUCTION SITES ENHANCEMENT OF OPPORTUNITIES   FOR LOCALLY-BASED SUPPLIERS   OF GOODS AND SERVICES   Provision of direct assistance/support   (also through workshops) to local firms   on pre-qualification/accreditation process     Performance of meetings aimed at   clarifying technical issues with prospective local   sub-contractors  Encourage first time Sub-contractors to  maximize local SME participation in the project  Coaching and mentoring programmes  Cooperation with local training schools     Post-training employment opportunities in  the local downstream and gas transformation  industry and overseas   Assistance to local employees in discovering  job opportunities   Alerting local suppliers about tender  opportunities, providing real-time support   in how to navigate the vendor registration,   pre-qualification and tendering process  Upgrading local suppliers and partners  through improvements in operational process,  efficiency and quality assurance  Collaboration with other organisations,  such as other operators and contractors, public  institutions and non-governmental organisations  Investments in operational offices, manufacturing facilities, service facilities or other fixed assets  To employ local workforce  To require sub-contractors to use local workforce TO ENHANCE LOCAL CONTENT 1 1 3 4 5 2 2 3 4 5 This approach allows   Maire Tecnimont to:  develop a sustainable and trusting  relationship with the local market,  helping to reduce the costs and risks  associated with projects;  improve the perception of the  company and create the conditions   for mutual understanding;  develop local skills and employ  local manpower as a Government lever  to sustain economic growth or,  alternatively, face international  sanctions;  transfer skills, know-how and  technologies to the local market   and workforce;  improve the reliability of local  companies in terms of quality, delivery,  fit for purpose, flexibility, availability of  materials logistics and transportation;  tackle new commercial  opportunities and support the local  market penetration strategy in light   of the legal framework for EPC  contractors;  design different strategic actions  that maximize impact with Key Local  Stakeholders;  improve HSE implementation in  line with the most stringent and  internationally recognized standards. 121  6.4 DEVELOPING   LOCAL COMMUNITIES AMISTAD  MEXICO RENEWABLE ENERGY YARA  NETHERLANDS FERTILIZERS FERTILIZERS PETROCHEMICALS OIL&GAS REFINING RENEWABLE ENERGY TYPE OF PROJECT REPRESENTATIVE   PROJECTS   AROUND THE WORLD 122  KIMA  EGYPT FERTILIZERS TEMPA ROSSA  ITALY OIL&GAS REFINING LOTOS K-214  POLAND OIL&GAS REFINING KINGISEPP  RUSSIAN FEDERATION PETROCHEMICALS RAPID  MALAYSIA PETROCHEMICALS AMURSKI  RUSSIAN FEDERATION OIL&GAS REFINING ORPIC  OMAN PETROCHEMICALS 3.9 bln 1.6 bln AGGREGATE VALUE OF THE  CONTRACTUAL CONSIDERATIONS PURCHASES OF GOODS   AND SERVICES PROVIDED LOCALLY In order to show the footprint in  connection with our presence on  the territory and to describe our  strategies for the engagement of  communities, the investments,  the public-private partnerships  and the creation of skills, we  have identified a representative  sample of our projects. In particular, we have identified  the 8 projects that best  represent the business   of the group both in terms   of progress, and as a type of  product and technology.

Site preparation activities for a large industrial  complex normally require the movement and disposal of enormous quantities of soil.   In the case of this project, however, this also  presented an opportunity to environmentally  redevelop part of the coastline which had been  damaged by erosion and posed a security threat  to houses and roads in the nearby Village of  Carawan. The operation salvaged a two-kilometre  stretch of the beach and allowed residents to  once again enjoy the Carawan sea shore.   The operation was completed in the latter half of  2016 in close collaboration with local authorities:   the Municipality of Sohar, the Ministry of the  Environment and the Sohar Environmental Unit.

This was undertaken in order to provide  optimised, rational and quick solutions utilising  the capabilities of Local manufacturers, traders,  stockists and various Technical service providers. From Q4 2016, the Maire Tecnimont Group  deployed a fully dedicated Procurement team to the KT-Kinetics Technology SpA Azerbaijan  Branch Office to carry out all procurement on the local market. The goal was to set up a fully integrated environment for Vendor  Selection regarding all aspects of Procurement  and to provide opportunities to Local Vendors to participate in a Global Platform to cater to Big Companies like Maire Tecnimont. The objective was to use as much as possible  Local Vendors such as Manufacturers/ distributors/Licensed companies for   our project needs. Such robust procurement reduces leads times  for deliveries and in turn adds value for the client.  Local manufacturers capable of providing  technical and field services benefitting the   end client were also identified. Examples include   steel fabrication works, underground piping,  fittings, flanges, valves, chemicals, mobile   radios, I&CT products, testing tools,   third party inspection etc. From Q4 2016 Deployed a fully dedicated  procurement team to the   KT-Kinetics Technology SpA  Azerbaijan Branch Office All  procurement  on the local  market NUMBER   OF LOCAL  PURCHASE  ORDERS ISSUED 250+ NUMBER   OF QUALIFIED  SUPPLIERS 200+ VALUE OF   THE LOCAL  PROCUREMENT,  FOR PROJECT  MATERIALS ONLY 3 TIMES THE EXPECTED VALUE PROCUREMENT RESULTS OF THE CAPABILITY TO LEVERAGE ON THE LOCAL SUPPLIERS PROCESS KT-KINETICS TECHNOLOGY OVERALL HIRES Knowledge of local  legislation 1 Knowledge of the local  market   and local  suppliers 2 Ability to  deepen Client  relationships 4 Improved  communication  ability   with local  authorities   and technical  interfaces 3 Building trust in  dealing with our  company and  achieving   competitive  advantages to  be fully passed  on to our  Clients 5 127  From the beginning of the Tempa Rossa project,  Maire Tecnimont established different initiatives to transfer value to the local communities. The course, provided by Assoil School in  partnership with Maire Tecnimont Group,  allowed participants to qualify as quantity  surveyors (responsible for the management of the construction sub-contractors).  Over a period of three weeks (120 hours  overall) beginning June 24, 2013, classrooms  and on-site lessons covered the eight main  modules showed in the table below.   14 young professionals from the Basilicata  Region with engineering, economy or geology  degrees took part; 5 have been hired by   Maire Tecnimont Group and are still part of   the Maire Tecnimont on-site workforce.   Moreover, participation was free and resulted   in AiFOS certification. Tempa Rossa is an oil field located in the upper  valley of the Sauro river, in the heart of the  Basilicata Region in southern Italy. The project  mainly covers areas in the municipalities of Corleto  Perticara, Guardia Perticara and Gorgoglione, and  is located between the Regional Park of Gallipoli  Cognato and the National Park of Pollino. The concession, named Gorgoglione, is located   in the heart of a highly-valued region for tourism  due to the beauty of its natural landscapes;  the local archaeological heritage is a significant  factor. To design and build an oil&gas treatment plant in such an environment is  therefore a challenge for the players involved   in terms of the safety of operations and  environmental protection.

IMPORTANCE   AND VALUE   OF OUR HSE  POLICY - ENERGY EFFICIENCY - GHG EMISSIONS - WATER AND WASTE MANAGEMENT - HEALTH AND SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS MATERIAL TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THIS CHAPTER SDGs STAKEHOLDER TO WHOM IT CONCERNS TECHNOLOGICAL PARTNERS CLIENTS LOCAL  ORGANIZATIONS  & NGOs LOCAL  COMMUNITIES  FULLY IN LINE WITH SDGs  NR. 3 AND NR. 15, MAIRE  TECNIMONT IDENTIFIES   THE HEALTH AND WELFARE  OF THE INDIVIDUAL,   THE SAFETY OF DESIGNED  AND BUILT INDUSTRIAL  PLANTS AND THE  PROTECTION OF THE  ENVIRONMENT AS  ESSENTIAL CORPORATE  OBJECTIVES.   Focusing on the prevention of  any type of incident and the  mitigation of any impact on the  ecosystem, the Group is  committed to providing  workplaces, services and  industrial plants which comply  with applicable legal  requirements and the highest  Health, Safety and Environment  (HSE) standards, while also  encouraging work safely and  environmental protection  approaches, for every area of  Company operations and during  all phases of project execution,  both at home office   and site level. THE DESIGN, PLANNING,  IMPLEMENTATION,  MONITORING AND  CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT  OF AN EFFICIENT AND  EFFECTIVE HSE  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM   ARE THE MAIN DRIVERS  132  BEHIND ESTABLISHING  APPROPRIATE HSE  PRIORITIES, OBJECTIVES  AND TARGETS.     The monitoring and control of  legal and other applicable  requirements is also  fundamental - including national  and international laws, local  requirements, agreements with  local authorities or customers,  voluntary principles and codes  of practice, in addition to the  satisfaction of the contractual  requirements of our customers.  The HSE Management System is  certified by third party  organization for the main  operating companies according  to the ISO 14001 standard for  environmental management and  to the OHSAS 18001 standard for  occupational health and safety.  In order to ensure the company's  success, a HSE Policy is provided  to all employees: it is a key guide  for corporate functions   and at the same time an asset  and strategic value for the   entire Group. The HSE Policy specifies  principles, objectives, targets,  roles and responsibilities, in  addition to the management  criteria necessary to control HSE  issues. These objectives and  targets are communicated to the  Companies by Top Management  and pursued through involving  all personnel in each activity  during the engineering,  procurement, construction and  commissioning stages of our  projects, and according to the  following principles:  fulfillment of all laws, rules or  international standards regarding  health, safety and environmental  matters;  identification of hazards and  environmental issues, evaluating the  impacts and risks - whether for the  home offices or for project execution  - setting out suitable preventive  measures;  prevention of incidents and injuries  and environmental incidents;  provision to all employees of  specific safety and environment  protection training;  engagement of all workers, also  through their safety representatives;  measuring and monitoring   of safety and environmental  performances;  selection and promotion   of suppliers and sub-contractors  according to the principles  underpinning this policy. Continuous and intensive  monitoring and periodic audits  are carried out by the HSE  internal auditors within the  organization and by external  notified bodies, ensuring that  the HSE obligations are  effectively met.  THE GROUP HSE FUNCTION  PLANS, COORDINATES,  MONITORS AND COLLECTS  RELEVANT DATA, SETTING  OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS,  IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE  LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND  THE EFFICIENCY AND  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HSE  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. In accordance with SDGs Nr. 7  and Nr. 13, the Group is highly  committed to apply engineering  standard, which minimize energy  consumption and emissions and  consequently environmental  impact. Dedicated HSE Studies  are carried out during project  execution in order to ensure safe  and reliable installations, a high  standard of safety in the  workplace and the minimization  of environmental impacts,  energy waste and GHG  emissions. 07.   IMPORTANCE   AND VALUE   OF OUR HSE  POLICY 133  7.1 HSE CULTURE   AND TRAINING An intensive training program  and relevant sessions involve all  employees in order to improve  knowledge on health, safety  and environment issues,  tailored according to the role  and tasks of the employee.  The core topics are the HSE  Management System framework  and Policy, the main hazards and  risks at the home office and on  field construction sites, the  preventative and protective  measures to be adopted and   the emergency procedures.  The full program includes both  classroom and e-learning  lessons, involving collaboration  with external qualified companies. HSE CULTURE   AND TRAINING TRAINING IS ESSENTIAL   FOR THE CREATION OF VALUE   FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND TO  ENSURE THE LONG-TERM HEALTH   OF OUR BUSINESS. IT IS A CORE  STRATEGIC ACTIVITY OF THE GROUP,  WHICH CONTINUOUSLY DEVELOPS   THE PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCES   AND SKILLS OF OUR EMPLOYEES. 134  2015 2016 2017 HSE training hours for Home  office, construction site and  Operation and Maintenance  Employees  18,328 23,521 55,728 HSE training hours for  Sub-contracting workers 326,248 706,700 2,323,330 3,453,855 hours have been dedicated  to HSE courses over the last three  years. The table above breaks down  HSE training hours by year. The average hours of training per  capita provided to employees at home  office and construction sites for Maire  The ratio between HSE training hours  and men-hours worked on site is  increasing, from 1.48% in 2015 to  2.74% in 2017 and this reflects our  3.0% 2.5% 2.0% 1.5% 1.48% 2.09% 2.74% 0.5% 1.0% 0.0% HSE TRAINING/CONSTRUCTION WORKING HOURS HSE TRAINING HOURS BY YEAR 2015 2016 2017 Tecnimont Group on HSE and  Social Accountability topics are  4.3 hours in 2015, 5.1 hours  in 2016 and 11.1 hours in 2017.  In addition to that all  subcontractor workers at  construction sites receive training  on HSE and Human Rights issues. strong focus and our high  commitment on prevention   and personnel training.  In terms of the activities  performed on site, training is   a key element for incident  prevention: entering a  construction area exposes  personnel to risks related to  both field activities and the  presence of chemicals, as the  construction area is generally  built within the industrial plants.  Different levels of training are  available on site for supervisors,  HSE professionals and workers,  including the general HSE  induction, the fire-fighting  course, the first aid courses,   the construction risk exposure  courses (such as lifting safety   or confined space entry,  scaffolding safety and courses  on chemical and material   safety handling). Particular  attention is dedicated to training  on the use of the Personal  protective equipment provided  to employees according to their  risk exposure. 135  The ISO 14001 certification  confirms that a consistent  Environmental Management  System has been established to  regularly evaluate, control and  mitigate environmental impacts  from the execution of projects  and home offices activities. The Group periodically identifies  and reviews all environmental  aspects, in order to plan  objectives and measurable  targets, identify and implement  corrective actions and re- evaluate the efficacy of the  system as part of a cycle of  continuous improvements. A detailed analysis is performed  to evaluate the significance of  activities that influence the  environment, negatively  impacting through the  consumption of energy, harmful  emission in the atmosphere,  spills on soil and water, waste  production, resource depletion  and flora and fauna damage.  The results of such analysis  result in specific action plans to  continuously mitigate impacts.  ENVIRONMENT  PROTECTION  RESPONSIBILITY THE MAIRE TECNIMONT GROUP  CONSIDERS ENVIRONMENTAL  RESPONSIBILITY AS A KEY FACTOR   IN SUPPORT OF SUSTAINABILITY   AND CLOSELY CONNECTED   TO THE ABILITY OF A BUSINESS   TO CREATE ADDED   AND SUSTAINABLE VALUE.  ISO  14001 7.2 ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION  RESPONSIBILITY 136  Specific local issues are  examined before construction  starts so that obligations   are identified and met.  The engineering phase is a  fundamental opportunity to  implement important  modifications proposed during  the design review which can  result in energy saving and  cleaner emissions leading to a  reduction in harmful compounds  entering the atmosphere,   soil and water and environmental  and economic benefits for   the customer, stakeholders   and the whole community.  MAIRE TECNIMONT IS HIGHLY  CONSCIOUS OF THE CONTRIBUTION   IT CAN MAKE DURING   THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE ON-SITE,   BY RESPECTING LOCAL LAWS   AND REGULATIONS,   PROMOTING AND EXPECTING   GOOD PRACTICE FROM   ALL SUB-CONTRACTORS AND BEING  CONSTANTLY READY TO ACT   IN THE CASE OF SPILLS OR  ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.  137  MAIRE TECNIMONT IS ALREADY  PROVIDING LOW-CARBON SOLUTIONS  TO ITS CLIENTS AND IS THEREFORE  EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THE POTENTIAL  GROWTH IN DEMAND.  Within the environmental  evaluation process, indirect  aspects connected to climate  change are afforded significant  focus which, on the other   hand, can be turned into an  opportunity. With respect to the  oil&gas sector, environmental   risks include:   the impact of more restrictive laws  and regulations on energy efficiency  and climate change, which may lead to  an increase in operational costs and,  consequently, to a reduction in  investment in the industry;  the impact of client awareness and  sensitivity to climate change and GHG  emissions reduction, with a  consequent shift towards low   carbon products. The development of general  environmental regulations   could generate new business  opportunities for Maire  Tecnimont in the growing low  carbon energy market. The expertise of the Group   in developing sustainable  solutions for its clients   and the ability of the Group   to react quickly   to changes in environmental  regulations are clear   competitive advantages. Moreover, client and consumer  demand for eco-friendly  solutions and renewable  energy technologies   is on the up. 138  RESPONSIBLE   USE OF RESOURCES Carbon dioxide (CO2) is   the final product of the most  common chemical reaction,   the combustion of coal,  hydrocarbons and biomass to  produce energy. Carbon dioxide  is also sometimes present in  large quantities in natural gas,  at gas fields throughout   the world.  CO2 has historically been   viewed as an inert waste  product and disposed of   into the atmosphere.   Nowadays, it is considered one   of the principal causes   of the greenhouse effect,   and consequently responsible   for the environmental impacts  associated with climate change.  Energy Saving in terms of fuel   and natural gas combustion  leads to a consequent reduction  in CO2 and other GHG emissions   in the atmosphere. Maire Tecnimonts Environmental  Policy focuses on monitoring  energy consumption of  construction and home office  activities, in order to evaluate  possible areas of improvement  and implement the relative  measures to reduce consumption. The following tables of Energy  Intensity and GHG Emission  Intensity factors and also energy  and water consumption and  waste in construction sites,   are mainly and strongly  influenced by the number of EPC  projects active during the year   of observation and by the phase   of each project as well,   in particular the trends observed  reflect the increase of projects  number and more advanced  phases in some projects from  2015 to 2017, as confirmed by   the total worked hours observed   in each period. The Olevano (Italy) Biomass  Power Plant environmental data  is not included in the following  paragraph (refer to the case  history Olevano p.146). It is highlighted that have been  estimated the data provided:  for the quota of personnel  employed at the Group's branches and  foreign offices, representative for  around 8% on average in 2015, 2016  and 2017 (9.4% for 2017) and related to  energy consumption (natural gas and  electricity), to the use of natural  resources (water) and production of  waste (hazardous and non-hazardous   as well as destination, recovery   and disposal in landfills);  for some construction sites equal  to about 1.5% on average of man-hours  worked in construction sites in 2015,  2016, 2017 (1% of man-hours worked  for 2017) and related to energy  consumption (electricity, use of fuel   for the production of electricity and  transport), to the use of natural  resources (water) and production of  waste (hazardous and non-hazardous   as well as destination, recovery   and disposal in landfills). 139  GHG EMISSIONS INTENSITY ENERGY INTENSITY 201511 2016 2017 kJ/man-hours worked  10,254 20,537 24,875 201512 2016 2017 kg CO2 /man-hours worked  0.99 1.64 1.92 The Groups energy intensity factors  are calculated using both direct   and indirect energy consumption   as a numerator and man-hours worked   as a denominator.

The table above shows the aggregate  volume of direct GHG emissions in  metric tons CO2 equivalent, generated  by Groups operations (Scope 1  emissions). The Group also quantifies  indirect emissions resulting from  electricity consumption   (Scope 2 emissions).  Direct emissions are emissions from  fossil fuels such as natural gas, diesel  and gasoline, directly through Group  activities and operations. Indirect  emissions are from the direct  consumption of electricity through  Group operations.

The Groups GHG emissions intensity  factors are calculated using both  direct and indirect emissions   (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions)   as a numerator and man-hours  worked as a denominator. Worked  hours have been acknowledged   as representative of the Groups   overall activity. 140  ENERGY MANAGEMENT   AT HEADQUARTERS Maire Tecnimonts headquarters  in Milan is an example of  sustainable architecture with a  high energy classification: it  produces about 30,000 kWh  from installed photovoltaic  panels and several energy saving  systems in offices. Such systems  have resulted in the achievement  of an excellent level of zero local  emissions of CO2 eq. Compared to 2016, in 2017   with the new KT headquarters  in Rome, a 604 MWh reduction  in electrical energy consumption  was achieved as a   direct result of conservation   and efficiency initiatives.   In terms of emission reduction,  this means 217 tons   CO2 eq. avoided13. To reach these objectives   and to maintain and identify  further improvement areas,  official energy audits at the  headquarters were performed   by a third party. The following main  consumptions are monitored   for continuous improvement:  natural gas for heating offices;  electricity for air conditioning,  computer equipment, lighting, etc.;  fuel for power production related  to emergency generators and heating  units;  fuel for private and public means   of transport for employees to reach   their workplace;  fuel for transportation   of suppliers of goods or services. 13 The following information should be considered in terms of these results:   - Gas included in the calculation: CO2 - Sources of the emission factor used: Confronto internazionale Terna 2014.;  - Scope in which reductions took place: Scope 2. 14 Group Energy consumption does not stem from renewable forms of energy.

MOBILITY MANAGEMENT      The specific purpose of Mobility  management is to reduce  environmental impacts from staff  commuting through reducing the  use of private individual transport  and developing sustainable  mobility policies.          The aim of Mobility Management is  to contribute in particular to the  reduction of CO2, heavy metals and  noise emissions by encouraging and   promoting the use of public  transport and car-sharing among  the many colleagues travelling  greater distances.    TCMPL (Tecnimont Private Limited)  is a good example of this policy,  due to 3,053 tons CO2 eq.15  of emissions reduced in 2017,  through a service bus for  commuting personnel. ENERGY MANAGEMENT   AT CONSTRUCTION SITES Regarding construction sites,   the Maire Tecnimont Group  invests time and resources   to periodically monitor and  control energy consumption   at our temporary facilities,  despite the difficulty   in collecting data as the project  construction teams are located  at the Clients site.   Nevertheless, this initiative   is promoted further   by including the consumption   of Subcontractor operating  vehicles, material suppliers   and private transportation. 15 With reference to this figure, the following information should be considered:  - Gases included in the calculation: CO2;  - Scope in which reductions took place: Scope 3  - Calculation tools used: GHG Protocol, Transport Tool V 2.6 - Local Bus, GHG Protocol, Transport Tool V 2.6 - Passenger Car, Diesel, 1983-Present.

Moreover, water resources are  often polluted by unauthorized  discharge or other illegal activities. WATER WATER MANAGEMENT   AT HEADQUARTERS The main sources of water for  sanitation and civil purposes  (canteen, toilets, flushing wc)  used by the companies located  in Maire Tecnimont Headquarters  in Milan are provided via public  supply network and, for a small  portion, via the rainwater  collection systems on the roof. The facilities of the complex   use groundwater to feed Heating  Ventilation Air Conditioning  (HVAC) systems, both for  heating and air conditioning;  groundwater is returned to the  soil without any significant  chemical change, aside from   a heat exchange.  Waste water products enter the  urban sewerage network (as is  the case for households)   WATER MANAGEMENT   AT CONSTRUCTION SITES During the construction phase,  the topic of safeguarding water  resources is part of the initial  training and the environmental  promotion campaign.  In respecting Client rules and the  local laws, no water discharge to  the public sewer or directly to  the sea and rivers is allowed.  Water consumption at  construction sites over the last  three years is presented below. and thus no discharge  authorization is needed in  accordance with the current  local law. Over the last three years, total  water withdrawn from municipal  water supplies or other public or  private water utilities were:  55,877 m3 in 2015, 65,610 m3   in 2016 and 53,234 m3 in 2017. The same quantity of water   was discharged to sewers over  the last three years.  In 2015, 983,700 m3 of ground  water were withdrawn (and  consequently discharged), while  in 2016 the amount was 954,600  m3 and 1,404,060 m3 in 2017.

WASTE MANAGEMENT   AT HEADQUARTERS In relation to waste management,  the Maire Tecnimont Group,   in accordance with the Local  Applicable Legislation (Ref.  Italian law Decree 152/2006 and  subsequent amendments and  supplements), and in accordance  with its ISO 14001 environmental  management system, undertakes  attentive and comprehensive  collection, transportation   and final treatment of waste   by means of qualified external  companies.   Indeed, detailed listing and  monitoring is performed relative  to the type of waste to be  disposed of, with indication of  the local applicable regulations  (referred EWC code - European  Waste Catalogue) and the  quantity produced in   percentage terms.  The Group has provided several  locations with segregated  collection bins for paper waste,  plastic and toner, promoting the  reduce – reuse – recycle  message, and specific temporary  storage areas, avoiding mixing  hazardous (electronic  components pc, lead-acid  batteries, neon lamps) and  non-hazardous waste (paper,  toner, electronic components,  alkaline batteries, furniture,  WASTE MANAGEMENT   AT CONSTRUCTION SITES Site and HSE Managers,  endorsing the Group  commitment, verify daily and  manage the sub-contractors  environmental procedures and  behaviors, assessing the entire  waste and scrap disposal process  from cradle to tomb, using  specific environmental plans   by which sub-contractors are  required to record their types of  waste material, the source  activity, the quantity, the  temporary storage and the  destination, in cooperation with  specialized waste companies  according to local laws. plastic packaging, mixed metals,  insulating material, wood). Thanks to this attentive  management process, virtually  everything is correctly collected  and delivered to the waste  companies ready to be recycled,  in line with Maire Tecnimont Policy. The highest percentage of waste  consists of paper; therefore, the  digitalization of documents  assists a \"paper-less\" approach  which helps to reduce paper  supplies and consequently paper  waste. The Group has started  also to increase the purchase of  recycled paper, encouraging  even more a \"recycling culture\"! ISO  14001 144  In 2016 and in particular in 2017, the  waste data reflects the increased  man-hours spent on sites. Waste data  are impacted by significant soil  excavations from construction sites:  about 320 thousand tons in 2016 and  484 thousand tons in 2017.  The percentage of waste disposal   CONSTRUCTION SITES WASTE MANAGEMENT (and therefore the percentage of  recovery) is affected, in some cases,  by the rules of construction site  applied in the industrial site owned  by the end user. It is also affected by  the limited availability, in some  countries, of public and private  collection networks and systems. 201520 2016 2017 Total weight of waste (tons) 128,454 402,301 929,284 Non hazardous (tons) 128,437 401,717 928,294 Hazardous (tons) 17 584 990 Total weight of waste   by disposal method (tons) 128,454 402,301 929,284 Recycling 54,156 88,392 109,660 Landfill 74,290 313,695 818,739 Other (to be specified) 8 214 885 RECOVERY (%) 42.2% 22.0% 11.8% DISPOSAL (%) 57.8% 78.0% 88.2% HOME OFFICE WASTE MANAGEMENT 2015 2016 2017 Total weight of waste (tons) 76 62 53 Non hazardous (tons) 75 59 52 Hazardous (tons) <1 3 <1 Total weight of waste   by disposal method (tons) 76 62 53 Recycling 75 58 52 Landfill <1 4 <1 Other (to be specified) 0 0 << 1 RECOVERY (%) 99.4% 92.8% 98.8% DISPOSAL (%) 0.6% 7.2% 1.2% 20 Site data for 2015 do not include all sites. 145  The Biomass Plant of Olevano Lomellina (Italy)  is a biomass power plant, having a rated  electrical capacity of about 20 Mwh.

The Group has committed   to the goal of incorporating  sustainability into the Group's  business strategy, governance,  operations and financial  reporting, in line with the  Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) established by the  United Nations in the 2030  Agenda for Sustainable  Development. The report has been prepared   in accordance with the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI)  Sustainability Reporting  Standards 2016: Core option.  Furthermore, Maire Tecnimont  has aligned itself with the new  Consolidated Non-Financial  Statement reporting  requirements provided for by  Italian Legislative Decree 254   of December 30, 2016, which  transposes, into Italian law,  Directive 2014/95/EU   of the European Parliament   and Council. STAKEHOLDER INCLUSIVENESS,  MATERIALITY, COMPLETENESS,  SUSTAINABILITY CONTEXT  The Sustainability Report  presents the main Group results  in terms of the economic,   social and environmental topics  identified in a dedicated  materiality analysis, which is  described in detail in Paragraph  2.3 Materiality Analysis of this  document. In order to identify  the most material themes, and  therefore determine the  contents of this report,  consideration was taken   of the opinions of the top  management of the various  corporate divisions in the Group,  as well as of sector analysis  results, sustainability macro- trends and other external  reference sources. The report  additionally aims to inform all  stakeholders on the Group's  main economic, social and  environmental results.  The following table shows, for  each of the identified material  topics, its relative boundary   both inside and outside of the  organization. Note that there   are no limits to the boundaries  of material topics inside   the organization.

Reporting  packages, in reference to these  indicators, were prepared   and sent to all data handlers  identified in the various divisions  both at corporate and subsidiary  level. The compiled reporting  packages were then aggregated  at the corporate level to   obtain an indication of the  performances of the   Group as a whole.  The data and information  provided in the Sustainability  Report refers to the   Maire Tecnimont Group, which   in turn refers to Maire Tecnimont  SpA and to the companies in the  Group's 2017 Annual Report.   It should be noted that:  financial data has been taken  from the Group's 2017 Annual  Report, and refer to all the  Group companies referenced  therein;  social data refers to all  Group companies referenced in  Group's 2017 Annual Report;  health, safety and  environment (HSE) data refers  to all Group companies  referenced in Group's 2017  Annual Report and their  respective sites and  environments. In cases in which  Group companies play the role  of main contractor,   data concerning them also  include data concerning  sub-contractors;   any further exceptions to  reporting boundaries are  indicated in individual sections. The Groups Sustainability  Report will be published  annually and circulated via the  communication tools ordinarily  used by the Group. 162  COMPARABILITY   AND CLARITY   In order to make the  Sustainability Report accessible  to all stakeholders, clear,  complete and concise language  has been used and images and  graphics included.

There have been no cases of confirmed incidents of corruption within the reporting period. There have been no cases of non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The number of new hires concerns permanent employees, considering the focus on structural personnel and as indicated  by workforce movements in the year. For consistent turnover analysis, the permanent workforce and the presentation of  the voluntary departure rate was focused on. Given the broad global spread of the Group, only benefits uniformly recognised at the various Group companies are  qualitatively represented. 169  Specific Disclosures  Reference Disclosure 401-3 Parental Leave Ch. 4 par 4.3 LABOR MANAGEMENT RELATIONS  Disclosure 402-1 Minimum notice periods regarding operational changes Ch. 4 Introduction OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY  Disclosure 403-2 Types of injury and rates of injury, occupational diseases, lost  days, and absenteeism, and number of work-related fatalities Ch. 7 par. 7.4 TRAINING AND EDUCATION  Disclosure 404-1 Average hours of training per year per employee by gender,   and by classification Ch. 4 par. 4.4 – Ch. 7 par 7.1 Disclosure 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance   and career development reviews Ch. 4 par. 4.4 DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY  Disclosure 405-1 Diversity of governance bodies and employees Cap. 3 par. 3.1 – Ch. 4 par. 4.3 Disclosure 405-2 Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men Ch. 4 par. 4.3 NON DISCRIMINATION  Disclosure 406-1 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken Ch. 3 par. 3.4 – Ch. 4 par. 44.5 HUMAN RIGHTS ASSESSMENT  Disclosure 412-2 Employee training on Human Rights policies or procedures Ch. 4 par. 4.5 LOCAL COMMUNITIES  Disclosure 413-2 Operations with significant actual and potential negative impacts   on local communities Ch. 6 par. 6.4 SUPPLIER SOCIAL ASSESSMENT  Disclosure 414-1 New suppliers that were screened using social criteria Ch. 6 par. 6.3 CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY  Disclosure 416-2 Incidents of non-compliance concerning the health   and safety impacts of products and services --  MARKETING AND LABELING  Disclosure 417-234 Incidents of non-compliance concerning product   and service information and labeling --  SOCIOECONOMIC COMPLIANCE  Disclosure 419-1 Non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social   and economic area --  34 This indicator has been modified compared to the declination provided by the GRI guidelines to be closer to the Group's business.

There have been no cases of incidents of discrimination. There have been no incidents of non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services. There have been no incidents of non-compliance of contractual clauses that have led to final convictions with monetary  compensation to clients.

Responsibility of the directors and of the Board of Statutory Auditors for the NFS    Directors are responsible for the preparation of the NFS in accordance with article 3 and 4 of the  Decree and with the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards defined in 2016  by the GRI - Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards), as laid down in paragraph Reporting  Methods, Principles and Criteria of the NFS, identified by them as the reporting standard.    Directors are responsible, in the terms prescribed by law, for such internal control as management  determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a NFS that is free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error.     Directors are responsible for identifying the content of the NFS, within the matters mentioned in  article 3, paragraph 1, of the Decree, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group and to  the extent necessary to ensure an understanding of the Groups activities, its performance, its results  and related impacts.     Directors are responsible for defining the business and organisational model of the Group and, with  reference to the matters identified and reported in the NFS, for the policies adopted by the Group and  for the identification and management of risks generated and/or faced by the Group.    The Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for overseeing, in the terms prescribed by law,  compliance with the Decree.       176    2 of 4  Auditors Independence and Quality Control    We are independent in accordance with the principles of ethics and independence set out in the Code  of Ethics for Professional Accountants published by the International Ethics Standards Board for  Accountants, which are based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, competence and  professional diligence, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our audit firm adopts International  Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italy 1) and, accordingly, maintains an overall quality control  system which includes processes and procedures for compliance with ethical and professional  principles and with applicable laws and regulations.      Auditors responsibilities    We are responsible for expressing a conclusion, on the basis of the work performed, regarding the  compliance of the NFS with the Decree and with the GRI Standards. We conducted our engagement in  accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) – Assurance  Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (hereafter ISAE 3000  Revised), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited  assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and apply procedures in order to obtain  limited assurance that the NFS is free of material misstatement. The procedures performed in a  limited assurance engagement are less in scope than those performed in a reasonable assurance  engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and, therefore, do not provide us with a sufficient  level of assurance that we have become aware of all significant facts and circumstances that might be  identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.     The procedures performed on the NFS were based on our professional judgement and consisted in  interviews, primarily of company personnel responsible for the preparation of the information  presented in the NFS, analyses of documents, recalculations and other procedures designed to obtain  evidence considered useful.    In particular, we performed the following procedures:    1  Analysis of the relevant matters reported in the NFS relating to the activities and  characteristics of the company, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process  used, in accordance with article 3 of the Decree and the with the reporting standard adopted.  2  Analysis and assessment of the criteria used to identify the consolidation area, in order to  assess their compliance with the Decree.  3  Comparison of the financial information reported in the NFS with the information reported in  the Groups consolidated financial statements.  4  Understanding of the following matters:    -  business and organisational model of the Group, with reference to the management of  the matters specified by article 3 of the Decree;  177    3 of 4  -  policies adopted by the Group with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of the  Decree, actual results and related key performance indicators;  -  main risks, generated and/or faced by the Group, with reference to the matters  specified in article 3 of the Decree.    With reference to those matters, we compared the information obtained with the information  presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described under point 5 a) below.    5  Understanding of the processes underlying the preparation, collection and management of the  significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the NFS.    In particular, we held meetings and interviews with the management of Maire Tecnimont SpA and  with the personnel of Tecnimont SpA, KT - Kinetics Technology SpA, Neosia SpA, Stamicarbon BV and  we performed limited analyses of documentary evidence, to gather information about the processes  and procedures for the collection, consolidation, processing and submission of the non-financial  information to the function responsible for the preparation of the NFS.    Moreover, for material information, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group:      At a group level:    a)  with reference to the qualitative information included in the NFS, and in particular to  the business model, the policies adopted and the main risks, we carried out interviews  and acquired supporting documentation to verify their consistency with available  evidence;  b)  with reference to quantitative information, we performed analytical procedures as well  as limited tests, in order to assess, on a sample basis, the accuracy of consolidation of  the information.      For the companies Tecnimont SpA, Neosia SpA, KT – Kinetics Technology SpA, Stamicarbon  BV and construction sites of Alba-Bra (Italy), Lotos K-214 (Poland) and Orpic (Oman), which  were selected on the basis of their activities, their contribution to the performance indicators  at a consolidated level and their location, we carried out in depth analysis, during which we  met local management and gathered supporting documentation regarding the correct  application of the procedures and calculation methods used for the key performance  indicators.      Conclusions    Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS  of Maire Tecnimont Group as of 31 December 2017 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in  compliance with articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and with the GRI Standards.     178    4 of 4  Other aspects    The comparative data presented in the NFS in relation to previous years has not been subjected to any  procedures.
