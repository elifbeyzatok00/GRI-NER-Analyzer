We strive to be a trusted partner that  helps people secure their devices, identities, online privacy,  and connected homes and families. Currently, we provide  approximately 50 million people better control of their  digital lives.  The digital world has changed the way we live our lives  every day. From work and school to the way we socialize  with family and friends, our digital lives are front and center.  These new technologies, smart devices, and an increasingly  connected world also mean people will encounter a range  of vexing new cybersecurity and privacy challenges. In the  United States, someone falls victim to identity theft every  three seconds and our recent survey of 10 countries found  that 350 million people were victims of cybercrime in the  last year alone.  Our experience with COVID-19 has only accelerated this  transformation. Ransomware, identity and data scams,  and cyberattacks are stronger than ever as cybercriminals  capitalize on the pandemic and these new trends. In  response to the pandemics impacts, we offered a  6-month complimentary subscription to Norton Family to  help parents monitor and manage their childrens online  activities and continued to publish free resources, including  how to protect yourself fromphishing scams and keep  connections secure when working remotely. The health and safety of our global team remains a top  priority. Since March 2020, weve asked all employees who  are able to work from home to do so. Weve implemented  rigorous safety protocols for team members working  on-site including physical distancing measures, providing  hand sanitizer and wipes, and more frequent cleaning of  offices. We also donated $100,000 to the United Nations  Foundations Solidarity Response Fund and an additional  Letter from   Vincent Pilette  $146,000 through employee donations and a 2:1  corporate match to COVID-19 relief efforts. NortonLifeLocks transition to a pure play company  dedicated to consumer Cyber Safety on November  4, 2019, enabled us to reaffirm that corporate  responsibility and positive social impact are core to  our business strategy. Our position as a global leader  depends not only on our technology, but on our values  as an ethical company that operates with integrity and  accountability in everything we do.  Our company values include treating each member  of our community with respect, challenging ourselves  to be curious, and celebrating diversity as a driver of  innovation. We donate products to help protect people,  work to increase digital safety literacy, and focus on  minimizing our environmental footprint. Im proud of  all that weve accomplished to date, including: Education and training: Helping people keep their  home and family Cyber Safe means giving them the  tools and know-how to take charge of their digital  lives. Through our partnership with the National Parent  and Teacher Association (PTA), we created The Smart  Talk, an interactive tool that encourages children and  their caregivers to set tech ground rules together. In  FY20, 160 PTAs across the U.S. held a Safer Internet  Day event focused on The Smart Talk. Product donation: In FY20, our products helped more  than 14,600 nonprofits and public libraries keep their  devices and data secure. These product donations,  with a retail value of nearly $11 million, enable  nonprofits to spend less time responding to malware  attacks and more time helping their communities  thrive.                                       ENVIRONMENT  DATA PRIVACY TABLE OF CONTENTS INTRODUCTION APPROACH  COMMUNITIES OUR PEOPLE  DATA TABLE GRI AND SASB INDEX Environmental stewardship: In FY20, we started  work to refresh our greenhouse gas emissions  strategy and goals, continued to use Forest  Stewardship Council certified paper in our product  packaging, and engaged our employees in a  campaign focused on environmental awareness and  action. Diversity, equity, and inclusion: Along with industry  peers, we are working to increase the representation  of women and underrepresented minorities in  technology. We recently relaunched our employee  resource groups called Communities, and continued  to fund nonprofits focused on diversifying tech,  including Reboot Representation and NPower.  We recently updated our Code of Conduct and  reaffirmed our commitment to the United Nations  Global Compact (UNGC), and its 10 principles related  to protecting human rights and the environment, and  combating corruption.  In 2021, we will continue to build on our positive  impact and the commitments weve made to our  customers, stakeholders, and the world we live in.  Our mission is at the core of our social responsibility,  making the world Cyber Safe.  Vincent Pilette   Chief Executive Officer, NortonLifeLock  1 OUR PEOPLE YOUR INFORMATION INTRODUCTION APPROACH  COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE DATA TABLE GRI AND SASB INDEX  Peoples digital lives have exploded in recent years,  with research showing that in the U.S. there are  approximately eight networked devices per person.   With each of these smart devices—phones,  tablets, laptops, watches, in-home speakers,  thermostats, cameras, and more—comes the need  for comprehensive products and services for Cyber  Safety, which NortonLifeLock delivers better than  anyone else. Great leaders enable growth, and this year, we  have assembled a world-class consumer-oriented  leadership team. This team is already building  velocity with new product innovation, partner  launches, and a growing customer count for the first  time in over five years. As an example, BotSight, a  free tool recently released by NortonLifeLock Labs,  uses machine learning to identify bots in Twitter  feeds and fight the spread of disinformation. Another  product, Privacy Monitor Assistant, helps enable our  customers to protect their own privacy and went  from idea to market in just 30 days.  NortonLifeLocks customers trust us with their most  valuable asset—personal information—and ethical  conduct and integrity are the building blocks of our  business success. This commitment is realized in  part through good governance. The Nominating and  Letter from   Sue Barsamian  Governance Committee of our Board of Directors  has oversight of corporate responsibility issues  and receives quarterly updates on topics such as  diversity, ethics, and community investment. The very nature of our business—helping protect  all areas of consumers online lives—also requires  a global culture of responsibility. This culture is  realized in the positive contributions we make  to the customers, employees, communities,  shareholders, and stakeholders that we serve. These contributions include providing employment  opportunities for female engineering graduates  in India, helping protect the identities and data  of women building peace in their communities,  taking a stand against stalkerware and domestic  violence, investing in STEM education, piloting  virtual volunteerism, and supporting diversity and  inclusion.  We know strong teams are formed through  combinations of people with different skill sets  and perspectives. The relaunch of employee  resource groups this year is an important step  in encouraging employees to connect, learn,  support, mentor, and appreciate one anothers  diverse contributions. Were also proud to fund  and partner with Year Up, NPower, and Nasscom,  organizations working to increase the number of  women, minorities, and veterans in the global tech  talent pipeline and workforce.  As we look to 2021, we are excited to deliver on  our vision to be the trusted brand in Cyber Safety  by protecting consumers and giving them control  of their digital lives.

You will  see this process reflected in the new corporate  responsibility strategy we will announce in FY21  and in our newly released objectives. Corporate responsibility  objectives Data Privacy and Protection –  Objective: Establish NortonLifeLock  as a thought leader in online privacy  protection practices. Education and Training –   Objective: Leverage NortonLifeLocks  leading expertise and technology in  Cyber Safety to protect communities. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion –   Objective: Develop partnerships and  investments to support diversity inside  and out of NortonLifeLock. Talent Development and Engagement  –   Objective: Drive corporate responsibility  initiatives to support a culture of  community involvement. Climate and Energy –   Objective: Establish NortonLifeLock as an  environmentally responsible business. NortonLifeLocks commitment to corporate  responsibility is a critical anchor of our  companys mission and operating philosophy.  We bring together our people, expertise, and  powerful technology to support social and  environmental priorities that foster a safer  and more sustainable future for people, their  personal information, and the digital world. Events of the past six months have tested  companies in a number of ways and changed  mainstream discourse about the role  When NortonLifeLock transitioned to a standalone company last year, we saw an opportunity to evolve and build  upon our commitment to corporate responsibility. At the same time, companies were confronted with issues that  were urgent and sensitive to address, such as racial injustice and the COVID-19 pandemic. While we dont have all the  answers, we remain committed to building an inclusive and diverse workforce, to bettering the planet, to generating  positive societal impact, and to being responsive to our employees, consumers, and communities. With that in mind,  we donated $100,000 to the National Urban League, which works to help African Americans and other underserved  urban residents secure economic self-reliance, parity, power, and civil rights. Through our commitment to corporate  responsibility we are working to create a future we all can feel safe and secure in.  – Kim Allman, Head of Corporate Responsibility and Government Affairs, NortonLifeLock corporations should play in advancing and  addressing social and global challenges. FY20  was also a rebuilding year for our company and  we emerged with a new consumer-focused  mission, new headquarters, new leadership, and  new teammates.

Our  corporate responsibility efforts are organized into three pillars, Our People, Your Information, and The World. 1 We conduct a formal materiality analysis, a process to identify environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues which could impact the business and  our stakeholders, every three to five years. We conducted our most recent materiality analysis in August 2020.

NortonLifeLock is committed  to safeguarding our customer, partner, and employee data as well as  offering products that help consumers protect their own personal data  wherever it lives. Privacy excellence Following our corporate transition this past year, we have evolved our  privacy program to suit the needs of our consumer-focused business.  A key part of protecting our customers digital lives is ensuring their  information is safe when we collect and use it. Our privacy by design  framework guides our approach to privacy when designing our products.  NortonLifeLocks Privacy Principles outlined in our Code of Conduct  detail how employees are required to manage and protect customer data.  Launched in FY19, our Privacy Operating Model (POM) guides privacy  governance. The POM is based on a three lines of defense model and  assures proactive governance and accountability at all levels of the  company. In FY20, the model was updated to reflect NortonLifeLocks  smaller–and consumer-focused–organization, including adding  Operational Privacy Compliance functionality to the model. As a smaller organization, weve also seen substantial value in the ability  to increase and deepen our cross-functional collaboration. In FY20, we  launched our #ask-privacy-legal employee Slack channel and began  building out the Privacy Business Lead program to bring privacy guidance  in at every level of the business.

Data Accountability  We are each accountable for upholding the  Data Protection Principles and respecting  individuals' privacy rights. Empowering consumers  In addition to protecting our customers  and employees data, we want to empower  consumers to protect their privacy online  and in their daily lives. For example, our  newly launched Privacy Monitor Assistant  provides greater control over online privacy  by scanning popular sites for personal  information to allow individuals to opt-out. Norton Secure VPN helps secure private  information like passwords, bank details,  and credit card numbers when using public  Wi-Fi and Norton Privacy Manager helps  consumers manage and control personal  information and credentials used to access  websites and online accounts. Additionally, we continue to offer free  guidance and education on online privacy  to everyone from school-aged children to  university students and professionals.

In response, we offered a 6-month  complimentary subscription to Norton Family,  which was activated by 112,000 people.  Just a few months later, we further improved  Norton Family with the addition of School  Time, a new Parental Control feature that  allows access to distance learning content,  without giving access to the broader web.   We also partner with National Parent Teacher  Association (PTA) and together created The  Smart Talk, a free, fun, interactive resource that  brings caregivers and kids together to create  tech ground rules. In February and March of  2020, 160 PTAs across the U.S. held a Safer  Internet Day event centered around The Smart  Talk, reaching 6,600 people.    Increasing diversity in tech Our work withNPower and Year Up, which  offer cybersecurity training and internships for  underserved minorities, women, and veterans,  centers around creating a more diverse  technology workforce. Since Symantec began  the program in 2014, 981 students, like Avneet  Hall and Anthony Plummer, have graduated  through all of our nonprofit partner training  programs, an 80.8% graduation rate. Of  these graduates, 71%–699 people–were hired  by a company or chose to pursue additional  education within six months of graduating.  In FY20, we also made a three-year commitment  to support theReboot RepresentationTech  Coalition, which is committed to doubling the  number of Black, Latinx, and Native American  women graduating with computing degrees by  2025, and funded all 12 U.S. AAUW (American  Association of University Women) Tech Trek  camps offering a cybersecurity curriculum to  help girls explore their interests in STEM.  The World Donating products to help nonprofits From small public libraries that sponsor  literacy programs to food banks feeding the  hungry, nonprofit organizations worldwide  face rising demands on their services.  Compounding the issue is their lack of  resources to secure employee and volunteer  digital information. NortonLifeLocks  software donation program exists to help  these organizations stay safe online in an  increasingly interconnected world.  We give product directly to nonprofits that  need it and partner with TechSoup, which  offers heavily discounted technology solutions  for changemakers. Through these avenues, in  FY20, NortonLifeLock products helped more  than 14,600 nonprofits and public libraries  keep their devices and data secure. These  product donations, with a retail value of nearly  $11 million, enable nonprofits to spend less  time responding to malware attacks and more  time helping their communities thrive. #NortonLifeLockCares about  communities  We are proud to support the  communities where we live and work.  We do this by leveraging our expertise  and industry-lauded products to reach  vulnerable and underrepresented  people; investing our resources where  we can have the greatest impact;  collaborating with high-impact, trusted  nonprofit organizations; and activating  our employee base.  From helping to keep families Cyber  Safe to donating nearly $11 million  in products to securing the data and  devices of nonprofits and public  libraries, this section includes notable  community initiatives and impact.

NortonLifeLock responded  to a call from The Kroc Institute for Peace  and Justice at the University of San Diego to  help protect these courageous women online.  As part of our FY21 pilot, we provided Cyber  Safety training to 15 women peacebuilders,  empowering them with the knowledge they  need to protect their identities, sensitive data,  and their lives. The pilot showed the collective  level of knowledge among peacemakers  doubled from just one training and the  women also received free Norton 360  Deluxe licenses and Norton Secure VPN  products to help protect their digital identities.  We plan to extend this program to reach more  women in FY21.  Helping girls Surf Smart NortonLifeLock supports the World  Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts  (WAGGGS) with online safety education. The  partnership began in 2012 when Symantec  created the Surf Smart curriculum. Since  2012, Surf Smart has been delivered to  more than 300,000 children across Europe,  Asia, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere,  providing them with the skills and knowledge  needed to safely navigate online spaces.  Our FY20 commitment, a two-year grant to  update the Surf Smart global curriculum,  used data from a previous evaluation to  make enhancements and improvements. The  new curriculum and facilitators guide, which  includes a focus on cyberbullying and more  knowledge about WhatsApp and Facebook,  will be available online for multiple platforms  (desktops, laptops, smart phones, etc.) in   late 2020. Making an impact in India In FY20, we made numerous grants in India to the  organizations Symantec had supported for many  years. Based on input from our partnersSoStakes  andCAF India, as well as our India-based  employees we chose to support Save the  Childrens Technology Enabled Learning program,  Ashoka Trust and Research in Ecology and The  Environment, the Agastya iMobile Program, and  SayTrees efforts to plant trees. Through our partnership with theNasscom  Foundation, we launched theCyber Security  SkillsDevelopment Initiative for Women, which  helps create greater employability opportunities  for underprivileged female engineering graduates.  The initiative, conducted in Bangalore, Chennai,  and Pune in January and February of 2020,  trained 121 women, and 109 women secured  the Certified Ethical Hacker certification.

But our impact goes much further than  that. Data is the new currency–its what  nation-state actors set out to destroy,  what digital gangs steal, and what  cybercriminals trade illegally. These are  incredibly serious issues and our products  have the capability to truly protect people  from harm.  – Gagan Singh, Chief Product Officer,  NortonLifeLock  Taking a stand against  domestic violence and give victims and potential victims tools  to help protect themselves and be free of  harassment, violence, and attacks.  This year, NortonLifeLock researchers  published papers on the prevalence of  stalkerware apps on popular app stores–  driving Google to remove over 800 apps  from the Android Play Store–and developed  a proprietary algorithm in partnership with  Cornell Tech and New York University that  ranks the probability that any given app is used  as creepware/stalkerware. This CreepRank  algorithm has since been incorporated into  Norton Mobile Security for Android, allowing  the software to automatically detect these  types of surveillance apps, stop them from  being installed on a device, and remove them if  theyre already installed.  We are issuing roughly 2,000 stalkerware  warnings a month and blocking hundreds  of stalkerware perpetrators from further  nefarious actions. Our efforts detected more  than 223,000 installations of such malicious  applications in FY20. Additionally, NortonLifeLock is a founding  member of the Coalition Against Stalkerware,  pooling its demonstrated expertise in  stalkerware with domestic violence  organizations and other cybersecurity  companies to protect people from this  invasive, dangerous technology. Since its  inception, NortonLifeLock and its Coalition  partners createda standard definition and  detection criteria for stalkerware, which  did not previously exist. In addition, the  Coalition produced helpful online resources  for stalkerware victims that have been made  available in six different languages. With these  resources, users can find information about  what stalkerware is, what it can do, how to  detect it, and how to protect themselves.  by Darren Shou, Chief Technology Officer,     NortonLifeLock 15 OUR PEOPLE YOUR INFORMATION INTRODUCTION APPROACH  COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE DATA TABLE GRI AND SASB INDEX  collective action to find a better way forward.  Fostering diversity and inclusion, both in our  company and in our communities, is a priority  at NortonLifeLock and an important focus of  the programs we run through our People and  Culture and Corporate Responsibility teams. We were not able to plan a global week of  employee volunteer service in FY20 due  to the companys transition as well as the  pandemic. In August of 2020, we re-launched  our Employee Volunteer Program. Volunteer  Leaders at each large site partner with our  Corporate Responsibility team and are  currently engaging employees through virtual  volunteer opportunities to connect with each  other and their communitiesin a new way. Read about three of our Volunteer Leaders,  Trisha Hailston, Kelly Ryan, and Amanda Davis,  and the work they can safely do in their own  communities, as well as the virtual events  theyve organized for their offices, on our  Corporate Responsibility Blog. Our community programs are most successful  when our team members share their expertise  and knowledge. To encourage employees  to support the causes they care about, our  benefit program includes paid volunteer time  off, Dollars for Doers grants, and corporate  matching.  In FY20, we combined the caps for Dollars  for Doers grants and corporate matching into  one to increase the flexibility of this benefit.  NortonLifeLock continues to match up to  $2,000 per employee per year, and employees  can now choose to support their communities  by volunteering their time or giving financially. Our philanthropic giving focuses on  organizations furthering digital safety  education, diversity in technology,  environmental responsibility, and STEM  (science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics) education. Our giving strategy is  also designed to allow us to respond in a timely  and effective way to issues that affect our  communities. As such, we provide one-time  grants and hold several special 2:1 matching  campaigns to respond to current events.  Examples include:  Australian wildfires: In January 2020,  we donated $25,000 to the American Red  Cross, and an additional $17,000 in matching  grants to the Australian Red Cross, Sydney  Metropolitan Wildlife Services, and World  Wildlife Fund through a special 2:1 matching  campaign to help those affected by the  Australian wildfires.  COVID-19 relief efforts: This spring, we  donated $100,000 to the UN Foundations  COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. We  also donated $100,000 through a 2:1  corporate match campaign, where employees  contributed $46,000 for a total of $146,000, to  additional COVID-19 relief efforts. Racial equity: When protests erupted across  the world to put a stop to racial injustice, our  team donated $100,000 to the National Urban  League. The League, which works to help  African Americans and other underserved  urban residents secure economic self-reliance,  parity, power, and civil rights, has also helped  to inform our diversity strategy. So far, our  Corporate Responsibility team has attended  a National Urban League diversity seminar  and participated in an online advocacy day.  We also set up another 2:1 match campaign  and to date have sent an additional $44,500 to  organizations fighting for racial justice. Donations alone will not address the systemic  racial inequality impacting people of color.

Volunteering and philanthropy 16 OUR PEOPLE YOUR INFORMATION INTRODUCTION APPROACH  COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE DATA TABLE GRI AND SASB INDEX  NortonLifeLock protects human rights in our own  operations and throughout our supply chain.  Our Human Rights Policy statement builds on  our commitment to uphold the ten principles  of theUnited Nations Global Compact, which  we recommitted to in FY20, and is aligned with  theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. This  commitment is also enshrined in both our Code  of Conduct and Global Supplier Code of Conduct.  Five suppliers manufacture and distribute our  products and we regularly engage with them  to share best practices. In FY20, our two main  suppliers who manufacture and distribute over  95% of our physical products globally were  considered low risk for human trafficking by  the Dun and Bradstreet Human Trafficking Risk  Index. Moving forward, our aim is to assess the  other Tier 1 suppliers who supply the remaining  percentage of our physical products. We expect all directors, officers, employees,  interns, and contractors of NortonLifeLock,  as well as third parties acting on behalf of the  company, to be well aware of the implications of  violating any aspect of our Codes.  Visit our website for a full list of our  Corporate Responsibility Policies  and Statements. and state legislators, privacy advocates, state  attorney generals, and concerned consumers. Policy partnerships In FY20, we continued our involvement in  the Better Identity Coalition, which works  alongside policymakers to improve digital  security, privacy, and identity protection  through education and collaboration. As a  founding member, we helped the coalition  publish Better Identity in America: A Blueprint  for Policymakers, and we are currently drafting  best practices on the next generation of  identity theft protection. We recently became a member of the National  Institute of Standards and Technologys (NIST)  National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, a  collaborative hub where industry organizations,  government agencies, and academic  institutions work together to address the U.S.s  most pressing cybersecurity issues. Policy in the time of COVID-19 This year was also complicated by the  COVID-19 pandemic. Weve seen COVID-19  relief scams, healthcare fraud, an increase  in identity theft as people spend more  time online, and, at the time of publication,  Maryland officials were investigating a massive  coronavirus unemployment insurance fraud  scheme totaling over $500 million that used  stolen identity data to submit false claims. NortonLifeLocks Government Affairs team  manages the companys participation in public  policies that affect our consumers and business.  Data protection, online privacy, and identity theft  are critical issues to our consumers, and we  advocate for legislation that protects consumers  and curbs cybercrime. The Government Affairs  team prioritized transparency and began shifting  our public policy work to meet the needs of our  new consumer facing company in FY20.  Policy engagement and awareness The Government Affairs team raises awareness  and provides key data and insight to elected  officials at all levels of government, their staff,  media, and through industry coalitions. As  an example, California enacted one of the  strongest privacy-protection laws in the nation,  the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA),  which went into effect on January 1, 2020. Under  the CCPA, consumers are afforded new privacy  rights regarding their personal information that  companies and websites collect–such as the  right to opt-out.  While our product teams worked on the release  of Norton Privacy Builder–a new browser  extension that makes it easy for consumers to  tell websites not to sell their information–our  Government Affairs team was busy organizing  two privacy conferences. We hosted PrivacyCon  in both Washington, DC, and Sacramento, CA,  where we discussed the CCPA with federal  States in the U.S. are acting quickly to enact  legal protections for consumers in the face of  the increasing COVID-19 scams. At the federal  level, the Improving Digital Identity Act of 2020,  which was championed by the Better Identity  Coalition, was introduced into the U.S. Congress  in September 2020. As we look to FY21, our  Government Affairs team will continue to work  with legislators to raise awareness of how they  can best protect consumers against identity  theft, fraud, credit scams, and cyberthreats. Political disclosure and accountability Since 2001, NortonLifeLock has maintained our  Global Political Contributions Policy, a formal  policy regarding political activities, political  disclosure, and accountability. The Boards  Nominating and Governance Committee  monitors compliance with this policy. We do not  maintain a political action committee (PAC) and  in 2020, did not make any corporate political  contributions. All past political contributions  and our Global Policy are available on Investor. NortonLifeLock.com.

Public policy and advocacy 17 OUR PEOPLE YOUR INFORMATION INTRODUCTION APPROACH  COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE DATA TABLE GRI AND SASB INDEX  Environmental  stewardship #NortonLifeLockCares   about the environment   From fires in Australia and California to  typhoons across Asia to flooding and  droughts across Europe, it is clear that  protecting our environment is key to ensuring  a safe and sustainable future. While legal  compliance has always been our starting  point, a sharp focus on environmental  performance that goes beyond this is  part of our culture of responsibility. It also  contributes to the urgent action needed to  address global climate change and other  environmental challenges.  While we spent the majority of FY20  transitioning to a smaller, consumer- focused company, environmental  sustainability remained a priority focus  area. NortonLifeLocks Environmental  Management Policy is publicly available  and details our approach to managing  environmental impacts across our production  operations, business facilities, and supply  chain, as well impacts associated with  our products and services. Our two main  suppliers, who manufacture and distribute  over 95% of physical product globally,  maintain environmental management  systems that are ISO14001 certified.  3 Data during a transitional year: As a newly developed  company, and one that is undergoing a broad restructuring  effort that includes the sale of several commercial  buildings (still to be completed), it is difficult at this time to  accurately collect and report on FY20 environmental data.  In this report, we disclose available data. Next year (FY21),  we will resume our full environmental reporting with FY21  as our first full baseline year. 4 Moving forward many of our offices will transition from  owned to leased properties. As we firm up our environmental strategy  in FY21, we have engaged internal and  external experts to help us develop programs  and policies that reduce greenhouse gas  emissions, make our product packaging more  sustainable, and engage our employees in  protecting the environment.  Reducing greenhouse gas emissions3 We work to mitigate Scope 1 (direct  emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions,  including purchased electricity), and Scope 3  (all other indirect emissions, including business  travel and procurement) greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions. As a new consumer company  offering mostly digital products, we have  identified GHG reductions from data center  and office energy use (Scope 2 emissions) and  employee travel (Scope 3 emissions), to be  our most immediate priorities. Looking ahead,  we will investigate opportunities to reduce  emissions in the supply chain of the goods and  services we purchase and which we recognize  as a significant driver of our Scope 3 footprint.  In this reports performance tables, we  include an estimate of our FY20 Scope 1 and  2 emissions for the sites that have currently  been confirmed as part of the NortonLifeLock  portfolio.4 During FY20, we experienced a 45%  increase in Scope 1 emissions due to two  refrigerant recharges needed in our Culver City,  CA office. Large refrigerant recharges are not a  common occurrence (typically every 15 years  or more), but the global warming potential of  certain types of refrigerants is significant.  We used 116,821 gigajoules of electricity in  FY20, 24% of which was renewable energy  included in the electricity delivered to our sites  by our utility suppliers.  A refreshed strategy In FY20, we completed a GHG inventory  to guide our development of a refreshed  climate strategy and goals. As we consider  our future strategy, it will look different from  the past. With our physical offices largely  closed and employee travel on hold due to  COVID-19, as well as our smaller company  size, we anticipate lower Scope 1 and 2  emissions across the company in FY21. We  will also consider opportunities to limit our  environmental impacts as we anticipate and  plan for a post COVID-19 world.  In FY20, we signed on to the Business in  the Community Ireland (BITC)s Low Carbon  Pledge, demonstrating our commitment  to reduce our GHG emissions and thereby  contribute to limiting global temperature  rises. Through the Low Carbon Pledge, we  have committed to reducing Scope 1 and 2  greenhouse gas emissions intensity of our  Irish operations by 50% by 2030. We have also  engaged renewable energy experts to help us  find opportunities to increase our use of clean  energy in FY21.  18 OUR PEOPLE YOUR INFORMATION INTRODUCTION APPROACH  COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE DATA TABLE GRI AND SASB INDEX  The Global Supply  Chain team constantly  strives to implement  sustainable processes.  Our objectives are to  minimize negative  environmental impacts, conserve energy,  and protect natural resources with our  global partners. We partner with our  product teams to design products that meet  our customers expectations and that are  better for society and the environment. – Joe Goode, Director Supply Chain,  NortonLifeLock Our employees were  excited to learn little  ways they could go  green in their everyday  lives. From using  reusable water bottles  to riding a bicycle to work, the Choosing  Green campaign showed us that every  individual can make a difference, and that  together we can make a significant and  lasting impact. – Amanda Davis, Senior Corporate  Responsibility and Environmental Manager,  NortonLifeLock Product packaging  At present, approximately 90% of  NortonLifeLocks products are delivered  digitally. The majority of our software products  come pre-installed on hardware devices or  are downloaded electronically by customers,  requiring no physical product or packaging  materials. Even though only 10% of our  products are material goods, in FY20 we  shipped nearly eight million physical units,  making packaging sustainability an important  area of focus for our company.  Over the past decade, we have evolved our  product packaging multiple times, greatly  reducing the amount of waste associated  with our products and the cost of shipping.  Today, several of our products are delivered  on cards smaller than the size of a credit  card. Additionally, 32% of all NortonLifeLock  products are currently made with and  packaged in Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)  certified paper. FSC certification ensures that  products come from responsibly managed  forests that provide environmental, social, and  economic benefits to their communities.  Supply chain sustainability  NortonLifeLock promotes high ethical  standards for human rights, environmental  protections, and responsible business  practices in our own operations and  throughout our supply chain. We focus on  transparency and continuous engagement  with stakeholders to share and refine  our approach, policies, and supply chain  management practices. While our supply  chain size and risk are smaller as a result of  our corporate transition, our commitment  to the highest ethical standards remains  the same.  For example, in FY20 100% of our Tier 1  physical product suppliers agreed to our  corporate responsibility requirements.  Additionally, our two main suppliers, who  manufacture and distribute over 95%  of physical product globally, completed  the Responsible Business Alliance Self- Assessment Questionnaire and shared their  results, completed forced labor training,  and are considered low risk on the Dun  and Bradstreet Human Trafficking Index.  Moving forward, our aim is to assess our  Tier 1 suppliers who supply the remaining  percentage of our physical products. Read more about our commitment  to human rights in The World and in  our Global Reporting Initiative index. Employee involvement We believe every individual can make a difference  and that together our actions can have a big  impact. Through NortonLifeLocks site-level  volunteer committees, employees encourage  each other to take part in our environmental  sustainability efforts. In FY20, we continued  Choosing Green in 2019, an employee campaign  focused on environmental awareness, education,  challenges, and ideas for individual action.  Choosing Green impacts included:    Introducing Less Meat Mondays in some of  our largest cafes. Consuming less meat is a  simple way to make an impactas industrial  scale beef production requires 20 times more  land and emits 20 times more greenhouse gas  emissions than common plant-based protein.

Our People and  Culture team worked with our employees to  develop a new set of company values that  represent the culture of our NortonLifeLock  team. In addition to a company-wide  survey, employees joined focus groups  in unprecedented numbers to drive the  conversation around behaviors, attitudes, and  common goals for the company. We are proud to highlight our new  NortonLifeLock Values:  Advocate: Think Consumer First  Be Empowered: Own It  Communicate: Be Open and Authentic  Execute: Smart and Scrappy  Win Together: Innovate and Grow Our mission and values come together in the  NortonLifeLock Code, a commitment we all  make as members of NortonLifeLock and as  trusted partners to consumers. Our People  #NortonLifeLockCares about  our team  NortonLifeLock is committed to building a  strong, diverse, and passionate team—a team  that stands together to protect our customers  like no one else can. FY20 was a year of  significant transformation and transition due to  the asset sale and integration of our Enterprise  business to Broadcom. Our People and Culture  team played a key role throughout, supporting  the successful transfer of thousands of  enterprise employees to Broadcom while  also standing up NortonLifeLock as a  consumer company. In the latter part of  FY20, we also executed a separate divestiture  of our ID Analytics business to LexisNexis,  while managing a significant population of  employees providing transition services. A key objective of People and Culture in FY20  was to establish the NortonLifeLock Executive  Leadership Team, which is now 30% female.  We assembled and promoted several existing  leaders while attracting and onboarding new  consumer-oriented leaders. While much of our  talent development and management work  this fiscal year focused on our new company  organizational design, the creation of new  teams and roles, and building our new leadership  team, we continued to invest in our talent and  provide access to various career development  resources and trainings. These employee  offerings included Leadership Success training  modules including, but not limited to, Leader  as Coach, Diversity and Inclusive Leadership,  Building Great Teams, Making Great Decisions  and Hiring for Results. We also continued to  encourage employees to attend conferences and  technical trainings, both online and via our tuition  reimbursement initiative. Our Board of Directors has long recognized that  our employees are one of our most important  assets and is engaged with management to  ensure that we are an employer of choice for the  most talented employees in our industry. While  the full Board and leadership discuss human  capital management with regards to its role in  our overall long-term strategy, our Compensation  Committee has responsibility for overseeing  human capital management at NortonLifeLock.  For more details on the Boards  oversight of human capital  management, visit our 2020 Annual  Report.

FY20 was a year of both  incredible transition  and incredible growth  for our team. We  worked through a  significant asset sale, became a pure- play consumer Cyber Safety company,  established a new leadership team, and  then went right to work to define the new  mission-driven NortonLifeLock. Our values  are the foundation for everything we do,  and we engaged our employees in every  step of our new values process. I look  forward to championing these values and to  continuing to create the NortonLifeLock we  all know we can be. – Kara Jordan, Chief People and Culture  Officer, NortonLifeLock 20 OUR PEOPLE YOUR INFORMATION INTRODUCTION APPROACH  COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE DATA TABLE GRI AND SASB INDEX  NortonLifeLock is committed to building an  inclusive, diverse workforce. We celebrate  diversity as a driver of innovation and know  that diverse points of view help us make  products and services that meet the needs  of the broad spectrum of people we serve.  We invest in diversity not just because its the  right thing to do, but because it translates to  a higher performing industry, company, and  bottom line. This starts with ensuring a culture where  people of every race, ethnicity, age, sexual  orientation, disability, background, and  experience are respected and encouraged to  thrive. We believe that a work environment  where people can be their authentic selves can  help amazing things come to life. We care about transparency and share our  performance (see Performance Tables),  challenges, and action plans for continual  improvement with our employees and  stakeholders. As Symantec, in FY20, the  global organization included 25% women  and in the U.S. 10% of employees identified  as underrepresented minorities. As  NortonLifeLock in FY20, global representation  increased to 31% female, and in the U.S.  underrepresented minorities represented  10.8% of our workforce. As a standalone  consumer business, we are in the process of  establishing our baseline representation and  look forward to sharing our first full year of  diversity, equity, and inclusion data in our FY21  report.  We are committed to equal pay for equal work.  We completed our annual pay equity review  in FY20 and are proud to report that our pay  ratios (average female salary / average male  salary) are equitable across all three levels:  executives (1.12), management (1.12), and  non-management (1.12). We are preparing for  our FY21 pay equity review and are adopting a  different approach that will enable us to bring  this process in-house with an independent firm  partner to verify our process and findings. This  will allow us to continually monitor pay equity  as part of our ongoing diversity and inclusion  efforts.  We also see supporting anti-discrimination  efforts as key to being a responsible citizen.  As an example, we are proud to be part of  The Business Coalition for the Equality Act, a  group of leading U.S. employers that support  the Equality Act, which would guarantee  explicit, permanent protections for lesbian, gay,  bisexual, and transgender people under our  existing civil rights laws. Our diversity, equity, and inclusion  strategy We are currently finalizing a five-year strategy  for NortonLifeLock to attract, retain, and  develop the best diverse cybersecurity talent  in the world. This strategy will be supported  by focused long-term goals and shorter-term  objectives and is structured across four key  pillars: measurement and accountability,  fostering an inclusive environment, diversifying  our workforce, and employee development and  retention. For example, we offered diversity and inclusion  training to employees in Tempe, AZ, Dublin,  Ireland, and Chennai, India, as well as a remote  training for our Consumer Services and Inside  Sales team in FY20. Increasing diversity  awareness and removing unconscious bias  is a key part of our fostering an inclusive  environment pillar and we will review  workplace diversity training programs in FY21  and FY22. We will be rolling out our Diversity,  Equity, and Inclusion Dashboards. These  dashboards, distributed quarterly to senior  leaders, will include team representation data  and goals to support focused efforts that grow  our representation of underrepresented talent.  Our diversity, equity, and  inclusion mission: To proactively grow our  representation of underrepresented  groups at all levels (diversity), where  everyone has an opportunity for  development and advancement  (equity), and to belong to an inclusive  culture where they feel valued and  are able to bring their whole selves to  work every day (inclusion). Our diversity, equity, and  inclusion vision: We believe in and embrace an  inclusive culture where all identities  are celebrated and encouraged to  thrive. To us, diversity is more than  just race, gender, and ethnicity. It  is also about diversity of thought,  experiences, identities, and  backgrounds. Diversity, equity, and inclusion 21 OUR PEOPLE YOUR INFORMATION INTRODUCTION APPROACH  COMMUNITIES ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE DATA TABLE GRI AND SASB INDEX  Driving diversity In FY20, women made up 31% of our global  team and 27% of our leadership. We are  focused on increasing gender diversity at  NortonLifeLock and work to diversify our  applicant pool through partnerships we have  in place, those we will continue to establish  moving forward, and through investments in  our internship program.  Diversifying our workforce is a pillar of  our FY21 strategy and we have increased  our focus on driving diversity in FY21.  We are approved as a Work180 partner  company, the women-focused recruitment  site that only lists career opportunities from  employers that support diversity, inclusion,  and flexibility.  We are now posting all job descriptions on  diverse recruiting sites, including the National  Society of Black Engineers and Women Who  Code. Our People and Culture team is also  partnering with our Corporate Responsibility  team to hire diverse talent from the nonprofit  cyber training programs NortonLifeLock   helps fund.  We are participating in McKinsey &  Companys new Black Leadership Academy  for the first time in November 2020.  The Academy is designed to accelerate  the progression of Black leaders in their  organizations. A cohort of NortonLifeLock  NortonLifeLock partnered with Pivotal, a  nonprofit that works to help young people  in foster care, from FY15 through FY20. We  supported Pivotals STEM training program for  foster youth and have hosted several Pivotal  interns during our partnership. Most recently, in  2020, we recruited Diana Pham for an intern role.  A confident and strong candidate, Diana was well  prepared, her communication skills were strong,  she was passionate about learning new things,  and open to exploring various opportunities  within our organization. Diana supported both  our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Talent  Acquisition teams and within three months of  completing her internship, we offered Diana a  full-time role. As a foster child and first- generation college graduate,  the opportunity to be part  of NortonLifeLock is life  changing. This would not  have been possible without  Pivotal, who supported my education and  developed me as an independent woman. As  I continue to walk confidently into the future, I  can pave the way to success for generations to  come and be an example of how our system can  lift youths from underprivileged to contributing  members of society. – Diana Pham, NortonLifeLock employee employees will attend either a three-month  Black Executive Leadership Program, designed  for senior leaders looking to further develop  their leadership capabilities and improve critical  skills to grow personally and professionally, or a  six-month Management Accelerator, designed  to support ongoing career progression for high  performing early to mid career managers. At  the end of the program, all participants will  have direct engagement with the Executive  Leadership Team to discuss their experience  and provide feedback. Driving inclusion Increasing our representation and diversity is  one half of the equation. Establishing a culture  of inclusion is the other half. This year, in FY21,  we relaunched seven employee resource  groups, called Communities, as a platform  for communities of employees to come  together as allies, to learn, support, mentor, and  celebrate with one another. These Communities include N-ABLED  (NortonLifeLock Disability Allyship), WONDER  (Women Outreach and Development  Resources), N-PRIDE (NortonLifeLocks  LGBTQIA+ and Allies Alliance), NOBLE  (NortonLifeLocks Black Life Empowerment),  SNAP (Supporting New and Aspiring  Professionals), CARES (Caregivers Alliance for  Resources, Education and Support), and HOLA  (Hispanic/Latino Outreach Leadership and  Advancement).  These groups play a vital role in helping create  an inclusive work culture where everyone feels  seen, heard, respected, and valued.  We also launched a weekly series called  NortonLifeLock Learning Journeys on our  employee intranet NSight. Our Learning  Journey initiative came out of an inspiring  conversation during a company-wide monthly  meeting wherein we spoke about our desire  to be a company of action when it comes to  inclusion and diversity.  The meeting left an incredible mark on  our team after team members from  underrepresented groups spoke candidly  about their experiences. Each week, we  share information that highlights important  moments or people in the diversity and  inclusion conversation. The goal is to broaden  our perspectives and better understand the  experiences of others. A recent example of  a Learning Journey came from one of our  Community Champions and helped highlight  the importance of National Hispanic Heritage  month, which recognized the histories,  cultures, achievements, and contributions of  the Hispanic American community.

NortonLifeLock uses a model similar to the Precautionary Principle for risk management with regard to  business continuity. Our Crisis Management and Continuity Management teams determine the impact likelihood of each threat  occurring and conducts exercises to ensure full understanding of possible impact. This allows us to determine and report any  unacceptable single points of failure.
