The Manager lived up to such requirements throughout the year under  review. During the year, the INEDs/NED held a closed-session among themselves when issues were discussed to the exclusion of  the EDs and management. Our INEDs/NED bring constructive analysis and critical judgement on management proposals, scrutinise business  performance against business goals, and monitor risks and compliance. Assessment of independence of INEDs is carried  out before each appointment, annually, and at any other time where the circumstances warrant re-consideration. Our  assessment of independence of an INED is based on the independence criteria set out in the Link Corporate Governance  Policy which is modelled on (and, in some aspects, exceeds) the independence guidelines of the Listing Rules. We  reference from time to time major proxy advisors voting recommendations and guidelines in approaching the issue of  INEDs independence. Directors have disclosed to the Manager the number and nature of office held in Hong Kong and overseas listed companies  and organisations, and their other significant commitments. INEDs/NED have also indicated the amount of time he/she was involved in his/her outside-Link commitments and confirmed  with the Board Chairman that he/she has given sufficient time to the affairs of Link. No current Director holds directorships in  more than three public/listed companies (including Link). The 2 EDs have not held any directorship in other listed company but have participated in professional bodies, academic  and public organisations.  7 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Governance Independence Weighting (13 members as of 6 June 2018 against 13 members as of 7 June 2017) Board INED NED 2018 2017 77% 8% 77% 8% 15% 15% ED Senior Management (Note) Audit and Risk Management Committee Nomination Committee 2018 2017 100% 100% 2018 2017 75% 80% 20% 25% Remuneration Committee Finance and Investment Committee 2018 2017 100% 100% 2018 2017 64% 12% 57% 14% 29% 12% 12% Note: CFO is a member of the Finance and Investment Committee but not a member of the Board. The Manager has received from each INED his/her annual confirmation of independence in accordance with the Link  Corporate Governance Policy. Based on such confirmations received, the Nomination Committee assessed and the Board  considered that all the INEDs have maintained their independence throughout the year under review and up to the date of  this report. Board Diversity It is our philosophy that a balanced and diversified Board brings a broad range of views to bear upon discussions and  critical decision-making, and balances against group thinking. Our Board Diversity Policy is multi-faceted stressing  business experience, skill-sets, knowledge and professional expertise in addition to gender, ethnicity and age.

Our Directors also participated actively in the affairs of Link outside the board room. They participated in community events  organised under the Link Together Initiatives programme and seminars sponsored or participated by Link in the year under  review. Supports to Directors Induction to New Directors A comprehensive and tailored orientation programme is arranged for each newly-appointed Director. The induction kit  contains key materials on the regulatory framework of Link including the Trust Deed, the Compliance Manual and other  regulatory updates, which are regularly reviewed by the company secretary to ensure they are updated. In addition, an orientation was arranged for Mr Christopher John BROOKE in which the CEO and the senior management  members attended to brief Mr BROOKE on Links latest developments and the operations of the core function units. Continuous Professional Development of Directors Our Directors undertook continuous professional and training programmes in the year to keep themselves abreast of  the latest developments in the fields relevant to their respective expertise and professions. They received briefings from  the company secretary on the latest legal and regulatory developments which have a bearing on their duties. They also  attended externally-run seminars by professional bodies and industry associations which the company secretary regularly  recommended. The Board Chairman spoke at industry conferences and seminars of professional associations. The EDs developed and refreshed their skills and knowledge of Links business through making presentations to investors  and analysts, speaking at industry conferences and meeting with Government officials as well as attending externally-run  seminars by professional bodies. The CEO attended the Advisory Services Program held by Urban Land Institute in  Singapore from 28 January to 2 February 2018; and spoke at the events held by MIPIM Asia from 28 to 29 November 2017  and Property Council Academy from 17 to 19 January 2018.

The Nomination Committee has  an on-going programme on Board succession. This serves to maintain the culture of the Board and ensure that transition is  smooth. An external executive search firm has been retained to advise the Nomination Committee on expertise gaps that  could arise when Directors go on scheduled retirement and identify appropriate candidates for it to consider. The need to  replenish and upgrade Board competence timely has become increasingly relevant when Link is expanding its business.  Board appointments are recommended by the Nomination Committee and made by the Board on merits and in line with the  Board Diversity Policy of Link. In the year under review, the Nomination Committee discussed and reported to the Board on succession plans, reviewed  potential INED candidates, and set and prioritised with the assistance of the independent external consultant the selection  criteria for new Board member. The Board has the overall responsibility of overseeing the succession plan for the EDs and senior management. During the  year, the Board discussed and reviewed both the contingency and longer term plans for CEO succession, considered the  leadership development plan for senior management, and approved the creation of the position of COO and CSO (chief  strategy officer) and appointment of the new CFO. On-going Board Performance Evaluation The Board is committed to regular, independent evaluation of its own effectiveness and that of its Committees. Board  performance is evaluated on an on-going basis by the Nomination Committee which reports its findings to the Board. Formal Board Performance Evaluation & follow-up The Board has set the practice of carrying out a formal evaluation of its performance through the facilitation of  independent  external consultant every three years, which it did in 2016/2017 with Russell Reynolds Associates (RRA). Follow-on actions  identified in the 2016/2017 formal Board performance evaluation were also addressed in the year under review. Actions that  have not already been closed out from the 2016/2017 formal Board performance evaluation form an ongoing improvement  to the Board process and effectiveness being led by the Chairman. Board Performance Review in between Formal Evaluation In between formal Board performance evaluations, Board performance will be reviewed internally by the Nomination  Committee chairman (who is also the Board Chairman). In year 2017/2018, the Board performance was reviewed by the Nomination Committee chairman. For individual  performance evaluation, NED/INEDs directly responded to structured questionnaire sent by the Nomination Committee  chairman and held an one-on-one discussion with the Nomination Committee chairman on how he/she perceived the  performance of the Board as a whole and the performance of his/her fellow Director in the year under review, his/her  individual contribution, individual training and development needs, and the time commitment that is required to continue to  deliver the role effectively. Members of the senior management also directly responded to another set of questionnaire sent  by the Nomination Committee chairman on Board performance during the year. EDs individual performance evaluation is undertaken as part of the performance management process for all employees,  when the results are considered by the Remuneration Committee and ultimately by the Board when determining variable pay  awards each year, as set out in the Remuneration Committees Report. The Chairman attended the Remuneration Committee  to speak on the performance of the CEO. Based on the findings of the 2017/2018 Board performance evaluation, the Nomination Committee and the Board  considered that the Board performed effectively in the year under review.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 16 Governance Corporate Governance Report Our Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Philosophy Our approach to reward is meritocratic and market competitive, underpinned by an ethical and value-based performance  culture that aligns the interest of our employees with those of our Unitholders. Our remuneration strategy supports this  objective through balancing business goals against long-term sustainable performance. We judge performance not only by what has been achieved, but also by how it is and will continue to be achieved on   a sustainable basis. Individual remuneration is determined through the assessment of performance delivered against  short-term and long-term business targets as well as adherence to Links vision, mission and values.

Fees had been increased for FY2016/2017 after an internal  review conducted in 2016.  There has been no increase in the fees for FY2017/2018. In 2018, the Remuneration Committee has performed a review of fee levels with independent advice from Mercer (Hong  Kong) Limited (Mercer). The outcome of the review was that NED/INEDs fees had fallen below appropriate peer  benchmarks since the last review. Rather than making the full adjustment in the current year, the Remuneration Committee  recommended, and the Board agreed, to spread the increase with effect from 1 April 2018 over the next three financial  years. The annual NED/INEDs fees for FY2017/2018, FY2018/2019, FY2019/2020 and FY2020/2021 are as follows: FY2017/2018 FY2018/2019 FY2019/2020 FY2020/2021         Chairman  HK$ Member  HK$ Chairman  HK$ Member  HK$ Chairman  HK$ Member  HK$ Chairman  HK$ Member  HK$                   Board 1,720,000 500,000 1,836,500 540,000 1,960,600 582,900 2,094,000 630,000 Audit and Risk Management  Committee 200,000 150,000 204,400 150,000 209,400 150,000 215,000 150,000 Remuneration Committee 100,000 60,000 105,000 61,500 110,600 62,900 116,500 64,400 Nomination Committee 100,000 55,000 101,200 55,000 102,600 55,000 103,500 55,000 Finance and Investment  Committee 155,000 77,500 157,000 79,400 159,100 81,500 161,200 83,500                   Internal Control and Risk Management Board Responsibility The Board (as assisted by the Audit and Risk Management Committee) is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the  effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management systems and determining the nature and extent of the significant  risks Link may take in achieving its strategic objectives. It acknowledges that such controls and systems can only manage  but not eliminate risks and provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against loss or material misstatement. With the assistance of the Audit and Risk Management Committee, the Board had reviewed and was satisfied with the  effectiveness and adequacy of the internal controls and risk management systems for the year under review, having had  regard to the key processes of Link. This was achieved primarily through:  approving the scope of the annual internal audit plan,  reviewing the findings, recommendations, and follow-on actions of internal audit work,  reviewing statutory and operational compliance reports,  approving work plan of the risk management function,  reviewing quarterly risk management activity reports,  reviewing the corporate risks register and monitoring movements of key risks,  reviewing controls and procedures of financial reporting and the annual and interim financial statements, and  reviewing the nature, scope of work and reports of the external auditor. Structure of Controls and Risk Management Led by the Board, management monitors the risks associated with Links business and activities on an on-going basis. Procedures and control measures have been implemented including the setting up of a corporate risks register where  elements of business risks, operations risks, financial risks, compliance and reputational risks are recorded and calibrated  according to severity of impact and probability of occurrence. The risks recorded are monitored by the risk management  team and head of business unit as risk owner.  21 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Governance The key risks are reported monthly to the EDs and senior management for monitoring and action, and quarterly to the Audit  and Risk Management Committee for review and monitoring. The Board also reviews the principal risks annually. Details of the internal control processes and risk management framework are discussed on pages 46 to 49 of the Strategic  Report of Annual Report 2017/2018. Monitoring and controls have also been set up on specific compliance areas such as anti-competition behaviour, data  privacy, Common Reporting Standard and FATCA in addition to other on-going regulatory compliance and monitoring. Audit and Risk Management Committees Review The Audit and Risk Management Committee – assisted by the internal control and risk management functions – reports  to the Board on mitigating measures and key risk indicators in the risk management process. Regular reports from the  internal control and risk management functions are submitted to senior management and the Audit and Risk Management  Committee. The Head of Internal Audit and Risk Management functions attends all Audit and Risk Management Committee  meetings. The Audit and Risk Management Committee also reviews and endorses the annual risk assessment results, and  recommends the principal risks for the Boards review and approval. Whistle-blowing and Anti-corruption The Manager has a whistle-blowing policy to help detect possible improprieties for managements attention and actions  as well as for reporting to the Audit and Risk Management Committee. The chairman of the Audit and Risk Management  Committee is also available to receive any complaint directly. To set the business standards and enforce integrity in business practices, the Manager has embedded in the code of  conduct of staff a set of anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies, and arranged for staff from different function units to attend  seminars on prevention of corruptions organised by the Hong Kong Independent Commission Against Corruption. External Auditor The external auditor reports on any control issues identified in the course of its interim review and annual audit work on Links  financial and business results. Management has periodically engaged the external auditor of Link to review and advise on  the adequacy of Links internal controls and risk management systems. Conflict of Interest The Manager has instituted stringent internal procedures, including compliance with the internal General Guidelines on  Declaration and Avoidance of Conflict of Interest, to monitor and deal with conflict of interest issues. In particular: (i) Directors are required to immediately report and periodically update any changes in their directorships and positions  held in other companies and organisations to the Manager. The Manager maintains a register with respect to such  outside directorships and positions of the Directors and makes filings with the SFC in the manner as required by the  SFO. Management checks transactions against the register and performs periodic and sample checking to detect and  deal with potential connected party transactions in the manner as required under the REIT Code. (ii) Directors are required to declare their direct or indirect interests, if any, in any business proposals and abstain from  voting on such proposals. A Director will not be counted in the quorum for a transaction in which he/she is interested. (iii) Unitholders cannot vote on (nor will they be counted in the quorum for) a transaction in which they have a material  interest which is different from the interest of other Unitholders as a whole. (iv) The Manager does not manage any REITs other than Link. (v) All connected party transactions are managed in accordance with the requirements of the REIT Code, the procedures  prescribed in the Compliance Manual and the conditions of the waivers granted by the SFC relevant to the types of  connected party transactions in question. Connected party transactions are subject to regular monitoring by the Audit  and Risk Management Committee and regular periodic review by the Trustee, the internal audit team and Links external  auditor.

David Charles WATT Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Hong Kong, 6 June 2018  35 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Regulatory & Compliance Governance Regulatory Framework Link is a collective investment scheme authorised by the SFC under section 104 of the SFO. It is also a constituent of the  Hang Seng Index and its units are listed on the Stock Exchange. Link Asset Management Limited is the Manager. HSBC  Institutional Trust Services (Asia) Limited is the Trustee.   The Manager The Manager is licensed by the SFC under section 116 of the SFO to conduct the regulated activity of asset  management, and manages Links assets in the interest of the Unitholders. The Manager is wholly owned by the  Trustee and charges management fee on a cost recovery basis. The Manager does not charge any acquisition/ divestment fee, or fee based on a percentage of assets under management or other performance-related indicia.   This minimises conflict and aligns with the interest of the Unitholders.   The Trustee The Trustee is a registered trust company for collective investment schemes under the SFO and the REIT Code,  holding all the Links assets in trust for and in the sole interest of all our Unitholders. The Trustee and the Manager  operate independently. The respective rights and obligations of the Manager and the Trustee are governed by the Trust Deed. The Trustee carries  out periodic reviews on the Manager, in addition to the reviews performed by the internal auditor and external auditor. The  Trustees Report is set out on page 76 of this report. The activities of the Manager and Link are regulated by the SFC pursuant to the REIT Code and the SFO. During the year  ended 31 March 2018, the Manager managed Link, in all material aspects, in accordance with the provisions of the Trust  Deed and the Compliance Manual. The names of the five responsible officers of the Manager for the purposes of the SFO appear in the Corporate Information  section of this report. Corporate Structure UNITHOLDERS TRUSTEE (HSBC Institutional Trust  Services (Asia) Limited)  MANAGER Link Asset Management Limited  100% 100% 60%(2) 100% The Link Holdings Limited (1) Financing The Link Finance Limited The Link Finance (Cayman) 2009 Limited China Property Investments The Link (PRC) Holdings Limited Hong Kong Property Investments Link Properties Limited Hong Kong Property Development Century Land Investment Limited management services managers fee 100% 100% Notes: (1) The Link Holdings Limited is the holding company of all SPVs of Link, and Links principal subsidiaries as at 31 March 2018 are set out in Note 32  to the consolidated financial statements. The Trustee is the sole owner, on behalf of all our Unitholders, of both the Manager and The Link Holdings  Limited, which holds all of the Links assets. The units of Link represent stapled interest in these two companies. (2) 40% interests are held by Nan Fung Development Limited.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 36 Governance Regulatory & Compliance Compliance with Listing Rules Corporate Governance Code & Other Regulations Throughout the year ended 31 March 2018, (i) Link and the Manager complied with the REIT Code, the SFO, applicable provisions of the Listing Rules, the Trust Deed,  and the Compliance Manual; and (ii) Link and the Manager applied the principles and complied with, to the extent appropriate, the code provisions in  the Listing Rules Corporate Governance Code, save and except code provision A.4.2. The Manager considers that  rigid application of code provision A.4.2 to our EDs is not in the interest of our Unitholders. Business continuity and  longevity at top management level work for the long-term benefit of Link. Frequent re-shuffle in executive directorate,  absent the anchor of a controlling Unitholder, tends to promote short-termism. Any risk of entrenchment in office is  counter-balanced by an overwhelmingly high majority of INEDs on our Board, who have the collective power (and the  Unitholders also have the same power under the Trust Deed) to remove a recalcitrant ED. Compliance with Link Securities Dealing Code The Link Securities Dealing Code governs dealing in securities of Link by Directors, senior management, and other  employees of certain senior grades and their respective associates. The terms of the Link Securities Dealing Code are  regularly reviewed and updated (when required) to ensure that they are no less exacting than those set out in the Model  Code for Securities Transactions by Directors of Listed Issuers in Appendix 10 to the Listing Rules. All the Directors, after making specific enquiry on each of them, confirmed that they complied with the required standard set  out in the Link Securities Dealing Code throughout the year ended 31 March 2018. Pursuant to the Link Securities Dealing Code, Directors or senior management or other relevant senior employees wishing to  deal in the securities of Link must first have regard to the provisions of Parts XIII and XIV of the SFO with respect to insider  dealing and market misconduct as if such SFO provisions were applicable to Link. They must also refrain from dealing in  the securities of Link if they are aware of, or are privy to, any negotiations or agreements relating to intended acquisitions  or disposals, or have been otherwise in possession of unpublished inside information, until proper disclosure of the inside  information in accordance with the REIT Code and the Listing Rules has been made. Staff members who are involved in the preparation of the interim and final results announcements and the related reports of  Link are prohibited from dealing in the units of Link (or black-out) for the period and in the manner as specified by the Listing  Rules and the Compliance Manual. The Manager also imposes and enforces ad hoc black-out on staff members who are  involved in corporate transactions or possess inside information relating to them in the manner as required by the Listing  Rules, the inside information provisions of the SFO and the Compliance Manual. Staff members subject to black-out will be  suspended from participating in the EUPP until the black-out is lifted. Compliance with Inside Information Requirements The Manager has an escalation policy monitoring information flow for management to identify events and the Board to  consider timely disclosures of inside information. It also has stringent internal procedures to preserve confidentiality of inside  information. The Manager has complied with the requirements of Part XIVA of the SFO, which are extended to non-corporate  entities including Link. Compliance with Manager-in-charge Regime During the year under review, the Manager updated the roles and responsibilities of the executive officers in order to comply  with the new manager-in-charge regime imposed by the SFC in 2017. Relevant notifications had been filed with the SFC  accordingly.  37 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Governance Directors Responsibility for the Financial Statements The Directors acknowledged their responsibilities for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of Link for   the year ended 31 March 2018, which had been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Management Committee and approved   by the Board. The statement of the auditor regarding its reporting responsibilities on the consolidated financial statements of Link is set out  in the Independent Auditors Report on pages 77 to 81 of this report. Auditors Re-appointment and Remuneration The Audit and Risk Management Committee reviewed and recommended to the Board the re-appointment of the existing  external auditor (PricewaterhouseCoopers). In making its recommendation, the Audit and Risk Management Committee took into consideration the quality and  effectiveness of the work, current level of remuneration as against market trend and the independence of the external  auditor who has confirmed in writing to the Audit and Risk Management Committee its independence with respect to Link  and that there is no relationship between it (as the external auditor) and Link which might reasonably bring to bear on their  independence. It has also considered the scope of non-audit services provided by the external auditor and assessed  whether its independence and objectivity were and could be affected by the rendering of these non-audit services. All services provided by the external auditor in the year were reviewed and approved by the Audit and Risk Management  Committee which has set guidelines governing the engagement of the external auditor for provision of non-audit services  and pre-approval amounts and thresholds for non-audit services. The Manager considered (and the Audit and Risk  Management Committee also agreed) that the external auditors review of interim results and report and annual tax filings  services for Links entities (as tax representative) are recurring items, and the rendering by the external auditor of such  recurring services did not impact its objectivity or any perceived independence in auditing the financial statements of Link. Non-audit services of a non-recurring nature for the year included ad hoc assignments such as setting up procedures and  controls in relation to the Common Reporting Standard under the Inland Revenue Ordinance, transaction due diligence and  assurance as well as IT security assessment and accounting and tax advisory services. An analysis of the fees paid/payable  to the external auditor for audit and non-audit services for the year ended 31 March 2018 is set out in Note 10 to   the consolidated financial statements.

A Director shall abstain from voting in respect of his/her own re-appointment. By the Unitholders The Trust Deed provides that Unitholders may appoint, re-appoint or remove any Director by an ordinary resolution:  two or more registered Unitholders holding together not less than 10% of the units in issue may serve written request to  the Manager which shall convene a meeting of Unitholders to consider the proposed ordinary resolution to appoint,   re-appoint or remove a Director; and  if the proposed resolution is supported by a recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the effective quorum for  the relevant Unitholders meeting shall be two (or more) registered Unitholders holding together not less than 10% of  the units in issue; otherwise, the effective quorum for the relevant Unitholders meeting shall be two (or more) registered  Unitholders holding together not less than 25% of the units in issue.

Retirement by Articles of Association The Articles of Association require that:  any Director so appointed by the Board shall retire but be eligible for re-election at the next following annual general  meeting (with such Director not being taken into account in determining the number of Directors subject to retirement by  rotation at such annual general meeting);  an ED is not subject to retirement by rotation at annual general meeting; and  one-third of the NED/INEDs shall be subject to retirement by rotation (but are eligible for re-election) at each annual  general meeting. The Link Corporate Governance Policy further requires one-third of the INEDs to retire by rotation at each annual general  meeting.  39 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Governance Right to Convene Meetings and Procedures for Putting Forward Proposals According to the Trust Deed, a general meeting of Unitholders may be convened:  by the Trustee; or  by the Manager; or  by not less than two Unitholders registered as together holding not less than 10% of the units in issue, who may serve  written request to the Manager to ask the Manager to convene a general meeting of Unitholders and propose resolutions  for consideration at such meeting. Notice convening the annual general meeting or other general meeting of Unitholders will be given to the Unitholders  in accordance with the requirements of the Trust Deed, the REIT Code and the Listing Rules. Generally, two or more  Unitholders present in person or by proxy registered as holding together not less than 10% of the units in issue shall form  a quorum for the transaction of business at a general meeting but for passing a special resolution, the quorum shall be not  less than 25%. In accordance with the REIT Code and the Trust Deed, any resolution put to a general meeting of Unitholders shall be  decided by poll except (as permitted by the Trust Deed and under waiver granted by the SFC) where the chairman of the  meeting, in good faith, decides to allow a resolution which relates purely to a procedural and administrative matter to be  decided by a show of hands given that such matter (i) is not on the agenda of the general meeting or in any supplemental  circular to Unitholders; and (ii) relates to the chairmans duties to maintain the orderly conduct of the meeting and/or allow  the business of the meeting to be properly and effectively dealt with, whilst allowing all Unitholders a reasonable opportunity  to express their views. Matters Required to be Decided by Special Resolution Pursuant to the Trust Deed, each of the following matters requires specific Unitholders approval by way of special  resolution: (i) disposal of any real estate forming part of the assets of Link within two years from the date of acquisition (or, in the case  of engaging in any property development and related activities, from the date that such property development and  related activities is completed); (ii) disposal by the Trustee of all or any of the issued share capital of the Manager; (iii) any increase in the maximum percentage rate or any change to the structure of the Trustees fee which is not provided  for in the Trust Deed; (iv) any modification, alteration or addition to the Trust Deed, save for certain circumstances specified in the Trust Deed; (v) termination or merger of Link; and (vi) removal of the Trustee under certain circumstances. Directors Service Contracts There is no service contract, which is not determinable by the Manager within one year without payment of compensation  (other than statutory compensation) in respect of those Directors who are due to retire and offer for re-election at the  2018 AGM.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 40 Governance Regulatory & Compliance Directors Interests in Transactions, Arrangements or Contracts Save as disclosed under the Connected Party Transactions section on pages 64 to 70 of this report and in Note 30 to the  consolidated financial statements, no transactions, arrangements or contracts of significance in relation to Links business  to which the Manager was a party and in which a Director had a material interest, whether directly or indirectly, subsisted at  the end of the year or at any time during the year. The Manager entered into agreements with Directors and certain key employees in respect of the grant of restricted unit  awards under the 2017 LTI Scheme in the year under review. Other than the 2017 LTI Scheme, there was no arrangement in  the year under review whose objects are to enable Directors to acquire benefits by means of acquisition of units of Link, or  shares in, or debenture of, any other body corporate. Further details of the 2017 LTI Scheme are disclosed in the   Long-term Incentive Schemes section on pages 54 to 63 and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. There is no  equity-link agreement entered into by the Manager in the year under review. Permitted Indemnity Provisions There are permitted indemnity provisions in the Articles of Association of the Manager and relevant SPVs of Link to provide  indemnity to directors of the Manager and other members of the Group against any third party liability incurred by them in  discharging their duties. The Manager reviews every two years the coverage (including the amount insured) of the directors and officers liability  insurance to ensure that directors and officers (including the company secretary) of all members of the Group in so serving  Link, its SPVs and the Manager are fairly and sufficiently covered against potential liability to third parties. Link Together Initiatives The Link Together Initiatives programme is part of Links on-going commitment to sustainable development. In the year under review, upon the recommendation of the selection committee, the Board approved approximately HK$9  million to fund selected projects under the Link Together Initiatives. The themes of all these selected projects are in line with  the objectives of the Link Together Initiatives which are to support the well-being of the elderly and the disadvantaged and  education, training and development of children and youth services in the communities around Links properties. Details of  selected projects under the Link Together Initiatives in the year under review are set out on pages 71 to 75 of this report. Employee Unit Purchase Plan The EUPP, under which the Manager subsidises eligible employees to purchase Links units, fosters a sense of ownership  among staff. Employees meeting prescribed criteria of the EUPP are entitled to subsidies from the Manager to purchase  from open market Links units through an independent third party intermediary (currently, the Bank of China (Hong Kong)  Limited). Four purchases are made in each financial year on pre-determined dates, and the amount of subsidy for each  eligible employee is determined in accordance with the rules of the EUPP with reference to such employees length of  service and appraised performance. In the year under review, 516 eligible employees of the Manager participated in the EUPP who together purchased   244,244 units on the Stock Exchange at a total consideration of HK$16,174,542 of which HK$2,304,668 were subsidised by  the Manager.  41 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Governance Information on Units of link Issue of New units During the year under review, 1,561,196 new units were issued pursuant to the 2007 LTI Plan.

Therefore, APG Asset Management N.V., APG Groep N.V. and Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP were interested or deemed to be  interested in the same block of 113,471,409 units as shown in the above table and these interests in units were overlapped. (2) The Capital Group Companies, Inc. is the controlling corporation of Capital Research and Management Company and therefore it was deemed to  be interested in the same block of 116,463,159 units in which Capital Research and Management Company was interested. In addition, The Capital  Group Companies, Inc. was deemed to be interested in 14,530,771 units through four other controlled corporations, namely, Capital Guardian Trust  Company (10,245,781 units), Capital International, Inc. (2,537,302 units), Capital International Limited (633,242 units) and Capital International Srl  (1,114,446 units).

(which  had long position interests in 171,607,092 units (7.98%) and short position interests in 3,000 units). Since both companies are wholly-owned by  BlackRock, Inc., their aforesaid interests overlapped with part of the interests of BlackRock, Inc. as shown in the table above. The interests held by  BlackRock, Inc. as shown in the above table included certain long position interests (444,500 underlying units) and short position interests   (64,000 underlying units) in cash settled unlisted derivatives. (4) The approximate percentages were calculated based on 2,150,058,972 units in issue as at 31 March 2018 (rounded down to two decimal places).

Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 54 Long-term Incentive Schemes Disclosures Adoption of the 2017 LTI Scheme The 2007 LTI Plan expired on 22 July 2017. The Board adopted the new 2017 LTI Scheme on 10 July 2017, pursuant to  which awards may be granted to Directors and selected key employees of the Manager, the Managers subsidiaries and  SPVs of Link. The Board adopted the 2017 LTI Scheme having taken into account the success of using unit awards to attract and retain  key executives and employees under the 2007 LTI Plan and the growing popularity of share award schemes with listed  companies as a compensation tool to compete for talents. Details of the principal terms of the 2017 LTI Scheme were set out  in the announcement of Link dated 10 July 2017 (the 2017 Announcement). Unlike the 2007 LTI Plan, the 2017 LTI Scheme does not involve the issue of new units. This eliminates dilution impact to  Unitholders. Awards which may be granted under the 2017 LTI Scheme comprise (i) restricted unit awards (to be satisfied  by purchase of units through a third party intermediary from the open stock market upon vesting); and (ii) conditional cash  awards (to be satisfied by cash payment equal to the aggregate distributions per unit over the vesting period multiplied by  the actual number of units that may finally vest).

Performance Targets Performance targets, vesting scale, and/or other vesting conditions (if any) of an Award shall be determined by the  Remuneration Committee which, in its absolute discretion, will determine whether, and to what extent, such performance  targets and/or vesting conditions (if any) have been satisfied (or, if applicable, waived) upon vesting.

The actual number of units that will finally  vest and be purchased for each relevant grantee may range from zero to such maximum number depending on whether, and to what extent, the  relevant vesting conditions (if any) are met. The restricted unit awards relating to the Non-Executive Director and Independent Non-Executive  Directors are tenure-based only. (2) The closing price of the units on the business day immediately preceding the date of grant of the restricted unit awards in the year was HK$60.45  per unit. On the assumption that the restricted unit awards granted in the year were finally vested for the maximum number of units, the estimated  fair value of such restricted unit awards would amount to approximately HK$130.2 million as at 31 March 2018 based on the valuation of an  independent valuer. (3) These figures represent the maximum number of units in respect of which the restricted unit awards had lapsed or were cancelled in the year. The  conditional cash awards granted in conjunction with such restricted unit awards had lapsed or were cancelled simultaneously. (4) The restricted unit awards in the above table were all granted in conjunction with conditional cash awards. There was yet to be any value carried by  the outstanding conditional cash awards attached to the outstanding restricted unit awards at the end of the year. The restricted unit awards and conditional cash awards granted under the 2017 LTI Scheme are to be expensed through  Links consolidated income statement over the relevant vesting period. Further details of the 2017 LTI Scheme are set out in  Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.  59 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Disclosures 2007 LTI Plan The 2007 LTI Plan adopted on 23 July 2007 had expired on 22 July 2017 after being in operation for 10 years. Pursuant to  which equity incentive in the form of a restricted unit award giving a conditional right to receive units (the Restricted Unit  Award) and a cash incentive in the form of a conditional cash award (the Conditional Cash Award) may be granted to  the Directors and other eligible staff of the Manager. Unit option giving an option to subscribe for units (the Unit Option)  may also be granted under the 2007 LTI Plan. Restricted Unit Award, Conditional Cash Award and Unit Option are referred  to each as an Award and collectively as Awards. Since its adoption and up to 31 March 2018, a total number of 13,798,620 new units were issued in satisfaction of awards  vested under the 2007 LTI Plan. The total number of new units issued represents approximately 0.6% calculated on the  basis of 2,150,058,972 units in issue as at 31 March 2018. After its expiry, no further awards has been and none shall be  granted under the 2007 LTI Plan. Nonetheless, awards granted and accepted prior to expiry but yet to vest shall continue to  have effect and be governed by the rules of the 2007 LTI Plan. New units may be issued in satisfaction of such outstanding  awards upon vesting. Summary of the 2007 LTI Plan Rules The 2007 LTI Plan is managed and administered by the Remuneration Committee in accordance with the rules of the 2007  LTI Plan. A summary of the plan rules is set out below: Purposes The principal purposes of the 2007 LTI Plan are: (i) to align the interests of the participants of the 2007 LTI Plan with the achievement of the strategic long-term goals of the  Manager for Link and with the interests of the Unitholders as a whole; (ii) to enhance the ability to attract and retain talented management and key employees of the Manager whose contributions  are essential to the long-term growth and prosperity of Link and the creation of value for Unitholders; and (iii) to provide Link with the ability to incentivise and/or reward the management and key employees of the Manager so as to  motivate them to achieve superior performance. Participants Persons eligible to participate in the 2007 LTI Plan include (i) Directors; and (ii) key employees of the Manager who, in the  sole opinion of the Remuneration Committee, have contributed or have the potential to contribute to the success of Link. Grant of Award Before the expiration of the 2007 LTI Plan, grant of Award had been approved by the Remuneration Committee, except for  the grant of an Award to a Director, the chief executive officer of the Manager or a significant holder of Link, or any of their  respective associates (other than a person who is an associate only by virtue of such persons employment by the Manager)  which had been approved by the Board (including the INEDs). No Director had been involved in the decision of granting an  Award to himself/herself.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 60 Disclosures Long-term Incentive Schemes Maximum Entitlement of Each Participant Unless approved by the Unitholders by way of an ordinary resolution, no participant had been granted an Award which, if  accepted and vested (for a Restricted Unit Award) and/or exercised (for a Unit Option) in full, would have resulted in such  participant becoming entitled to receive such number of units that, when aggregated with the total units already issued  or to be issued to him/her pursuant to all the Awards granted (including Awards vested and/or exercised, cancelled and  outstanding) to him/her within a 12-month period immediately preceding the date of such proposed grant, would have  exceeded 1% of the total units in issue as at the proposed date of grant of such Award. If an Award had been proposed to be granted to an INED or a significant holder of Link or any of their respective associates  which would had resulted in the units issued pursuant to all the Awards granted (including Awards vested and/or exercised,  cancelled and outstanding) to him/her within a 12-month period up to and including the date of such proposed grant, (i)  representing in aggregate over 0.1% of the total units in issue; and (ii) having an aggregate value, based on the closing  price of the units as at the date of such proposed grant, in excess of HK$5 million, such further grant of Award should have  been approved by the Unitholders by way of an ordinary resolution and the relevant participant and his/her associate(s)  should abstain from voting on the relevant ordinary resolution. In addition, grant of Awards to an INED should not, among  others, exceed 1% of the total units in issue. Vesting Period/Option Period The vesting period of a Restricted Unit Award is generally one year to three years or such other period as determined by  the Remuneration Committee. The option period for a Unit Option is such period (which is no longer than 10 years) as  determined by the Remuneration Committee. Exercise Price of Unit Option The exercise price of a Unit Option shall not be less than the higher of: (i) the closing price of the units as quoted on the  Stock Exchange on the date of grant; and (ii) the average of the closing prices of the units as quoted on the Stock Exchange  for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of grant. No Unit Option has ever been granted since the adoption  of the 2007 LTI Plan. Performance Targets The performance targets and/or other vesting conditions (if any) for a Restricted Unit Award had been determined by the  Remuneration Committee which, in its absolute discretion, had determined whether, and to what extent, such performance  targets and/or vesting conditions (if any) had been satisfied (or, if applicable, waived) upon vesting. Conditional Cash Award A Conditional Cash Award had been granted, in the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee, in conjunction with  a Restricted Unit Award and had vested under the same performance targets and/or vesting conditions (if any) and vesting  period applicable to the relevant Restricted Unit Award. A Conditional Cash Award gives the grantee a conditional right  to receive a cash payment equal to the aggregate distributions per unit paid to the Unitholders during the vesting period  multiplied by the actual number of units finally vested with such grantee. Acceptance of Award and Consideration Payable An offer for grant of an Award should have been accepted within 14 days from the date of grant (or such other period as  specified by the Remuneration Committee). Consideration payable on acceptance of an Award (if any) had been determined  by the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion. Duration The 2007 LTI Plan had expired on 22 July 2017. Upon expiry, no further Award has since been and none can be granted  under the 2007 LTI Plan but the provisions of the 2007 LTI Plan shall continue to have effect in relation to Awards granted  under it but yet to vest.  61 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Disclosures Movements of Restricted Unit Awards under the 2007 LTI Plan Movements in restricted unit awards(4) under the 2007

those relating to the Non-Executive Director and Independent Non-Executive Directors) represent the maximum number of  units that may be issued on vesting of the relevant restricted unit awards. The actual number of units that will finally vest and be issued to each  relevant grantee may range from zero to such maximum number depending on whether, and to what extent, the relevant vesting conditions (if any)  are met. The restricted unit awards relating to the Non-Executive Director and Independent Non-Executive Directors are tenure-based only. (2) The closing price of the units on the business day immediately preceding the date on which the relevant restricted unit awards were vested in the  year was HK$59.90 per unit. An aggregate amount of approximately HK$8.2 million was paid for the conditional cash awards vested simultaneously  with the restricted unit awards in the year. An aggregate amount of approximately HK$0.2 million was paid to the Executive Directors for the year  ended 31 March 2018 due to a catch-up vesting in cash, in lieu of units, which was calculated by reference to the closing price of the units on the  vesting date. (3) These figures represent the maximum number of units in respect of which the restricted unit awards had lapsed in the year. The conditional cash  awards granted in conjunction with such restricted unit awards had lapsed simultaneously. (4) The restricted unit awards in the above table were all granted in conjunction with conditional cash awards. The aggregate weighted average value  carried by the outstanding conditional cash awards attached to the outstanding restricted unit awards at the end of the year was HK$4.1505 per  unit. (5) According to the prevailing policy, outstanding restricted unit awards held by a retired Director under the 2007 LTI Plan will vest on a basis pro rata  to his/her actual number of days in office before retirement. (6) On a pro rata basis (see note 5 above), the maximum number of units that may be issued on vesting of the outstanding restricted unit awards held  by Mr William CHAN Chak Cheung (who retired effective from 9 November 2017) would be, respectively, 4,691 units, 3,906 units and 2,604 units  (instead of 6,000 units, 5,750 units and 5,750 units as stated in the above table). The remaining portion will lapse on the relevant vesting dates. (7) Included in these figures were outstanding restricted unit awards held by two former Independent Non-Executive Directors, including (i) restricted  unit awards in respect of a maximum of 16,750 units held by Mr Nicholas Robert SALLNOW-SMITH at the beginning of the year, of which 9,678 units  were vested and issued and the remaining balance had lapsed in the year; and (ii) restricted unit awards in respect of a maximum of 17,000 units  held by Professor Richard WONG Yue Chim at the beginning of the year, of which 7,208 units were vested and issued, 4,542 units had lapsed, and  a maximum of 5,250 units remained outstanding at the end of the year (which will vest on a pro rata basis as mentioned in note 5 above). Please  refer to page 52 and page 53 of the Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements report of annual report 2016/2017 for further details. The restricted unit awards and conditional cash awards granted under the 2007 LTI Plan are to be expensed through Links  consolidated income statement over the relevant vesting period. Further details of the 2007 LTI Plan are set out in Note 20 to  the consolidated financial statements.

Confirmation by the Manager and the Trustee in Respect of Corporate Finance Transactions  with the HSBC Group The Trustee and the Manager both confirm that, with respect to the corporate finance transactions entered into with the  HSBC Group in the year under review, (i) such transactions were carried out at arms length on normal commercial terms;  (ii) the Trustee was not involved in the decisions to enter into such transactions, subject only to its duties of oversight under  the REIT Code and the Trust Deed; and (iii) the on-going general conditions under the relevant Waiver (details of which were  disclosed in the offering circular dated 14 November 2005 of Link) were complied with.

Report from Auditor in Relation to Certain Connected Party transactions The continuing connected party transactions conducted in the year under review have been reviewed by the auditor in  accordance with Hong Kong Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements Other Than  Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and with reference to Practice Note 740 Auditors Letter on Continuing  Connected Transactions under the Hong Kong Listing Rules issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public  Accountants.

Confirmation by the Audit and Risk Management Committee The management submitted quarterly compliance reports to the Audit and Risk Management Committee for review which  were then presented to the Board after endorsement. The Audit and Risk Management Committee has reviewed and is satisfied that the general nature and types of the ordinary  course banking and financial services provided by the HSBC Group and Dah Sing Bank in the year under review were of  the types that are contemplated in the respective Waivers granted by the SFC and were of the nature and types that were  entered into in the ordinary and usual course of business at arms length on normal commercial terms and there were no  material inconsistencies with the internal procedures of the Manager that should be drawn to the attention of the Unitholders.

Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 68 Disclosures Connected Party Transactions New Connected Party Transaction Waivers Granted on 19 January 2018 New waivers were granted on 19 January 2018 by the SFC to Link from strict compliance with certain provisions in the REIT  Code (or referred to as the Code below) in respect of certain connected party transactions between Link, the Manager,  and the other companies or entities held or controlled by Link (referred collectively in the text below as Link REITs  Group) with Dah Sing Bank. Terms and conditions of such new waivers relating to Dah Sing Bank are reproduced below: Modifications and waivers granted in relation to certain requirements of the Code and conditions  thereon (I) Extension of Definition of Relevant Banking Group The definition of Relevant Banking Group in paragraph 8 of Schedule VII to the Compliance Manual be extended  to cover Dah Sing Bank, such that ordinary course banking services provided by Dah Sing Bank to Link REITs  Group will be deemed not to be connected party transactions and therefore will not be subject to any requirement  for announcement or unitholders approval, provided that in relation to the ordinary course banking services with the  Relevant Banking Group, the Manager will: (a) disclose in its annual report a positive or negative confirmation whether any ordinary course banking services  has been entered into with each member of the Relevant Banking Group in the relevant financial year and a  description of the general nature or types of such transactions; and (b) disclose in its annual report that (i) the Audit and Risk Management Committee has reviewed the general nature  and types of such transactions and reported on them and (ii) the Audit and Risk Management Committee is  satisfied that the general nature and types of transactions are of the type that are contemplated in the waiver  application of the Manager and are of a nature and a type that would be entered into in the ordinary and usual  course of business at arms length on normal commercial terms and there are no material inconsistencies with  the internal procedures of the Manager that should be drawn to the attention of the unitholders. In any case where the Relevant Banking Group (excluding the Trustee) is acting in its ordinary course of its business  and in the capacity of fund manager, nominee, custodian, agent or trustee or otherwise on behalf of a third party (so  that the transaction is being conducted for the account or benefit of a party other than the Relevant Banking Group  concerned), the transaction (including a transaction in securities of Link) will not be regarded as a connected party  transaction. Such a transaction would include a transaction between Link and another collective investment scheme  (including another real estate investment trust) for which a company within the Relevant Banking Group acts as the  manager or trustee, provided the transaction is not a proprietary transaction of the Relevant Banking Group (excluding  the Trustee). (II) Corporate Finance Transactions with Dah Sing Bank Waiver from strict compliance with the unitholders approval and disclosure requirements under Rules 8.9 and 8.11  of the Code and a modification of the announcement, disclosure and reporting requirements under Chapter 8 of the  Code with respect to certain corporate finance transactions with Dah Sing Bank be granted. For this purpose corporate finance transactions means: (i) underwriting, securitisation, issue of debt instruments or other securities, or other related arrangements where  Dah Sing Bank is involved in an underwriting or arranging capacity or acts as listing agent and/or financial  adviser and/or global co-ordinator to Link; (ii) lending and borrowing of funds or other related arrangements (including refinancing thereof) in connection with  any facility agreement by which Link REITs Group will finance the acquisition of real estate (other than ordinary  course banking services which relate generally to working capital financing); and (iii) corporate advisory transactions, (i.e. the provision of corporate finance advice1 to Link and excludes (i) and (ii)  above).  69 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Disclosures The announcements, disclosures and reporting requirements under Chapter 8 of the Code that would apply in  respect of any corporate finance transactions between Dah Sing Bank and any member of Link REITs Group shall  be modified as described in the conditions (a) to (i) below. (a) each transaction is carried out at arms length on normal commercial terms; (b) the offering document or any circular for Link will include clear disclosure regarding this waiver and, with respect  to the transactions under (i) and (ii) of this waiver, full disclosure of the material terms of the relevant agreements; (c) the annual report of Link will disclose the following details: (i) the aggregate fees paid to Dah Sing Bank in respect of corporate finance transactions conducted by   Dah Sing Bank for Link in the relevant financial year; and (ii) in respect of corporate finance transactions conducted by Dah Sing Bank for Link in the relevant financial  year whose individual fees exceed HK$1 million: (A) the nature of the transaction; (B) the parties to the  transaction; and (C) the date of the transaction; (d) the Manager will confirm, in respect of corporate finance transactions entered into with Dah Sing Bank, in the  annual report of Link that (a) above and the general conditions as set out below have been complied with; (e) a statement will be made by the Audit and Risk Management Committee in the annual report of Link that it has  reviewed the terms of any such connected party transactions and is satisfied that these transactions have been  entered into in the ordinary and usual course of business at arms length on normal commercial terms, are fair  and reasonable and are in the interests of the unitholders; (f) underwriting or other related agreements are to be in respect of a particular transaction carried out at arms  length on normal commercial terms, the primary objective of which is the offering or distribution of securities to  parties outside of Dah Sing Bank; (g) aggregate fees of Dah Sing Bank generated from all corporate advisory transactions between Dah Sing Bank  and Link conducted during the relevant financial year are to be capped at 0.5% of the net asset value of Link as  disclosed in the latest published audited accounts of Link adjusted by any subsequent transactions published  in an announcement and/or circular of Link, in order for the waiver to apply to corporate advisory transactions. If  the aggregate fees of Dah Sing Bank generated from all corporate advisory transactions between Dah Sing Bank  and Link conducted during the financial year exceed the cap above, the normal connected party transaction  requirements under Chapter 8 of the Code (including obtaining unitholders approval) will apply with respect to  the relevant connected party transaction; (h) where a transaction involving Dah Sing Bank is required to be announced pursuant to the provisions of the   Code and to which the waivers granted by the SFC in respect of connected party transactions do not apply,   then disclosure of the role played by Dah Sing Bank and the relevant terms of engagement shall be made in   the relevant announcement in accordance with normal market practice and the requirements of the Code; and (i) the auditor of Link will report to the Manager confirming that: (i) the transactions were duly approved by the Board of Directors of the Manager in accordance with the  internal procedures of the Manager; (ii) the transactions were entered into in accordance with the terms of the agreements governing the  transactions; and (iii) the aggregate fees of Dah Sing Bank generated from all corporate advisory transactions between Dah Sing  bank and Link conducted during the relevant financial year do not exceed the cap as described above.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 70 Disclosures Connected Party Transactions In addition to the aforesaid, the waivers set out in paragraphs I and II above shall also be subject to the following general  conditions on an ongoing basis: (a) the Manager has implemented internal control and compliance procedures to deal with connected party transactions  to ensure that connected party transactions are monitored and carried out on terms in compliance with the Code; (b) the connected party transaction waivers will be given on the basis that they only apply to connected party  transactions which arise solely as a result of and for so long as Mr Blair Chilton PICKERELL acting as an independent  non-executive director (INED) of the Manager. If other connected party transactions arise as a result of other  circumstances, these will be governed by Chapter 8 of the Code in the normal way; (c) the connected party transactions are entered into at arms length on normal commercial terms in the usual and  ordinary course of business and in the interests of unitholders; and (d) the waivers do not need to be renewed on a regular basis, provided that: (i) the SFC reserves its right to review or  revise the terms of the waivers or impose any conditions as it deems appropriate from time to time; and (ii) the full  Board (including the INEDs) considers that it is fair and reasonable and in the best interests of the unitholders to  continue with the waivers granted without unitholders approval and disclose such confirmation in the annual report  of Link. In addition, the Audit and Risk Management Committee will make a statement in the annual report of Link that  it has reviewed the terms of the connected party transaction waivers and is satisfied that (on the basis of the terms of  the waivers and the internal controls and procedures in place) it is fair and reasonable that the waivers be continued  without unitholders approval. The various categories of transactions which are the subject of the waivers set out in paragraphs I and II above are  supplementary to any and all applicable exemptions and permissions under the Code and are independent of each other  so that: (a) none is in any way limited by or by reference to any of the others; and (b) if more than one category is relevant  in any particular circumstance or situation, any relevant category may apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the SFC has the right to review, revise or impose any of the conditions relating to the  above waivers as it deems appropriate from time to time.

Our opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the  Group as at 31 March 2018, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then  ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of  Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA). Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Hong Kong Standards on Auditing (HKSAs) issued by the HKICPA. Our  responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Independence We are independent of the Group in accordance with the HKICPAs Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the  Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 78 Independent Auditors Report Independent Auditors Report Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the  consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion  on these matters. The key audit matter identified in our audit relates to the valuation of investment properties. Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter Valuation of Investment Properties Refer to notes 3(d), 5(a) and 15 to the consolidated  financial statements The valuation of the Groups investment properties is the  key component of the net asset value attributable to the  unitholders and underpins the Groups result for the year.  The aggregated valuation in the consolidated statement of  financial position is HK$203,091 million and the fair value  gain of investment properties for the year was HK$35,493  million which is a significant component of the consolidated  income statement. The Groups investment properties  portfolio comprises of retail and office properties, car  parks and property under development in Hong Kong and  Mainland China. The valuations were carried out by a third party valuer  (the Valuer). Under the Code on Real Estate Investment  Trusts issued by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures  Commission (the REIT Code), the Valuer shall retire after  it has conducted valuations for three consecutive years,  and may only be reappointed after three years. The valuation of the Groups completed investment  properties is inherently subjective due to, among other  factors, the individual nature of each property, its location  and the expected future rentals for that particular  property. For properties under development, factors  include estimated development costs and allowance for  developers risk and profit. Experience of Valuer and relevance of their work We read the Valuers report and understand that the  valuation was prepared in accordance with HKIS Valuation  Standards 2017, the International Valuation Standards  2017, the RICS Valuation – Global Standards 2017 and the  REIT Code. We assessed the Valuers qualifications and  expertise and read its terms of engagement with the Group  to determine whether there were any matters that might  have affected their objectivity or may have imposed scope  limitations upon their work. Valuation methodology used by the Valuer We involved our experts in property valuation to discuss,  assess and evaluate the reasonableness of the valuation  methodologies and models used by the Valuer by  comparing against our knowledge in valuation and the  properties industry. Data used by the Valuer For completed investment properties we checked, on a  sample basis, the data used by the Valuer to perform the  valuation to appropriate supporting documents, including:  key terms of lease agreements;  operating expenditure details; and  rental income schedules.      79 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Independent Auditors Report Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter Valuation of Investment Properties (Continued) In determining a propertys valuation, the Valuer took into  account property-specific information such as tenancy  agreements, rental income and direct property expenses.  For completed properties, the income capitalisation  approach and discounted cash flow analysis were primarily  used, with cross reference to direct comparison approach,  where applicable. The Valuer applies assumptions for  capitalisation rates and net passing income, which are  influenced by the prevailing market yields and comparable  market transactions, as well as discount rate, to arrive  at the final valuation. For properties under development,  the residual approach is used, whereby the valuation is  derived from the gross development value of the project  upon completion (estimated using a direct comparison  approach) less estimated outstanding development costs  and allowance for developers risk and profit. The existence of significant estimation uncertainty, coupled  with the fact that only a small percentage difference in  individual property valuations, when aggregated, could  result in a material misstatement, warrants specific audit  focus in this area. There were a number of specific factors affecting the  valuations in the year which we considered when making  our judgements:  disposal of the Groups investment properties during the  year, as reference for recent market transactions;  revitalisation of certain investment properties through the  Groups Asset Enhancement Program; and  the performance of the Groups investment property  portfolio. Data used by the Valuer (Continued) For property under development, we agreed on a sample  basis that the planned schemes being valued were  consistent with the supporting documents and, where  appropriate, had achieved planning consent. Where the  Valuer used estimated development costs, we agreed  on a sample basis these costs to the approved budgets,  construction contracts and/or other supporting documents. Assumptions and estimates used by the Valuer We attended meetings with the Valuer where we discussed  the valuation approaches and the key assumptions  used. The assumptions used varied across the portfolio  depending on the age, nature and location of each  property but they included estimated capitalisation rate,  net passing income, development costs and allowance for  developers risk and profit. In each of these areas, and on a  sample basis, we compared the estimates and assumptions  used by the Valuer against the published industry  benchmarks and comparable market transactions, and our  experience in this sector. We performed further work on the  properties with assumptions suggesting a possible outlier  versus market data for the relevant property sector. Where  assumptions were outside the expected range or were  otherwise unusual, and/or valuations showed unexpected  movements, we held further discussions with the Valuer  to understand the rationale and obtained additional audit  evidence to support the explanations received. We considered that the assumptions used in the valuations  were supportable in light of available and comparable  market evidence.

Responsibilities of the Manager and the Audit and Risk Management Committee for the  Consolidated Financial Statements The Manager is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in  accordance with HKFRSs issued by the HKICPA, and for such internal control as the Manager determines is necessary to  enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or  error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Manager is responsible for assessing the Groups ability to continue  as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of  accounting unless the Manager either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative  but to do so. In addition, the Manager is required to ensure that the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in  accordance with the relevant provisions of the Trust Deed dated 6 September 2005, as amended by the 11 Supplemental  Deeds (the Trust Deed), and the relevant disclosure provisions of Appendix C of the REIT Code. The Audit and Risk Management Committee is responsible for overseeing the Groups financial reporting process. Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion. We  report our opinion solely to you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept  liability to any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a  guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial  statements. In addition, we are required to assess whether the consolidated financial statements of the Group have been  properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Trust Deed and the relevant  disclosure provisions of Appendix C of the REIT Code.  81 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Independent Auditors Report Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) As part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism  throughout the audit. We also:  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or  error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is  higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,  or the override of internal control.  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate  in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups internal control.  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related  disclosures made by the Manager.  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Managers use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt  on the Groups ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required  to draw attention in our auditors report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such  disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the  date of our auditors report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going  concern.  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a  manner that achieves fair presentation.  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities  within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the Audit and Risk Management Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify  during our audit. We also provide the Audit and Risk Management Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical  requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the Audit and Risk Management Committee, we determine those matters that were of  most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit  matters. We describe these matters in our auditors report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the  matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report  because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of  such communication. Report on Matters Under the Relevant Provisions of the Trust Deed and the Relevant  Disclosure Provisions of Appendix C of the Reit Code In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance  with the relevant provisions of the Trust Deed and the relevant disclosure provisions of Appendix C of the REIT Code. The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors report is Wong Hung Nam.

Notes: (i) Transactions with Unitholders comprise the distributions to Unitholders of HK$5,254 million (2017: HK$4,898 million) and change in net assets  attributable to Unitholders, excluding issues of new units and units bought back, of HK$44,609 million (2017: HK$12,461 million). (ii) In accordance with the Trust Deed, the units of Link Real Estate Investment Trust contain contractual obligations to pay to its Unitholders cash  distributions and also upon termination of the trust, a share of all net cash proceeds derived from the sale or realisation of the assets of the trust less  any liabilities, in accordance with their proportionate interests in the trust at the date of the termination. The Unitholders funds are therefore classified  as a financial liability rather than equity in accordance with Hong Kong Accounting Standard 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation. Consistent  with Unitholders funds being classified as a financial liability, the distributions to Unitholders and change in net assets attributable to Unitholders,  excluding issues of new units and units bought back, are finance costs. Accordingly, the total comprehensive income, after the transactions with  Unitholders, is zero.

Notes: (i) Under the terms of the Trust Deed, the Total Distributable Income is the consolidated profit after taxation attributable to Unitholders adjusted to  eliminate the effects of certain non-cash adjustments which have been recorded in the consolidated income statement for the relevant year. Link  Real Estate Investment Trust is required to ensure that the total amount distributed to Unitholders as distributions for each financial year shall be  no less than 90% of Total Distributable Income. The Manager has decided to distribute 100% (2017: 100%) of Total Distributable Income as the  distribution for the year ended 31 March 2018. (ii) Discretionary distribution refers to any additional amount to be distributed as determined by the Manager pursuant to clause 13.4 of the Trust Deed.  The Manager recommended a discretionary distribution relating to the adjustment for depreciation charge on investment properties under China  Accounting Standards during the year. (iii) The interim distribution per unit of HK121.50 cents (2017: HK111.75 cents) for the six months ended 30 September 2017 is calculated based on the  interim distribution of HK$2,673 million (2017: HK$2,494 million) for the period and 2,199,876,472 units (2017: 2,231,341,276 units) in issue as at 30  September 2017. The interim distribution was paid to Unitholders on 1 December 2017. (iv) The final distribution per unit of HK128.28 cents (2017: HK116.66 cents) for the year ended 31 March 2018 is calculated based on the final  distribution to be paid to the Unitholders of HK$2,758 million (2017: HK$2,581 million) for the second half of the financial year and 2,150,058,972  units (2017: 2,213,002,276 units) in issue as at 31 March 2018, without taking into account any change in the number of units in issue subsequent to  the approval of the consolidated financial statements. The final distribution will be paid to Unitholders on 5 July 2018.  85 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Consolidated Statement of Financial Position As at 31 March 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements 2018 2017 Note HK$M HK$M          Non-current assets Goodwill 14 416 466 Investment properties 15 203,091 174,006 Property, plant and equipment 16 115 87 Derivative financial instruments 22 280 116          203,902 174,675          Current assets Trade and other receivables 17 715 503 Deposits and prepayments 97 77 Derivative financial instruments 22 1 – Short-term bank deposits 18 8,525 150 Cash and cash equivalents 18 3,164 535          12,502 1,265          Total assets 216,404 175,940          Current liabilities Trade payables, receipts in advance and accruals 19 2,462 1,870 Security deposits 1,665 1,494 Provision for taxation 420 305 Current portion of long-term incentive schemes provision 20 87 76 Interest bearing liabilities 21 2,589 300 Derivative financial instruments 22 2 1          7,225 4,046          Net current assets/(liabilities) 5,277 (2,781)          Total assets less current liabilities 209,179 171,894          Non-current liabilities, excluding net assets attributable to Unitholders Long-term incentive schemes provision 20 50 37 Interest bearing liabilities 21 23,196 27,197 Derivative financial instruments 22 375 498 Deferred tax liabilities 23 2,893 2,417 Other non-current liabilities 24 3,597 3,248          30,111 33,397          Total liabilities, excluding net assets attributable to Unitholders 37,336 37,443          Non-controlling interest 474 256          Net assets attributable to Unitholders 178,594 138,241          Units in issue 25 2,150,058,972 2,213,002,276          Net assets per unit attributable to Unitholders HK$83.06 HK$62.47          The notes on pages 88 to 130 are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 88 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 1  Corporate Information Link Real Estate Investment Trust (Link) is a collective investment scheme authorised under section 104 of the  Securities and Futures Ordinance (Chapter 571 of the Laws of Hong Kong). Link is governed by a trust deed entered  into on 6 September 2005 (as amended and supplemented by 11 Supplemental Deeds dated 4 November 2005, 8  November 2005, 16 January 2006, 21 November 2006, 13 July 2007, 23 July 2007, 5 October 2009, 23 July 2010, 25  July 2012, 18 February 2014 and 15 January 2015) (together the Trust Deed). The principal activity of Link and its subsidiaries (the Group) is investing in real estate (other than real estate of a  residential, hotel or serviced apartment nature) and undertaking property development and related activities in respect  of all types of developments that contain retail and/or commercial portions. The addresses of the registered offices  of the Manager, Link Asset Management Limited, and the Trustee, HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Asia) Limited,  are 33/F., AXA Tower, Landmark East, 100 How Ming Street, Kwun Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong and 1 Queens Road  Central, Hong Kong, respectively. 2  Basis of Preparation (a) Statement of Compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Hong Kong Financial Reporting  Standards (HKFRSs), the requirements of the Trust Deed and the relevant disclosure requirements as set out in  Appendix C of the Code on Real Estate Investment Trusts (the REIT Code) issued by the Securities and Futures  Commission of Hong Kong. HKFRSs is a collective term which includes all applicable Hong Kong Financial  Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong  Institute of Certified Public Accountants. (b) Accounting Convention The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by  the revaluation of derivative financial instruments, investment properties and non-controlling interest put option  obligation, which are stated at fair values as explained in the significant accounting policies set out in Note 3. (c) Adoption of New and Revised HKFRSs For the year ended 31 March 2018, the Group has adopted all the new amendments that are currently in issue and  effective. HKAS 7 Amendments Disclosure Initiative HKAS 12 Amendments Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses Annual Improvements to HKFRSs 2014–2016 Cycle:  HKFRS 12 Amendments Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities The adoption of these new amendments has not had any significant effect on the accounting policies or results  reported and financial position of the Group.  89 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 2  Basis of Preparation (Continued) (c) Adoption of New and Revised HKFRSs (Continued) The following new standards, amendments and interpretations, which have been published but are not yet  effective, have not been early adopted in the consolidated financial statements.

Preliminary review noted that save for HKFRS 16 which may require further evaluation to address  the recognition, classification and measurement of leases, the adoption of all these new or revised HKFRSs are  unlikely to have a significant impact on the Groups financial performance and financial position but may result in  new or amended disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 90 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are set out  below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented. (a) Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of Link and all its subsidiaries as at 31  March 2018 and their results for the year then ended. Subsidiaries are entities, including structured entities, over which the Group has control. The Group controls an  entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has  the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated  from the date that control ceases. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are  eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the  asset transferred. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred  for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former  owners of the acquiree and the units issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value  of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and  liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values  at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the consolidated income statement during the  period in which they are incurred. Where the Group enters into a contract that contains an obligation (for example a written put option exercisable  by the contract counterparty) to acquire shares in a partly-owned subsidiary company from the non-controlling  interest, which is not part of a business combination, the Group records a financial liability for the present value  of the redemption amount with a corresponding charge directly to equity. Changes to the value of the financial  liability are recognised in the consolidated income statement. (b) Segment Reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing a particular type of  service (operating segment), or in providing services within a particular economic environment (geographical  segment), and which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments. Consistent  with the Groups internal financial reporting to the Manager, being the chief operating decision maker, for the  purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance, segment assets consist  primarily of tangible assets and receivables and segment liabilities mainly comprise operating liabilities.  91 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (c) Foreign Currency Translation (i)  Functional and presentation currencies Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of  the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated  financial statements are presented in millions of Hong Kong Dollars, which is the functional currency of Link  and the Groups presentation currency. (ii) Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing  at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses  resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the reporting date exchange  rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated  income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and  qualifying net investment hedges. (iii) Group companies The results and financial position of all the Groups entities that have a functional currency different from the  presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: –  assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position of the Groups entities are translated at the  reporting date closing rate; –  income and expenditures for each income statement of the Groups entities are translated at average  exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the  rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenditures are translated at the  rates on the dates of the transactions); and –  all resulting currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and  liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the reporting date closing rate. Currency translation differences  arising are recognised in other comprehensive income. (d) Investment Properties A property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, is classified as an investment  property. It also includes properties that are being constructed or developed for future use as investment  properties. Investment property comprises land held under government leases and treated under finance lease and buildings  held under finance leases. An investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs. After initial recognition, an investment property is carried at fair value, representing open market value determined  at each reporting date. The carrying value of the investment property is reviewed every six months and is  independently valued by external valuer at least annually.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 92 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (d) Investment Properties (Continued) Any gain or loss arising on disposal of the investment property (calculated as the difference between the disposal  proceeds and the carrying amount, including revaluation, of the asset) is recognised in the consolidated income  statement in the period in which the investment property is disposed of. Changes in fair values of the investment properties are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic  benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other  repair and maintenance costs are expensed in the consolidated income statement during the period in which they  are incurred. (e) Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,  only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost  of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance costs are expensed in the consolidated  income statement during the period in which they are incurred. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate cost less  estimated residual value less accumulated impairment losses over the estimated useful lives as follows: Leasehold improvements 5 years or lease terms (if applicable) Equipment 3 to 5 years Motor vehicles 5 years An assets residual value and useful life are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is  greater than its estimated recoverable amount, as an impairment loss. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amounts and are  recognised in the consolidated income statement. (f) Trade and Other Receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost,  less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade and other receivables is established when there  is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms  of the receivables. The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the  present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is  recognised in the consolidated income statement. (g) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid  investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. (h) Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net  identifiable assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on business combinations is  stated as a separate asset. Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost  less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the  disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to  cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.  93 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (i) Unitholders Funds as a Financial Liability In accordance with the Trust Deed, Link is required to distribute to Unitholders not less than 90% of the Groups  Total Distributable Income for each financial year. The trust also has a limited life of 80 years from the date of  establishment. Accordingly, the units contain contractual obligations of the trust to pay to its Unitholders cash  distributions and also upon termination of the trust, a share of all net cash proceeds derived from the sale or  realisation of the assets of the trust less any liabilities, in accordance with their proportionate interests in the trust  at the date of the termination. The Unitholders funds are therefore classified as a financial liability rather than  equity in accordance with HKAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation. This liability is shown on the consolidated  statement of financial position as the net assets attributable to Unitholders. Distributions to Unitholders are  recognised in the consolidated income statement. (j) Trade Payables and Provisions (i)  Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the  effective interest method. (ii) Provisions Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it  is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the  amount can be made. Where a provision is expected to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a  separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the  obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the  risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest  expense. (k) Operating Leases Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of assets remain with the leasing company are  accounted for as operating leases. Details of the recognition of operating lease rental income are set out in Note  3(o)(i) below. (l) Current and Deferred Taxation The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated income  statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in  equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the  reporting date in the countries where the Groups subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management  periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is  subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid  to the tax authorities.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 94 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (l) Current and Deferred Taxation (Continued) Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the  tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred  taxation is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting  date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is  settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available  against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred taxation is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the  timing of the reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary  differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred taxation arising from investment property is determined based on the expected manner as to how the  investment properties will be recovered (through sale or through use) with the corresponding tax rate applied. (m) Interest Bearing Liabilities Interest bearing liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Interest bearing  liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction  costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the  instrument using the effective interest method. (n) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets Assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the  carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets  carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value  less costs to sell and value in use. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer impairment are reviewed for  possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. (o) Revenue Recognition (i)  Rentals from retail and commercial properties Operating lease rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement.  Contingent rental income (representing income over and above base rent) such as turnover rent, is recognised  according to the terms of the lease agreements when the amount can be reliably measured, in the accounting  period in which it is earned. Lease incentives provided, such as rent-free periods, are amortised on a straight- line basis and are recognised as a reduction of rental income over the respective term of the lease. (ii) Rentals from car parks Rentals from car parks are recognised as revenue on an accrual basis. (iii) Service fees and charges Service fees and charges such as air conditioning income arising from the provision of services are  recognised when such services are rendered. (iv) Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method.  95 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (p) Expenditure Expenditures, including property related outgoings and other expenses, are recognised on an accrual basis. (q) Employee Benefits Employee benefits such as wages, salaries and bonuses are recognised as an expense when the employee has  rendered the service. Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for  the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the reporting date.  Employee entitlements to sick leave and maternity leave are not recognised until the time of leave. The employers  contributions to the Mandatory Provident Fund for employees are expensed as incurred. (r) Employees Long-term Incentive Schemes Incentives in the form of a long-term incentive schemes are provided to eligible employees (including directors). Employee services rendered in exchange for the grant of the long-term incentive schemes awards are recognised  as an expense, with a corresponding increase in the liability incurred. This expense is charged to the consolidated  income statement over the vesting periods. Until the liability is settled, the value of the liability is re-measured  at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with any changes in value recognised in the consolidated  income statement for the year. At each reporting date, estimates of the number of long-term incentive schemes  awards that are expected to vest will be revised and the impact of the revision is recognised in the consolidated  income statement. The carrying value of the long-term incentive schemes awards is reviewed every six months  and is independently valued by external valuer at least annually. If the awards do not vest on the vesting dates, the  amounts charged to the consolidated income statement will be written back. (s) Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities A derivative is initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and is subsequently  re-measured at its fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the  derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. (i)  Cash flow hedge Hedging relationships are classified as cash flow hedges when such relationships are used to hedge against  exposure to variability in cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset  or liability and such variability could affect profit or loss. The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments  and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge  transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis,  of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and will continue to be highly  effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. The changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow  hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income and deferred in a cash flow hedging reserve. The gain  or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 96 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) (s) Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities (Continued) (i)  Cash flow hedge (Continued) Amounts accumulated in hedging reserve are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the  periods when the hedged item affects earnings. However, when the highly probable forecast transaction that  is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses  previously deferred in cash flow hedging reserve are transferred from hedging reserve and included in the  measurement of the initial cost or carrying amount of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria  for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in the cash flow hedging reserve at that time shall  remain in hedging reserve and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the  consolidated income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative  gain or loss that was reported in hedging reserve is immediately transferred to the consolidated income  statement. (ii) Fair value hedge Derivatives designated as hedging instruments to hedge the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities may  qualify as fair value hedges. The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge its exposure to variability in fair values of recognised  liabilities against changes in market interest rates. The Group uses cross currency swap contracts to hedge its exposure to variability in fair value of recognised  foreign currency liabilities against changes in foreign currency exchange rates and market interest rates.  The changes in fair values of the cross currency swap contracts are recognised directly in the consolidated  income statement. Changes in the fair values of these derivative contracts, together with the changes in the fair values of the  hedged liabilities attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the consolidated income statement as  finance costs on interest bearing liabilities. At the same time the carrying amounts of the hedged liabilities in  the consolidated statement of financial position are adjusted for the changes in fair values. (t) Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are  assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to  the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other  borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.  97 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 4  Financial Risk Management (a) Financial Risk Factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including interest rate risk and currency  risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. Risk management is carried out by the Manager. The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on  the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial  performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap contracts and cross  currency swap contracts to manage financial risk. (i)  Market risk (A) Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through the impact of rate changes in interest bearing liabilities  and assets. The risks can be separated into cash flow interest rate risk and fair value interest rate risk. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will impact cash flows arising  from variable rate financial instruments. Borrowings at floating rates therefore expose the Group to cash  flow interest rate risk. The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest  rate swap contracts. Such interest rate swap contracts have the economic effect of converting borrowings  from floating rates to fixed rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the values of financial liabilities will fluctuate because of changes  in market interest rates. The Group manages its fair value interest rate risk by entering into interest rate  swap contracts which have the economic effect of converting borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates. As at 31 March 2018, if interest rates on floating rate interest bearing liabilities net of floating rate interest  bearing assets had been 100 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, profit for the  year, before transactions with Unitholders, would have been HK$46 million (2017: HK$84 million) lower/ higher, mainly as a result of higher/lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings. As at 31 March  2018, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower, the hedging reserve would have been  HK$384/407 million (2017: HK$326/349 million) higher/lower mainly as a result of an increase/decrease in  the fair values of the cash flow hedges as described above. (B) Currency risk Currency risk arises on account of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not  the functional currency. The Group has certain investments in Mainland China, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency  translation risk. This gave rise to an unrealised gain of approximately HK$1,818 million (2017: unrealised  loss of approximately HK$662 million) on translation of these operations net assets to the Groups Hong  Kong Dollar reporting currency, which is reflected as a movement in reserves under the heading of  exchange reserve. The Group has medium term notes denominated in United States Dollars. It uses cross currency swap  contracts to hedge its exposure against changes in United States Dollars exchange rates. Management  therefore considers that there are no significant currency risk with respect to United States Dollars. As at  31 March 2018, the Hong Kong Dollars equivalent of United States Dollars medium term notes stands at  HK$7,350 million (2017: HK$7,306 million).  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 98 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 4  Financial Risk Management (Continued) (a) Financial Risk Factors (Continued) (ii) Credit risk Credit risk arises from the potential failure of the Groups counterparties to meet their obligations under  financial contracts. The Group is exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents and deposits with  banks and financial institutions, derivative financial instruments as well as trade receivables. Credit risk is managed on a group basis. The Group manages its deposits with banks and financial institutions  by limiting the level of deposits to be placed with any counterparties. Deposits placed with any individual  counterparty cannot exceed a pre-defined limit assigned to the individual counterparty. As at 31 March 2018,  all deposits were placed with financial institutions with external credit ratings of no less than BBB. In respect of credit exposures to tenants, credit risk exposure is minimised by undertaking transactions with  a large number of counterparties and conducting credit reviews on prospective tenants. The Group also has  policies in place to ensure that rental security deposits are required from tenants prior to commencement of  leases. It also has other monitoring procedures to ensure that follow-up action is taken to recover overdue  debts. In addition, the Group regularly reviews the recoverable amount of each individual trade receivable  to ensure that adequate provision for impairment losses is made for potentially irrecoverable amounts. The  Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the  consolidated statement of financial position after deducting any impairment allowance. The Groups exposure  to credit risk arising from trade receivables amounted to HK$106 million (2017: HK$78 million) and is set out in  Note 17. The Groups exposure to credit risk arising from bank deposits amounted to HK$11,689 million (2017:  HK$685 million) and is set out in Note 18. The Groups exposure to credit risk arising from derivative financial  instruments amounted to HK$281 million (2017: HK$116 million) and is set out in Note 22. (iii) Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash and the availability of funding from  committed credit facilities and operating cash flow. The Group has cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits of HK$11,689 million (2017: HK$685  million) as at 31 March 2018. In addition to the cash resources, the Group has total available borrowing  facilities amounting to HK$37,285 million (2017: HK$38,085 million), of which HK$26,285 million (2017:  HK$28,040 million) was drawn as at 31 March 2018. The undrawn committed facilities, in the form of bank  loans, totalled HK$11,000 million (2017: HK$10,045 million) as at 31 March 2018.  99 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 4  Financial Risk Management (Continued) (a) Financial Risk Factors (Continued) (iii) Liquidity risk (Continued) The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the  remaining period at the reporting date to the contractual maturity dates.

The Group monitors capital on a regular basis and observes the REIT Codes maximum gearing ratio of 45%. This  ratio is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non-current borrowings) divided by total asset value as  shown in the consolidated statement of financial position. 2018 2017 HK$M HK$M       Interest bearing liabilities (Note 21) 25,785 27,497       Total asset value 216,404 175,940       Gearing ratio 11.9% 15.6%        Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 100 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 4  Financial Risk Management (Continued) (c) Fair Value Estimation (i)  Fair value hierarchy HKFRS 13 requires disclosure of fair value measurement by three levels of fair value measurement hierarchy.  The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,  either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable  inputs). Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total HK$M HK$M HK$M HK$M           At 31 March 2018 Assets Investment properties – – 203,091 203,091 Derivative financial instruments – 281 – 281           Total assets – 281 203,091 203,372           Liabilities Derivative financial instruments – 377 – 377 Non-controlling interest put option obligation – – 700 700           Total liabilities – 377 700 1,077           At 31 March 2017 Assets Investment properties – – 174,006 174,006 Derivative financial instruments – 116 – 116           Total assets – 116 174,006 174,122           Liabilities Derivative financial instruments – 499 – 499 Non-controlling interest put option obligation – – 630 630           Total liabilities – 499 630 1,129           There were no transfers between these three levels during the year (2017: Nil). The Groups policy is to recognise transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels as of the date of the  event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. (ii) Fair value disclosure The carrying values less impairment provision of trade receivables and the carrying values of trade payables,  accruals, bank deposits and short-term interest bearing liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair  values due to their short-term maturities. The fair values of long-term interest bearing liabilities are based on market prices or are estimated by using  the expected future payments discounted at market interest rates.  101 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 5  Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires the use of certain critical  accounting estimates. It also requires the Manager to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups  accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors,  including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by  definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of  causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year are discussed  below. (a) Investment Properties The fair value of each investment property is individually determined at each reporting date by independent  valuer based on a market value assessment. The valuers have relied on the discounted cash flow analysis,  income capitalisation approach and residual approach as their primary methods, cross-referenced to the direct  comparison method where applicable. Details of the valuation techniques and assumptions have been disclosed  in Note 15. (b) Financial Instruments In estimating the fair value of its financial instruments, the Group uses valuation techniques such as dealer quotes  and discounted cash flows. The Group also makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at  each reporting date. (c) Long-term Incentive Schemes Valuation The value of awards granted is estimated based on valuation techniques and assumptions on unit prices,  outstanding length of the awards, distribution pay-out rates and other market conditions, which management  considers as representing the best estimate of the value of the liability for such awards at the reporting date. The  carrying value of the long-term incentive schemes awards is reviewed every six months and is independently  valued by external valuer at least annually. (d) Non-controlling Interest Put Option Obligation The fair value of the non-controlling interest put option obligation is determined at each reporting date by  independent valuer based on a market value assessment. The valuer has used discounted cash flow as the  valuation technique. The valuation is based on various assumptions, including the estimated fair value of the equity  interests of the non-wholly owned subsidiary at the expected time of exercise of the put option, the expected time  of exercise itself, the cash flow and the discount rate used. Details of the valuation technique and assumptions  have been disclosed in Note 24.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 102 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 5  Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements (Continued) (e) Goodwill Goodwill is recorded as a separate asset and it is subject to an annual impairment test. The tests undertaken as at  31 March 2017 and 2018 indicated that no impairment provision was necessary. For the purposes of impairment tests, the recoverable amount of goodwill is referenced to the cash flow projections  inherent in the valuation of investment properties by the principal valuer. Judgement was required to determine  key assumptions for adoption in the cash flow projections, such as income and expenditure growth rates, discount  rate, income capitalisation rate, etc. The income and expenditure growth rates were driven by the forecast  occupancy rate, reversion rate, progress on asset enhancement projects and inflation. The discount rates and  income capitalisation rates stated in Note 15 were used in the cash flow projections. 6  Revenue Revenue recognised during the year comprises: 2018 2017 HK$M HK$M       Rentals – Retail and commercial properties 7,554 6,914 – Car parks 2,046 1,940       9,600 8,854       Other revenue – Air conditioning service fees 375 370 – Other property related revenue 48 31       423 401       Total revenue 10,023 9,255       Leases with tenants provide for monthly base rent and recovery of certain outgoings.

The Manager held discussions with the principal valuer and reviewed all significant inputs used by the principal  valuer. Discussions of the valuation processes and results at each reporting date are held between the Manager  and the principal valuer.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 112 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 15 Investment Properties (Continued) (c)  Valuation Techniques The principal valuer has relied on the income capitalisation approach, discounted cash flow analysis and residual  approach as its primary approaches, cross-referenced to the direct comparison method. The income capitalisation approach is based on the capitalisation of the current passing rental income and  potential reversionary income of the property from the date of valuation at appropriate investment yields to  arrive at the capital value. The appropriate adjustments/deductions for rent-free period, ongoing vacancy voids/ marketing periods and non-recoverable expenses for the vacant space have been allowed. The discounted cash flow analysis requires periodic net cash flows to be forecasted over the life of the investment  and discounted at a risk-adjusted opportunity cost of capital to arrive at a present value. The discounted cash  flow analysis takes into consideration the yearly net cash flows after deductions for expenditure, and having  regard to the assumptions made relating to rental growth projections, vacancies, rent frees, replacement reserve,  non-recoverable outgoings and leasing costs. The discounted cash flow analysis incorporates an assumed 10- year holding period and the reversionary value in Year Eleven, discounted by an appropriate discount rate to  derive at a net present value. The residual valuation method involves firstly the assessment of gross development value, which is the value  of the proposed development, as if completed, at the date of valuation. Estimated outstanding cost of the  development including costs of construction, professional fee, finance costs and associated costs, plus an  allowance for developers risk and profit are deducted from the gross development value. The resultant figure is  the residual value. The three valuation techniques are summarised in the below table with their respective significant unobservable  inputs. Significant unobservable inputs Relationship of significant  unobservable inputs to fair value       Income capitalisation approach Completed properties – retail and   commercial properties and   car parks i)  Capitalisation rate (Blended):  3.00% – 4.75%   (2017: 3.00% – 5.30%) The higher the capitalisation rate,   the lower the fair value. ii) Net passing income per annum:  HK$0.5M – HK$388.0M   (2017: HK$0.5M – HK$332.4M) The higher the net passing income,  the higher the fair value. Discounted cash flow analysis Completed properties – retail and   commercial properties and   car parks i)  Discount rate: 7.25% – 7.75%  (2017: 7.25% – 7.50%) The higher the discount rate,   the lower the fair value. ii) Net passing income per annum:  HK$0.5M – HK$388.0M   (2017: HK$0.5M – HK$332.4M) The higher the net passing income,  the higher the fair value. Residual approach Property under development Estimated development costs and  allowance for developers risk and  profit The higher the estimated  development costs and allowance for  developers risk and profit, the lower  the fair value.       The investment properties are included in Level 3 (2017: Level 3) of the fair value hierarchy.  113 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 15 Investment Properties (Continued) (d) Restriction of the REIT Code Link acquired 77 Hoi Bun Road in Kowloon East for commercial development, 700 Nathan Road in Mong Kok  and Metropolitan Plaza in Guangzhou, the completion of which were on 23 February 2015, 15 April 2016 and  11 May 2017 respectively.

After its expiry, no further awards shall be granted under the 2007 LTI Plan. Nonetheless,  awards granted and accepted prior to its expiry but yet to vest shall continue to have effect and be governed by the  rules of the 2007 LTI Plan. Under the 2007 LTI Plan, the Manager might grant three types of awards – restricted unit award, unit option and  conditional cash award – to directors and key employees of the Manager. No unit option has ever been granted under  2007 LTI Plan since its adoption up till expiry. For those restricted unit awards granted with performance goals, the eventual numbers of new units to be issued to  the relevant grantees on vesting are linked to the performance of Link in terms of total Unitholders return (TUR) and  net property income (NPI) or certain vesting conditions. Conditional cash awards are granted in conjunction with  restricted unit awards, bestowing upon each grantee a conditional right to receive a cash payment representing an  amount equivalent to the aggregate of the distributions during the vesting period. During the year, the Group issued 1,561,196 units (2017: 1,600,140 units) for restricted unit awards which have vested  in accordance with the 2007 LTI Plan. 2017 LTI Scheme On 10 July 2017, Link adopted a new long-term incentive scheme (the 2017 LTI Scheme). Under the 2017 LTI  Scheme, the Manager may grant restricted unit awards and conditional cash awards to directors of the Manager and  key employees of the Group. During the year, certain directors and employees of the Manager were granted restricted unit awards and conditional  cash awards at nil monetary consideration under the 2017 LTI Scheme. The restricted unit awards granted under  the 2017 LTI Scheme, in general, will vest approximately two to three years from the date of grant. Under the 2017  LTI Scheme, units will be purchased in the grantees favour from open stock market to satisfy restricted units awards  vested. For those restricted unit awards granted with performance goals, the eventual numbers of units to be  purchased in each grantees favour upon vesting are linked to the performance of Link based on the TUR, NPI or  certain vesting conditions. Conditional cash awards were also granted in conjunction with the restricted unit awards,  bestowing upon each grantee a conditional right to receive a cash payment representing an amount equivalent to the  aggregate of the distributions during the vesting period.  117 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 20 Long-term Incentive Schemes Provision (Continued) During the vesting period, a liability is recognised representing the estimated value of the awards granted under both  the 2007 LTI Plan and the 2017 LTI Scheme and the portion of the vesting period expired as at the reporting date.  The value of the awards was estimated at the reporting date by Towers Watson Hong Kong Limited, an independent  external valuer based on valuation techniques and assumptions on unit prices, outstanding length of the awards,  distribution pay-out rates and other market conditions, if appropriate. The change in value of the outstanding awards  was charged to the consolidated income statement. In the event that the vesting conditions are not met, the amount  previously accrued will be written back accordingly.

These valuation  techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all  significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. (ii) The fair values of cross currency swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts are calculated by reference to the present values of the  estimated future cash flows, taking into account market observable yield curves and forward exchange rates at each reporting date. Cross  currency swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts are included in Level 2 (2017: Level 2) of the fair value hierarchy.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 120 Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 22 Derivative Financial Instruments (Continued) The Group uses cross currency swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts (swapping from foreign currencies  to Hong Kong Dollars) to minimise its exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in  relation to its interest bearing liabilities. The fair values of these cross currency swap contracts and interest rate swap  contracts are classified as non-current items should the remaining maturities of the hedged items extend for more  than 12 months. Any change in fair values of the effective portion of the cash flow hedges in relation to interest rate  swap contracts is recognised in the hedging reserve. Any change in fair values of the fair value hedges in relation to  interest rate swap contracts and any change in fair value of cross currency swap contracts are recognised directly in  the consolidated income statement. A net amount of HK$284 million (2017: HK$310 million) had been credited to the  hedging reserve during the year as further set out in Note 26. As at 31 March 2018, the derivative financial instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges have, in effect, provided the  Group with an average fixed interest rate period of 4.3 years on HK$10,000 million borrowings (2017: 5.3 years on  HK$7,000 million borrowings) from the reporting date. The notional principal amount and the weighted average fixed  interest rate of the outstanding floating rates to fixed rates interest rate swap contracts as at 31 March 2018 were  HK$10,000 million (2017: HK$7,000 million) and 1.74% (2017: 1.82%) respectively. The notional principal amount of  the outstanding floating rates to floating rates interest rate swap contracts as at 31 March 2018 was HK$6,500 million  (2017: HK$7,000 million). As at 31 March 2018, the derivative financial instruments qualifying as fair value hedges have, in effect, converted part  of the Group borrowings into Hong Kong Dollars fixed rate and floating rates interest bearing liabilities. The notional  principal amounts of the outstanding cross currency swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts qualifying as  fair value hedges as at 31 March 2018 were HK$7,753 million (2017: HK$7,753 million) and HK$1,910 million (2017:  HK$1,910 million) respectively. Gains and losses on interest rate swap contracts recognised in the hedging reserve (Note 26) as at 31 March 2018 will  be released to the consolidated income statement.  121 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements 23 Deferred Tax Liabilities Deferred taxation is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method.

For the purpose of funding the commercial development, Nan Fung, a non-controlling interest of the Project Company has  contributed cash in proportion to the shareholding ratio to the Project Company. The amount due to non-controlling interest is unsecured,  interest bearing at an effective interest rate of 2.6% (2017: 2.6%), has no fixed repayment term and is not repayable within one year. Such  amount including any accrued interest will be repaid from the Project Companys surplus cash after meeting its payment obligations. (ii) Pursuant to the shareholders agreement, Nan Fung has a right to exercise a put option to require Link to purchase all the issued shares Nan  Fung holds in the Project Company at the then fair market value, after the second anniversary of the completion of the commercial property  development and certain conditions have been satisfied. The non-controlling interest put option obligation was recognised as a financial  liability based on a valuation performed by Crowe Horwath First Trust Appraisal Pte Ltd, an independent firm of professional qualified  valuers. The valuer has used discounted cash flow as the valuation technique. The valuation is based on various assumptions and calculated  by reference to a number of unobservable inputs, including the estimated fair value of the equity interests of the Project Company at the  expected time of exercise of the put option, the expected time of exercise itself, the cash flow and the discount rate used. The Manager held  discussions with the valuer and reviewed all significant inputs used. Discussions of the valuation processes and results at each reporting  date are held between the Manager and the valuer. Fair value of the put option obligation is included in Level 3 (2017: Level 3) of the fair  value hierarchy. If the estimated fair value of the equity interests of the Project Company at the time of exercise is higher, the fair value of the  put option obligation would also be higher. If the expected time of exercise is later or if the discount rate is higher, then the fair value of the  put option obligation would be lower. The movement of non-controlling interest put option obligation during the year is as follows: 2018 2017 HK$M HK$M       At 1 April 630 580 Recognised in the consolidated income statement: – Fair value loss (Note 9) 70 50       At 31 March 700 630       25 Units in Issue 2018 2017 Number of units Number of units       At 1 April 2,213,002,276 2,243,148,136 Units bought back for cancellation (64,504,500) (31,746,000) Units issued under the 2007 LTI Plan 1,561,196 1,600,140       At 31 March 2,150,058,972 2,213,002,276       Pursuant to the general mandate granted to the Manager by the Unitholders, the Manager (on behalf of Link) bought  back a total of 64,504,500 units (2017: 31,746,000 units) at an aggregate price of HK$4,349 million (2017: HK$1,697  million).

Basis of Valuation Unless otherwise stated, our valuation has been prepared in accordance with HKIS Valuation Standards 2017 published by  The Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors (HKIS), the International Valuation Standards 2017 published by the International  Valuation Standards Council (IVSC) and the RICS Valuation – Global Standards 2017 published by the Royal Institution of  Chartered Surveyors (RICS) subject to variation to meet local established law. Unless otherwise stated, our valuations are  undertaken as External Valuers as defined in the relevant Valuation Standards. Our valuation of the Properties is made on the basis of the Market Value as defined by IVSC and adopted by HKIS and  RICS, set out as: the estimated amount for which an asset or liability should exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a  willing seller in an arms-length transaction after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably,  prudently and without compulsion. Our valuation services have been executed in accordance with our Quality Assurance System, accredited by HKQAA via  ISO 9001: 2015 and our report prepared with reference to the assumptions, definitions and limiting conditions as set out in  our General Principles of Valuation. Measurements All measurements are carried out in accordance with the Code of Measuring Practice booklet published by the HKIS. To  suit the local practice, we declare our departure from the RICS property measurement published by RICS in May 2015.  Unless otherwise stated, we do not physically measure the actual property or verify the floor areas provided to us, unless we  specifically agree in writing to do so, although we make reference to the registered floor plans if available. Valuation Methodologies We have relied on the Income Capitalisation Approach and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis as the primary  approaches for our valuation of the Hong Kong Completed Properties and the PRC Properties, cross-referenced to the  Direct Comparison Approach. For the Property under Development, we have carried out the valuation by using the Residual  Approach. For the Property under Renovation, we have primarily carried out the valuation by using Income Capitalisation  Approach, and cross-checked with Direct Comparison Approach. Income Capitalisation Approach The income capitalisation approach is based on the capitalisation of the current passing rental income and potential  reversionary income of the property from the date of valuation at appropriate investment yields to arrive at the capital  value. The appropriate adjustments/deductions for rent-free period, ongoing vacancy voids/marketing periods and non- recoverable expenses for the vacant space have been allowed. The income capitalisation approach can more accurately reflect these property specific factors by utilising various specific  assumptions which have been derived via analysis of market evidence. The ability to apply these assumptions in the  income capitalisation approach is by far more appropriate for valuing an investment property where investors emphasis on  delivering returns is of paramount importance.  133 Governance, Disclosures and Financial Statements Valuation Report The ranges of capitalisation rates adopted in our valuations are as follows: Hong Kong Completed Properties Retail:  3.0% – 4.2% Car Park:  3.5% – 4.8% Blended:  3.0% – 4.7% Property under Renovation Whole Property: 3.0% The PRC Properties Office:  4.25% Retail:  4.50% – 4.75% Car Park:  4.25% – 4.75% Discounted Cash Flow Analysis The DCF analysis requires periodic net cash flows to be forecasted over the life of the investment and discounted at a risk- adjusted opportunity cost of capital to arrive at a present value. The DCF takes into consideration the yearly net cash flows after deductions for expenditure, and having regard to the  assumptions made relating to rental growth projections, vacancies, rent frees, replacement reserve, non-recoverable  outgoings and leasing costs. The DCF analysis incorporates an assumed 10-year holding period and the reversionary value  in year eleven, discounted by an appropriate discount rate to derive a net present value. Direct Comparison Approach Direct Comparison Approach is the most widely used method of valuation and is based on comparing the Properties to be  valued directly with other comparable properties which recently changed hands or leased. These premises are generally  located in the surrounding areas or in another market which is comparable to the Properties. However, because of the  heterogeneous nature of real estate properties, appropriate adjustments are usually required to allow for any qualitative and  quantitative differences that may affect the price/rental likely to be achieved by the Properties under consideration. Factors such as tenants covenants, trade mix are difficult to be quantified in the overall unit value of the comparables.  Furthermore, good comparables may not be readily available in the market. In the light of the characteristics of the  Properties, we have therefore placed more weighting on the reliance on the Income Capitalisation Approach and DCF  analysis in arriving our valuation conclusion. Residual Method The residual valuation method involves firstly the assessment of Gross Development Value, which is the value of the  proposed development, as if completed, at the date of valuation. Estimated outstanding cost of the development including  costs of construction, professional fee, finance costs and associated costs, plus an allowance for developers risk and profit  are deducted from the gross development value. The resultant figure is the residual value. The residual method is subject to a number of hypothetical assumptions. A slight change in one or more of the assumptions  would have a significant impact on the conclusion reached. In general terms, it is noted that the residual method is most  sensitive to changes in sales price of the completed development. Valuation Reconciliation The results of the relevant valuation methods will be reconciled and the assessed value will be analysed in terms of initial  passing yield and internal rate of return and on a dollar per square foot or square metre basis. Valuation Assumptions The valuations have been made on the assumption that Link REIT sells the property interests in the open market without the  benefit of deferred-terms contracts, leasebacks, joint ventures, management agreements or any similar arrangements which  could serve to affect the values of the property interests.  Link Real Estate Investment Trust  Annual Report 2017/2018 134 Valuation Report Valuation Report No allowance has been made in our valuations for any charges, mortgages or amounts owing on the Properties nor for any  expenses or taxation which may be incurred in effecting sales. Unless otherwise stated, it is assumed that the Properties are  free of encumbrances, restrictions and outgoings of an onerous nature which could affect their capital values. Title Investigation and Encumbrances We have been provided with copies of the title documents relating to the PRC Properties. As per the information provided  by LAML, as at the Valuation Date, all the Properties have obtained their legal titles. For Properties located at Hong Kong,  we have conducted land searches of the properties with the Land Registry. However, we have not examined the original  documents to verify ownership or to ascertain the existence of any lease amendments, which may not appear on the copies  handed to us. All documents and leases have been used for reference only and all dimensions, measurements and areas  are approximate. Site Investigation We have not carried out any investigations on site in order to determine the suitability of ground conditions and services etc.  for future redevelopment, nor did we undertake archaeological, ecological or environmental surveys. Our valuation is on  the basis that these aspects are satisfactory and that where developments are contemplated, no extraordinary expenses or  delays will be incurred during the construction period due to these, or to archaeological or ecological matters. In the course  of our assessments, we have assumed that no contamination affecting the Properties or the neighbouring land. However,  should it be established subsequently that contamination exists at the Properties or on any neighbouring land, or that the  premises have been or are being put to any contaminative use, we reserve the right to adjust the values reported herein. Plant and Machinery Our valuation normally includes all plant and machinery that form part of the building services installations. However,  process plant, machinery and equipment which may have been installed wholly in connection with the occupiers  commercial processes, together with furniture and furnishings, tenants fixtures and fittings are excluded in our valuation. Car Parking Spaces We are advised that for those Properties where temporary/permanent planning approvals or waivers are required for letting  of surplus car parks to non-residents, these have already been or are in the process of being obtained from the relevant  Government authorities. Telecommunication Facilities We have assumed that all telecommunication facilities at the Properties are permitted and that all necessary approvals have  been obtained from the relevant authorities. Acknowledgement of Information We have relied to a considerable extent on the information provided by the LAML and have accepted advice given to us on  such matters as identification of the Properties, planning approvals, statutory notices, easements, tenure, occupation, floor  plans, floor areas, tenancy schedule and all other relevant matters. In the course of our valuation, we have also made reference to inter alia, the following information provided by LAML: Hong Kong Properties 1.

Human Rights Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2 make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Labour Principle 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to  collective bargaining; Principle 4 the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5 the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6 the eliminate of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Environment Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8 undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.
