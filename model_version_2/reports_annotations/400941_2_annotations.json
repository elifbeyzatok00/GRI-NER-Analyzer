      "2    INDEX    1. Message from the MD & CEO                3  3. YES BANKs Sustainability Approach              8  2. UNGC Reconciliation with GRI G4              10           3    1. FROM THE MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEOS DESK    Dear Valued Stakeholders,   I am pleased to share with you YES  BANKs Sustainability Report for FY  2016-17, titled Leveraging A.R.T for  Glocal Sustainable Impact.   YES BANK is the first Indian bank, and  among the first in the Indian corporate  sector, to release a Sustainability Report  based on the GRI Standards, the latest  global  framework  for  sustainability  reporting  by  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative (GRI).   In line with the Banks strategic vision  and objectives, the Report continues to be  aligned with the Integrated Reporting  framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council, and includes the SDG  Compass, as the Banks vision and objectives are firmly aligned with select Sustainable  Development Goals.   YES BANK firmly believes that in todays increasingly inter-connected world, the solutions  to our shared challenges and ambitions require a collective glocal approach. In order to  ensure the most optimal developmental and market based solutions, the Bank has an  adopted an innovative and collaborate approach towards stakeholder engagement through  its ART (Alliances, Relationships and Technology) philosophy. ART has enabled the bank to  deepen the impact of its sustainability initiatives at national and international levels.   The launch of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the transition to a low carbon  economy unleashed a series of challenges and opportunities, particularly for the Banking  sector. United Nations estimates that SDGs require USD 90 trillion investment till 2030, with  India alone requiring USD 2.5 trillion to achieve its committed climate targets by 2030. While  changes associated with transition to a lower-carbon economy present unprecedented risks,  they also create significant opportunities for sustainable finance, enabled by climate policy  and new technologies.  Additionally, Indian economy in particular is faced with the Ds of Disruption —  Demographics, a young workforce seeking employment opportunities, Deregulation, in  Banking & financial services, as also other sectors, and Digitization.  Any Disruption brings  with it both opportunities and risks.   Given the foregoing, Responsible and innovative banking underpinned by new age  technology innovations (across financial services, health, education, agriculture, energy and  others) has emerged as one of the key strategic factors.  CSR & Sustainability: Ideas in Action     4    YES BANK has been at the forefront of creating a market for delivering innovative financial  solutions, having hardwired Responsible Banking within its core business strategy. YES  BANK is also one of the few organizations in the country who have taken clear, time bound  targets towards climate action.   Towards the same, the Bank has linked CSR and sustainable development with stakeholder  value creation through innovation. It has further woven sustainability principles into the  core business strategy and operations of the bank, thus expanding its implementation  capabilities and alliances pan India.   During the reporting period, the Banks global engagement on key sustainability topics,  such as green financing expanded significantly, and it was recognized as a thought leader on  noteworthy national and international platforms.   I am pleased to share that YES BANK was the only Indian financial institution to be invited  to speak at the UN High-Level Thematic Debate on financing the SDGs, at the United  Nations (UN) headquarters in New York in April 2016, which had participation from key  Member States and Observers, UN agencies such as the UNDP and UNEP, central banks,  and multilateral development banks. Recognized for its expertise on sustainable finance, the  bank was invited to be a part of several international platforms on climate action and green  & SDG financing, including those organized by World Bank, G20 and the United Nations  (UN). These included particularly influential platforms like the UN Private Sector Forum at  the UN General Assembly in September 2016, which had a cross-section of experts from  public, private, and non-governmental sectors to discuss and find solutions to the main  challenges faced in accelerating and strengthening implementation of all SDGs, particularly  in the areas of data and monitoring, financing, clean energy, poverty alleviation and  inequities, infrastructure, and oceans.   Significantly, in November 2016, at the COP22 in Marrakech, Morocco, the Banks CSR  project, Say YES to Sustainable MSMEs in India was released and showcased as a Role  Model case study by the World Resources Institute, and was exhibited at the India pavilion.  The study highlights YES BANKs positive contribution in reducing greenhouse gas  emissions in the MSME (Micro Small & Medium Enterprises) sector through its CSR  interventions.   YES BANK continued to be a signatory to key protocols focused on climate action and  sustainable development, including the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative  (UNEP FI), Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, UN Global Compact, CDP, Natural Capital  Finance Alliance (earlier the Natural Capital Declaration), and is member of key national  and global alliances including the India GHG Program, TERI Council for Business  Sustainability, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.   I am pleased to share that YES BANK has pledged GBP 1 million to the London School of  Economics and Political Science (LSE) to support the IG Patel Chair – named in honour of  the former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India and former Director of LSE. The chair will  be held initially by Professor Lord Nicholas Stern and would also support the work of the  LSE India Observatory towards developing and enhancing research and programmes  around Indias economy, politics and society. This agreement has led to YES BANK joining     5    LSEs Benefactors Board, the highest accolade bestowed upon those who make  transformative philanthropic commitments to the School.   In line with YES BANKs commitments made at the COP21 in October 2015 towards  mobilizing USD 5 Billion for climate action in India by 2020, the Bank financed 1,158 MW in  clean energy sectors during the year, bringing it closer to achieving its stated target.   During the reporting period, YES BANK successfully raised INR 330 crores through an issue  of a 7 year Green Infrastructure Bond to FMO, the Dutch development bank, on a private  placement basis. This was YES BANKs third green bond issuance over the past 2 years,  having raised an aggregate of INR 1,645 crores in green infrastructure bonds.  In July 2016, under a World Bank initiative, YES BANK became the first Financial Institution  in India to sign an MoU with SIDBI for promoting energy efficiency in the MSME sector by  creating a Partial Risk Sharing Facility (PRSF).   Setting benchmarks in Reporting & Disclosures  I firmly believe that reporting on climate change impacts would help make markets more  efficient, and the economy more stable and resilient, through transparency. Towards this,  YES BANK continued to mainstream Triple Bottom Line accounting and reporting in India,  and is a member of the <IR> Lab India. To promote sustainability disclosures within Indian  Industry, the Bank hosted the official launches of the latest GRI Standards in Mumbai and  New Delhi.   In order to further foster transparency and disclosures, in 2015, YES BANK became the first  Indian bank to be included in the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) –  Emerging Markets Index, and is included in the Index for the second consecutive year in  2016, continuing to be the only Indian bank in the DJSI.   In a significant achievement, YES BANK was assigned an ESG rating of AAA by MSCI ESG  Research, assessing the Bank on pertinent Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance  parameters. The assessment acknowledged the Banks efforts to expand financial inclusion  driven by technological innovations and integrating environmental and social risks into its  credit risk assessment framework.   YES BANK is the first Indian Banking signatory to the UN Global Compact, and as  signatory, I reaffirm the Banks commitment and support to the Compacts Ten Principles.  The Bank continues to report at the GC Advanced level on its Communication on Progress  for 2017.   This year, YES BANK became the first bank globally to migrate to the new ISO 14001:2015  certification. This extraordinary achievement is backed by a new Environmental  Management Policy, robust process driven approaches and initiatives, and a comprehensive  e-learning module for employees. The certification now covers the Banks 444 Metro- Urban  branches and 3 corporate offices.   Towards mainstreaming Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) best practices across  its value chain, the Bank formulated its Supplier Code of Conduct and organized a  Sustainable Procurement Workshop for its strategic suppliers. Going forward, the Bank     6    intends to extend the adoption of the Code across all its suppliers and continue to conduct  such workshops.   ART of Digital Banking  I am pleased to advise that YES BANK has emerged as a leader in embracing the Digital  Banking ecosystem by adopting the A.R.T model. YES BANK is also progressively evolving  to provide Banking as a Platform and as a Service. In the reporting period, the Bank  launched the YES FINTECH business accelerator program for fintech startups, designed to  support and nurture disruptive solutions in financial services delivery, receiving 753  applications for the 15 week program of which 12 startups have been selected for the first  cohort.   In line with Digital India, the Bank, in its efforts to broaden the base of digital payments  infrastructure in India, launched SIMsePAY, a unique innovation based on the frugal sim- sleeve technology that allows any account holder to avail mobile banking services without  the need for internet or smart phones.   Banking the Next Billion   In its 13 years of achieving institutional excellence, YES BANK has maintained a steadfast  focus on inclusive growth and banking for the Next Billion. Through award-winning  products and services that leverage simple business models to impact the Bottom of the  Pyramid, the Bank has been positively impacting millions of individuals directly and  indirectly in rural and urban India.   The banks CSR programs continue to be guided at the highest level by its Board-approved  CSR Policy, and focus on Livelihood and Water Security, Skill Development and  Environment Sustainability. YES COMMUNITY, the Banks unique branch-led community  engagement program, touched 20.2 lakh lives in 2016-17, through its branches in every state  and union territory of India. The Banks Livelihood and Water Security program provided  access to safe and clean drinking water to more than 3.66 crore lives in FY 2016-17. The  Banks interventions in the MSME sector on environmental sustainability impacted 2,229  MSME units and 10,425 workers in 11 states.   During the year, YES BANK launched an innovative and transformational, blended finance  project in pilot mode that works towards promoting livelihood security among 600 under- privileged women salt farmers in the Little Rann of Kutch region while significantly  lowering their emissions footprint. The first phase of the pilot initiative, highlighted in this  Report, demonstrates how innovative structures can be leveraged towards facilitating  mainstream finance for inclusion and scale.   YES BANK has become also the first private sector company to enter into a CSR  commitment with the National Highways Authority of India under its Adopt a Green  Highway program. As part of the commitment, the Bank would develop and maintain a  green corridor along the Mumbai-Nashik highway in Maharashtra.   YES! i am the CHANGE, the social film making challenge launched by YES  FOUNDATION, YES BANKs social development arm, emerged as the worlds largest social  film movement in 2015. I am proud to share that the movement has achieved unparalleled     7    success, with participation of over 13 lakh individual participants comprising 3.24 lakh  teams, submitting over 29,000 films, and the launch of a new initiative, the YES  FOUNDATION Social Film Grant, in FY 2016-17.   I am pleased to share that YES BANK is now backed by over 20,000 Professional Bankers,  driven by a YES BANK culture that, encourages open and honest Communication,  strengthens Connect between employees and community, supports Career development and  shows that it Cares as an organization. During the reporting period, the Bank significantly  enhanced its capabilities through the adoption of HR Digitization, including big data,  mobility, social media, gamification and cloud computing. The YES SCHOOL of  BANKING has become the first and only Learning & Development function to receive the  dual certification of ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 29990:2010 in the Indian banking industry.   It is a matter of significant pride that YES BANK continues to be recognized in India and  across the world for its sector-leading work towards sustainable development, financial  inclusion, and innovation in banking & finance. Among its recognitions received during the  reporting period, YES BANK won the Euromoney Award for Asias Best Bank for CSR, the  Innovative Bond Structure of the Year by Environmental Finance magazine, and the Award  for Most Effective Domestic Community Investment by the Ethical Corporation.   As the Bank moves towards actualizing its vision of Building the Finest Quality Bank of the  World in India by 2025, it remains committed to achieving Size and Scale as a Large High  Quality Bank in India underpinned by the Responsible Banking ethos, with an imperative  on deepening Mind Share and growing our Market Share.   Thank you.   Sincerely,     RANA KAPOOR   Managing Director & CEO         8    2. YES BANKs Sustainability Approach            Leveraging A.R.T for Glocal Sustainable Impact  In an increasingly connected world, no business remains a silo, and the solutions to todays  challenges and ambitions require a collective, glocalized approach. Technology is emerging  as the go-to answer for developmental and market-based solutions, and is intrinsically  linking economies, societies and the environment into a common pathway of sustainable  development.  The massive strides in Information and communication technologies offer the  corporate sector an unprecedented opportunity to advance development towards achieving  the worlds socio-economic and environmental goals.   YES BANK believes that collaborations yield results and, as a public trust institution, play to  its strengths.  To a large degree, YES BANKs success in driving positive impact could be  accredited to the opportunities presented by its stakeholder engagements and partnerships.  With a greater understanding of the needs and issues of its stakeholders, YES BANK has  been able to establish the right alliances and amplify its sustainability impact both within  and outside the organization, leading to the realization of first-to-many sustainability  initiatives.  Building Alliances for Glocal Impact   Through its proactive approach and extensive engagements with its stakeholders, YES  BANK has helped cement strong community relations and leveraged its partnerships with  national and international institutions, multi-lateral organizations, academia and corporate  peers to bring a positive change to the lives of vulnerable or marginalized communities, lend  its voice to policy and regulatory action on pertinent issues, drive investments towards the  sunrise sectors of the economy, and innovate to bring Indias unbanked and under-banked  population into the formal economy. As a signatory to key global coalitions and alliances,  YES BANK has emerged as a strong voice on key sustainability topics.   Driving Glocal Climate Action  YES BANK believes that climate change is an opportunity for the global economy to shift  onto a pathway of low-carbon and inclusive growth. Through its Responsible Banking ethos,  YES BANK has been addressing the low carbon transformation by adopting a 360 degree  approach to mainstreaming climate action.  Partnering for Positive Community Impact   The magnitude of developmental challenges in India covering 1.3 billion people is  significant, and would require breakthrough innovative thinking and developing large scale  solutions that are sustainable and scalable. YES BANK believes that participatory  YES BANK believes that as a financial institution, there is an inherent need to play a leading role in  Indias development. In line with its Responsible Banking ethos, YES BANK has been able to establish  the right alliances and amplify its sustainability impact both within and outside the organization,  leading to the realization of first-to-many sustainability initiatives.     9    approaches enable the power of coalition and drive accelerated social impact that can secure  the most basic needs for the vast majority of the population.   Through its Responsible Banking ethos, YES BANK focuses on creating shared value for its  stakeholder spectrum through social, economic and environmental interventions, guided by  its four pronged approach framework to Promote, Invest, Engage, and Collaborate &  Monitor.           YES BANK was selected into the prestigious  Dow Jones Sustainability Indices – Emerging  Markets Index, for the second year in a row in  2016. The Index comprises of 95 companies  from 14 emerging economies, which were  selected after a rigorous assessment on over  600 data points in the Economic, Social and  Environmental dimensions.     YES BANK assigned AAA rating by  MSCI ESG Research    In 2016, YES BANK was assigned a AAA  rating by MSCI ESG Research, highlighting the  Banks key strengths in financial product safety  and corporate governance. The Report also  highlighted that there are no significant risks at  the Bank from an ESG perspective. The Rating  is an endorsement of the Banks 360 degree risk  framework that integrates ESG factors into its  overall risk assessment framework.     YES BANK welcomes the Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) adopted at the historic UN Sustainable Development  Summit in September, 2015. The Bank firmly believes that the  role of the private sector would be critical towards achieving  these global goals, given its ability to mobilize finances,  foreign direct investments and social impact investments.  YES BANK believes that it has clear alignment with the SDGs,  and has focused on mapping its organizational activities with  the pertinent Goals, and reports its performance in alignment  with the SDG Compass. In a significant achievement, the  Bank was featured as a case study in the SDG Matrix, a joint  publication by UN Global Compact & KPMG highlighting  global financial sector action.   The SDG Compass maps the Banks GRI based reporting with  the SDGs and is included in the report.      10    2.
