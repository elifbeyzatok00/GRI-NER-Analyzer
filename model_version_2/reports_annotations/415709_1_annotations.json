However, our underlying business performance was   encouraging. We delivered a solid organic growth of 2.4%,  stable operating margin of 5.7%, high cash conversion of  104%, and strong free cash flow of DKK 2.7bn. While net  profit (adjusted) ended lower for the year, this was mainly  driven by one-off non-cash items and discontinued operations.  Our underlying earnings power remains strong and as such we  propose an ordinary dividend of DKK 7.70 per share.  As in 2017, we continue to implement our growth strategy  with large key accounts in 2018. The phasing in and phasing  out of significant contracts may introduce some volatility in  organic growth and operating margin during this transitional  year, but long-term trends are positive. We remain confident  in the ISS Way strategy – as evidenced by recent contract wins  such as Deutsche Telekom and LEGO Group and the five-year  extension to our partnership with Barclays.     Our focus on customers At ISS, we support our customers purpose by delivering great  service moments. Our strategy is to provide bespoke solutions  that make facilities run smoothly, whether they belong to key  account or specialised services customers. For those in need of  a single point of contact, we offer Integrated Facility Services (IFS),   which eliminate the need for customers to manage a whole host   of subcontractors. Another key strength is our ability to use glo- bal scale to ensure operational consistency across facilities, offer   more cost-effective solutions, and introduce innovative concepts   and tools that will add even more value to our customers. Customer satisfaction serves as a key indicator of this strategys  success, and we regularly measure their engagement and loyalty.   In 2017, our customer Net Promoter Score increased again (to  44 from 43 in 2016), making it the sixth consecutive year of  improvement. We have also been recognised publicly for our  focus on serving customers well: for the fifth year in a row, ISS  achieved the highest possible rating on the International Asso- ciation of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) Global Outsourcing  Top 100 list – the industrys highest accolade.   We have signed several new key account customer agreements  this year, including the largest in ISS history: an IFS contract with   Deutsche Telekom from 2019 to 2029, covering approximately  9,000 sites across Germany, more than 6,000 employees and  about 4% of Group revenue. In addition, we have extended our   partnerships with Hewlett Packard Enterprise until 2021 (exclud- ing the business that was spun-off through DXC Technology and   HP Inc.) and Barclays until 2022. We also significantly expanded  our contract with the Danish Defence, which represents the  largest outsourced public facility services contract in Denmark.  Finally, we kicked off operations with biotech company Shire   in June 2017, a global agreement covering 23 countries. These  all exemplify the long-term relationships we aim to cultivate  with customers.    We focus on markets with significant future demand for facility  services, especially those of importance to our existing key   account customers. This has resulted in the divestments of  businesses of less strategic importance, including ISS Greece and  ISS Iceland. North America remains strategically important, and  in April 2017 we completed the acquisition of Guckenheimer,   a leading US catering company with an annual revenue of about   DKK 2,300 million and 3,200 employees. We also acquired the   Danish-based strategic workplace management consulting   firm SIGNAL, which strengthens our ability to support our key  account customers efforts to use the workplace as a strategic  tool to improve their business performance.   Investing in our people At ISS, we recognise that our 488,946 people around the world   are key to our success. Empowered employees make a differ- ence – through the Power of the Human Touch – by providing  outstanding service experiences that drive customer satisfac- tion. With that in mind, we have continued to invest in further  engaging and empowering our people, for example, through  our global training and career development programmes.  Our Global Management Trainee Programme now covers 26  countries, including in the Asia & Pacific region; another   435 key account managers completed our international Key   Account Manager Certification, joining the 1,000 alumni in   the programme so far; and we continued to roll out our Service  with a Human Touch programme, training more than 70,000  service professionals across more than 700 key accounts.  LETTER TO Our StakehOlderS As our 2017 performance demonstrates, we remain a resilient and growing business focused on serving our customers, extracting value from our strategy, and investing in  the long term.   3  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017 To measure our employee satisfaction, we survey our people  on their engagement and loyalty. In 2017, our employee Net  Promoter Score increased to 62 from 59 in 2016 – the fifth  consecutive year in which it has improved. The results provide  us with insights into how we can continually improve ISS as a  responsible and desirable employer. We are proud to see our  efforts recognised in places like Austria, Germany and Switzer- land, where ISS won best employer awards, as well as the UK,  where the Facility Management Brand Survey voted ISS Top  Service Provider as well as the FM company most people would  like to work for.   Responsible employer and partner We take great pride in being a socially responsible company   – for our people, our customers, and the communities in which  we operate. That is why we are proud that ISS has again been  recognised as a sustainability leader within our sector by achiev- ing a Bronze ranking in the 2017 Dow Jones Sustainability Index  (DJSI). The ranking places us in the top 10% of the 44 global  companies in the commercial services and supplies sector that  are assessed under the DJSI framework.  A safe working environment is a key part of our value proposi- tion to our people and our customers, and central to our cor-  porate responsibility strategy. We regretfully had six fatalities   in 2017. Despite these tragedies, our safety performance  measured by Lost Time Injury Frequency has improved by over  70% since 2010, and we continue to invest in measures that  strengthen our culture of workplace safety and safeguard all  our people.   Looking ahead to 2018 We enter 2018 with a solid customer portfolio, a strong pipe- line and firm confidence in our strategy. While current macro- economic conditions are generally supportive, we are also pre- pared for challenges in certain key markets. At the beginning  of the year, we simplified our management structure: several  operating units were consolidated into larger functions to bet- ter reflect our clear focus on customers. In the months ahead,  we will follow through on this strategic direction and continue  to extract the benefits of volume, concepts and talent for our  customers, empowering our people to keep doing what they  do best – delivering exceptional service with a human touch.  Thank you to all our 488,946 colleagues for the great work  they do every day to take us towards becoming the worlds  greatest service organisation.  Our commitments  We remain committed in our support of the United Nations   (UN) Global Compact as we have been since 1999. We conti- nuously align our strategy and operations with the ten prin- ciples of the UN framework. During the last three years, we  have specifically focused on strengthening our due diligence  systems in order to implement the Protect, respect and   remedy framework in accordance with UN Guiding Principles  on Business and Human Rights. In 2017, we revised our Corporate Responsibility Policy to show   our commitment to the UN Guiding Principles for Business and  Human Rights and, in terms of climate change, our commitment   to reducing greenhouse gas emissions related to our operations. New reporting guidelines This report reflects the new requirements of the Danish Finan- cial Statements Act concerning Corporate Responsibility report- ing. In ISS, we welcome the increased focus on transparency  and the principle of knowing and showing the full scope of  our non-financial responsibilities.  A safe working environ-  ment is a key part of our     value proposition to our   people and our customers,   and central to our corpo-  rate responsibility strategy  Jeff Gravenhorst, Group Chief Executive Officer Lord Allen of Kensington CBE, Chairman  4  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017 Mazal adiS Catering Services, ISS Israel    CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017  5 Vision  We are going to be the worlds  greatest service organisation Mission  Service performance facilitating  our customers purpose through  people empowerment strategy  Our strategy, the iSS Way, has choice- making at its core: \t clarity\ton\tthe\tcustomer\tsegments\t   we target, \t the\tservices\twe\tprovide,\tand \t the\tplaces\ton\tthe\tglobe\twhere\t   we provide them. Furthermore, through consolidation  and alignment of our capabilities,  our strategy drives the skill and scale  benefits of being a large, global  organisation.

We believe that respond-  ing to our main sustainability challenges is  the way to create long-term value for our  business, thus also for the global community.  Our contribution to sustainable development focuses on three  main areas which are reflected in the structure of the report:  \t People: Safe working conditions and human rights;  \t Planet: Reducing our impact on environment and climate;  \t Profit: Compliance with sound business standards.  This years report contains several new elements to further  explain our understanding of the engagement we have with,  and the impact we have on our stakeholders and on society  in general.  When the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were  launched in 2015, they expressed the need for a more resilient  and just international community. In ISS, we strongly support  this transformation. Due to our global business scope, we feel  compelled to contribute to solving some of the main sustain- ability challenges in the world today. On this page and the next  page we explain how we address the seven SDGs relevant to our  business. Sustainability principles are the foundation of future  growth. In ISS, we aim to lead by example in our industry.  We operate in unstable regions with, in some cases, limited legi-  slation and this provides challenges to our ISS global standards   and our aim to positively influence the markets where we are  present. Our approach to corporate responsibility has two ele- ments. We believe we have to take good care of our employees  and the environment. In addition, our value proposition obliges  us to ensure that we deliver great service to our customers and  that we protect their brand and reputation while working on  their sites. Our materiality assessment is key to the management of our responsibility across the entire value chain. The world is changing   constantly and as a global business we need to stay alert to  changes at many levels – from mega-trends to local culture. We  interviewed key internal stakeholders as part of this process.  The findings were validated and confirmed through internal  and external presentation. Our materiality assessment was   updated in 2017 and will be reviewed again next year. Please  see the materiality graphic on page 8. Our way of building a resilient business is based on our busi- ness fundamentals – vision, mission, values and strategy. This  is complemented by a guidance framework of policies, rules  and manuals with the signatory to the United Nations Global  Compact as a pivotal point. How we embed this mindset in the  business is described on page 7.

We  OUR APPROACH    CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017  7 Con- tinental Europe Northern Europe Asia and  Pacific Americas How we are building a resilient business Our framework for corporate responsibility shows the origin of  our mindset and how we embed our Group strategy locally. It is  based on our business fundamentals – the vision and mission,  our values and our business strategy: The ISS Way.  As a global business, a major task is to integrate the Group  Strategy for Health, Safety, Environment and Quality (HSEQ) and  Corporate Responsibility (CR) and related policies into our local  operations. This effort is essential to reaching our business goals.  In each country, a designated HSEQ manager is responsible for  implementing the Group strategy into the country business stra- tegy. Countries report their performance to Group HSEQ and CR. Group HSEQ and CR is responsible for driving the strategy,  monitoring and reporting on HSEQ and CR and works in close  alignment with the Executive Group Management. By reviewing  performance and actions, Group HSEQ and CR helps the coun- tries achieve the common Group goals.  Key activities are: \t Ensuring\ta\thealthy\tand\tsafe\twork\tenvironment; \t Driving\ta\tresponsible\tsupply\tchain; \t Reducing\tour\tenvironmental\tfootprint; \t Mitigating\trisks\tthrough\tinternal\teducation; \t Building\tstrong\tleadership\tcapabilities. policies are available at http://inv.issworld.com/policies.cfm Our FraMeWOrk FOr COrpOrate reSpOnSibilitY ISS Safety Rules Group HSEQ Management System ISS Tax Policy ISS Global People Standards ISS Supplier Code of Conduct ISS Supply Chain Policy ISS Code of Conduct ISS Corporate Responsibility Policy include a rising number of refugees in our workforce as well as  people with mental and physical disabilities, social challenges  or little academic schooling.

We work with strategic  suppliers to develop and test new tools and processes that will  reduce the environmental impacts from cleaning.

They are plant based and  100% biodegradable designed to deliver superior results while  being safe for people and kind to the environment.  SuStainable develOpMent gOal 13 take urgent action to combat climate change  and its impacts  ISS is committed to continuously reducing any negative impact  on the environment due to our operations, and at the same  time work with customers to help them reduce their environ- mental footprint.

As we work at our customers premises, we attain  insight into their performance and use this knowledge to help  our customers manage and reduce their impact.

These policies form the basis of our learn- ing tools and programmes, including an extensive onboarding  course where all employees are trained in our way of working  and our values. Corruption and bribery is illegal and against  our values. Our Speak Up system is promoted to allow   employees to raise concerns on these matters.

Risks  can expose our business, harm people and   damage the environment and climate. But  managing risks can also create opportuni- ties, not only for ISS, but also for people  and the global society as such.   We see an increasing demand from our customers to help them  improve their work environment and their impact on the   climate. At the same time, we are strengthening our compli- ance requirements in our supply chain. Thus, combined with  our own performance, we support the creation of a global  level playing field in all relevant aspects of sustainability. We  aim to achieve this by an ambitious and systematic approach;  yet the challenges remain so our efforts must be seen as part  of a continuous and proactive development. Our employees help us eliminate non-compliance when they  report incidents through our Speak Up system. The system is  a reporting channel for raising serious and sensitive concerns,  guaranteeing protection from reprisals or retaliation for all   persons who make complaints in good faith. You can read  more about Speak Up on page 30.  We recognise our responsibility for mitigating risks in our role  as employer, business partner and corporate citizen. We act  on our knowledge and seek to do this in a constructive and  transparent manner. In this overview, we present risks, impacts  and actions related to the UN Global Compact principles on  responsible business.  UK Modern Slavery Act Transparency statement Our policy is to ensure that slavery and human trafficking are  not taking place in any part of our business and in any part of  our supply chain. This is consistent with our Code of Conduct,  Corporate Responsibility Policy, our Supplier Code of Conduct  and our Global People Standards. Our Global People Standards  cover, among other areas, pre-employment checks, zero toler- ance for forced and compulsory labour, right to privacy, and  child labour. We conduct internal audits to verify we manage  these risks in our operations. We recognise that certain cate- gories of our supply chain carry a higher risk of child or slave  labour and we therefore in 2017 implemented the new Supply  Chain Policy and ISS ProcurePASS.

Although bri- bery and corruption are illegal and  against ISS policies, we acknowledge   that we cannot always prevent  breaches of rules or legislation. Foul play by just one of our 500,000  employees somewhere in the organi- sation can seriously harm our company   at a corporate level. Adverse effects   could include financial costs, corporate  liability, and reputational damages with   the potential to destroy business oppor-  tunities. Corruption affects society by  e.g. endangering the rule of law and  destabilising economic growth. Our global standards are part of the  training for all ISS employees. Enforcing   the anti-corruption and bribery rules  requires constant focus and the com- mitment from our top management  is unambiguous. Local management  must work actively to implement the  standards. We monitor and ensure  that each case of non-compliance  gets escalated and treated seriously. Reducing our environmental foot- print is a clear ambition in ISS. We  manage two different risk categories:  our own operations and our custo- mers. As for our own operations,  consistent reporting and coordinated  initiatives remain a challenge. In rela- tion to our customers, it is a challenge  to pursue the highest standards on  their behalf. With our global reach, improving  resource productivity will have a sig- nificant impact on the environment  by decreasing the use of water, energy   and materials. When we transport our   standards to customers businesses,  the impact will grow accordingly. Based on a systematic approach we  aim to achieve continuous improve- ment in quality and performance.  We set standards and targets for   improvements, and measure and  report on our performance. Credible  and effective management of envi- ronmental and climate-related risks  are part of our value proposition to  our customers. As a global organisation our people  have numerous interactions every  day. This tests our ability to respect  human rights, particularly in regions  affected by instability and weak law  enforcement. We have identified  three main areas posing a risk: child  labour, forced labour and right to  privacy. They reflect the vulnerability  of the people we interact with. Breaching the rights of vulnerable  people is double trouble: their   exposed situation is worse, and  feeling defenseless they may not  claim their rights. Influenced by local  sub-cultures, this could also impact  people in general. We recognise that certain individuals   and groups require increased aware- ness and attention to protect against  potential abuse. Our policy on safe- guarding children and vulnerable  people is being implemented via a  thorough programme. It is part of  our onboarding programme, training   of top management and leaders   and also included in our Global Peo- ple Standard. Our work on privacy is  detailed on page 29. Our policy is to ensure that slavery  and human trafficking are not taking   place in any part of our business and   our supply chain. We recognise that   certain categories of our supply chain  carry higher risk of child and slave  labour. Here, we specifically seek to  secure adequate risk controls. People who become part of slavery  or human trafficking usually do not  know their rights. They are victims of  a cruel business exploiting vulner- able humans. Apart from the human  costs, the negative societal and eco- nomic consequences are significant. ISS is committed to help eradicate  slavery and human trafficking; hence  we have a systematic and proactive  approach to ensure this. We conduct  internal audits to verify our standards  to manage these risks. In relation to  our supply chain, we require self- assessments and carry out audits to  verify our suppliers labour standards  and performance. The management of working   conditions and supply chain risks   are becoming more important as  compliance with international  standards grows. Operating in un- stable regions with scarce legisla- tion can be challenging to enforce  ISS global standards which impose  decent working conditions. As we operate a global company  with about 500,000 employees  and managing a vast number of  sub-contractors and suppliers every  year, we directly or indirectly impact  labour rights for a significant number  of people. Working with private sector partners  as well as civil society and labour  organisations, we seek to promote   labour rights both globally and  locally. We support the UNI Global  Unions 12 fundamental principles  and we manage labour rights on the  foundation of these shared goals.   10  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017 KEY SUSTAINABILITY EvENTS IN 2017 March 2017 May 2017 July 2017 June 2017 January  2017 helping reFugeeS in- tegrate intO SOCietY The Danish community award   Fllesskabsprisen recognises an  ISS project and an ISS employee  for helping refugees get a job.

While we at any  given time account for the compliance of  our own business, the supply chain poses  a risk as we interact with approximately  75,000 regular products and services  suppliers around the world.  We handle these risks by close relationships and an increased  demand for transparency and compliance by suppliers.   Thus we work systematically with risk assessment and   supplier management.  We are ambitious and competitive but we compete on fair  terms and on the merits of our services. Our business integrity  is non-negotiable and one of our core values.  To support this commitment and to create social and environ- mental improvements for all our stakeholders, we have adopted  the ISS Supply Chain Policy that applies to all purchases of  goods and services throughout the ISS Group. We also seek to  ensure alignment with the ISS Supplier Code of Conduct which  defines our environmental and social requirements. Although  ISS strategy is self-delivery, our many suppliers across all coun- tries and various categories reflect the client needs. This  includes broad categories such as Cleaning, Food & Beverage,  Technical Maintenance, Security, Support Services, Fleet and IT  and the supplier base spans from small local suppliers to large  global companies. The main CR risks associated with our supply chain are related to: \t Human\trights; \t Labour\tpractices; \t Work\ttime/overtime; \t Environment; \t Information\tsecurity. To mitigate these risks, ISS has over the last three years   significantly strengthened the global supply chain manage- ment approach:    \t SUPPLY CHAIN POLICY – A new ISS Supply Chain Policy is   being implemented. It builds on and supports ISS strong  commitment to complying with the United Nations   Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Also, the  revised ISS Supplier Code of Conduct (original from 2013)  now emphasises our commitment to reducing our impact  on Climate Change in our supply chain and includes new  requirements for suppliers regarding Conflict of Interest and  our Speak Up Policy. \t GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN AND PROCUREMENT   ORGANISATION – To strengthen the values and increase  capabilities on all levels across countries, a global organisa- tion was implemented for Supply Chain and Procurement.

This also gives central insight to which suppliers  support us on which customer sites. \t CONTRACT MANAGEMENT – With Sievo, we implemented   a global Contract Management system, where the procure- ment professionals share the supplier contracts, supporting  documents, evidence, etc. \t SANCTION LIST SCREENING – In 2017, we further   implemented a global screening system to monitor a sanc- tion list; we now screen all suppliers against government  sanction lists for cases on corruption, fraud, child-labour,  terror, etc. \t LINE MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION – KPIs and yearly   targets are now implemented in ISS processes and manage-  ment reporting tool Insight@ISS and thus integrated in  Regional and Country Business Reviews. To support the  Supplier Code of Conduct governance, the KPIs include:  Spend under Contract, Spend with approved suppliers and  Compliance with our Preferred Supplier programmes. The ISS Supply Chain and Procurement organisation is an  integral part of our business operations by delivering ongoing  value through utilisation of sound Supply Chain practices.  enSuring a reSpOnSible  SupplY Chain iSS procurepaSS (procurement-partner assured  Sourcing Solution) is a common, transparent  solution for supplier compliance and approval  across the countries iSS operates in.  WhY ProcurePASS directly supports our customers growing  need for working with sustainable business partners as  it enhances our valuable supplier relationships, compliance  and quality standards. We aim at a transparent supply  chain and assured adherence to the highest ethical stan-  dards as expressed in the ISS Supplier Code of Conduct. What We collect a wider range of data about our suppliers and  business partners. Our partner Achilles, a global supply  chain risk management solution provider, supports exist- ing and new suppliers. ProcurePass supports high-per- forming and risk-reduced delivery of our services.  hOW  ProcurePASS builds on a common ISS risk model and a  three stage self-assessment questionnaire approach:  from simple screening to enhanced screening with  supplier audit. Registration to ProcurePASS is by invitation.  All suppliers have an obligation to keep their information  up-to-date. Annually all suppliers risk level is re-evaluated  as part of a standard renewal process operated by Achilles.  next  After a successful pilot introduction in 2017 of Procure- PASS in Denmark and the United Kingdom with 1,500  suppliers the solution is now being rolled out throughout  these countries and in the rest of the ISS markets. iMpaCt On SOCietY  ISS believes that more suppliers will adopt industry best  practice and thereby contribute to higher standards  within the areas of human, environmental and economic  development. iMpOrtant FOr iSS  We protect and develop our business on a sound basis  when we operate as a responsible business partner. The  mitigation of risks in our supply chain protects our brand  and strengthens our relationships. AN APPROACH wITH  CONSEQUENCES Our approach has direct impact on our supplier base.   In 2017 we terminated two contracts with suppliers  due to non-compliance with our requirements.  During the assessment process other suppliers have chosen to  withdraw their engagement with ISS because of unwillingness  to participate in our solution. They are no longer part of our  vendor ledger. Some suppliers, when requested by ProcurePASS,  went back and increased their insurance coverage. All suppliers  in Sievo (+99.5% of our spend) are now sanction list screened.  14  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017 With around 500,000 employees in 50 countries, ISS is one of the largest  private employers in the world.  Through the work we provide and  the salaries we pay, we affect the lives  of more than two million people.  Our business results hinge on the engagement and actions of  our employees. They deliver the services and embody the value  proposition we make to our customers: They can pursue their  purpose and goals while we assume responsibility for managing   their facilities and the risk related to them.  But this is not just about tools, techniques, and processes. First  and foremost, it is about how we empower people. We drive profitable growth by ensuring that ISS has the leader- ship, talent, capabilities, and culture required for the excellent  execution of our strategy and achievement of our vision.  Great leadership is key to bringing out the true value embedded   in our strategy. It is the root of our peoples engagement and   the desired customer experience, and what gives us the strength   that differentiates us.  We aim to empower our employees through dedicated leader- ship and development that allows them to enhance their  personal and professional skills and competencies. We believe  that the commitment and engagement of our people lie in our  ability to let them unfold their full potential.  At the same time, we work intensely to create and manage   a safe, healthy and resilient work environment where our   employees thrive. We protect their human and labour rights,  we provide an understanding of basic rights and we strive to  build a strong safety culture.  The power of the human touch Our people are the true source of our competitive advantage,  and the proof point of our ability to deliver on our value  proposition is every single interaction between one of our  people and a customer. It is our fundamental belief that great service moments can be  architected by the right combination of people with a common  purpose and the right attitude, who are: \t inspired\tand\tsupported\tby\tthe\tright\tleadership; \t equipped\twith\tthe\tright\tskills\tand\ttools\tto\tperform;\tand \t engaged\tand\tempowered\tto\tcreate\tmemorable\t  service moments. The quality and consistency of our leadership is the biggest  single driver of our ability to truly unleash the Power of the  Human Touch, which is why we continue to invest in develop- ing our leaders across the Group through key Group-wide ISS  University programmes. To ensure that we continuously have the right competencies,  we have developed the ISS Leadership Competency Frame- work, which in 2017 was established as the core of all our  people processes from recruitment, to performance evaluation,  to development and to succession planning. The Leadership  Competencies – along with tools to help our people develop  their skills – have been integrated in core processes globally  and will continue to be rolled out in 2018.    Furthermore, in 2017 we launched the Leading the ISS Way  programme. It targets all senior leaders embedding the ISS   Leadership Competency Framework across our business.

The ISS University is structured to enhance our leader- ship capability across three core dimensions: \t strategic\tleadership\t–\tbuilding\tan\tintimate\tunderstanding\t  of our strategy and our key performance drivers;  \t people\tleadership\t–\tbuilding\tthe\tself-awareness\tof\tour\t  leaders and supporting them in leading their people; \t business\tleadership\t–\tequipping\tour\tleaders\twith\tthe\t  business understanding and skills they need to effectively   lead their specific part of the business, for example key   account leaders, commercial leaders, finance leaders, etc. A critical building block of the ISS University is our Key Account  Manager Certification (KAMC) – a modular development  programme directed at account leaders of our key accounts  across the world.  Focus in 2017 was to further sustain and maximise the effort of   the programme in the future by engaging the leadership and  support structures around our key accounts. At the end of 2017,   more than 1,000 certifications had been issued under the  programme, touching around 800 of our key accounts globally. Advancing our leadership pipeline Leadership is a key strategy enabler. Ensuring that our leaders  are equipped to communicate the strategy and engage the  organisation is a key focus area for leadership development.  Our leadership programmes provide our employees with an   essential understanding of the key elements of our strategy  and give them tools relevant for their day-to-day work. With that in mind, we have launched the ISS Leadership   Mastery programme, a comprehensive five-module programme  for selected executives. So far, 82 senior leaders have graduated   from the programme and in 2017, an additional 22 participants   were accepted for the programme. Furthermore, we have already   seen 32% of the alumni advance into new roles within ISS.  In parallel to the significant focus on developing current leaders,   we are also looking ahead, and building our pipeline of future  leaders through the ISS Global Management Trainee programme.   This programme is directed at global university graduates and we  select the brightest and the best in a rigorous assessment process. Our trainees go through an 18-month programme, including  an international assignment, before being assigned to their  first line appointment.  The benefits of the programme are twofold; it enables us to  build a sustainable talent pipeline for the future, whilst at the  same time building our global employer brand in the external  marketplace. the iSS univerSitY bringing On univerSitY graduateS 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 8 11 33 36 55 Retention rate 89%  20-25 participants annually  148 trainees to date   Annual conference addressing the  strategic objectives and direction of  the Group  400+ senior leaders   47 countries  140,000+ trained employees  700 key accounts  Senior manager induction programme  150+ participants annually     Around 800 key accounts Leadership programmes Business programmes Service mindset  On-boarding ISS Advantage Service with  a Human Touch Leading Service with  a Human Touch Area Manager  programme Key Account   Manager    programme Top Management   Conference Leading  The ISS Way Leadership  Mastery ISS GLOBAL MANAGEMENT TRAINEE PROGRAMME  16  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017 Creating a sense of purpose Employee engagement is critical for our ability to serve our  customers – engaged and motivated employees have a direct  impact on the customer experience of our services. For this  purpose, we survey our employees on how engaged and moti- vated they are in working for ISS and, more importantly, what  we can do better to drive engagement of our people.  In 2017, we carried out our sixth global employee engagement  survey. The survey covered 44 countries and was conducted in  54 languages. Scope has been expanded each year since incep- tion. In 2017, close to 320,000 employees were invited to par- ticipate, with 250,697 responding. Once again, the response  rate improved, climbing to 78% from 72% in 2016. The survey revealed an overall employee engagement of 4.5 out  of a possible 5. As part of the survey, we also measure our em- ployees willingness to recommend ISS as an employer. For the  fifth consecutive year, the score improved from 59 to 62 in 2016. In response to the previous learnings from the survey, we   continue the Service with a Human Touch programme, focus- ing on our frontline employees. This is a key strategic game  changer driving cultural change. We will continue the work to  continuously improve engagement, which in turn increases the  overall sense of purpose of our people in the delivery of our  services.  Challenged by employee retention Retention of staff is a common challenge in our industry where  jobs tend to be temporary or used as a supplementary income.  In 2017, the employee turnover was 44% compared to 43%  last year. Employees employed for more than one year made  up 68% of the workforce (same as in 2016).  We know that the longer an employee stays with ISS, the more  engaged he or she becomes. Substituting nearly one third of  our staff every year requires many resources and we are com- mitted to increase the retention in our operations. For this  purpose, a new initiative was launched in 2017 offering  education beyond the direct needs of our business, such as  leadership development, cultural awareness and soft skill train- ing including the use of computer software. In this way, our employees can grow their skills and thereby  expand their career opportunities. We believe that this chance  to prosper leads to more motivation and people who feel  recognised are more disposed to remain with ISS. Labour rights  ISS has a long history of working with and conducting respect- ful dialogues with our employees. Our Global People Standards  recognise the right of employees to form, join or refrain from  joining trade unions of their choice, without fear of intimida- tion, discrimination, reprisal or harassment. We manage our  employee relations for our European operations through the  European Works Council (EWC). This consists of quarterly  meetings between management and EWC representatives and  an annual meeting between EWC leadership and all European  44 countries 250,697 respondents 54 languages 78.4% Response rate Overall engagement 4.5 (4.5) Capability 4.5 (4.5) Motivation 4.5 (4.4) Pride 4.4 (4.4) 5 1 Retention 4.5 (4.4) glObal eMplOYee engageMent SurveY reSultS HOw wE SET A STANDARD  FOR MANAGING PEOPLE Our Global People Standards provide a systematic and consistent   approach to managing our employees. This includes placing  the right employees in the right positions, and by doing so,  maximising the current and future performance of our staff.  The People Standards were launched in 2016. During 2017  countries carried out self-assessments against the requirements  and developed action plans to close the gaps and in 2018 we  will focus on a full implementation across the entire organisation. The People Standards set minimum requirements for the develop- ment and implementation of effective people management for ISS  operations globally. In developing country-specific requirements,   a country will always comply with local legislative requirements.     CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017  17 Union country works council representatives. The annual   meeting with employee representatives from 20 countries  represents over 49% of our employees. We seek to work  with private sector partners as well as civil society and labour  organisations to promote labour rights both globally and  locally. Since 2003, ISS has been part of an agreement with  UNI Global Union, an international network of national labour  organisations. The agreement mutually commits both parties  to work in favour of human rights and decent working condi- tions including health and safety. The commitment stretches  beyond our own company into industries and the communi- ties where we operate. We are obligated to support the UNIs  12 fundamental principles based on the International Labour  Organisations (ILO) conventions. A thorough onboarding Each week 4,000 people join ISS. In 2017, we continued to invest   in developing our people at all levels of our organisation, people   with the right capabilities and mindset to deliver on our vision. We aim to be the preferred place to work in our industry and we are   well aware of our responsibility of welcoming our new colleagues   in the best possible manner. A good introduction programme is   a must and traditionally our operations have made a big effort of   welcoming people. In 2017, we developed a new global on-  boarding programme template. In addition, we launched a global   and mobile e-learning platform accessible for all employees.  The double benefit of this is that our employees quickly get  a thorough understanding of our values and standards and  thereby feel included and well-informed. This is combined with  clear guidance so that they know what is expected of them and   what services are to be done. As a result of this, our customers   meet engaged and sound representatives of the ISS brand. We  believe that engaged employees drive customer satisfaction  which leads to improved financial results. peOple – Our WaY  aMbitiOn We want our employees to feel engaged and dedicated.

It lies in our DNA to embrace   a diverse and inclusive workforce as we  value different perspectives to drive inno-  vation and engagement.  We believe that diversity makes us more productive and an  attractive place to work. Hence, we also encourage others to  include diversity in their businesses and thereby contribute to  a more complete and sustainable global labour market.  Leading diverse teams is an integral part of our leadership  training. ISS recognises its diverse workforce as a key competi- tive advantage, and we consider leadership as the main driver  of unfolding the potential of our employees – our most valu- able asset. The ability of our leaders, at all levels, to guide and  motivate must be based on human understanding, respect and  responsibility – what we term The ISS Way. The positive effect of diversity The effect of diverse leadership was emphasised by new  research from ISS Denmark in 2017 showing that diversity has  a positive impact on leadership development, especially within  the fields of communication, relationship building and talent  development. This conclusion follows earlier research from ISS  proving that diversity positively impacts the bottom line. ISS comprises many different cultures and nationalities as well as   people with mental and physical disabilities, social challenges  or little academic schooling. Also, we welcome a rising number  of refugees to our work force around the world.  While diversity includes age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, cul- ture, language, religion, physical ability, education, and skills,  the distribution of male-female representation continues to  have extra attention. The Board and Executive Group Management (EGM) recognise  the importance of promoting diversity at management levels  and have implemented policies regarding competencies and  diversity in respect of Board and EGM nominations. According  to this we are committed to selecting the best candidate while  aspiring to have diversity in gender as well as in broader terms  such as international experience. Emphasis is on experience  and expertise – diversity – personal characteristics matching  ISS values and leadership principles. The Board has adopted  a gender diversity target of having at least 40% women on  the Board by 2020. Currently, 33% of our Board members  are women. The target was not reached in 2017. The Board  found that it in broad terms possessed a high level of diversity  and did not nominate new Board candidates in 2017. In terms  of international experience, the Board aims to have sufficient  international experience at all management levels taking into  account the size and activities of ISS. The Board considers that it  has diverse and broad international experience. The EGM is con- sidered to have the necessary international experience if half of  its members have international experience from large   international companies. The current members of the EGM have   international experience. We recognise that a more balanced  gender representation is crucial to reaching our vision. Ensuring female representation In 2017, we implemented a new recruitment process instructing  that one out of three final candidates to our global management  trainee programme and for management for senior positions  needs to be female. This requirement complements other  initiatives pointing at developing succession plans aiming at  identifying female successors and tabling the matter of women  in leadership at ISS for discussion at least once a year at the  EGM level.  Investigations of discrimination   In line with the ISS Code of Conduct and the Global People  Standards, ISS takes all claims of discrimination seriously. 14 incidents were identified, investigated and followed up with  legal authorities in the countries. Out of the 14 incidents, 5 were  deemed to be without legal merit and 9 are still pending.  Flying the rainbow flag  We take pride in our diversity and throughout our organisa- tion a broad variety of initiatives are taken to attract potential  employees with the right mindset and attitude. For the first  time, in 2017 we embraced the rainbow in support of Pride  and LGBT by flying the flag at our headquarters and at several  other locations. This celebration underlines our commitment to  promoting a harmonious and dignified working environment.

This means ensuring that each of our   nearly 500,000 employees go home to their   families and loved ones in the same condi- tion as they started their workday at ISS.  To drive this vision, we need to have a culture where safety  is second nature; safety needs to be a natural part of our  working culture. This requires the commitment from everyone,  starting from our Executive Group Management (EGM) to our  colleagues delivering our services to our valued customers.  In 2017, we have embedded this commitment throughout  our organisation.  For example, at the Management level, our EGM have all  signed Personal Safety Action Plans (PSAPs), and we start all  our senior leadership meetings with a Safety Moment.  At middle management levels, we are also embedding PSAPs  and create Safety Ambassadors by asking our employees to  be safety role models by, for example, holding the handrails  when using the stairs, ensuring everyone uses their seat belts  in the car and not holding their mobile phones while they drive.  At the operational sites, some of the actions include holding  Toolbox Talks, Near Miss reporting and stopping unsafe work.  Our responsibilities also include the health and safety of our  customers as we work side by side with them on a daily basis.  If we instigate a strong safety culture amongst ourselves, this  will also have a positive impact on our customers. Fatalities We regretfully had six work-related fatalities in 2017. We are  deeply affected by each of the fatalities and we have investi- gated each one of them to ensure we determine the root causes  and take corrective actions to ensure they are not repeated.  The fatalities occurred in the United Kingdom, Thailand, India,  Hong Kong and Belgium. Three of the fatalities were vehicle  related, two were related to working at height and the one  was working with plant and machinery. Five of the fatalities  were our employees and one was a contractor.  As a result of the incidents, we have sent a Global Safety Flash  for each of the three areas to the whole organisation to ensure  we learn from the incidents and take preventive actions. As per  our Group Escalation Policy, each fatality and serious injury is  reported to our top management within 24 hours of occurrence. Improving the personal safety of our people The Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) for 2017 was 3.5, down  from 4.7 in 2016. This means, we have reduced our LTIF by  over 70% since our 2010 baseline of 13.  Lost Work Hours (LWH) is an important indicator of the general  health and wellbeing of our employees. It is also closely linked  to both operational and financial gains. LWH decreased by  55% compared to the 2010 baseline, well exceeding our tar- get of 45% reduction. The Total Reportable Cases Frequency  (TRCF) was under 7.5, a decrease of over 65% compared to  the 2010 baseline value of 23. We have established and implemented a systematic approach  in addressing our HSE risks across the organisation that has  resulted in continuous improvement in our overall HSE perfor- mance over the last six years.  Our HSEQ Management system is the backbone of this improve-   ment. The management system that was first implemented in  2010 was updated to reflect the new ISO standards in 2016  and was certified by our global certification partner, DNv GL,  in February 2017. We have also focused on improving our  reporting culture by reporting all incidents in our Global  Reporting System and increasing the reporting of Near Miss  incidents in our operations. the iSS SaFetY ruleS COver the FOllOWing aCtivitieS HealtH  and  safety Stopping unsafe work Permit to work Energy isolation Electrical safety   Working with chemicals Housekeeping   Manual handling   Working at heights     Confined space entry     Driving safety    CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017  21 Risk and due diligence We perform services with different personal health and safety  risk profiles depending on our customers activities and on   the individual site.

As part of our due diligence pro- cess to ensure we understand and comply with our customers  requirements, we have implemented a HSE Compliance Plan. Safety action plans  We have an ongoing focus on addressing vehicle-related  incidents, working at heights and slips, trips and falls. The HSE  strategy has a stated vision 100 (see below). Each year, we  build and distribute a Group HSEQ and CR Action Plan with  actions for each country to implement as part of their Country  HSEQ and CR Action Plan.  Furthermore, individual country management each year deve- lops a Personal Safety Action Plan (PSAP) with objectives and  targets for each member of the country management team.  This encourages and allows for management to show their  visible safety commitment and leadership through actions. what we did in 2017 Additionally, with our new learning management system, My- Learning (see page 32), we are rolling out the HSE E-Learning  modules such as the ISS Safety Rules, HSE E-Learning, Office  Safety and Driver Safety.  In 2017, we continued our quarterly Me and You safety cam- paigns in all the countries focusing on slips, trips and falls, electrical safety, working at heights, and driving safely. The  campaign uses posters produced by Group HSEQ and CR that  are translated into more than 20 languages.  We performed bi-monthly safety inspections for all our large  global key accounts during 2017. The audits build account- ability and transparency as results are reported directly into  ISS global IT-based HSE system. At the same time, the audits  provide documentation that we are living up to the HSEQ  requirements included in contracts. Furthermore, during 2017, we also developed the Quality  Management System (QMS) for the pharma sector. This QMS is  under the overall HSEQ Management system and emphasises  our commitment to our growth in this customer segment. As part of our overall strategy to develop HSEQ and CR as a  value proposition to our customers, in 2017, we started deliver- ing HSEQ as a service at a global level. This demonstrates that  we have developed the capabilities, and evidence to offer  HSEQ and CR as a service to our exisiting and new customers. aMeen ibrahiM Cleaning Services, ISS Norway  22  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017 Objective and ambition The project aims at creating an effective learning environment  for the ISS frontline staff so as to break through the barriers  of illiteracy and inadequate education considering their socio-  economic state and challenging backgrounds. The major goal  is to take the participants to the next level in terms of their  work-life progression, which in turn gives them bigger oppor- tunities to grow within ISS and also generates employment for  the other participants who are family members. what we do The project is moving steps beyond the basics of ensuring jus- tice and equality for working people and addresses challenges  defined by the UN like youth unemployment, moving the world   of work towards quality jobs and improving the lives of workers.  The programme comprises 72 hours of classroom training  which moves right from setting expectations and drawing the  big picture to mapping career paths and aspirations at the  beginning and flows further covering 5 important aspects  namely; Interpersonal skills, basic IT (Digital Literacy), customer  centricity, supervisory skills and confidence which are major  learnings of this programme. The other half of the programme  covers non-classroom training of 228 hours that includes: Live  Projects, Exposure visits and Work Place Assignments.  More than 500 front line employees are part of the project that  covers the following locations: \t EON\tKharadi-\tCiti\tBank\tand\tBarclays; \t Koregaon\tPark-Citi\tBank; \t Hinjewadi-\tBarclays; \t Mumbai\tInternational\tAirport; \t Ghansoli-\tReliance\tCorporate\tPark. what we achieve The participants have been highly interactive and have engaged   throughout all the sessions conducted. The training methodo- logy has been highly appreciated as trainers have used activi- ties, games and interactive discussions as a primary mode  of training. Many showed an interest in introducing this  programme to their family members and this is now being  arranged for their family members too.  Future plans Based on the learnings form this project, we will look at  developing this concept into a model that can be considered in  other countries to develop and upskill our front line employees.

This affects our health,  nature, economy and general well-being.   In ISS, we manage our impacts on the   environment and climate through the   design of processes and equipment we   use, and through the portfolio of services  we offer to our customers.  The main impacts on the environment and climate from our  own activities come from the use of cars and air transport,  energy consumption in buildings and the use of energy, water  and chemicals in delivering our cleaning services, which consti- tute 50% of our commercial offerings. We recognise that our  success and future growth require us to carry out our opera- tions in an environmentally and climate friendly way. This is  part of the ISS Way.  We did not identify any significant non-compliance with envi- ronmental laws and regulations in 2017.  At ISS, we are committed to reducing our impact on the  environment and climate. There is increasing pressure for  more transparency, engagement, and evidence of proactive  environmental initiatives from key external stakeholders, e.g.  customers and investors. In addition, there are expectations  from employees for ISS to take a responsible position with  regards to the environment and the climate. Our choices are integrated with our overall business strategy  to enhance our competitiveness advantage. At the same time,  our environmental strategy must allow for flexibility and scala- bility in an evolving future. The foundation of our strategy is  whatever we do, it must: \t be\tconsistent\twith\tthe\tISS\tvalues; \t be\tconsistent\twith\tISS\tambition\tof\toperational\texcellence; \t enhance\tISS\treputation; \t be\tsubstantive\tand\tnot\tmere\tPR;\tand \t be\tmanageable\tand\tmeasurable. Going from Eco-Efficiency to Eco-Advantage As a responsible company, ISS strives to comply with all evolving   regulatory and customer requirements. In addition, we drive   efficiencies in our operations that lead to cost reductions  and risk mitigation that provides competitive advantage and  increases the bottom-line. We achieve this through: \t a\tsystematic\tapproach\tto\tidentify\tpotentials\tfor\tmore\teffi-\t \t  cient use of resources, lower emissions and optimise cost; \t proactive\tmitigation\tof\tenvironmental\trisk;\tand \t anticipation\tof\tour\tcustomers\tneeds. Our strategy is clear. Our environmental strategic ambition  is to go beyond Eco-Efficiency to Eco-Advantage with the  aspiration to be recognised as an environmental leader and  the creation of significant economic value by developing value  Propositions through environmental initiatives and activities.  This will on top of cost reductions create incremental economic  value and enhance competitiveness through: \t improvement\tof\tresource\tproductivity\t(energy,\twater\tand\t  material) and realisation of significant cost savings; \t better\tmanaging\tenvironmentally-driven\tbusiness\trisk; \t enhancing\tISS\treputation. Our targets In the last few years, we have improved the quality of our data  reporting in this area through more frequent reporting and  tighter quality control and we believe that the data correctly  reflects the current footprint. We have established relative  targets that are meaningful and achievable: \t Electricity\tconsumption:\t5%\treduction\t(Mwh/revenue)\tover\t  a period 2018-2021 based on 2017 baseline data;  \t Car\temissions\tfrom\tleased\tcars:\t15%\treduction\t(g/km)\tfrom\t  2014 over the leasing period of 4 years; \t Water\tconsumption:\t5%\treduction\t(m3/\trevenue)\tover\ta\t  period 2018-2021 based on 2017 baseline data. Risk and due diligence  Credible and effective management of environmental and  climate-related risks is part of our value Proposition to our   customers. Therefore, we have adopted a systematic approach  to achieve continuous improvement in quality and performance.     CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017  25 ISS manages these matters as critical business activities, sets  standards and targets for improvement, and measures, appraises  and reports on performance. We also continuously look for ways to  reduce the environmental impact of our operations and services.  We manage two different risk categories: the impact of our  own operations and services and the impact of our customers.  The latter is gradually proving to be a new business opportu- nity as our customers increasingly seek to improve their perfor- mance and impact on the environment and climate.  Reducing the impact of our customers  As we operate the sites of our customers on a daily basis, we  often come to know their sites better than they do. In recent  years, we have increasingly used this knowledge to add a new  value proposition to business: helping our customers manage  and reduce their impacts.  REDUCING OUR CUSTOMERS IMPACTS We continuously work with our customers to reduce their  environmental impacts with processes and systems such as: \t The ISS Green Offices Programme: An office based pro- gramme designed to reduce the impact of offices and sites and  daily work practices on the environment. By changing peoples  behaviour, we can reduce our environmental footprint by using  resources efficiently and disposing our waste responsibly. \t waste process: ISS can directly influence the environmental  performance of our customers by managing waste from source  using our onsite presence and influence over the supply chain.  Our ability to integrate sustainable best practice into the heart  of client organisations has seen us regularly achieve recycling  rates in excess of 80% and zero waste-to-landfill targets. \t Audits: We can carry out energy and water audits to help  identify resource consumption and wastage. This helps identify  operational and resource consumption saving projects. We also  support our customers in achieving or maintaining their ISO  certification through the audit process.  planet – Our WaY  aMbitiOn Our environmental strategic ambition is to be recognised  as an environmental leader advocating for more sustain- able actions, measures and goals. driverS  Our environmental initiatives and activities are carried out  through a systematic approach when we identify poten- tials for more efficient use of resources, lower emissions  and optimise cost. We proactively mitigate environmental  risk and anticipate our customers needs. enablerS   environmental Strategy: Through our strategy we work  towards our goals of reducing our GHG emissions, our  use of water and waste production.  Cleaning excellence: This is a documented process to  identify potential improvements of both the service   delivery and environmental impact. It can reduce the use  of detergent and water significantly. iMpaCt On SOCietY  When we reduce our impact on the environment and  climate we contribute to solving the global challenge of  climate change and creating a sustainable world for  future generations. iMpOrtant FOr iSS As people are our most valuable resource we are respon- sible for providing a safe and complacent work environ- ment with the opportunity for all to unleash their personal  and professional potential. WhatS next We will continue to work with our stakeholders  (employees, customers and suppliers) in reducing our  impact on the environment through behavioural change  and developing solutions to reduce GHG emissions and  resource consumption.  26  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017 Objective and ambition Germany is known for waste separation and ambitious energy  goals. ISS Germany supports this and actively supports efficient  environmental policy and efficient energy management. In   its environmental and energy strategy, ISS Germany has set  sustainability goals to ensure the protection of the environ- ment, people and the future of the company. The Dsseldorf  headquarters of ISS Germany is committed to concrete mea- sures to implement this strategy. what we do When designing the new head office called The LAB in  Dsseldorf, resource conservation and a reduction in energy  consumption were taken into account right from the start.  Around 200 employees work in the German administration  headquarters. In September of this year, employees were asked  to commit to the sustainability principles set by ISS for the Gold  Certificate under the ISS Green Offices programme. In the  planning of The LAB technical requirements were taken into  account, which use the innovative possibilities of Internet of  Things, IoT: Around 500 sensors measure temperature, humi- dity, cleaning requirements and the level of soap dispensers.  As a result, only as much energy is spent on heat and cooling  as necessary, and it is only cleaned as needed in places with  corresponding pollution. This reduces energy consumption and  saves water and cleaning agents.  For the employees recycling-oriented waste separation and  waste avoidance are a matter of course. Corresponding collec- tion containers are available and reusable crockery is used in  the ISS Nitro coffee bars.  In the Open Office, ISS strives for the paperless office. If  printouts are required, double-sided printing on recycled paper  is recommended. If technically feasible, individual circuits are  controlled electronically or switched off with a time switch. what we achieve The employees were sensitised by the new office concept for  New Ways of Working: Less space, less energy, less resource  consumption. This also influences the behaviour of employees   regarding sustainability. The Dsseldorf head office was awarded  the gold certificate of the ISS Green Offices programme in  November 2017. Future plans The use of IoT, modern Internet technologies and artificial   intelligence will be expanded in the future. gOld CertiFiCatiOn  FOR OUR ISS GERMANY HEADQUARTERS CASE:    CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017  27 SUBJECT ENABLED BY ACTIvITIES PROGRESS CO2 emissions from  leased cars Reductions achieved  through leasing more fuel  efficient cars and changes  in driver behaviour Driver Safety E-learning Continued leasing of more fuel efficient vehicles vehicle emissions decreased from 106,353  tonnes CO2 eq. in 2016 to 96,664 tonnes  CO2 eq. in 2017 CO2 emissions from  business travel We encourage more  online meetings to reduce  air travel in particular Use of webinars Emissions from business travel increased  from 17,556 tonnes in 2016 to 18,217  tonnes in 2016.

We want these relations  to be based on good business practices.  This is why we have installed comprehen- sive measures to ensure the integrity of  our business. ISS is a competitive company as our ambition is to be the worlds  greatest service organisation. We want to achieve this by  competing on fair terms and by using our impact to positively  influence the global business environment through sound  financial performance and compliance with our business inte- grity framework. Our strategy, The ISS Way, is all about optimising the customer  experience while driving cost efficiencies through the align- ment of our organisation behind a set of common business  fundamentals and scale benefits.   We are intent on creating value for our shareholders by maxi- mising the cash flow growth from our business in a sustainable  fashion over the short and longer term.  Tax policy focusing on honesty and responsibility At ISS, we fully realise that for ISS to continue to grow sustain- ably, the local communities wherever we operate need to grow  and benefit as well. The most important way ISS contributes to  local communities is by providing jobs, income, training, social  benefits and career opportunities. But we are aware that also  our payments of tax and duties are important contributions to  many communities around the world.  Paying our taxes timely and correctly is an integrated part of  how we do business at ISS.  Our Tax Policy is built on our values and leadership principles  with focus on honesty and responsibility. The foundation of  our Tax Policy is our commitment to comply with all local and  international tax legislation. Governance of the Tax Policy is  carried out through yearly self-assessments followed by close  dialog and Tax Review meetings with countries. Governance structure explanation  ISS A/S is a limited liability company registered under Danish  law and listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Management  powers are distributed between the Board of Directors and  the Executive Group Management Board (the EGMB).

Profit  COMPETING ON   FAIR TERMS    CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017  29 DATA PROTECTION INFORMATION CONCERN CASES PERSONAL ACTIVITIES INTERNET PRIVACY ENCRYPTED E-MAILS REVEAL ACCESS CONNECTION TRUST CONTROL SECURED WEB handling PERSONAL DATA WITH CARE Since the adoption of the new EU General Data Protection  Regulation, ISS has been preparing for the regulation that  comes into force 25 May 2018. The Regulation will establish  a uniform set of rules to be complied with across the EU. The  Regulation aims at giving citizens control of their personal data  and creating a high, uniform level of data protection.  To prepare ISS group entities to be in compliance with the Regu- lation, ISS has initiated a Data Protection Project with an aim to  ensure compliance and raise awareness in the relevant ISS entities.  This is done through town hall presentations, local project kick-  off meetings, implementation follow-up and E-learning.  A key aspect of ISS compliance initiative is also to establish a  set of approved binding corporate rules on transfer of personal  data between ISS entities.  During 2017, the European ISS entities have conducted a data  mapping exercise to capture all the systems and processes  involved in the processing of Personal Data and evaluated the  compliance gaps based on the data mapping. ISS is currently in  the process of implementing the compliance tasks in due time  before May 2018.  ISS has established corporate data protection policies with  underlying protocols, hereunder in particular the data breach  protocol enabling ISS to act and respond to any breach or risk  of breach to data protection.   Part of compliance is also the ability to document that policies  and protocols are adhered to. ISS entities will therefore be  audited on a regular basis, and such audit will include testing  the awareness of complaints and data breach procedures.  Audits are carried out by Group Internal Audit, other internal  specialists or by ISS external auditors. The Group Data Protection Officer overlooks the internal audit  activities performed by Group Internal Audit and provides  advice to ensure that the audit activities address ISS processing  of Personal Data, including methods of ensuring that corrective  and preventive actions will take place. As part of ISS data protection compliance programme and as  part of the implementation of binding corporate rules, ISS has  established training programmes for ISS managers and relevant  employees with access to personal data. It is important that ISS is both recognised and acknowledged  for taking the safe-guarding of employees and customers  personal data very seriously. A new set of EU data protection rules fit for  the digital era has been decided for all companies hold- ing personal data of people residing in the EU, regardless  of the companys location. The reform will enter into  force on 25 May 2018.  30  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017 Raising awareness about Speak up In 2017, we continued our efforts in raising awareness across  the organisation about the Speak up Policy and system. One  of the topics of the Global Safety Campaign in February was   Speak up, as the audience of these campaigns are primarily  our front liners at our operational sites. This was one of the  media we used to increase awareness of this platform for   employees, business partners and other stakeholders to be  able to raise serious and sensitive concerns that could have  an adverse impact on the operations and performance of the  business of ISS, and which, due to the nature of the concern,  cannot be reported through the normal reporting lines.  Internal controls ensure our standards High business integrity and ethical standards are critical to the  success of ISS in achieving a position as a global leader in the  field of facility services. An integral part of the service we deliver  centers around customer security and trust. We operate inside  the walls of our customers and they depend on us to effec- tively manage their risks in terms of health and safety and  environment (HSE), Human Rights and Labour Rights. Also,  CR related issues in general are becoming increasingly moni- tored by media, NGOs and states worldwide. Group Internal Audit (GIA) carries out an elaborate set of  assurance activities to monitor our performance on business  integrity and good business practices.  Group HSEQ and CR also perform audits against the ISS Global  People Standards, the Group HSEQ Manual, the ISS Safety  Rules and the ISS Code of Conduct. In 2017, we carried out 18  audits. Main findings were: \t Insufficient\tcontrol\tmeasures\tindentified\tfor\tRisk\tAssessments; \t Incorrect\tuse\tof\tthe\tPermit\tto\twork\t(PTW)\tsystem; \t Lack\tof\tcompetencies\trequired\tto\tcarry\tout\tworking\tat\t  height tasks.

The purpose of the training module is to: \t Ensure\ta\tcommon\tand\tsystematic\tapproach\tto\tCode\t  of Conduct training of white-collar employees in ISS; \t Create\tawareness\tof\tour\tCore\tValues\tand\tCode\tof\t  Conduct amongst our employees and reinforce our   strong compliance culture; \t Fulfil\timportant\tcompliance\trequirements\tof\tcustomers,\t  authorities, and stakeholders of ISS as part of our   value Proposition. what we do Themes that are covered in the e-learning course are Personal  Conduct, Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery, Competition Law,  ISS Global People Standards, Corporate Responsibility and  Speak Up Policy. The course ends with a final quiz of 15 ques- tions which cover the course materials. The course participants  need to pass 80% correct answers in order to obtain a certificate. Key stakeholders at group, regional and country level have been   involved in the development. In January 2017, the training  module was tested on ISS employees working on the Barclays  and Citi accounts. In addition, the Executive Group Manage- ment tested the final product on ISS own Learning Manage- ment System (MyLearning) as part of the approval process. The training module was then rolled out to members of the   ISS Board and to the 400 Top Management Conference parti- cipants. The E-learning module is now rolled out across ISS  global on the My Learning platform. what we achieve In this initial roll out, we have now over 3,100 employees that  have completed and passed the course and obtained a certifi- cate. Employees will be required to do refresher training every  24 months. Future plans The training module will be translated into 20 languages,  namely, German, French, Spanish, Norwegian, Finnish, Swe- dish, Danish, Turkish, Simplified Chinese, Dutch, Indonesian,  Hebrew, Thai, Hindi, Portuguese (Brazilian), Portuguese, Italian,  Czech, Greek and Polish. The ambition is to have this module  rolled out to as many levels in the organisation as possible.

OVERVIEw OF 2017 BUSINESS INTEGRITY FRAMEwORK AND ACTIVITIES  34  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS ASSURANCE REPORT To Management and broader stakeholders of ISS A/S  We have reviewed the 2017 Corporate Responsibility Report  (the report), which covers ISS global activities from 1 January  to 31 December 2017, to provide limited assurance that: \t all\tPeople\tdata,\tPlanet\tdata,\tand\tIncome\ttax\tpaid\tby\t  employees on page 38 and 39 in the report, have been   stated in accordance with the reporting criteria;  \t the\treport\thas\tbeen\tprepared\tin\taccordance\twith\tthe\t  requirements of sections 99a and 99b of the Danish Finan-  cial Statements Act (FSA) and the requirements of the   UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Policy; \t the\treport\thas\tbeen\tprepared\tin\taccordance\twith\tthe\tprin-  ciples and reporting criteria defined in the Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards (Core level).  We express a conclusion providing limited assurance. Managements responsibility Management of ISS is responsible for collecting, analysing,  aggregating and presenting the information in the report  ensuring that data are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error. The ISS Group Health, Safety,  Environment and Quality (HSEQ) and Corporate Responsibility  (CR) Data Reporting Manual contains Managements defined  reporting scope for each data type. Auditors responsibility Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion  based on our engagement with Management and in accord- ance with the agreed scope of work. We have conducted our  work in accordance with ISAE 3000, Assurance Engagements  Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Informa- tion and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation  to obtain limited assurance about whether the selected CR  data in the report are free from material misstatement.  Deloitte Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab is subject to   International Standard on Quality Control (ISQC) 1 and, accord-  ingly, applies a comprehensive quality control system, including  documented policies and procedures regarding compliance  with ethical requirements, professional standards and appli-  cable legal and regulatory requirements. We have complied  with the independence and other ethical requirements of the  Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by FSR –  Danish Auditors (Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants),  which are based on the fundamental principles of integrity,  objectivity, professional competence and due care, confiden- tiality and professional behaviour. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope  than a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the  level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement  is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been  obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engage- ment. Considering the risk of material error, we planned and  performed our work to obtain all information and explanations  necessary to support our conclusion.  We performed our on-site review at the ISS Head Office in Den- mark in December 2017 and in January 2018. We have not  performed site visits or interviewed external stakeholders. We  have not performed any assurance procedures on baseline data,   economic or financial data, except for reported Income tax  paid by employees. We have not performed assurance pro- cedures on forward-looking statements, such as targets and  expectations, or on individual case stories disclosed in the report.  Consequently, we draw no conclusion on these statements. Considering the risk of material error, we planned and performed   our work so as to obtain all information and explanations  necessary to support our conclusion. We used the ISS Group  Health, Safety, Environment and Quality (HSEQ) and Corporate  Responsibility (CR) Data Reporting Manual and other internal  reporting manuals together with GRI reporting principles and  criteria as an appropriate basis for our engagement. Our proce- dures included the following: \t Reviewing\tISS\tprocesses\tfor\tdetermining\tmaterial\tissues\tto\t  be included in the report and challenging the material text   statements in the report; \t Reviewing\tthe\tkey\tprocesses,\ttools,\tsystems\tand\tcontrols\t  for gathering, consolidating and aggregating data at group   level and performing analytical review procedures and      obtaining additional explanations of data performance from   group functions;  \t Interviewing\tmanagement\tstaff\tacross\tvarious\tgroup\tfunc-  tions, including internal audit, as well as reporting and  data responsible personnel; \t Obtaining\trelevant,\tavailable\tcompany\tdocumentation\t  (including policies and action plans) to verify the extent to   which they support the information included in the report; \t Evaluating\tthe\toverall\tpresentation\tof\tthe\treport,\tincluding\t  consistency of information;  \t Reviewing\tthe\treport\tfor\tadherence\tto\tthe\trequirements\tof\t  sections 99a and 99b of the Danish Financial Statements    Act (FSA) and the requirements of the UN Global Compact   Communication on Progress Policy; 3  35  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017 Auditors observations regarding the GRI Standards Principles Materiality and sustainability context  This report reflects ISS ongoing commitment to ensuring   responsible business practices and acknowledges the companys   significant economic, environmental and social impact. The  topics presented align with Managements understanding of  ISS material Corporate Responsibility risks. Furthermore, the  report shows at a high level how ISS contributes towards the  UN Sustainable Development Goals. Comparability, completeness and timeliness Quantitative information in relation to the material topics  is presented such that stakeholders may analyse changes in  performance over time. The boundary and publication date  of the report are the same as the annual report, providing  timely disclosure to all stakeholders on ISS Corporate Respon- sibility performance.  Clarity and balance  The report provides a transparent and balanced presentation  of the companys 2017 Corporate Responsibility performance,  showing both positive and negative performance trends, high- lighting challenges and dilemmas faced within its own opera- tions and the broader facility services industry.  Stakeholder inclusiveness The report presents material stakeholder engagement activities  undertaken globally and locally in 2017, especially with em- ployees, customers and suppliers, and provides relevant exam- ples of how ISS engages with its different stakeholder groups.  Accuracy and reliability  Through ISS reporting principles, procedures and controls, the  company continues to promote accuracy and reliability across  the group regarding Corporate Responsibility data and report- ing. The transition to reporting in accordance with the new  GRI Standards shows Managements commitment to continued  refinement in this field.

The scope is all countries  and assets that are under ISS operational control and include  all employees (ISS employees, temporary workers and contract  personnel). Our employee engagement survey was offered to   employees that have worked for at least three months and work  at least 10 hours a week and were not on leave of absence. In  2017, we have not added new data parameters. For divestments,   data was included up to the time of the divestment taking  effect and not thereafter. We have focused on improving the  quality of our data. We have implemented a mandatory   HSE@ISS-IT system for countries to report and investigate inci- dents in a systematic approach. To further ensure improvements   in the quality of data, we have also held webinars with countries  to explain the data parameters. However, we are on a journey  of continuous improvement in terms of quality of our data. external principles and guidelines  We have designed our reporting to be in line with the new GRI  Standards by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the worlds  most widely used sustainability reporting framework. We have  chosen to be in accordance with the Core option. An over- view of the GRI Standards disclosures included in this report  can be found in the tables from page 42 onward. We have also used the ISO Standard ISO 26000 Guidance on  Social Responsibility and the Danish Standard DS 49001   Social responsibility management system – Requirements as a  basis of our analysis and reporting.  In addition, we also work with the principles of SA8000  pertaining to labour and human rights. The SA8000 Standard  is a tool for implementing international labour standards to  protect employees.  This is the statutory report on corporate social responsibility  cf.99 a and 99 b of the Danish Financial Statements Act.  The reporting furthermore serves to fulfil our obligation to  Communicate on Progress (CoP) as required by the UNGC.  In addition, it contributes to us meeting the requirements of  the UK Modern Slavery Act. internal guidelines  As a basis for our reporting, ISS developed a Group HSEQ and CR  Reporting Manual in 2010 to provide reporting principles and  rules to ensure a consistent basis for reporting. This Manual is  reviewed and updated yearly. The Manual specifies the data that shall be available for moni- toring performance and for reporting on corporate responsi- bility issues at Group level.  Number of employees are the total number of headcount   full-time and part-time averaged over the 12-month report- ing period. Full-time employees are defined as employees   who work a minimum of 30 hours a week for ISS. Number   of employees are specified into front-line and white collar  employees. Hours of training are hours registered as spent by internal and  external trainers and hours spent by participants while prepar- ing and participating. This includes any training participation,  paid or unpaid, as a result of employment within ISS. Incidents of discriminations are the registered number of inci- dent of discrimination on grounds of race, colour, sex, religion,  political opinion, national extraction, or social origin as defined  by ILO. Number of vehicles are all company vehicles: a vehicle that is  owned or leased by the company and provided to an employee   in order to carry out the requirements of their work i.e. to meet   a particular business need, including pool vehicles. Personal  company cars are excluded. Number of vehicle accidents are any contact made between  a vehicle and another vehicle, person or other object, regard- less of whether there is property damage or personal injury, but  excluding: \t damage to vehicle while it is parked in a legitimate   parking area; \t environmental damage (e.g. hail storms, damage from  wind, etc.); \t vandalism, break-ins; or \t stone chips. Electricity consumption is calculated from utility invoices or   meters. Fuel consumption is calculated using fuel purchases  e.g. invoices from the supplier. Business travel emissions are  calculated from data received from travel agencies and where  this is not possible, emissions are calculated on flight type  (short haul, medium haul, long haul), passenger kilometres  travelled and emission factors from recognised bodies. The source for emission factors for electricity and fuel is the  International Energy Agencys CO2 emissions from fuel combus- tion (2016 edition). Changes and future outlook  As we have done in 2017, we will continue on improving the  quality of our data in 2018. 3  37  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2017 Sarah puCCiO Receptionist, ISS Germany  This section presents our key performance indicators  and results against objec- tives and targets for 2017.
