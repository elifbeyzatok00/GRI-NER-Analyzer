Over the past 28 years, we  have stayed true to this basic fundamental,  continuously making a difference in the  communities where we have a presence. Today,  we provide clean drinking water not only in our  home country Singapore, but also to communities  in other parts of Asia, the Middle East and  North Africa.  In view of evolving needs in the communities  around us, we have expanded our environmental  solutions capabilities to include power  generation and waste-to-energy projects.  In all these projects, we remain dedicated to  our commitment to provide innovative solutions  that contribute to resource optimisation and  sustainable growth. We have always viewed sustainability  development and its responsibility central  to how we operate, and how we behave as a  corporate body. In this FY2016 sustainability  report, we have aligned our reporting to the  globally applicable GRI Sustainability Reporting  G4 Guidelines. OLIVIA LUM Executive Chairman &  Group Chief Executive Officer  Hyflux Ltd - Sustainability Report 2016 04 Our business operations are rooted in the  principles upheld by the United Nations  Global Compact in the areas of human rights,  labour standards, environmental protection  and anti-corruption. In the area of corporate  responsibility, we are committed to the best  practices in corporate governance and processes  that will enhance our Groups effectiveness,  ensure the appropriate degree of accountability  and transparency, and increase long-term  value and return to stakeholders. Listed on the  Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX), we subscribe to  the Code of Corporate Governance in Singapore  and comply with all applicable legislation and  recognised standards.  We have a robust human resource framework  which encompasses recruitment, retention,  development and human capital policies  and practices. Within this framework,  we provide a diversified, inclusive and fair  work environment where we encourage open  communication, employee engagement and  nurture our employees to their full potential.  All our employees are also expected to abide  by a Code of Ethics and Conduct. Our commitment to quality, environment, health  and safety standards is affirmed by the various  third-party certifications that we attained,  including ISO, OHSAS for occupational health  and safety, bizSafe, and National Sanitation  Foundation (NSF) International Standards for  safe drinking water. SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH IN OUR  BUSINESS AND COMMUNITIES Today, we operate desalination plants worldwide  that have a combined capacity to produce  more than 1.3 million cubic metres (m3) of water  per day. As we seek to extend the sustainability  impact of our business, we are actively pursuing  opportunities to offer our solutions in Asia,  the Middle East and North Africa region as  well as the Americas. At Hyflux, best practices  underscore all our projects. In Singapore, Hyflux plays a critical role in  national water security, being the current sole  provider of desalinated water supply to the  nation. Asias first integrated water and power  plant (IWPP), Tuaspring in Singapore, was the  first industrial plant to be awarded the Active,  Beautiful, Clean Waters certification by PUB,  Singapores National Water Agency. Water  reduction initiatives such as the collection and  recycling of rain water for use are implemented  at the plant. Tuaspring IWPP is also designed  to reduce energy footprint with its compact  and energy-efficient architecture while our  proprietary Kristal polymeric ultrafiltration  membranes, high efficiency motors and  advanced energy recovery technology lower  energy consumption in the seawater desalination  process. Tuaspring IWPP was awarded the Best   05 of the Best award at the Combined Cycle Journal  Best Practices Awards in 2016. The award  recognised the plants adoption of a fully- integrated enterprise asset management system  as a central platform for teams to work together,  which improved workplace efficiency and  minimised operations and maintenance costs.   Currently under construction, TuasOne Waste- to-Energy (WTE) plant is Singapores sixth and  largest WTE plant. Boasting one of the best  land utilisation factors in terms of incineration  capacity per unit floor area, it will also be one of  the most efficient in terms of energy recovery  per unit waste incinerated in the world, when  completed. Besides achieving business excellence,  Hyflux maintains good social and community  commitment. Over the years, Hyflux has  contributed towards various community  programmes in Singapore and the region.  Our community initiatives touch on the  environment, education, entrepreneurship,  and community outreach. In Singapore, a recent initiative in environmental  conservation saw Hyflux leveraging on  our technical expertise in water filtration  technologies and partnering Wildlife Reserves  Singapore in their Go Green for Wildlife  campaign. Hyflux developed and installed  customised potable water dispensers at the  Singapore Zoo to encourage park guests to  use refillable bottles. The aim was to reduce  generation of plastic waste from single-use  bottles and educate the public on recycling.  EMBEDDING SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS  PRACTICES NOW AND IN THE FUTURE Being at the forefront of sustainable  technologies means moving fast to adapt to  a rapidly changing reality. To thrive in this  environment, we adopt sustainable practices  that generate long-term value and drive  efficiency in our processes. Our internal  sustainability objectives are carefully defined  and implemented by ISO 9001, ISO 14001  and OHSAS 18001, management systems for  quality, environment, occupational health and  safety respectively. At Hyflux, innovation is ingrained into our  corporate culture. In the face of global urgency  to mitigate climate change, we believe it is the  key to finding robust solutions that optimise  resource usage. Since the signing of the Paris  Agreement on Climate Change in December  2015, we have seen a trend towards more  environmental-related regulations. For instance,  the Singapore government recently announced a  carbon tax on large direct emitters, as part of a  regulatory push towards a low-carbon economy.  While we will be affected by this regulation  through our Tuaspring Power Plant in the future,  we believe our continuous pursuit of resource- efficient solutions positions us well for future  regulatory changes.  CEOS MESSAGE  Hyflux Ltd - Sustainability Report 2016 06 In addition, we engage in research partnerships  with institutions and universities around the  world in our drive for innovative solutions.  Most recently, we signed a Memorandum  of Understanding (MoU) with the Nanyang  Environment Water and Research Institute  (NEWRI) in Singapore to collaborate on research  in biomimetic membranes, a potential low- energy alternative to conventional membranes  in desalination. Founded on the principle  of providing clean drinking  water to the world,  sustainability lies at the heart  of Hyfluxs business model. Moving forward, Hyflux will continue to engage  the community, and at the same time taking  a long-term strategic community approach  towards improving health. With Singapores  aging population and having one of the highest  incidence of diabetes globally, we intend to direct  our corporate social responsibility efforts more  towards such causes.  Motivated by a shared sense of purpose to  create a better world, our people work hard  every day towards our vision to offer sustainable  solutions that transform lives. We are deeply  grateful to our stakeholders for their support,  and are humbled by the opportunity and  responsibility they have given to us.

Hyflux exercises a precautionary approach  in managing its environmental impact. Data in this  sustainability report covers: 1. O&M projects (power and desalination plants):  Tuaspring IWPP (Singapore), SingSpring Desalination  Plant (Singapore) and Tianjin Dagang Desalination  Plant (China)  2. EPC projects (in construction phase): TuasOne WTE  Project (Singapore) and Qurayyat IWP (Oman)  3. Corporate offices in Singapore: Hyflux Innovation  Centre, Hyflux Building and Tuas Manufacturing Hub  ISO 14001 guidelines on environmental management  systems govern all of Hyfluxs operations, and all  construction sites are ISO 14001 certified. Before  the commencement of any construction project, all  necessary due diligence in the form of Environmental  Impact Assessments (EIAs) and/or Environmental,  Social and Health Impact Assessments (ESHIA) are  carried out. Close monitoring and follow-ups are  conducted throughout the construction phase until  project completion.  WATER USE AND REDUCTION The Groups core business is in water treatment  solutions. It aims to provide a clean and stable supply  of water to communities around the world.  PERFORMANCE In FY2016, total water withdrawal at our desalination  plants, EPC projects and corporate offices was 338  million m3. More than 99% of total water withdrawal  was seawater used in our desalination and power  plant operations2. Approximately 40% of the seawater  withdrawn for desalination is recovered through the  reverse osmosis process.   Testing and commissioning of the Tuaspring Power  Plant contributed to the increase in water withdrawn  in FY2015 as compared to FY2014. In FY2016,  the Tuaspring Power Plant began commercial operations  in March. Seawater intake is used by the power plant  as cooling water to condense steam and to cool  auxiliary services.   WATER WITHDRAWAL FOR  DESALINATION AND POWER  PLANT OPERATIONS 2  Desalination and power plant operations refer to data from Hyfluxs O&M Projects: Tuaspring IWPP (Singapore), SingSpring  Desalination Plant (Singapore) and Tianjin Dagang Desalination Plant (China). million m3  Hyflux Ltd - Sustainability Report 2016 22 3   Source of fuel caloric values: Carbon Dioxide Emissions Coefficients from US Energy Information Administration (2016). 292,920 FY2014 FY2015 304,202 FY2016 241,428 100,000 50,000 350,000 250,000 300,000 200,000 150,000 ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND  CLIMATE CHANGE Hyfluxs energy consumption and greenhouse gas  emissions emanate primarily from our desalination  and power plant operations, as well as our  construction projects.  PERFORMANCE In FY2016, Hyfluxs total energy consumption was  1.18 million gigajoules. Electricity used for desalination  operations comprised approximately 73% of Hyfluxs  total energy consumption, while power plant operations  contributed to about 17% of energy consumption.  Fuels used to operate generators and cranes at our  construction projects accounted for approximately 7% of  total energy consumption, while operations at corporate  facilities made up the rest.  For Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG), Hyflux generated  about 670.0 thousand tonnes of Scope 1 GHG emissions  in FY20163. A significant proportion of emissions can  be attributed to the combustion of natural gas to  generate electricity at the Tuaspring Power Plant,  which began commercial operations in March 2016.  With approximately 0.37 tonnes of GHG emissions  generated per MWh of electricity produced, we are in  line with industry standards.  TOTAL ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION  FOR DESALINATION PLANTS In terms of Scope 2 GHG emissions from electricity  consumption, Hyflux generated about 130.0 thousand  tonnes of carbon dioxide in FY2016. Hyflux has constantly pursued innovations that improve  energy efficiency, given the high energy requirement of  desalination. Our approach is evidenced by the lower  electricity consumption per m3 of desalinated water  produced by our newer plants when compared to our  older plants. COMPLIANCE WITh MANDATORY ENERGY  MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN SINGAPORE Hyfluxs two desalination plants in Singapore,  the Singspring and Tuaspring Desalination Plants,  have been in compliance with the National  Environmental Agency (NEA) Energy Conservation  Act since 2014. As per the requirements of the act,  we report the energy use of the plants periodically and  submit an annual Energy Efficiency Improvement Plan  for each plant. MWh  23 OUR ENVIRONMENT ENERGY MANAGEMENT AT hYFLUX INNOVATION CENTRE Hyflux Innovation Centre Recognised for its model of innovative environmental design and construction, Hyflux Innovation Centre received  the BCA Green Mark Platinum Award in FY2012. The building features environmentally sustainable designs such  as a solar-powered gym and a grey water recycling system that utilises Hyfluxs proprietary Kristal polymeric  ultrafiltration membranes. These innovative measures meet the most stringent criteria set by the Building &  Construction Authority of Singapore and lower energy consumption by approximately 30% and conserve about  15.6 million litres of water a year. For energy saving purposes, all common areas such as lift landings are also fitted  with motion sensor lightings.

The tighter emission standards mandated by  Singapores  National  Environment  Agency  include a new daily site-average limit for sulphur  dioxide (SO2) aimed at regulating SO2 emissions  from combustion sources.  The main processes encompassed by the flue gas  treatment system are:  i. Selective non-catalytic reduction to reduce  nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentration in the  flue gas  ii. Dry catalytic fabric filter system to remove  dust particles, acidic and other gaseous  pollutants MINIMISING ThE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT  OF CONSTRUCTION  Environmental Control Measures are in place to  ensure silted water runoff from the construction  site are treated before being discharged into  the public drainage system. Monitored by real- time CCTV cameras located near the discharge  outlets, alerts will be triggered when muddy  flows are captured. This is to ensure compliance  with the Total Suspended Solids (TSS) standard  for discharges.  TUASONE WASTE-TO-ENERGY PLANT TuasOne WTE, Singapore, Artists Impression  Hyflux Ltd - Sustainability Report 2016 26 ELO LAB Opening of ELO Lab at City Square Mall, Singapore The grand opening of our first ELO Lab was on 8 September 2016 at City  Square Mall in Singapore. Building and Construction Authority of Singapore  (BCA) has awarded ELO Lab with a BCA GREEN MARK GOLD PLUS  in 2017 under  the Green Mark for Retail scheme. This award marks another milestone in  our sustainability efforts in Hyfluxs projects and anchors our sustainability  practices in our operations.  The ELO Lab features 20 rooms, each with its personal bath which allows  guests to relax and enjoy the benefits of soaking in warm, oxygen-rich ELO  water in the complete privacy of a contemporary and tranquil setting.   27 OUR ENVIRONMENT AIR EMISSIONS Hyfluxs NOx and SO2 emissions are carefully managed  worldwide. We not only aim to meet all regulatory  standards in the jurisdictions in which our plants  operate, but also strive to achieve international  best practice.  COMPLIANCE WITh MANDATORY AIR  EMISSIONS LIMITS In December 2016, a source emission test was  conducted at the Tuaspring Power Plant to determine  the concentration levels of particulate mass (PM),  nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and sulphur  dioxide (SO2). The test results showed that emissions  from the plant is in compliance with regulatory  limits stipulated in the Environmental Protection  and Management Act, EPMA 2008 (Air Impurities)  Regulations 2001.  WASTE AND EFFLUENTS DESALINATION OPERATIONS Hyfluxs desalination plants use large volumes of  seawater to produce potable water. The by-products  of desalination, which include high-concentration brine  and backwash waste water, are discharged back into  the sea. Before release, online analysers installed  in the outfall pipe measure discharge flow rate,  dissolved oxygen, turbidity, conductivity, free chlorine,  temperature and pH. These parameters are monitored  continuously by a SCADA5 system to ensure they fall  within allowable limits. Samples are also sent regularly to external consultants to  measure suspended solids and chlorine levels to ensure  they are within regulatory allowable limits. In Singapore,  all parameters listed in NEA water quality standards of  Trade Effluent Discharge to Watercourse are also tested,  in accordance with regulatory allowable limits.  FY2016 AIR EMISSIONS FROM  TUASPRING POWER PLANT4 (TONNES) 327.0 0.4 Nitrogen  oxides (NOx) Sulphur  dioxide (SO2) 4  Air emissions data is based on measurements made at the Tuaspring Power Plant.  5  SCADA refers to supervisory control and data acquisition, a computer system used for gathering and analysing real time data. CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS The main types of waste generated at Hyfluxs  construction projects include scrap metal, wood and  small amounts of boiler slag. In addition, some waste  such as ash, soil and sludge wastes are collected and  treated before being sent to landfills.  In FY2016, approximately 770 tonnes of non-hazardous  waste was generated during the construction of the  TuasOne WTE project in Singapore and the Qurayyat  IWP in Oman. At the TuasOne WTE construction site,  there were 35 occurrences of TSS in excess of the  discharge limit. To prevent such occurrences, we have  put in place a 24-hour monitoring system which will  trigger alerts when muddy flows are captured.  Hyflux Ltd - Sustainability Report 2016 28 CORPORATE FACILITIES Hyfluxs corporate facilities produce mainly domestic and municipal waste, which we work with local municipalities to  recycle. Non-recyclable waste is treated and disposed of according to local regulatory requirements. SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE USE Hyflux is committed to resource optimisation while maintaining its product and service quality. Purchasing is  centralised at Hyfluxs headquarters to allow for the efficient allocation of resources.  177.6 thousand tonnes of non-renewable input materials, including ready-mix concrete, steel rebar, and structural  steel, were used for EPC projects. Hyflux uses recycled input materials whenever possible. 58.6 tonnes of materials  used in the construction of the Qurayyat IWP were recycled input materials. The recycled inputs were mainly  metal-based construction materials. 6  During construction stages, waste generated includes used engine oils and glass reinforced plastic pipes waste. 7  TuasOne WTE waste was tracked from May to December 2017. 8  Lab waste contains caustic substances, sulphuric acid and other chemicals.

For employees engaged in high-risk work, monthly training sessions and refresher courses are conducted.   AT PROJECT SITES, hEALTh AND SAFETY PRACTICES ARE REINFORCED IN ThE FOLLOWING WAYS:  37 OUR PEOPLE HMM GOT SAFETY! As  part  of  the  Annual  QEHS  Awareness Promotion Programme,  the HMM Got Safety competition  was held in January 2016 at Hyfluxs  Tuas Manufacturing Hub in Singapore.  Employees  from  three  different  departments presented their ideas  for improving QEHS performance  to a panel of judges comprising  management staff and non-executive  representatives. Aimed at encouraging  employees to inculcate safety values  into their daily work routine, the event  drew many useful recommendations.  These recommendations were then  considered by Hyfluxs Workplace  Safety and Health committee, with  appropriate measures implemented  after further refinement.  Hyflux Membrane Manufacturing (HMM) Got Safety competition  Hyflux Ltd - Sustainability Report 2016 38 FORMAL WORKER REPRESENTATION   All our employees at our EPC sites and Singapore  corporate offices are represented in formal joint  management-worker health and safety committees  that monitor occupational health and safety issues.    EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE All employees on Hyfluxs sites are made aware of  Emergency Preparedness and Response procedures  and evacuation plans in cases of non-routine incidents,  accidents and emergency situations.  CONTRACTORS  Hyfluxs contractors are expected to comply with  safety standards that are aligned with the Groups  policies. To ensure compliance, certain conditions are  stipulated and made known to all contractors during  the pre-contract stage.  Hyfluxs key management, employees and contractors on-site  39 PERFORMANCE REVIEWS Performance appraisals are conducted annually at Hyflux. Corporate employees are evaluated by their managers  and given feedback on their strengths and areas for improvement. Employees career progression and rewards are  determined at this annual appraisal. Key performance indicators for the next year are set during the session and a  training needs analysis is conducted to identify skill gaps. Employees are thereafter provided coaching and training  sessions tailored to help improve their performance. TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT  Hyfluxs learning and development practices are based on ISO 9001 standards. In FY2016, training hours per employee  in Singapore improved significantly from 15.4 hours per employee to 25.5 hours per employee, exceeding ISOs target  of 16 hours per employee.  We believe in nurturing the full potential of our employees by giving them opportunities to develop their careers and  capabilities through training courses, on-the-job training, job rotations, overseas postings and mentorship. We have  programmes for skills management and lifelong learning that support the continued employability of employees.  Hyflux also conducts a range of in-house customised courses. Courses in the following categories are made available  to all corporate employees: OUR PEOPLE TALENT DEVELOPMENT Performance  Reviews  Training Talent  Retention Talent  Acquisition Welfare Orientation  Series  Personal  Effectiveness  Series  Managerial   Series  Internal Subject  Matter Expert  Series  Technical Lecture  Series   Hyflux Ltd - Sustainability Report 2016 40 TALENT ACQUISITION  In Singapore, Hyflux participates in the national effort  to groom talents from the community. We are currently  partnering the government in initiatives such as the  Singapore-Industry Scholarship (SgIS), Young Talent  Programme Scholarship (YTP) and SkillsFuture Earn  and Learn Programme. The SgIS and YTP programmes  are scholarships offered to students pursuing their  undergraduate studies at local tertiary institutions.  Upon graduation, these students join Hyflux and  undergo a rigorous management trainee programme,  aimed at nurturing their leadership ability. Over the past  five years, we have sponsored 10 students through these  two programmes. The SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme is a  work-learn programme to support fresh graduates  transition into the workforce. Through an 18-month job  attachment, students are trained in industry-relevant  competencies. Still in the pilot phase, Hyflux has  two participating students stationed at its Tuaspring  Power Plant. TALENT RETENTION Hyflux places great emphasis on building our bench  strength to bring the Group into our next phase of  growth. With global operations spanning the Middle  East, Africa, Latin America and Asia, Hyflux encourages  Singapore-based employees to move geographically  to gain a deeper understanding of overseas markets,  develop their leadership capabilities and foster  global mindsets.  Localisation is another important pillar for our overseas  operations and expansion. Locally-recruited staff are  encouraged to take on key roles, as they can add value  with their local socio-political and cultural insights.  In FY2016, two Omani nationals were selected for  Hyfluxs Internship Programme, conducted annually  at our headquarters in Singapore. While recruitment  is typically limited to Singapore-based students, the  programme was opened to students in Oman last year.  With the upcoming completion of the Qurayyat IWP  in 2017, the aim was to raise awareness of the project  among the local community and attract young local  talents to join Hyflux.    41 OUR PEOPLE WELFARE Hyfluxs employee policies meet all requirements of the Employment Act (Singapore). In FY2016, Hyflux implemented  two days of eldercare leave for employees to better care for their elders at home. To promote an active lifestyle,  the Group also organised various health-related workshops, as well as lunchtime yoga and kickboxing classes.  Every year, Hyflux organises a Bring Your Child to Work day to allow our employees children to have a glimpse of  their parents work environment, while enjoying child-friendly activities such as magic shows, movie screenings and  food festivals.  To promote a healthy work-life balance, the Human Resources department tracks overtime hours to minimise the risk  of employee burnout. If overtime hours exceed a certain threshold, the relevant Head of Department is notified.

In June  2016, Hyflux also hosted and participated in one of three co-creation  workshops to discuss the basic foundation for the business model of  the Asia P3 Hub. After completion of all three co-creation workshops,  the Asia P3 Hub established its cross-sector partnership approach  to bring together companies, start-ups, non-profit organisations,  and the government to develop market-driven solutions to solve the  issue of water in Asia. In FY2016, a total contribution of over S$150,000 was made by Hyflux towards community investments and scholarship  awards in Singapore and the region.
