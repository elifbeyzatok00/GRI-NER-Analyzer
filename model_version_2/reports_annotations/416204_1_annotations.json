When we published our first report in 2008, the world  had been plunged into turmoil triggered by the sub- prime crisis in the U.S. home loan market.  Economists suggest that we are still to emerge  completely from that great recession as it is now  called.  In fact the past decade has been marked by several  disruptive shifts in our societys political, economic  and social order, accompanied by a gradual and  definite deterioration in our planets ecological  stability. What implications this has for governments,  business and for common citizens remains a matter  of vigorous debate. But what is clear is that business  must be more proactive and resilient in shaping  movement towards a better society and a safer  planet. One positive trend that has emerged is the increased  spotlight on the role of the corporation as an agent of  responsible behavior. Catalyzed by several  convergent forces – a decisive shift in business  leaderships thinking on these issues, clear evidence  of linkages with business outcomes, peer pressure,  legislation and brand leverage – the world is seeing  significant traction in the adoption of sustainable  practices by companies. I am glad this is happening  and hope that the momentum continues to increase.  Let me now present the key highlights for the  reporting year while simultaneously placing it in the  context of the progress we have made in the last  decade Ecological Sustainability:  When we started a formal  sustainability program in 2007-08, we had set for  ourselves clear and ambitious goals on Energy, Water,  Waste and Biodiversity.

Narayan Vice President and Head, Sustainability Email: narayan.pan@wipro.com Report Profile 1.1 1.1  *   A list of all entities included in the consolidated financial statements is given in pages 95-98 of Wipro Annual  Report for FY 2016-17. However, the scope of this report is restricted to Wipro Technologies, Wipro Infotech and  Wipro Business Process Services. The GRI Content Index in accordance with option Comprehensive as prescribed by GRI G4 Guidelines details the  coverage of relevant information. The index is available at http://wiprosustainabilityreport.com/16-17/?q=gri- index Approach Like our previous reports, we continue to adopt the stakeholder format of reporting. Given that stakeholder  inclusion and engagement is such a crucial cornerstone of the Aa1000 and the GRI frameworks, we believe  that the stakeholder format is more appropriate for focusing attention on key material aspects for each of  the stakeholders. Each individual section on this report is structured as our response to concerns of the  respective stakeholder identified through the materiality assessment. Additionally, for financial year 2016- 17 we have followed the ISO26000 guidelines  We have opted to conduct an independent assurance of our sustainability report as part of our company  policy. DNV GL has been engaged to verify the content of this report.

Determining materiality helps an  organization to understand issues that are relevant to its stakeholders over the short, medium and long  term. This understanding, in turn, makes sustainability strategy and action more in tune with stakeholder  priorities, and more robust in terms of creating impact and navigating risk. The process has to be  centered at the intersection of organizational relevance and stakeholder priorities. In this section, we  discuss the rationale, approach and outcomes of our materiality determination exercise.  Our Approach The questions Who are your stakeholders? and What are their material issues? are important starting  steps and we consider these questions as the building blocks of our sustainability initiatives and reporting.  Based on GRI G4 Guidelines and AA 1000 principles of Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Materiality and  Sustainability Context, we have adopted the following approach to determine materiality for our company. Defining stakeholders Identifying issues  Seeking stakeholder  feedback  Benchmarking  Asessing internally Prioritizing issues  Seeking stakeholder  feedback  Understanding sustainability  context  Figuring in intrinsic worth About this Report Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 21 should reflect the complexities of multiple  environmental, social and governance  dimensions that are relevant to Wipro as a  company and to the IT Services sector. It is  also important to look at the probability and  impact of the issues over a long period of  time. The societal and global context could  shift and what would have been peripheral in  the short term could eventually become  central and critical.   2. Individual stakeholder view: The conventional  materiality matrix typically places issues  based on relevance to the company and  relevance to stakeholders; however, given that  a company will have multiple stakeholders  who are often very different in the roles that  they play, it makes little sense to talk about  stakeholder relevance as an abstract, macro  notion unless it is mapped to the next level of  detail to the individual stakeholder. 3. Intrinsic worth: In the conventional  materiality matrix of Relevance to Wipro and  Relevance to Stakeholders, certain critical  sustainability issues may not score high on  either of the dimensions. And yet, they have  an intrinsic worth that compels serious and  deep engagement. Therefore, our new  framework will look at all these three factors. Materiality Recalibration Materiality is informed by the socio-economic  context in which an organization operates and  the needs of its primary and/or influencing  stakeholders. It requires us to keep ears to the  ground by understanding stakeholders  perceptions and expectations, the business  context, local and macro developments and  changing thresholds of sustainability risks and  opportunities over time.  The Driving Principles In addition to the classic framework that maps  issues on the basis of Relevance to the  Organization and Relevance to Stakeholders,  our materiality framework incorporates the  following driving principles: 1. Incorporation of multiple dimensions:  Material dimensions vary from one  organization to another as the context of each  company and the industry or geography in  which it is operating is not necessarily the  same. The issues faced by a business can be  different even within the same sector and  geography. The materiality determination   Material issues and their relative importance to Wipro and our stakeholders are not static and are likely to  change with time. In line with this, we followed a threefold approach based on the Five Part Materiality Test  proposed by AccountAbility. We try to present a 360 degree perspective on our business and ecosystem  through this process and its outcomes.  Relevance to Wipro Relevance to stakeholders Stakeholder Feedback Test 4: Stakeholder behavior and concerns Test 5: Societal norms Internal Assessment Test 1: Direct economic impacts Test 2: Organizational values & commitments External Benchmarking Test 3: Business peer-based norms Stakeholder Identification Defining who an organizations primary stakeholders are, can be relatively straightforward within the  business ecosystem. But when it comes to larger social and environmental contexts, the meaning of  stakeholders can assume a form that is unduly large or amorphous. Here it becomes important to  understand and identify those attributes of stakeholders that makes them important to business and  necessitate meaningful engagement. We began our identification by defining those attributes and then  mapping our value chain to determine stakeholders who qualify the attributes. Those who can impact or  are impacted by  our business Influence Interest Those who can influence  the way we operate Those who are interested in our  success or whose wellbeing is of  interest to us Impact Stakeholders with  legitimate claims, either  contractual or  ethical Urgency Diverse perspectives Stakeholders with a relationship  or claim of a time-sensitive  nature Stakeholders who can further  organizations understanding of  an issue Legitimacy We also looked at three additional factors while finalizing our stakeholders. These led us to identify the following eight stakeholders groups. Readers will note that, except for minor  semantic differences, these are the same stakeholders that appear in our previous reports. Therefore, the  materiality recalibration exercise essentially reaffirmed our earlier decision in this regard. While the first four have direct and operational/ business value chain impacts, the other four are part of the  larger community and society that we operate in. 1. Employees 5. The Education ecosystem: Partners and Academic Institutes 2. Customers 6. Communities and Civil Society Networks 3. Investors 7. Government and Policy Networks 4. Suppliers 8. The Young Citizen and Future Generations Identification of Issues About this Report Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 22  The sustainability context of each of the issues or dimensions identified was detailed so as to understand  their materiality to our business and industry. Following this, a prioritization exercise was undertaken by  looking at the intrinsic worth of each issue as well as its relative priority. The stakeholders feedback was  also taken into account by incorporating their ratings for each of these dimension against four criteria of 1)  Relevance to Wipros business operations; 2) Relevance to stakeholders; 3) Impact; and 4) Time horizon of  impact.  In 2014-15, we held a formal consultation with senior leadership, employees and external sustainability  experts from industry and academia, on stakeholder priorities, concerns and expectations. We also  considered inputs from customers and investors. The collective outcome of the consultation process was a  revised materiality matrix. Since then, we have revisited the materiality matrix/map each year, and consider  any refresh that it requires, based on latest stakeholder feedback and input.  Stakeholder inclusiveness is central to the materiality determination process. It is important to consider  reasonable expectations and interests of stakeholders so as to provide a balanced view of the issues that  emerge. At Wipro, we engage with our stakeholders regularly to understand their concerns and develop  plans to address those concerns.  From the above mentioned sources, a universe of all issues or dimensions that could be material for our  businesses was identified.  Prioritization of material issues Stakeholder feedback A significant part of materiality determination stems from the organizations overall mission, values,  commitments and competitive strategy as well as the impact of or on its economic performance. An  internal perspective on risks as identified through organizational processes like risk assessment studies  and audits or self-assessments using disclosure frameworks is also considered in the process. Listed  below are the sources of information. Internal assessment   Financial reports (Annual reports & Form 20F)  Sustainability reports  Disclosures (Dow Jones Sustainability (DJSI), Carbon Disclosure Project (CEP), Vigeo etc.)  Other risk assessment studies & audit reports We conducted an extensive review of literature to identify issues considered as material and identified as  risks by our business peers and also to understand expectations expressed in international standards and  agreements.

We adopted the following steps to identify material aspects for reporting.  Mapping the identified material issues to GRI Topics  Defining the boundary of each Topic based on impacts  Deciding the scope of reporting for other issues/dimensions  From the universe of issues or dimensions that was identified as material, a total of 20 topics have been  finalized for reporting. Depending on the relative importance, the other identified issues identified will be  detailed in the respective sections as part of disclosure of management approach. The outcomes of the  process were shared with all relevant functions for review and the consequent feedback was incorporated.

The topics highlighted in italics are not part of GRI standard. About this Report Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 25  Freedom of  Association and  Collective Bargaining The right of workers (and employers)  to organize collectively in organizations  of their own choice is a fundamental  provision of the UN Universal  Declaration of Human Rights Capacity Building and  Career Development The quality of employees is considered  to be an important source of  competitive advantage to any  organization. Hence maintaining and  improving the human capital of the  company, particularly through training  that expands the knowledge base of  employees, is a key differentiator. Employees Workplace Sustainability  Energy Global Supply Chain (includes  Business Travel and commute)  contribute to 77% of overall  environmental impact. Studies estimate that the ICT systems  now use 1,500 terawatt-hours of  power per year which is about 10% of  the world's total electricity generated.  Jevons paradox proposes that the  increase in efficiency which comes  along with technological progress  tends to increase (rather than  decrease) the rate of consumption of  that resource. Emissions Global Supply Chain (includes  Business Travel and commute)  contribute to 77% of overall  environmental impact. Emissions are a major contributor to  climate change. As demand for ICT is  expected to quadruple by 2020, the  total carbon footprint of ICT sector is  set to grow at 6% per year. Data center  footprint is expected to triple by 2020.  To limit the negative impacts f climate  change, it is critical to limit the  temperature increase to 2 degree  celsius above pre industrial levels. Water Operations in India as they  constitute 80% of overall footprint  and higher impact World Economic Forum's Global Risk  Report 2015 identifies water crisis as  one of the top high impact and high  likelihood risks. The UN Water  forecasts that 1.8 billion people will be  living in countries or regions with  absolute water scarcity and two thirds  of the world population under water  stress conditions by 2025. Current & future generations Ecological Responsibility About this Report Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 26  Effluents and Waste Operations in India as they  constitute 80% of overall footprint  and higher impact Unmanaged disposal of waste and  effluents can have significant impact  on receiving ecosystem and this in  turn can affect the quality of the water  supply available to the organization  and its relationship with communities  & other water users. Reduction of  waste and effluents can contribute  directly to lower costs for materials,  processing and disposal at the same  time reduce financial risks from the  loss of raw materials, remediation  costs, regulatory action as well as  reputation.

It is critical for business to engage  with the social and ecological  challenges that face humanity in a  deep and meaningful manner with  long term commitment; for that is the  only way by which real change can  happen on the ground. It is these  engagements which gives the  organizations license to operate. Social Responsibility Investors Suppliers* The responsibility of the business  does not ends within the boundary of  the organization. The suppliers play  critical role in the sustainability and  hence issues faced by the supplier  ecosystem should be considered by  the organization for effective risk  mitigation. * As described in the section Our Value Chain, our suppliers are of three categories – Human Resources, Service  Providers and Materials & Equipment Providers.

About this Report Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 39  Risk Management Risk Management at Wipro is an enterprise wide function that aims at assessing threats to business  sustainability and mitigating those threats. The function is backed by a qualified team of specialists with  deep industry experience who develop frameworks and methodologies for assessing and mitigating risks.  Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) works in close co-ordination with Business teams, Legal, Finance,  Human Resources, Quality, office of the CIO, Delivery, Internal Audit and other Functional teams. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) enables and supports business objectives through risk-intelligent  assessment and mitigation mechanisms while providing reassurance to all stake holders including  Customers, Shareholders and Employees. This is done by identifying, assessing and mitigating risks within  key business and functional processes through a collaborative approach. As part of this, the leveraging of  technology and tools for continuous monitoring and reporting of risks is crucial. The risk landscape in the current business environment is changing dynamically with the dimensions of  Cyber security, Information Security & Business Continuity, Data Privacy and Large Deal Execution figuring  prominently in the risk charts of most organizations. To effectively mitigate these risks, we have employed a  risk management framework which helps proactively identify, prioritize and mitigate risks. The framework  is based on principles laid out in the four globally recognized standards.  Orange Book by UK Government Treasury  COSO; Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated.

Business Continuity management risks arising out of  global operations like IT outages, Cyber, natural disasters,  pandemic, terror and unrest, power disruptions etc.  which will bring down the availability of People, Technology  and Facility Effective implementation of Business Continuity  Management System (BCMS) framework aligned to ISO  22301 across accounts, service functions and various  locations. The system will have a comprehensive and  integrated readiness of the BCMS requirements that will  help plan, coordinate and execute the strategies  effectively. Geo political risk arising out of entering into contracts in a  new country. An assessment of doing business in a new country is done  in order to analyze the feasibility of doing business based  on the countrys economic stability, corruption index,  investment opportunities, ease of doing business and  physical safety. Risk of protectionism policies impacting the business Appropriate measures are being taken to provide  uninterrupted high quality services to the clients at all  geographies. Risk Governance  The Board Committee on Audit, Risk and Compliance consisting of non-executive independent directors  has the responsibility of periodically reviewing the companys policies for risk assessment and risk  management and assess the steps taken to control such risks. The committee also reviews and approves  the Strategic and Operating Plan of Enterprise Risk Management function of the Company. Concomitantly,  the internal Audit function at Wipro also plays a key role in identifying and highlighting potential risks to  Board Committee. High risks including concerns related to Ombudsprocess, sexual harassment prevention  and critical security incidents are tracked and reviewed periodically. They are reported to the Audit  committee of the board every quarter. Customer related issues and key employee engagement  developments are also reviewed by the board. About this Report Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 42  Code of Conduct  Wipro has a corporation wide Code of Business  Conduct (COBC) that provides the broad direction  as well as specific guidelines for all business  transactions. The COBC is applicable to all  business practices and employees, contractor  employees and consultants. It covers critical  aspects like customer relations, protecting  customer information, supplier selection, conflicts  of interest, gifts, entertainment & business  courtesies, communicating with the public,  confidential information, intellectual property,  competitive/business intelligence, protecting the  privacy of employee and personal information,  business records and internal controls,  safeguarding company assets, insider trading,  anti-trust and fair competition, anti-corruption,  political involvement/lobbying, global trade;  human rights, diversity and non-discrimination,  harassment-free workplace, safe and healthy  work environment, and sustainability and  corporate citizenship.  The COBC is socialized at multiple points of an  employees lifecycle - it is first covered as part of  the induction program of new hires and  subsequently, every employee has to take an  online test annually to assert their familiarity with  the tenets of the COBC. The code can be accessed  at   The COBC is the central document on which the  Companys ethics compliance message is  disseminated to all employees. Hence, it is  constantly reviewed by the Legal & Compliance  team to ensure it stays current with trends and  changes in corporate ethics, benchmarking with  the best and most ethical companies in the world,  and keeping up with the statutory changes.  Wipro will take appropriate disciplinary action  including termination against any employee,  agent, contractor or consultant, whose actions are  found to violate the terms of COBC. We have a zero  tolerance policy for non-compliance with the non- negotiable aspects of COBC e.g. child labor, anti- corruption etc. 360 degree feedback process rates  http://www.wipro.com/documents/investors/pdf- files/code-of-business-conduct-and-ethics.pdf  Wipro managers on how well they align with the  principle of unyielding integrity. Compliance Framework Compliance processes at Wipro have the oversight  of the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee,  and the Corporate Compliance Committee. We  have a dedicated in-house Legal & Compliance  team focused on compliance to identify and  analyse the legal and regulatory changes resulting  in creation and update of policies and processes.  The team oversees compliance with local  business laws and regulatory compliance in each  of the countries we operate. It is important to  assure the stakeholders that internal systems are  fair and just. Global Immigration Management  System (GIMS), Integrated Risk management and  Human Resources have been identified as  functions with material compliance related risks.  As a result, the legal and compliance team  reviews the process of these functions.  Dashboards are maintained across Business  Units and Support Functions and reviewed for  contractual compliances periodically. Suitable  external consulting firms are engaged for  Corporate, Taxation and Labour law compliance  activities.  GSCCP Program In 2014, the Global Compliance Management  Project was started with the objective of  documenting (replace with adopting) a global  statutory compliance certification program  (GSCCP) framework and automating the  framework. The project covers all functions across  24 countries, including India. Under this project,  Compliance Landscaping is being done under the  broad categories of Corporate and Commercial  laws; Industry specific laws; Employment, Human  Resource & Immigration laws; Environment,  Health & safety; and IT and Data. An external  service provider has been engaged for this project.  A compliance tracking tool has also been  implemented, to track statutory compliance  across global operations and ensure compliance  with all relevant legal requirements. Audits for  select suppliers are also planned for next year.  Anti-Corruption About this Report Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 43  Our code of conduct and the supplier code of  conduct cover requirements of FCPA (Foreign  corrupt practices act) and the UK anti-bribery act.  High risk functions assessed are procurement, TA,  CMF, HR, FMG, Sales and the geographies  selected are based on the relative ranking in  Transparency International ranking of countries  we operate in.  Training programs on ethical compliance and the  Ombudsprocess are regularly conducted at  various leadership levels. At these interactive  sessions, key applicable ethical policies are  explained, with real organizational case studies  and relevant judicial pronouncements on ethical  matters. Statistical data on the complaints /  concerns received by the Ombudspersons, and  the processes adopted to address these are  shared with the participating leaders. Every new  hire is required to attend an ethical compliance  session titled Spirit of Wipro Session where key  aspects of the ethics framework are  communicated. We have an annual test and  certification for all employees on the Code Of  Business Conduct. Additionally, specific training  through e-learning modules is rolled out on  various subjects including anti-corruption, Gifts,  entertainment, and Business Courtesies, and is  mandated for all employees in a phased manner.     Other modes of maintaining awareness of ethical  compliance among employees include focused  training sessions organized for various functions-  Procurement, Operations and Administration,  Human Resources, Finance and Accounts,  Internal Audit. At these classroom sessions, key  policies relevant to the participants are discussed  and feedback is taken for addressing any changes  to processes and policies. Mailers on Compliance  are periodically circulated by the ombudsprocess  group through emails, posters at key employee  access locations. External Trainings are organized  regularly for Legal & Compliance, Finance,  Accounts, and Internal Audit teams on anti- corruption laws of USA and UK, best practices on  implementing anti-corruption processes in  organizations. These sessions are conducted by  US external counsel and consulting firms. In  accordance with mandatory local law, all  manager-level employees located in the states of  California and Connecticut within the US are  required to undergo training and certification on  prevention of sexual harassment. In addition,  special trainings are conducted for Prevention of  Sexual Harassment Committee panel members,  and SOPs are published for better governance  encompassing the requirements under law on  sexual harassment.  There have been no significant instances of non- compliance in the last financial year. The Ombudsprocess Wipro is committed to the highest standards of  openness, probity and accountability. An  important aspect of accountability and  transparency is a robust mechanism that allows  partners, customers, suppliers and other  members of the public, to voice concerns in a  responsible and effective manner. What this  means in concrete terms is that whenever a  stakeholder discovers information that reveals  serious malpractice, impropriety, abuse or  wrongdoing within the organization then the  stakeholder should be able to report without fear  of reprisal Anyone can report a concern to the  ombudsperson online at www.wiproombuds.com In Wipro, our Chief Ombuds-person works with  designated Ombuds-persons in each Business  Unit. The process ensures confidential and  anonymous submissions. An organization wide  multi-lingual Ombudsprocess is available 24 x 7  (phone and internet enabled) for all our  stakeholders.  Complete details of the Ombuds process for  employees is available at the following links in our  website. Employees - For non-employees - In 2016-17, 1692 complaints were received via the  ombudsprocess and 1709 complaints were    http://www.wipro.com/documents/investors/pdf- files/wipro_ombuds_process.pdf   http://www.wipro.com/documents/investors/pdf- files/wipro-ombudsman-process-non- employees.pdf  About this Report Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 44  closed. All cases were investigated and actions  taken as deemed appropriate. Based on self- disclosure data, 25% of these were reported  anonymously. The top categories of complaints  were people processes (34%) and workplace  concerns and harassment (22%). A total of 116 complaints of sexual harassment  were raised in the calendar year 2016, of which  102 cases were disposed and appropriate actions were taken in all cases within the statutory  timelines. This includes all cases reported to the  system, even if unsubstantiated. In some cases, a  clear action has been taken (warning or  separation) and the rest have either not  progressed due to lack of information or resolved  through counselling. The ombudsprocess statistics for 16-17 and  earlier years are provided below and this  information is periodically communicated to the  board.

We  have location registers at all our locations which  can be used by any stakeholder group to express  their concerns. Wipro also invites experts in the  field of crime and investigation to conduct master  classes on topics relevant to the business.  The concerns about unethical or unlawful  behavior, and matters related to organizational  integrity which are mandated by law to report are  communicated to the relevant agencies as and  when such issues happen. In FY 16-17, there was  no instance of ethical or unlawful activity which  required seeking external advice or reporting to  external agency.

We examine global sustainability trends and try to  position our strategic approach in this larger context.  A thriving global society, now and in the future,  depends on the stable functioning of all  interacting components of the Earth System  (ecology and society). Unfortunately, scientific  evidence indicates that human influence has  altered Earth System processes to a point that we  have begun transgressing planetary boundaries  that have kept civilization safe for the past 10,000  years. Scientists claim that we have entered a new  geological epoch 'the Anthropocene' -  characterized by manmade actions interfering  and changing the environment. The changes in the Earth system can be  understood through the framework of nine  planetary boundaries proposed by a team led by  Johan Rockstrom at the Stockholm Resilience  Centre, it shows that at least three planetary  boundaries have been transgressed (rate of  biodiversity loss, human interference with the  nitrogen and phosphorus cycle), while some are at  risk of being surpassed (land-system change, and  ocean acidification). While the world income (GDP per capita) has  increased exponentially over the past century,  income inequality did decrease till the 70's-80's  and is now showing a rebound to levels seen near  2.1  the beginning of the century (IMF). About a billion  people are estimated to be living in extreme  poverty today. A quarter of all children under the  age of five years is estimated to be stunted due to  malnutrition. By the close of 2016, 65.6 million  people worldwide were forcibly displaced due to  violence, conflict, persecution or human rights  abuse. The worldwide refugee population is nearly  5 million, with 84% of them hosted by developing  regions. . 775 million adults and 250 million  children  worldwide lack basic literacy skills, and  of this, more than 60 per cent of them are women.  2015 was the year when three landmark  agreements on human development were signed:  the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a  new framework for global sustainable  development financing, and a new climate change  agreement at the COP 21 in Paris. The objectives  of the seventeen SDGs are to end poverty, protect  the planet, and ensure prosperity for all as part of  a new sustainable development agenda. The COP  21 at Paris concluded with a legally binding and  universal agreement on reducing greenhouse gas  emissions to limit the global temperature increase  to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels  climate, from all world nations. Even though the  outcome of the summit can be considered very  little and too late, the summit succeeded in  reaching at a global consensus for a complex  problem. Also it resulted in countries committing  on post-2020 climate actions they intended to  take under the new international agreement,  known as their Intended Nationally Determined  Contributions (INDCs). Implementation on the  SDGs began in 2016, and the first progress report  was published in 2017, accompanied by the  launch of the Global SDG Indicators Database,  which presents global, regional, and country-level  data. Countries have also undertaken separate  voluntary national reviews. The UNs Sustainable Goals Progress Report,  2017, indicates that while progress has been  made on the 17 goals, the pace of progress needs  to be much faster to achieve the agreed on 2030  milestones. For instance, while the rate of child  mortality has sharply declined, the pace of progress in reducing maternal mortality must  double to reach the 2030 target. Progress is also  inconsistent across demographic groups and  nations. For instance, women spent almost three  times the number of hours that men do, on unpaid  domestic work and care-giving. Women also  continue to be under-represented in parliaments  and corporates, especially at senior and middle  management levels. Another area of growing  concern, worldwide, is youth unemployment.  While mobile cellular coverage is almost universal  now, internet and fixed broadband services  remain out of reach in many parts of the  developing world. Not all trends are discouraging,  though. Manufacturing emission levels are lower  across regions, and investment in R&D continues  to rise. For business, these results and trends  would mean a need to think widely in terms of  defining vulnerable groups and materiality, and  step up their efforts to partner with government  and civil society to create change.  The involvement of business in SDG action and  progress is considered an integral part of  governmental plans, and is widely referred by  around 60% of countries that carried out a  Voluntary National Review. In countries like India,  which is considered a land of opportunity for  sustainable development, the SDGs are expected  to create huge opportunities for sustainable  business in the areas of food & agriculture, cities,  energy and health. Across the world, businesses  across the world must be willing partners in the  journey towards progress- by bringing technology,  ingenuity, enterprise building capacities and  creating markets for development of sustainable  alternatives. In this, business has to collaborate  with all stakeholders across its value chain and  with the community to transition to a future that  is equitable to all stakeholders and is cognizant of  interdependent issues and planetary boundaries. What follows is an articulation of eight  significant sustainability mega forces or trends  and their implications for business. Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 51  Climate Change Current Scenario:  The fifth assessment report of IPCC asserts with greater  certainty that climate change is a reality. The report says that \"the  atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have  diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse  gases have increased\" and \"human influence on the climate system is  evident from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the  atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and  understanding of the climate system\". Climate change can directly or indirectly lead to hunger, water scarcity,  health problems, and poverty over varying time frames. It can impact  employment and livelihood opportunities thereby limiting opportunities to  access education, housing and energy. It can also cause large scale  migration and displacement as a result of climate change related  emergencies like extreme heat, floods and droughts, tropical storms and  changing patterns of infection of diseases. The cost of climate change is  both financial and social. The IPCC AR 5 predicts global mean losses to be  in the order of 1 to 5% of GDP for 4C of warming with even higher regional  losses. Inaction can create risks of major disruption to economic and social  and herein lies the implications for businesses. Discussions on climate change have moved from ascertaining the  probability and estimating risks and costs to developing strategies for  mitigation and adaptation. The Fifth Assessment report talks about  adaptation and mitigation strategies that need to be implemented.  Businesses are expected to play a greater role in implementing those  Global Economic System Current Scenario:  Business Implications: The global economic system is vulnerable to multiple  risks which have the potential to undermine financial and social stability of  societies. The risks include asset bubbles in major economies, failure of a  major financial mechanism or institution, fiscal crises, unmanageable  inflation or prolonged ultra-low inflation or deflation in a major economy or  region (World Risks Report, 2016). There is also a growing problem of  structural unemployment in advanced economies. Even though the world  has recovered from the latest financial crisis, the danger of complacency  compared to other risks exists. The volatile nature of economic environment and  the multitude of risks that can disrupt the financial order pose serious  threat to long time sustainability of businesses. Businesses need to be  alert and should proactively address critical areas of concerns to insulate  themselves from any potential crises.  They should avoid unduly large debt  and related financial exposures and exercise prudence in their risk taking  strategies Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 52  strategies. WRI, CDP and WWF launched ' Mind the Science, Mind the Gap'  initiative to develop sector specific methodologies to help companies set  science based emission reduction targets based on IPCC's  recommendations  i.e. what is required by companies across different  sectors to limit global temperatures rise by 2 degree centigrade by 2100  from pre-industrial levels. Businesses will face a multitude of risks and  opportunities related to climate change. The risks include (a) increased  energy and other resource costs (b) increased insurance costs related to  extreme and adverse climate events and (c) potential future litigation,  claims and legal action. On the other hand, opportunities for businesses lie  in the field of emissions trading, carbon credits, carbon offsetting or  ecofriendly technologies or products like hybrid cars and renewable energy.  Process improvements that can save energy and reduce GHG emissions  can also enhance brand value and reputation. The opportunities are not  without challenges - both scientific and political. For example, renewables  face the challenges of energy density, efficiency, scalability and grid  integration while offsetting programs like large scale afforestation can  adversely impact other resources due to land use change - like water and  biodiversity. Business Implications: Water Crises Current Scenario: Global water demand (in terms of withdrawals) is  projected to increase by 55 percent by 2050. Currently agriculture accounts  for 69% of the world's total freshwater withdrawal and a further 19%  increase of agricultural water consumption is expected by 2050. But the  rise in demand of water is mainly because of growing demands from  manufacturing (400 percent), thermal electricity generation (140 percent)  and domestic use (130 percent). Water and food security are inextricably linked. Multiple factors like  population, shift in food consumption patterns (non-local and higher  protein food) and shift towards mechanization without the application of  local and traditional resources, knowledge and skills are increasing the  demand for water. If this situation is not resolved, the impending water  crisis can threaten food security. Urbanization supported by the increase in tertiary economic activities  (services) and industrialization have also contributed to the misuse of  water resources - primarily driven by the shift to water being viewed as yet  other resource that an external entity ( the state in most cases) is supposed  to provide. This situation is likely to be exacerbated further due to Climate  change driven changes in precipitation patterns. The UN Water forecasts that 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or  regions with absolute water scarcity and two thirds of the world population  will be living in water-stressed areas by 2025 (UN Water, 2007). World  Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 53  Economic Forum's Global Risk Report 2016 reflects this problem and  identifies water crisis as one of the top high impact and high likelihood  risks. Water scarcity can lead to implementation of  stringent policies on water allocation and regulation e.g. development of  water markets that cap usage and stricter water quality standards.  Subsidies may be replaced with full cost pricing which may increase water  prices. Agricultural crises can increase food prices and this along with  increased water prices can affect disposable income of consumers. This  can impact profits of businesses and economic growth. Water is a commons which has tangible societal and cultural connects. The  societal license to operate for a business may be challenged in times of  scarcity and there will be pressures to implement water saving measures,  new processes technologies and products to reduce the water foot print by  businesses. Disruption in water supply can directly impact continuity of  business operations at a local level.  Consumers are likely to consider water efficient products or from  companies which are seen as water responsible. Business Implications: Urbanization Current Scenario:  Business Implications:  Urban living is often associated with better access to  employment, livelihoods, education, health care and other social services  as well as greater opportunities for social and cultural participation. It is  largely lead by increased mechanization in farm/rural sectors and  opportunities from industries and service sectors in cities. Currently, 54%  of world's population lives in urban areas, projected to reach 66% by 2050  (UN, 2014). Nearly 90% of projected increase would come from Asia and  Africa. Most emerging urban areas are low on livability indices. They suffer  from haphazard planning which is mostly post facto and reactive.   Accessibility of basic services is often an issue for disadvantaged sections  of the society, leading to urban inequality. Cities are the ecosystems for organizations and  institutions to access rich and diverse social capital. It can be argued that  they have been the centers of economic growth since the past few decades  and will continue to do so in the future. Poor social infrastructure can  dampen this possibility. While the state will continue to play a key role in  creation of this infrastructure, they suffer from significant knowledge and  governance deficits. Businesses must play an active role here by engaging  with local governments and communities to look at solutions for some  complex problems. Integrated multi modal transport and management of  other urban civic services leveraging technology are some of the emerging  possibilities. Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 54  Biodiversity Loss Current Scenario:  Business Implications:  Biodiversity is critical for the proper functioning of  ecosystems and ensures the delivery of various ecosystem services - from  provisioning of clean air, water and food to decomposition of wastes and  supporting pollination and nutrient cycles. Biodiversity is also an important  source of flora and fauna with medicinal characteristics. Around 50000 -  70000 plant species are currently used in or as medicines. Given the importance of biodiversity for the sustainability and survival of  humankind, biodiversity loss is found at the nexus of many risks ranging  from food price volatility to infectious diseases.  Large tracts of biodiverse  ecosystems have been converted to cropland to ensure short term food  security. Scientific studies have found that cropland expansion is one of the  principal causes of biodiversity loss. There is also a relationship between  biodiversity loss and soil degradation which in the long term could affect  food production leading to food price volatility. Loss of biodiversity can also  amplify environmental issues like coastal flooding and desertification. The WWF Living Planet Report has been long emphasizing that 1.6 planet  Earths are required to support the current lifestyles of humankind. This  figure called the ecological foot print of mankind (WWF, 2016). Ecological  footprint is the sum of biologically productive land and sea required to  produce the resources which human beings consumes and to absorb  associated wastes and to provide space for infrastructure.  A study in 2008 by The Economics of Ecosystems  and Biodiversity (TEEB) has calculated the total annual economic cost of  biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation to be between 3.3 - 7.5% of  global GDP for the year. No business sector can escape the risks associated  with biodiversity loss, either direct or indirect. The type and extent of  exposure to the risk could be different for different industries. The risk  exposure would be greater for primary industries such as agriculture,  forestry and fishing and secondary industries dependent primarily on  primary produce - fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) for example.  Inequality and Inclusion Current Scenario: According to the Millennium Development Goals Report  2014, extreme poverty has reduced by half in 2010 compared to 2010  figures - a reduction of 700 million people. The fight against diseases like  Malaria, Tuberculosis and HIV in poorer countries has shown good results.  However, a study by the World Institute for Development Economics  Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults  alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The UNDP report titled  'Humanity Divided: Confronting Inequality in Developing Countries'  published in 2013 talks about how income inequality has significantly  increased in many countries during the last two decades. The report says  income inequality increased by 11 percent in developing countries between  Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 55  1990 and 2010 and more than 75 percent of the population is living today in  societies where income is more unequally distributed than it was in the  1990s.  The latest Global Multidimensional Poverty Index indicates that  nearly 1/3rd of the population across over 100 developing nations are  deprived of basic well-being in terms of education, health and standard of  living. This global trend of inequality if left unchecked, can undermine social  and economic development. Social inequality or discrimination due to  gender, nationality/ethnicity and disability further adds to this economic  inequality. Diversity as a key engine of innovation Eliminating  discrimination and including disadvantaged minorities in mainstream  social processes is a crucial driver of more resilient and innovative  communities. Empowerment of women, for example, has shown to be  closely correlated with variety of social outcomes - family planning, the  prevention of human rights abuses like child labor, better management of  community resources and educational levels of their children. Businesses action on inclusion has centered on  livelihood generation, micro credit and low cost technologies for bridging  the resource and information gaps. While this needs to continue, there is a  force multiplier effect when diversity and inclusion programs are integrated  across their own operations value chain. The business sector should  prioritize commitment to promote diversity and inclusivity at the workplace  and in its extended supply chain. Business action on inequality and  inclusion should incorporate aspects like diversity criteria in the  procurement, local or traditional knowledge and socio economic contexts,  for example- how to engage with the informal economy. Business Implications: Human Rights and Labor Relations Current Scenario:  Business Implications: The World Report 2016 published by Human Rights  Watch discusses several instances of human rights violations which  happened in the previous year. An earlier report by Human Rights Watch  describes companies as the most powerful and sophisticated actors on the  world stage, not governments. There are instances where corporate  accountability has failed and human rights were violated by companies  directly or indirectly and Human Rights Watch has documented such cases  of corporate complicity with human rights violations. These are not  restricted to extractive industries (mining, refineries) but also include  companies with poor human rights and health and safety compliances  across other business sectors. . In the last couple of years, international  migration levels have steadily risen, which would bring about a change in  global workforce demographics and workplace practices. Migrant worker  human rights and risks (pay equity, benefits, workplace conflicts and other  issues) is an emerging area of focus.  Investors, media, consumers and communities,  primarily from the developed economies, have been particularly successful  in bringing the spotlight back on human rights compliance for suppliers of  Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 56  large businesses, many of who are based out of emerging and low-income  countries. The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (\"OECD  Guidelines\") and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  (\"UN Guiding Principles\") reflect the importance of proactive business  interventions on upholding human rights principles. An important challenge  which businesses may face is in effecting interventions where the sphere of  control and influence is limited. Businesses should take efforts to ensure  that business decisions and interactions are guided by the context of  issues and informed consent of affected parties. Workplace policies,  processes and cultures must re-align with demographic changes, to help  the workforce adapt and to prevent human rights violations.  Companies  must set examples on transparency by reporting publicly on human rights,  and the social and environmental impacts of their work. Pervasive Digitization Current Scenario:  Business Implications: According to International Telecommunications union  (ITU), there are more than 7 billion mobile cellular subscriptions worldwide  in 2015, corresponding to a penetration rate of 97%. Between the years of  2000 and 2015, global internet penetration grew sevenfold from 6.5% to  43% and 3.2 billion people are using the internet by end of 2015. This is  driving creation of new business models which strives to take technology as  well as other accessible and affordable. With ICT becoming ubiquitous in day to day life, several technological risks  arise. The World Economic Forum's Global Risk Report 2016 talks about  risks related to the growing role of information and communication  technologies to individuals, businesses and governments. The major risks  identified by the report are adverse consequences of technological  advances, critical infrastructure failure/ breakdown, data fraud/theft and  cyber-attacks. These technological risks are strongly connected to each  other and also to risks such as terrorist attacks and global governance  failure. TICT companies have greater responsibility in  strengthening critical infrastructure and for putting in place systems to  protect against disruptions or attacks as the risks associated utmost  important to national security and business continuity. Companies are  increasingly being subject to various government disclosures on data  privacy and cyber security issues. As a result, there is onus upon  businesses to put in place resilient infrastructure and communication  protocols. Businesses are legally obliged to comply with lawful government demands.  At the same they also have the responsibility to uphold universally  accepted human rights principles. In this context, there is onus upon  businesses to address this issue by balancing legal compliance with  compliance with human rights principles.  Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 57  Financial Implications of Climate Change At Wipro, the implications of climate change are of deep interest and we have been engaged with the  multiple questions on this for the past seven years. We have studied and identified risks and opportunities  that have the potential to generate a visible change in our business operations, revenue or expenditure. The  risks and opportunities have been identified in the context of regulatory changes like introduction of fuel /  energy taxes, physical climate parameters like changes in precipitation extremes and droughts, and other  climate related developments like increasing humanitarian demands. We have followed a comprehensive  approach for identification of risks and opportunities and estimation of their financial implications. Our  analysis outcomes are detailed in our response to Carbon Disclosure Project every year. The quantification  of some key impacts is provided below. For more information, visit  and search for the Wipro  response.  www.cdp.net  Risks Financial Impact Time Horizon Fuel/energy taxes and regulations. An aggregate impact of USD 97 Million of  increased operational costs over the next five  years (2017-18 to 2021-22) is estimated on account  of increase in electricity and diesel costs. Medium Renewable energy regulations An incremental annual cost of which will be in the  range of USD 0.32 Mn for non-solar or solar  Renewable Energy Certificates. Medium Due to changes in precipitation  extremes and droughts. An estimated impact of $ 46.7 Mn over 5 years due  to employee absence caused by disruption in city  infrastructure and tropical diseases. Short Due to changes in temperature  extremes A total financial impact of $ 8.62 Mn is estimated  over 5 years over the next five years due to (a)  increased employee absence from work and (b)  increased electricity costs resulting from higher  cooling demand. Medium Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and  typhoons) Potential revenue loss due to increased employee  absence from work due to disruption in the city  infrastructure - $13 Mn. over the five year period Short Reputation An estimated financial impact of around 0.1% of  our revenues which translates to $ 44.7 Mn over a 5  year period. Long Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 58  Overview of Wipros  Sustainability Journey Wipro started its formal sustainability journey in  2001 with Wipro Cares, our community care  program followed by Wipro Applying Thought in  Schools (WATIS) in 2002, an initiative that  addresses issues of systemic reforms in school  education. This pursuit of good citizenship is a  deliberative choice Wipro made in line with its  core values of Wipro.  Over the years, our programs have expanded in  scope and scale with significant initiatives getting  added around ecology, workplace and employee  engagement, customer stewardship, and  suppliers. Running through these diverse  programs is a common thread of thinking that  reflects our position on sustainability. Business wields enormous power and influence in  todays world, both, economic and sociopolitical.  With this power comes the concomitant  2.2 responsibility make a difference in the larger  social context. For us, this starts with a set of  foundational values as embodied in the Spirit of  Wipro: Intensity to Win, Act with Sensitivity and  Unyielding Integrity. These values emphasize  respect for all stakeholders and are the ethical  bedrock of conducting business which is non- negotiable under any circumstance. In engaging with the issues of sustainability,  business must do so in a manner that is  consistent with its core drivers; a spirit of  innovation, financial and operational rigor, a keen  focus on outcomes are hallmark attributes of the  business sector and these must inform business  action in sustainability in equal measure. In the  absence of this, the approach to sustainability is  likely to be peripheral and hollow. What this also  implies is that there is nothing that business must   do that seems to be driven by the need to oblige or  comply. Related to the previous point is our conviction that  we should be deeply engaged with our partners  rather than treat it as an outsourcing exercise.  This involvement must manifest in a carefully and  deliberately chosen set of initiatives without  spreading oneself thin. For similar reasons, we  prefer to avoid using the term Corporate Social  Responsibility as the term can be perceived to  have a patronizing connotation to it; Sustainability  is a more inclusive and appropriate term that  suggests a proactive, comprehensive, and  collaborative approach During the course of our sustainability journey, we  have tried to establish a formal framework for our  sustainability program which address proactively  the concerns of our stakeholders as well as  contribute to their well-being. We identified our  workforce, customers, suppliers, proximate  communities, civil society networks and future  generations as our stakeholders with whom we  share mutual relationship of interest, influence  and impact. Our engagement with our  stakeholders and our materiality assessment  gave us insights into issues relevant to our  business as well as stakeholders and identify  possible areas of engagement. For more  information on our stakeholder identification and  materiality assessment, refer to section on  Materiality Determination. We have formulated eight guiding principles to  guide our approach to sustainability. The  principles add to the rigor of our sustainability  program. The principles are listed below and is  discussed in detail in the subsequent sections.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 PRINCIPAL PRINCIPAL PRINCIPAL PRINCIPAL PRINCIPAL PRINCIPAL PRINCIPAL PRINCIPAL Set well  defined and  measurable  sustainability  goals Define  progress  measures  that are  appropriate  to context –  emphasize  the long term  and the  qualitative  equally  Vest formal  accountabilit y at all levels  of leadership Focus within  as well as  outside the  boundary Integrate into  mainstream  planning,  budgeting  and review  processes  Explore  disclosures  as catalysts  for self- trans- formation  Create  organiza- tional  capacity at  multiple  levels Leverage the  power of  partnership  Our Approach to Sustainability Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 60  Wipros Sustainability  Framework The principle of focusing within as well as outside the boundary informs our strategic choice of looking at  sustainability as a boundary-less continuum and this forms the backbone of our sustainability framework.  This continuum spreads across two conceptual dimensions - business responsibility and social  responsibility.  Business responsibility is about the organization fulfilling its essential duties and obligations, and running  its business with integrity and ensuring that the ecological footprint of its operations is minimized. This  translates to: 2.3 Basing operations on sensitivity for the  environment, with a concomitant goal of  minimizing its ecological footprint. Managing social impacts of business and  ensuring integrity of human and labor rights  within the sphere of influence in the supply  chain. Abiding by the law of the land in spirit and  letter, in all its activities. Practicing high levels of corporate governance,  ensuring transparency and diligent discharge  of fiduciary responsibilities. Being fair, and delivering on commitments to all  immediate stakeholders - employees,  customers, partners, vendors and investors.  Education - Work on Issues of deep systemic  reform in Indias education ecosystem Community Care - Work on Long term disaster  rehabilitation & issues of health, education &  environment Shape policies by engaging with government,  NGOs and industry networks Ecological Sustainability - Minimize Wipro's  internal footprint on energy, water and waste Workplace Sustainability - Promote employee  diversity, empowerment & continuous learning Customer Stewardship - Provide products and  solutions that enable customers to become  greener Supplier Sustainability - Collaborate with  suppliers to help them become  more  sustainable Business  Responsibility Social  Responsibility Advocacy and  Public Policy The second dimension of social responsibility is about looking beyond the boundaries of organization and  contributing towards development of the larger community. While this categorization is conceptually  useful, the right approach is to look at both the dimensions as an integrated continuum which is based on  the same fundamental principles. Bases on the above mentioned dimensions of social responsibility, a graphical representation of our  sustainability framework is shown below. Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 62  Sustainability  Governance The sustainability governance mechanism at Wipro derives greatly from the above guiding principles. At  Wipro, sustainability is every ones job. The responsibility is spread across hierarchies, functions and  businesses with multiple functions seeing themselves as key stakeholders in its success; among these, the  Global Operations team, the People Function, the Investor Relations team and the Legal team play a major  role in several of the programs. However, the oversight of sustainability programs rest at the corporate level  with our Chairman, Board of Governors and Group Executive Council.  Board Oversight The Board of Directors comprises 3 Executive and  7 Independent Directors. In keeping with the  companys Corporate Governance guidelines, the  Board is comprised of a majority of Independent  Directors. The Board of Directors has designated  one Independent Director as Lead Independent  Director. The Lead Independent Director is  responsible for coordinating the activities of the  other independent directors, and to perform  various other duties. The general authority and  2.4 responsibility of the Lead Independent Director  are to be decided by the group of Independent  Directors The nomination and selection process  for appointing Directors is led by the Board  Governance, Nomination and Compensation  Committee. Nomination is governed by Corporate  Governance Guidelines and the Board Nomination  policy. Nomination criteria includes experience,  expertise, and specific diversity factors such as  Gender and Nationality, to promote diversity of  composition and perspective. Further, importance   is given to personal characteristics such as  awareness of the Companys responsibilities to  its customers, employees, suppliers, regulatory  bodies, and the communities in which it operates.  Familiarization programs are conducted for newly  appointed Directors, through meetings with key  officials and senior business leaders. During  these meetings, Directors are familiarized with  the roles and responsibilities of Directors, as well  as other specific aspects such as governance,  strategy, and related matters. The Board Governance, Nomination and  Compensation Committee is headed by an  independent director, and also acts as the CSR  Committee - an apex body that oversees Wipro's  sustainability policy and programs. The  Committee comprising of entirely independent  directors has the additional responsibility of  reviewing the Companys policies on Corporate  Social Responsibility, including public issues of  significance to the Company and its stakeholders.  This committee and the Chairman will discuss  and sign off the goals and objectives along with  the budgets of CSR programs at the beginning of  every year.  Subsequently, the sustainability team  leadership will allocate the budgets in line with  the defined priorities and goals. The sustainability  / CSR leadership team also presents a quarterly  report to the Chairman and the Board CSR  Committee. The Committee comprises Dr. Ashok Ganguly, Mr.  N Vaghul and Mr. William Arthur Owens. During the  financial year 2016-17, the Committee met four  times and in each of the meetings, update on CSR initiatives were discussed. The overarching responsibility for our  sustainability charter rest with our Chief  Sustainability Officer who reports to the  Chairman. The CSO is also part of our Group  Executive Council, the senior most executive body  in the organization which comprises of a core  group of corporate leaders. All sustainability programs of Wipro follow the  regular planning and budgeting cycles of the  company and are also reviewed by the group  executive council. Organization Structure The operating structure of Wipros multiple  sustainability initiatives is based on the idea of  building a Coalition or network of partners –  internal and external – with nodal responsibility  lying with a distinct group. The initiatives are  handled by four functional groups at the corporate  level which carry distinct responsibility and  accountability but are part of a common  sustainability charter under the Chief  Sustainability Officer. The operational oversight of  sustainability programs as well as reporting rests  with Head of Sustainability. This includes the  responsibility of formally reviewing and approving  sustainability disclosures to ensure  comprehensive reporting of material topics as  well as seeking external assurance. The sustainability organization includes four  functional groups namely ecoeye, Wipro Cares,  Wipro Applying Thought in Schools and Wipro –  Carries the primary  responsibility for sustainability  programs at corporate level.  Also has the oversight of  sustainability disclosures like  GRI Sustainability report and  Business Responsibility Report. Works on our  community  development  W A T S ipro pplying  hought in chools -  Responsible to drive  our education reform  agenda. Wipros Sustainability  education program for  schools and college brings  together two of our key  concerns: Education and  Sustainability. wipro cares wipro eco-eye wipro earthian watis Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 64  Collectively, these four groups pull together the different strands of our sustainability initiative and steers it  in the defined direction. The reporting structure is illustrated below. Responsibility Matrix  All key organizational stakeholders have vested responsibilities related to planning, execution,  evangelization, review, as well as advocacy of the sustainability agenda of the company. Given below is the  responsibility matrix for our environment programs (energy, water, waste and biodiversity). Other  sustainability programs have similar matrix pertinent to their operations.  Board Sustainability Committee Chairman Functional Groups Chief Sustainability Officer Chief Executive Officer VP & Head of Sustainability  Planning & Review Execution Internal Evangelizing External Advocacy Board of Directors Group Executive Council Business Leadership Facilities Management Group  Infrastructure Creation Group  Ecoeye -  Sustainability Office  Employee Chapters Human Resources  Finance Corporate affairs, Brand & Communication  Risk Office Legal and Compliance Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 65  Transparency and  Disclosures As a part of our philosophy of adhering to highest ethical standards, transparency and accountability,  disclosures are considered critical in the company. Disclosures help us adhere to regulatory requirements  as well as in proactively informing and engaging with our various stakeholders. Due care is taken to  disclose timely, consistent and accurate information through annual financial reports, sustainability  reports and other public reports to shareholders and the public regarding financial performance, liabilities,  control and ownership, and corporate governance issues. We have been active participants in the major frameworks that assess the Environment, Social and  Governance (ESG) performance of companies, e.g., the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the Carbon  Disclosure Index, Worlds Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, Vigeo Sustainability Rating etc. Wipro has  been consistently rated among the leaders, both globally and in India. Feedback attributes this to our  comprehensive and well-defined framework of goals and inclusive stakeholder reach supported by a solid  governance process. 2.5  Advocacy and  Public Policy Given the fundamental axiom that sustainability  is about maximizing social and environmental  good, it requires an engagement template that  emphasizes informed advocacy of the underlying  issues amongst all stakeholders. Each  stakeholder – Business, Government, Academia,  and Civil Society – brings a dynamic and energy to  the table that is unique and complementary. We  think that industrys role must go beyond its own  boundaries and should be one that seeks to  vigorously promote advocacy of sustainability  challenges. In doing so, the conscious emphasis  must be on the difficult and the long term in  preference to the easy and the short term.  Our areas of focus on policy and advocacy have  centered on Water, Energy and Climate Change, e- Waste, Education and Diversity. We work through  different industry platforms as well as with  research partners who carry expertise in these  2.6 domains. Our primary identified stakeholders for public  policy and advocacy are   Relevant government ministries and  departments, both at the center and the states  where we operate in; Our interactions have  been largely with the Ministry of Environment  and Forests, Ministry of New and Renewable  Energy, and Ministry of Corporate Affairs  Industry networks and associations play a  crucial role as catalysts for awareness,  advocacy and action on the multiple  dimensions of sustainability; by providing a  common platform for industry representatives  to share and exchange ideas and practices,  industry association can help foster a virtuous  cycle of feedback led improvement. Industry  networks also lend strength and credibility in   the dialogue process with government on  important matters of policy and directives. The  industry networks that we have been an  integral part of are:   The CII-Godrej Green Business Center  (GBC)  The CII-ITC Center for Sustainable  Development  CII National Environment Committee  The TERI-CBS (Council for Business  Sustainability) forum  The CII led Indian Business for  Biodiversity Initiative (CIIIBBI)  The Leaders for Nature (LFN) framework  of the India, Chapter of the International  Union of Conservation Networks (IUCN)  U.N. Global Compact (UNGC)  Research and Advocacy NGOs: Issues like  Energy, Climate Change, Water, Biodiversity,  Community Education, Health etc. require  strong civil society involvement as the third  pillar along with government policy and  business engagement. NGOs and academic  institutions, by combining the right blend of  field work and academic rigor can generate  valuable insights that can inform the work of  practitioners, policy makers and industry  professionals. Illustrative examples of such  organizations that we work with are : Carbon  Disclosure Project in the area of Climate  Change, BIOME and ACWADAM in the area of  Water, ATREE and IUCN ( India chapter) in the  areas of Biodiversity , and our network of  nearly 30 education partners across the  country. Advocacy Engagements Water, Energy,  Biodiversity and Waste Mangement Energy:  Water Biodiversity:  Waste Management:   With CSTEP for undertaking research on Design and Development  of smart micro-grid technologies for large scale decentralized solar power  applications in indian villages – The zero energy village concept  continued to be a major area of collaborative focus for us in 2016-17.  The two major advocacy platforms that we have been deeply involved in are  summarized below Advancing the agenda of the Karnataka State Water Network (KSWN) along  with the CII Karnataka chapter. The KSWN brings together stakeholders  from government, academia, civil society and business to address the most  pressing issues in water in Bangalore and surrounding areas. Five area- wise clusters and one horizontal cluster on lakes were formed with specific  action plans drawn up for each The Responsible Water program seeks to address the pressing issue of  ground water in the Sarjapur area in Bangalore. It does this through a  combination of scientific hydrogeology and the involvement several citizen  groups as part of a unique decentralized governance framework.  Our participation in advocacy on biodiversity issues was  through two national levels forums – the CII-India Business for Biodiversity  Initiative (IBBI) and the Leaders for Nature program from the India chapter  of IUCN. As part of the CII Steering Committee Meeting on the  Voluntary Rating System for E-waste Recyclers, we are bringing in our  experiences with the e-waste recycling. Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 68  Biodiversity Our participation in advocacy on biodiversity issues was through two  national levels forums – the CII-India Business for Biodiversity Initiative  (IBBI) and the Leaders for Nature program from the India chapter of IUCN. Horizontal areas in Sustainability and CSR We continued to strengthen our participation in advocacy on the cause of  corporate sustainability as a whole As Co-Chair of the CII-GBC Greenco forum (Bangalore chapter), the goal is  to drive the adoption of the Greenco framework by the IT sector. The  Greenco framework encourages companies to establish a multi- dimensional framework of ecological sustainability that spans the areas of  Energy, Water, Waste, Biodiversity and Product Stewardship. School Education  We have supported 19 new organisations, out of which 14 organisations  with 26 fellows were supported through seeding fellowships and 5  organisations through grants.   With our grant support, ATREE plans to set-up a central education team  and establish an institution-level environment education programme  and coordinate activities across sites.   Our 16th Partners Forum on organizational sharing was held in April  2016. The 3-day forum was a well-attended affair with close to 100  participants from various organizations.  Through our partnership with Punarchith, over 20 administrators have  received training and continuous support, including teaching-learning  support to a few private schools in the Chamrajanagar district,  Karnataka.  Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 69  Diversity During 2016-17, Wipro has participated in various eminent forums by  bodies like SHRM (Society for Human Resource Management), NASSCOM,  Catalyst, NHRDN (National HRD Network) etc. We continued our  engagement with external stakeholders where we hold advisory board /  core committee positions.  Wipro is part of the core CII committee for employment of people with  disabilities and also part of the NASSCOM working group on gender  inclusion.  Catalyst is a leading nonprofit organization which works on expanding  opportunities for women and business. Wipros CEO is on the Catalyst  Board of Directors and is also the chair of Catalyst India Advisory Board.  This year Catalyst and Wipro co-hosted a Round table on Strategies to  Retain Mid-Career Women. Speaking engagements in public forums play an important role in building sustainability awareness and  advocacy. We actively participated as speakers in several events all through the year, some examples of  which are: the GRI Conference on Disability Reporting, the CII Annual Greenco Summit, Xavier University  Bhubaneswars Annual Sustainability Summit, CII-Karnatakas Annual Conference on Water and  Sustainability workshops at IIM Bangalore, IIM Lucknow and MDI Gurgaon. Sustainability Education  Wipro earthian, flagship program in sustainability education for schools  and colleges, tries to catalyze advocacy on sustainability learning  among young students across the country.  Through our partnerships with CEE and CPREEC and state govts we  have reached 2478 teachers from 2124 schools. 51 workshops were  conducted for schools across 27 states. 170+ colleges participated in  our program.  We helped our winning schools set up Sustainability learning corners-  with 11 Wipro earthian Sustainability Learning corners set up in 11  schools across India with a diverse collection of Audio, video and print  mediums on the theme of sustainability  Wipro earthians Sustainability quizzes have gained traction and have  become a fixture in various college festivals in institutes like IITB, IIML,  IIMB and BITS Goa with a total participation from 360 teams and 720  students.   We have introduced a Sustainability Fellowship program at Indian  Institute of Management Bangalore (IIMB), and 2 students have been  awarded funds through this fellowship during 2016-17.  Wipro and Sustainability Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 70  Alignment with Sustainable  Development Goals Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was  adopted with the objective of stimulating action  over the next 15 years in areas which are of critical  importance for humanity and the planet. These  goals focuses on achieving sustainable  development in its three dimensions – economic,  social and environmental – in a balanced and  integrated manner. These goals call for action by  all countries, poor, rich and middle-income to  promote prosperity while protecting the planet  and covers a wide range of issues like poverty  eradication, economic growth education, health,  social protection, climate change, environmental  protection. Given the ambitious nature of the targets for 2030,  magnitude of efforts required to achieve them and  2.7 the scale of challenge, it is not possible to achieve  the goals without meaningful partnership  between different stakeholders. Businesses as  drivers of economic growth and employment and  a source of finance, technology and innovation is a  key stakeholder and it has great potential to  contribute towards the implementation of the  SDGs. They can use SDGs as a framework to  explore new opportunities and pursue  responsibilities, thereby assisting in the  implementation of the goals at national level. At Wipro, we are actively working on multiple  aspects of development which are aligned with  the different themes of SDGs. Our initiatives and  their alignment with the SDGS are explained  alongside.  Our Programs Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls At Wipro, diversity and inclusion principles are embedded in our organizational values, culture,  policies and processes.

The focus  is on energy efficiency, responsible water use, and pollution and waste management. For more information, refer to Ecological Sustainability Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Understanding the implications of climate change to the planet and business in specific, Wipro  has set ambitious scientifically valid and traceable goals to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2  people emissions intensity figures. In 2015-16, we undertook a target setting exercise to  propose targets for the period 2015-16 to 2019-20. We used the science based target setting  framework from WRI (World Resource Institute) that tries to align itself with the 2 degree  imperative i.e. global emissions by 2050 to be 20% of 1990 levels so as to stay within the  threshold of 2 degree rise in average surface temperature. We have adopted targets for 2025 and  2030 also and these will be revisited at the next target review exercise in 2020.

In such a system of interdependencies, engagement with stakeholders is central; however over  the past few decades, stakeholder engagement has become more than just interactions happening over  the normal course of business. Engaging with stakeholders has a greater purpose of understanding risks  and opportunities associated with the social, environmental and economic climate that a business is  embedded in.   Building relationships with customers is core to  understanding their business needs and  emerging trends.  Close engagement helps Wipro  to communicate unique and differentiated value  to customers.

We firmly believe that we cannot build a  great business without nurturing talent from within. We are committed to partnering with employees and  strengthening our talent pool by providing them with growth and career enhancement opportunities.  Today  we have a large and diverse workforce (160,000+ employees in 50+ countries as on 31st March 2017) and  we continuously design and implement processes and programs to foster people development, leadership  development and skill enhancements among our global team. technology landscape. The high demand for  automation and digitization has reduced  technology cycles and skills are becoming  commoditized more rapidly than before.  The IT services marketplace is also a highly  competitive one, with an ever-increasing focus  on talent and innovation. Meeting rapidly  evolving customer requirements requires a  high level of competence, expertise and  learning agility. Co-innovation, collaborative  working and crowd sourcing are capabilities  which are fast becoming the norm.   Difference between talent that is sought and  talent that is available.

A significant portion of our  management focus is invested in engaging with  our employees; thus creating the need to build  managerial and leadership capabilities in the  context of an increasingly virtual work  environment. In the recent past, changes to  immigration laws & regulations and risks to  offshore business models have also made an  impact on our people strategy, particularly in  our approach to attract local talent.

Creating a safe and  empowered workplace with a culture that drives  equal opportunity, non-discrimination,  meritocracy and one in which employees feel  listened to are therefore our core priorities. We  imbibe these principles in all our processes like  hiring, compensation, access to training,  promotions, etc. and do not engage in or support  discrimination based on ethnicity, nationality,  race, caste, religion, age, disability, gender and  sexual or political orientation.  Our people practices are shaped by the Spirit of  Wipro values, Code of Business Conduct (COBC),  as well as principles of the U.N. Global Compact,  U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, OECD  Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the  International Labor Organizations declaration on  Fundamental Principles & Rights at Work (1998).  While these provide the guidelines and direction  for responsible business conduct at a global level,  our policies are shaped and customized by local  regulations and law of land.  Our COBC imbibes  our commitment for human rights and zero  tolerance for discrimination at all stages of the  employee lifecycle (Protect-Respect-Remedy of  UN principles).  The Wipro Human Rights policy is published in  company website and is intended to express  Wipros active commitment to do business with  ethical values and embrace practices that  supports environment, human rights, and labor  laws globally. Our commitment to uphold and promote human  rights and interests of our global workforce is  long-standing and integrated in our Code of  Business Conduct & Ethics (COBC) available  publicly on our company website. The COBC  provides the ethical guidelines and expectations  for conducting business on behalf of Wipro Ltd, its Commitment to Human Rights/Non  Discrimination Policies & Principles:  subsidiaries and group companies. It applies to all  employees, members of the board of Directors as  well as to contractors, sub-contractors, retainers  or any other such basis. As suppliers serve as an  extension of the Company, and their conduct and  behavior while carrying on business for / behalf of  Wipro can impact Wipros reputation, are expected  to be in compliance with the COBC. All suppliers  are also mandated to sign & confirm their  acceptance to our Supplier Code of Conduct  available publicly (SCOC) Our values and code of conduct are socialized at  multiple times in the employee life-cycle through  touchpoints like induction and onboarding,  classroom sessions, all hands meets, awareness  mailers/posters and through our mandatory  online COBC certification which all employees  undertake every year. All employees are entrusted  and empowered to highlight concerns and  grievances via the Ombudsprocess and  Prevention of Sexual Harassment Committee. The  policy also assures all stakeholders that a  concern raised in the spirit of the policy will not be  under risk of retaliation/retribution, even if  unsubstantiated upon investigation.  We respect the right of employees to free  association without fear of reprisal,  discrimination, intimidation or harassment. A  small proportion of our employees (~2%) are  represented through local employee  representative groups, Works Councils and /or  Trade Unions in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Czech  Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,  Netherlands, Poland, Romania and Sweden. In  some of these countries, Collective Bargaining  agreements are required by law. The HR function  meets these groups periodically to inform and  consult on any change that can impact work  environment. We pro-actively engage with Works  Councils and Unions when it comes to client  employee transfers under the EU Directive of  Transfer. of Undertaking and respective local  legislation such as TUPE, Art. 613a German Civil  Code, Art 338 Czech Labour Code etc. Engagement  starts in early stage and provides first-hand  information to client employee representatives on  terms and conditions as well as collective  employment matters.

These team  adopt a systematic approach to identify issues &  vulnerable people, develop appropriate mitigation  actions and a monitoring process. Besides these  committee we have well established people  processes and audits which helps us to identify  potential human rights issues. Our progress on  aspects of human rights is owned by the business  and functional leadership team, and is under the  review our Group Executive Council, Chief  Sustainability Officer, the Audit Committee and the  Board of Directors.  - We have a robust ombuds process  which allows employee, contractors, vendors, to raise  a grievance or complaint without any fear of reprisal.  The team does a trend analysis basis the complaints  received by them to identify the root causes and  accordingly highlight the same to top management.  Recommendations are also shared with Audit, Risk &  Compliance Board which result in process  improvements thereby building a stronger  governance mechanism - Our Prevention of Sexual  Harassment (PSH) committee ensures that all  grievances (globally) are resolved expeditiously and  in an unbiased manner through defined procedures.   The team also focuses on inducting and increasing  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 86 the number of members of the PSHC team to ensure  presence across all locations and Geos which in turn  would lead to increasing number of education and  awareness sessions regarding PSH among  employees as well as faster resolution of cases  highlighted. The team conducts proactive quarterly  internal audits on closed cases that were reported  and actions taken. A deeper assessment of such PSHC cases has  brought to the fore that more trainings on  unconscious bias & workplace gender sensitivity &  inclusion would need to be organized  globally across  locations.  - Safety committees are formed at  major locations and consist of cross functional  members from senior management, stakeholder,  service providers and employees. These meet  quarterly & participate in risk assessments, safety  inspections, incident investigations and hygiene  audits. Please find more details on this in the  Employee Well Being and safety section.  - Based on a structured review  process with D & I council- we continuously  strengthen our D& I systems & processes. Our  collaboration with research partners and industry  platforms like Catalyst, CII, NASSCOM, Diversity and  Equal Opportunity Centre (DEOC) bring to the fore  focus areas for due diligence on D & I linked issues.   For e.g in the gender diversity area, we have  undertaken a project on Vital Signs which looks at  the entire People Supply Chain through the lens of  Gender, examining closely how we recruit, train,  deploy and promote women. This data when tracked  Health & Safety Diversity & Inclusion  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 87 and published to business units and functions helps  us uncover bottlenecks that may have crept into the  system.  In 2016-17-Wipro has proactively conducted a Wipro  Disability Inclusion Audit to align itself with the RPD  Act -2016 passed by Indian Government. In  collaboration with Diversity and Equal Opportunity  Centre (DEOC), detailed due diligence process was  conducted on all the existing processes and Systems  As part of the same we have conducted audit on  various functions like recruitment, procurement,  Internal IT systems, Emergency Preparedness etc.  Based on our audit findings, we have reviewed our  operations/processes/ policies from an inclusion  perspective.  Our gender inclusion & diversity principles are  embedded in our organizational culture & values,  Code of Business Conduct (COBC). We imbibe these  principles in all our policies and processes like  hiring, compensation, access to training, promotions,  etc. and do not engage in or support discrimination  based on ethnicity, nationality, race, caste, religion,  age, disability, gender and sexual or political  orientation. Our philosophy focusses on hiring or  deployment of talent based on experience/role and  our commitment on rewarding meritocracy Through internal audits and special projects such as  the Vital Signs project, we regularly track and  monitor key indicators impacting gender diversity  representation /unconscious bias at all employee  lifecycle stages. We track gender equity signs e.g   like hiring, attrition, career levels, engagement level,  project deployment time-frame, promotions,  compensation/gender pay ratios .We see that for  junior levels the gender pay ratio  is close to 1 , for  middle and senior levels pay gap is around 5-10  %.This reflects the trend of higher proportion of  males from junior to senior levels.  The differences in  our assessment, is also reflective of a larger social  trend of women leaving the workforce at different  points of their career.  The pay ratios given above are for India based  employees, representing 79% of total workforce.  - Our focus on  responsible people practices extends across our  people value chain, and covers contract employees  and retainers. Many of them are deployed at our  Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to  men:  Supply Chain Partner Engagement client sites, and a customized Partner Employee  Engagement team (PEET) in our Global  Infrastructure Service is responsible for building an  engaged and motivated contract employee  workforce. The PEET team consists of human resource  professionals and undertake responsibilities like  induction and orientation, performance  management, engagement, retention, rewards and  recognition, training and career development etc. for  contract employees deployed on IT delivery projects.  The PEET team drives various initiatives like client- site visits to meet contractor employees to  understand needs and concerns, driving programs to  build capacity, facilitating conversion of contract  employees into retainers or full time employees etc.  Quarterly / Half yearly / annual audits are conducted  by PRO (Partner Relation Office) on the empanelled  partner to ensure that they comply with the statutory  and labour compliance. The PRO (Partner Relation  Office) is responsible for vendor selection and  management; it ensures compliance of partner  agencies to legal and statutory employment norms.  Reviews and statutory audit checks were conducted  by PRO in 2016-17 to ensure continuity of the  process and procedures that are laid down. In FY 16-17, the PEET team led various initiatives like  client-site visits to meet contractor employees to  understand needs and concerns, initiated programs  to build capability through training programs.  Focused initiatives like Meet Matters are structured  partner connect sessions at regional level which  serve as a common forum for partner employees to  have face to face meeting with their employer,  discuss & resolve their issues/concerns. Through  Meet Matters , we ensure that we protect our rights  of our Partner employees through effective  communication and Awareness. Audits are  conducted by PRO (Partner Relation Office) to ensure  that the statutory and labour/ human rights  requirement are complied. This covers more than  50% of the total contracting workforce employed by  the organization. A further extended people supply chain, consists of  temporary workers who are in soft service functions  such as Housekeeping, Security etc. We protect the  interest of such workers by ensuring that the  contracting agency is in compliance with the  Supplier code of conduct and there is no violation of   Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 88 Human Rights for e.g ensuring salaries of all workers  are in compliance with relevant Minimum Wages  legislations. We ensure that the temporary contract  workers work under the similar working conditions  as employees and employee benefits such as  recreation and refreshments are also made available  to them – Employee  perception survey is rolled out annually to capture  employee feedback and satisfaction towards the  organization and various policies and processes. The  findings from the survey are analyzed and shared  with each business unit and accordingly action plans  are prepared to address and work upon the areas of  improvement/if any. This proactive mechanism of  due diligence helps capture not only the employee  morale but also to ensure potential grievances may  be addressed at an early stage. EPS survey 2016 saw both an increase of  participation and engagement from the previous  biennial survey in 2015. Our employee engagement  scores went up by 12.5 percentage points and  employee participation scores went up by 3  percentage points. Our inhouse built EPS analytics  tool provides analysis of the results at various levels  e.g geography, business unit, gender, career levels,  age, nationality, tenure and enables us to formulate  action plans. Survey results and identified action  areas are communicated throughout the  organization through mailers and cascade sessions  by business leaders and HR. Each business unit  includes action plans specific to their units in  addition to the organization-wise action plans. EPS Pulse 2016 results have been studied - Action  areas for the upcoming year have been finalized  which includes key initiatives at an organization wide  level around Manager Effectiveness, Careers &  Capability, Diversity & Inclusion, Process  Simplification  -  Wipro holds employee feedback in very high regard  and solicits this through formal surveys, informal  forums like one to one meetings, All Hands Meetings,  focus group discussions, roundtables and team  meetings.  We actively scan for any specific issues &  risks relating to human rights and labour practices  through the following engagement platforms Our employee engagement programs are driven at  EPS (Employee Perception Survey)  Feedback through other Engagement Platforms multiple levels – organizational, unit/team and  individual. Key organizational changes  andannouncements are cascaded through emails,  online posts, posters, kiosks, on-floor sessions and  through business and HR teams. The leadership  team engages with employees throughout the year  through online chat sessions, Leader blogs,  organizational level Wipro Meets, business unit level  All Hands Meets, round table discussions and  functional review meets and offsites. Another  important enablement to engagement is through  business managers and HR teams who meet  employees through one-to-one meetings & team  discussions. Additionally, customized engagement  frameworks are used by business units to address  needs specific to employees in that unit or to that  business/domain. Our online enterprise-wide social platform- Yammer  has allowed employees across the globe to network  and collaborate, thus removing the physical  boundaries of a geographically widespread  workforce and increasing the feeling of  connectedness in a global organization. It has also  allowed employees to provide real-time feedback  through online polls & directly connect with senior  leaders or functional teams. Additionally, employees  have been able to network, form special interest  groups, seek role opportunities and work on  collaborative projects without location or team  constraints. Over 109,000+ Wiproite (As on close of  FY 16-17) use this platform, with over 9400 public  and private groups. The adoption of these forums by  employees (as indicated by participation  levels/usage) indicates how well ingrained they are  into the organizational culture  - Today we have  30,000+ employees overseas - hence our Enterprise  Risk Management team continues to closely monitor  any human rights impact issues in countries where  we are growing. Whenever Wipro is venturing into  new geographies, there is a detailed due diligence  process that is carried out with respect to any  human rights issues in that geography/check overall  alignment with Wipro's values/processes. There is a  security council which has to give the sign off after  assessing the safety conditions of the country.

Parental Leave:  Our return to work rate for male  employees availing parental leave has typically  been close to 100% , hence we closely track and  monitor return to work ratio for women employees  which is around 90%. We continue to scale our  flexibility initiatives for women employees through  various leave options, onsite day care centres and  wellness benefits. The compensation & benefits programs available  in each geography are outlined in detailed policy  documents and are available to all employees on  the company intranet. In order to familiarize the  human resources teams on the compensation  philosophy and benefits across geographies and  empower them to answer employee queries, an in- house Compensation and Benefits (C & B)  certification program is held every year in multiple  batches. Additionally, organizational / business- unit level sessions are also held to create  awareness amongst employees through avenues  like HR-facilitated workshops, chat sessions,  webinars, teleconferencing and mailers.

There are 27 Occupational Health  Centre (OHC) and 7 ergonomic centres that are  functioning  across Pan India Wipro locations. Ergonomic related illnesses and upper respiratory  infections are material for our workforce. We have institutionalized health and safety  processes including trainings for service  providers, risk assessments, ergonomic session  for employees, vaccination campus, health  awareness sessions and regular cafeteria food  inspections. There is special focus on aspects  such as womens safety, assistance to persons  with disability, emergency response, and  preventive health & safety measures.  We consider indoor air quality  as a significant risk on employees health aspect  as employees work in air conditioned offices. The  risks are assessed with adequate controls and  environmental parameters are monitored in  cognizance to ASHRA standards. Where ever  indicators deviate from permissible levels, root  cause analysis is done and corrective measures  undertaken to avoid injuries / illnesses.  This  ensures a safe workplace for the employees and  align with the health and safety objective of  employee wellbeing.   Employee connect  programs conducted to bring awareness among  employees on reporting of hazards, unsafe  conditions and unsafe acts to help in reduction of  Injury rate.   Programs were held  across locations in India on emergency response,  mock evacuation drills, hazard recognition, driver  safety training, first aid training, fire-fighting  training etc. Vehicle based Quick Reaction Teams  deployed in major locations continues to provide  services to ensure safe commute and help during  emergencies.   Security teams are trained on  gender sensitization as a part of their on job  training and induction. Cab pickup and drop  facility with security escort is available for women  employees travelling in night hours.

In FY 17,  1900+ women employees have undergone the  Security Awareness and Self Defence sessions  conducted across locations.  : Breast cancer awareness and  tests were conducted across locations,; 800+   women employees participated during the event  Cafeteria Hygiene:  Our 24 in-house cafeterias/  kitchens comply with the FSSAI requirements. In  comparison with last two years audit reports, on  an average 80 % of FSSAI requirements are  implemented at our cafeterias & kitchens.  Thirteen base kitchens were assessed during last  year across PAN India and 25 internal audits are  organized across pan India locations to check the  effectiveness on the implementation of FSSAI  requirements. The results of the food safety/  cafeteria meetings are showcased in  management reviews as part of Health and Safety  performance  (employees,  contractors and service providers) attended  trainings on Health & Safety covering  Occupational Health, Transportation, Hospitality,  Emergency Response and Security domains. Our Employee counselling and Support forum  (Mitr) in India and Employee Assistance Programs  in the geographies provide counselling support on  issues pertaining to personal or professional life. Taking cognizance that employee well-being and  safety is an aspect which impacts at various focal  points, the overall responsibility for health &  safety is assumed by the HR, EHS, Audit, Risk and  Compliance team.  Around 79% of our workforce works in locations  across India and majority of them work from  Wipro facilities. Taking this into account, we have  established a core EHS team with city-wise EHS  coordinators who drive compliance to standard  procedures defined at a corporate level. The EHS  Womens Health Over 157 ,000 participants Governance: Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 90  Team along with stakeholder and service  providers organize awareness programs on health  and safety, thereby impacting performance on  health and safety aspects. Major locations exceeding 2000 employees have  safety committees which meet quarterly and  participate in risk assessments, safety  inspections, incident investigations and hygiene  audits. Remaining locations report work place  hazards in the HSE portal and get discussed in  city-wise committee meetings. Employees also  record their observations on under various  categories like Major/ Minor/ First-Aid / Near- misses etc. through our intranet portal. Decisions  taken during these meetings are communicated  along with corrective actions and target dates in  order to minimize risks. These committees bring  together stakeholders at various levels to promote  positive occupational health & safety culture. The  safety committee meetings represent 100%  participation from the representative employees. Identification and Risk Assessment. The risk  assessment is evaluated every year and also as  and when the accidents / incidents / near misses  are noticed. Employees, stakeholders and Service  providers are part of this risk assessment. Our internal audit team conducts checks on the  effective implementation of ISO 14001 / OHSAS  18001 standard requirements every 6 months by  involving cross functional teams. 18 locations in  India are certified or ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.  Apart from the Internal Audits, the corporate  internal audit team also conducted the audit at  selected locations to check the effectiveness on  the closure of the gaps identified in internal  audits and the report is submitted to the senior  management as part of the Management Reviews.

At Wipro, our client  portfolio is diverse in composition, in terms of  locations, culture, industries and technologies  they deploy. In order to address the increasing  complexities of such a diverse clientele, it is  imperative to cultivate a workforce, which can  generate a rich mosaic of ideas that enhance  innovation resulting in higher revenues & greater  customer satisfaction There is a visible, deep organization-led strategic  commitment to experience inclusivity as a way of  life and nurture a sense of belonging within  teams. This is further strengthened, with the CEO  as the Executive Sponsor of the Diversity &  Inclusion (D &I) Council. This makes D & I a  mainstream business driver and a must-have  trait, rather than a stand-alone / aspirational  initiative. As signatories to UNGC and U.N.  Womens Empowerment Principles, we express  our commitment to becoming a responsible  business leader and role model.

Our commitment  towards non-discrimination and meritocracy is  explicit in our COBC and Global Diversity and  Inclusion Policy.  Our commitment to D & I is also extended to our  Suppliers through the Supplier Code of Conduct  and we encourage engagement with qualified  suppliers owned by persons of disabilities, women  or minority communities. Wipro is an equal opportunity employer and merit  in qualification, performance & capability form  the sole criteria for selection, remuneration and  promotions for new applicants and existing  employees alike. We believe that number-based  targets / percentages to increase diverse  workforce can impact meritocracy and deviate  from our holistic approach of ensuring meaningful  employment across different functions and levels.  We have therefore consciously refrained from  integrating such targets into the goals and  objectives of leaders and relevant teams. Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 93  Focus Areas  Our Diversity & Inclusion Program was formally launched in 2008 to give shape and direction to our  commitment. An overview of key initiatives across our various inclusivity pillars are shared below. For detailed  description of initiatives, please refer Sustainability Report 15-16 Inclusivity Pillar  Gender Persons with Disabilities Nationality/ Culture  Sensitivity  Under Privileged Objective/ Description of key initiatives Our efforts here are all inclusive –and focus on  providing an enabling work environment. For  example: WoW or the Women of Wipro program has  various initiatives following the research led insights  from a life stage based approach  for women (e.g   some of the key initiatives here are WoW Career  Mentoring, Women in Technology, WoW Speaker  Series, Day Care Centres) The CREATE (Career, Recruitment, Engagement,  Accessibility, Training & Enablement) framework  was adopted to promote those with different  abilities across areas. Our self-identification form  allows employees to  request for reasonable  accommodation while being assured of Wipros  commitment to non-discrimination Today we have a strong local national footprint in  our international geographies- via both organic &  inorganic growth.  Our initiatives in this area have  strengthened our efforts towards nurturing a  culture inclusive workforce through various  sensitization interventions There has been a committed focus on collaborating  with colleges/universities in small cities to drive  opportunities for jobs and thereby increase  recruitment. This has included collaborating with  NGOs/Foundations which impart skills trainings to  graduates from underprivileged societies. They work  towards improving the competency, professional  skills and employability of youth and prepare them  for various roles- which makes them job ready for  Wipro or other organizations in the industry Key Highlights  33% - Women workforce   The fourth batch of the Mentoring  program recently concluded in FY17  International Womens Hackathon for  women technologist hosted where 800  women technologists participated  Higher engagement levels for women as  measured by our Employee Perception  Survey (EPS)  As on March 31, 2017 there were 334  employees who had voluntarily declared  their disabilities through our online Self  Identification Form.

We understand  that the success of transformational initiatives depends on how much the larger organization believes in  the strategy and the strength of the initiative and its success in trickling down to the lowest levels in the  organization. With this in mind, our D & I charter and agenda is supported cross-functional project teams  and senior leaders assume leadership of individual diversity pillars. Focus areas/goals are reviewed on a  quarterly basis by the D & I Council which is chaired by the CEO.The D & I council is composed of Senior  Leaders/Executives with representation from gender, geographies and ethnicity. Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 95 D & I Awards  2016-17  Wipro won Innovative Policies & Practices for Persons with  Disabilities Award 2017 by Zero Project, Vienna.

Anticipating and defining future  needs and developing these competencies in the  employees is vital to organizational sustainability.  Wipro offers multiple learning & development  opportunities to employees at various stages of  their career. These are aimed at upskilling, cross- skilling, and reskilling through a number of  training programs in technical, domain, soft skills,  and leadership aspects. While dedicated teams  identify learning needs at an organizational level,  employees partake in identifying their individual  learning needs through appraisals, feedback  surveys, and career tools. Capability building and career development  initiatives at Wipro encompass building  awareness on career paths, identifying  developmental areas for current & aspired role  through a rigorous performance management  process, mentorship, and building capability  through training & assessments. Our infrastructure supports both traditional and  new-gen ways of learning. While dedicated  facilities like learning centers, training labs are  used for instructor led classroom sessions,  enterprise solutions like 24 x7 access to e- Learning modules, Webex, Video Based learnings,  simulation based learning, etc. are being widely  adopted, providing convenient and flexible  learning environment. Our performance management system is  designed to achieve holistic employee  development through performance differentiation,  transparency, and effective evaluation. There is a  structured process of formally and objectively  Our Approach & Commitment Policies & Principles  Focus Areas Enabling Careers: evaluating ones performance against defined  goals & objectives. We continue to drive a high- performance culture. In FY17, we institutionalized  the practice of quarterly employee appraisal. This  enables employees to excel based on regular  feedback. Learning modules were launched to  enable managers and employees alike to embrace  the new process of Performance management. We  also piloted the Agile Performance Management  system for those in Agile roles.  As part of the performance evaluation process, a  360-degree feedback is provided on leadership  competencies for middle and senior management  roles. Appropriate development plans and  interventions are then charted out based on  discussion between manager and employee. The  Talent Review and Planning exercise is conducted  at the beginning of the FY and is used to identify  short-term, medium-term and long-term  successors for critical, senior and executive  management roles. One of our other initiatives in this category is  Talent Marketplace, which enables internal role  fulfilment of senior roles. The objective of the  initiative is to connect talent to opportunities  within the organization so as to retain the senior  skilled talent pool.  In FY 17 internal redeployment  as a % of total fulfilment was at 66% for  senior/strategic roles The focus in FY 17 has been on growing new  businesses with existing customers, becoming  strategic partner for our customers, building  strong digital skills and core technical  competencies  Delivery Transformation:  To increase the breadth  and depth of engagement with existing customers  and take Delivery to next higher level, we trained  2000+  delivery leaders from strategic accounts  through two programs called WinMore - Account  Mining for Growth & ADROIT – for Behavioral  Transformation .  These programs are designed for  delivery leaders to enable them to do delivery-led  sales and next-generation delivery  Capability Building: Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 96  Sales Transformation  Building core technical competencies  In this digital enabled business environment,  customers no longer look for technology services  but emphasize on business outcomes. Customers  are looking for a strategic partner to co-create a  vision and execution strategy. Keeping this in  mind, a new training program OneVoice was  developed for sales transformation which trains  our sales /customer facing people with more  consultative selling and selling digital solutions.  2,000+ participants have been covered through  the One Voice Program. We are also creating a  continuum between our delivery and sales teams  through a program called PRISM, which grooms  delivery people to become effective sales people. Digital Training: In line with the growing demand  for Digital Services, we continue to augment our  workforce with digital skills. Against our annual  plan of training over 33,000 people in FY17, we  trained over 39,000 employees. Overall, now we  have reached over 60,000 technical employees  trained on Digital skills Trend.nxt Competency framework – in which  employees are encouraged to build depth and  width of knowledge in technical skills –  has  helped us to build strong skills across employees,  in FY17 over 21,000 employees acquired  additional skills in upto 4 technology areas. One of  the key new features of Trend.Nxt is Competency  Credit points which can be earned by employees  through a variety of channels. Every employee  covered by the Trend.Nxt framework needs to  accumulate the minimum threshold of credit  points to become eligible for progression to the next career band Through our crowd sourcing platform (TopGear),  we have created 70+ customized cloud based  development environments that enable our  workforce to develop Proof of Concepts, Use  Cases, and Assignments in high-demand  technologies. 32,000+ employees have enrolled  themselves through this platform. Employees  have so far contributed to over 20000  assignments and case studies and over 100 IP  Development/Solution projects. Many of our large  accounts have started using this platform to  introduce new-age skills to their teams to fulfil  their upcoming client demands and create a  fungible future ready team For a number of our capability building programs,  Yammer has been used extensively for social  learning. For example, groups have been created  focusing on specific technologies/roles in the  organization, where employees can come together  to effectively learn from each other. After  classroom training, the faculty use this platform  to engage with the participants for continued  learning. The discussions are analyzed to derive  feedback which enables L&D to improve training  programs. To generate interest, we launched a  competition across the various groups in Yammer  on how they could use the social media platform  effectively for learning. The groups were measured  on the number of discussion threads and  responses, as well as the quality of the posts.  There was enthusiastic participation and many of  the groups demonstrated creative and innovative  ways of using social media for learning.

Learning and Development  Awards 2016-17  Wipro won the prestigious ATD (Association for Talent  Development) BEST* Award for 2016. This is the 10th  time that  we are winning this award. The BEST  Awards recognizes the  learning and development initiatives of our organization.  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 98  3.2 Ecological   Sustainability Wipro recognizes the environmental challenges that face humanity today are as critical as are economic  imperatives and hence ecological sustainability is an essential part of our approach to responsible  corporate citizenship. Understanding Life Cycle Impacts  To understand the unsustainable dependency of Wipro on vulnerable natural resources, natural capital  valuation exercise was conducted. This exercise helped us get an overall integrated environmental impact  assessment of our operations and upstream suppliers. Details of the Natural Capital Valuation is covered  under the sub section Lifecycle impacts  In addition this, we continue to explore additional and specific quantitative and qualitative metrics to  evaluate water (see sub section Responsible Water Framework) and waste management in our campuses.  We also aim to baseline and set specific goals to reduce our footprint associated with key Scope 3  categories (like emissions from Business Travel and Commute), Ozone depleting refrigerants, indoor air  quality and noise pollution. The outcomes of these assessments contribute our program design and  stakeholder engagement.    Natural Capital Impacts Natural capital can be defined as the worlds stocks of natural resources which make human life possible.  Businesses rely on this natural capital to produce goods and deliver services. The overall objective of the  project, (done in association with Trucost) is to quantity and value the natural capital impacts of Wipros IT  Services operations and supply chain for the 2016-17 financial year. The valuation looks at our global  operational footprint (from energy related emissions, water consumption, air/water pollution, waste  generation and management, land use change) and upstream value chain impacts from business travel,  employee commute and the embedded natural capital in all goods and services we procure. Operational  data, business data and employee commute valuation is derived from on actual data, extrapolated for a  few global locations and environmental categories. The natural capital embedded in goods and services is  primarily based on valuation methodology that is based on Trucosts econometric Input-Output model  which takes into account spend across different sub-categories of procurement.   In the 2016-17 financial year, the natural capital valuation of the environmental impacts relating to Wipros  operations and supply chain was equal to INR 11,476 million (2% of Wipros revenue and 7 % of Wipros  profit in the same period). The largest contributions came from GHG emissions (46%), water consumption  (25%) and air pollution (19%).   In terms of GHG emissions, although Scope 3 emissions increased in some areas, this was offset by a  marked decrease in Scope 1 & 2 emissions, leading to a decline of nearly 10% year on year.  Water  consumption meanwhile showed a substantial increase year on year (26%) with most of this attributable to  supply chain water consumption.

Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 102  Program Areas Wipros ecological sustainability program directly addresses four of the eight mega forces. It is an integral  part within many of our key programs, internal and external and across stakeholders.  Our programs focus on the following aspects: Scope of Reporting The environmental reporting covers all our operations globally.  55 locations (includes 3 operational data centers) representing 79% of our workforce. The majority  of operations are based out of 23 owned locations. 163 locations, which includes 7 customer data centers. A majority of the office locations  overseas are leased. In most cases, we pay an all-inclusive rent for the usage of facilities (rental, utilities  and maintenance are combined). We have managed to get electricity data for a representative set of the  locations from the property management. They represent 53% of locations by seat capacity. For other  locations where 'metered' data is not available, we have applied an average consumption figure of 112  KWh/seat/month. These locations account for around 2.1% of our overall Scope 2 emissions, hence is not  materially significant (See our CDP 2017 report for more details). We report only energy consumption  from purchased electricity for overseas offices as the energy consumption under other heads like heating  and cooling is negligible.  India:  Overseas:  Our journey in ecological sustainability reinforces some foundational principles:  Both the environmental impacts and outcomes of measures we implement are multiple and interrelated  The need to assess programs through rigorous goal setting, qualitative measures and quantitative  metrics Acknowledge issues, explore alternatives and prioritize responses specific to the context of each  issue We continually assess operational risks to the environment and apply the precautionary principle in our  approach to get insights and plan our environmental programs.  What follows is a brief description of our policies, systems and programs we follow as part of our ecological  sustainability charter.

Approach A robust mechanism of measuring and reporting performance metrics is a primary requirement to set  scientifically valid, traceable and accountable goals. We have standardized the process for accounting of  Scope 1 and 2 emissions and have also completed the valuation of externalities (all Scope 3 heads).  Our current emissions target for Scope 1 and 2 is based on SBTi (Science Based Target Initiative) from WRI  (World Resources Institute), which runs from 2015-16 to 2019-20; we have suggested targets for 2025 and  2030 also but these will be subject to revision when the next five year target setting exercise is done in 2020.  While we have studied and incorporated the WRI framework to the extent that is relevant, our methodology  has also been driven by empirical considerations that are more pertinent to the IT industry sector and to  India. Our goals comprise five sub-targets, two on GHG and three on energy:  For Energy Efficiency, in line with industry standards, we are shifting from Per Employee based metrics to  Floor Area (FAR) based metrics. The accepted standard is EPI or Energy Performance Indicator which is  equivalent to Energy Per Unit of Floor Area for a defined number of working hours per day. We have deliberately not set a Carbon Neutral goal or an offset program for reducing Scope emissions due to  the externalities involved in most alternatives like embedded carbon and water footprint, land use change  and broader ecological and social sustainability issues involved in such programs. For example, mass  afforestation of a single species over a large area may help achieve a carbon reduction goal but have a high  negative impact on water sustainability, biodiversity and livelihoods. Our focus is on pushing the envelope on  operational emission reduction programs across our value chain. Baselining energy and emissions parameters Setting ambitious, scientifically valid and traceable goals Developing robust mitigation programs Absolute Scope 1  and2 GHG  emissions –  Absolute  emissions  reduction of  35,000 tonnes 1.

Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 107  Energy Intensity: EPI for office spaces, measured in terms of energy per unit area, is 195 units per sq. meter  per annum, an increase of 3% compared to the previous year. While absolute India offices energy  consumption has decreased by 4% due to energy efficiency, operating area shows a sharper reduction of  6.3% as of March 2017 due to consolidation of operations. We expect the EPI metric to show an  improvement in 2018 when we look at full year energy data for consolidated operations. CO2 eq. Tons Per Employee Per Annum CO2 eq.

Global Scope 1 and 2 emissions for 2016-17  has decreased by 3.4%. This is primarily due to higher share of renewable energy procurement. The  dashboard below provides a summary of our Global and India GHG emissions for office spaces – from Scope  1 (emission from direct energy consumption, like fuel) and Scope 2 (emissions from purchased electricity).  The figures are net emissions for all years, after considering zero emissions for renewable energy procured. Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 109  Emissions Intensity: Our India office space emissions intensity (Scope 1 and Scope 2) is at 128 Kg Co2 eq.  per Sq.  Mt. per annum, an increase of 4.7% from last year, largely due to a decrease of 6.3% in operating  area due to consolidation of operations throughout the year. However the global people based emissions  intensity for office spaces is down by more than 8% to 1.34 tons per person per annum. Absolute GHG  emissions reduction of 1.8% for India office operations was contributed by shift from DG electricity to grid  in Chennai, energy efficiency measures and RE procurement.  CO2 eq.

Energy Efficiency  Renewable Energy both (a) strategic procurement and (b) onsite generation Of these, strategic RE procurement will contribute the maximum to GHG emission reductions.  The visual below depicts a graphic representation of this strategy. Over the preceding five year period, we have implemented a variety of  energy efficiency measures.   Green Buildings: We were one of the early adopters of Green Building  Design with 18 of our current buildings certified to the international  LEED standard (Silver, Gold, and Platinum).  Server virtualization: Since 2007, we have been working on a server  rationalization and virtualization program, through which we have  decommissioned old physical servers and replaced the processing  capacity with virtualization technology on fewer numbers of servers. As  of March 2017, we have 2,920 virtual servers (2,088 in 2015-16) running  on 312 physical servers which contributes to an energy savings of  approximately 12.5 million units annually. The savings showed an  increase of 35% over the previous year. This is based on sever rating of  0.75 KW operating for 24 hours and 5 days in a week. This, we believe, is  a conservative estimate considering that many servers run for 7 days a  week and the power rating ranges from 0.75 Kw to 1 Kw (we have  considered the lower power rating for the savings estimate calculation).  Operational Efficiency Measures: Over the years, significant focus has  been given to reduce the energy consumption of our locations by  bringing in various operational efficiency measures in our operation.  These measures include 1. Better operation controls for priority areas  of operations like chillers, water systems and installation of timer  controls to avoid unnecessary usage 2. Retrofit of older equipment with  more energy efficient equipment 3. Consolidation of operations  Renewable Energy - Purchase : 80.0 % Renewable Energy - Generation: 15.0 % Renewable Energy - Generation : 15.0 % Energy Efficiency: 5.0 % Energy Efciency : 5.0 % Energy Efficiency Global Scope 1 and 2 (split by activity) Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 114  accompanied by a transition from leased to owned facilities with the  resulting increase in overall utilization of office space 4. Higher quality  maintenance operations.  These initiatives have helped save 26 Mn  KwH units in the reporting year.  Others:   There is a significant reduction in Scope 1 India emissions (by  40%) due to shift from DG to Grid electricity at our Chennai facility, post  commissioning of an electricity grid substation by the state  government. Data center India emissions have also reduced by 48%  compared to last year, as one of the units of a data center is not  operational.  Strategic procurement: For the reporting period 2016- 17, RE  contributed to approximately 25% of our total India energy  consumption. We procured 96 Mn. units of Renewable energy through  the PPAs (Power Purchase agreements) with private producers, against  our target of 95 Mn units for the reporting year.  Out of this, the zero  carbon RE accounting is considered for 76.5 Mn units, as for this the  green attributes have either been retired or are traceable to Wipro. This  has been done by including non-tradability of Renewable Energy  Certificate (REC) for contracted power through contracts and including  verification of generation in the regulators national REC registry. This  has helped mitigate 62.7 tons of CO2 equiv.  In-situ renewable energy use: The pilot rooftop Solar PV installations at  3 of our campuses followed by extensive use of solar water heaters in  our guest blocks and cafeterias have resulted in equivalent savings of  1.3 Mn units of grid electricity. The IT services outsourcing model require frequent travel to customer  locations, mainly overseas, across the delivery life cycle and contributes to  around 1/4th of our overall emissions footprint. This includes travel by air,  bus, train, local conveyance and hotel stays. Policies on usage of different  modes of travel based on distance, time taken, need and business unit  budget-based travel approval with increasing focus on processes which  enable remote working and collaboration are some of the cost and process  optimization measures implemented over past few years. We have seen an  air travel footprint reduction (distance as well as emissions) reduction of  over 19% compare to 2015-16. In association with a partner, we have  conducted a detailed airline and business unit level of emissions  intensities for the last two years. We plan to incorporate some of the  recommendations in the booking process of travel agents and employees. Renewable Energy Business Travel Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 115  Employees have various choices for commuting are driven primarily by  distance, flexibility, work timings, costs, city infrastructure and connectivity  in the case of group or public transport. In addition to company arranged  transport (41%), employees utilize public transport (~45%), with owned  cars and two wheelers accounting for the balance. Over the past few years,  we have taken steps to facilitate a shift towards improved access to public  transport for employees (buses, commuter trains), carpooling, apart from  encouraging cycling to work through an active cycling community in the  organization.  A mobile app based car-pooling initiative launched across  four of our large locations in July 2016, in association with partners, has  14000 users and has resulted in reduction of 146 tons of CO2 equiv. in the  reporting period. IT led soft infrastructure enablers like anytime direct connectivity access to  office intranet applications, secure personal device connectivity through  the BYOD initiative (Bring Your Own Devices) are steps in enabling more  flexible work place options. Employee Commute Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 116  Water Stewardship   At Wipro, we view water from the three inter-related lens of Conservation, Responsibility and Security; our  articulated goals are therefore predicated on these three dimensions. Water efficiency Continuously improve water  efficiency (fresh water use  per employee) of our  operations. To ensure responsible sourcing  and water management in  proximate communities,  especially in locations that are  prone to water scarcity. Recognizing water availability  as a business risk, to  proactively assess and plan for  the water security of the  organization in a manner that is  congruent with the first two  objectives.   Water security Responsible sourcing Improve water efficiency  (fresh water use per  employee) by 5% year on  year  Reduce absolute water  consumption in existing  campuses by 20% between  FY16 and Fy21 Responsible stewardship: To  ensure responsible water  management in proximate  communities, especially in  locations that are prone to  water scarcity 1 2 3 Goals The following sections describe our implementation approach and the initiatives in this context. Water Efficiency We launched a program in 2013 with the aim of minimizing absolute freshwater consumption by 20% by  FY2018-19 through an integrated approach as articulated below:  Implementing standard metering infrastructure and procedures across campuses.  Demand side optimization (improving efficiency through flow restrictors across campuses and arresting  leakages).  Improving recycling levels through ultra-filtration with eventual use for non-contact applications other  than landscaping and sanitation.  Integrating rain water harvesting into the consumption side of the campus water cycle.  Improving water governance by building user awareness and involvement of water plumbers. New Initiatives We are working towards making our facilities more and more water –sustainable. This has been achieved  with the use of water efficient fixtures, waste water treatment technologies, rain water harvesting and  smart metering for monitoring.  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 117  Aerators:  Water less urinals:  Smart water metering:  Waste water reuse:  Nanofiltration:  Rain water Harvesting:  Employee Participation:  We have installed Aerators in all our wash basins across the campuses during the last fiscal year  2015-16. Aerators provide a constant flow rate of 0.5 GPM through variable pressure optimizing water use  to great extent.    We have retrofitted existing urinal system with water less urinal system by installing  key valves in some of the locations. This system doesnt require water for flushing. This in turn has reduced  water consumption and energy related to pumping of the system. We have installed smart water meters in our campuses to ensure continuous  monitoring of water consumption data in real time. These smart meters have enabled us to identify  wasteage areas so that immediate action can be taken. Entire waste water generated in the campus is treated at our sewage treatment plants.  Recycled water is used for landscaping and flushing. We have installed Ultrafiltration and Reverse osmosis  in three of our major locations and reusing the treated water for cooling systems, this has reduced our  fresh water consumption by 40%. The water quality is monitored on a regular basis ensuring standards and  safety of the employees.  Conventional water softeners is being replaced by membrane softeners (Nanofiltration)  which gives good quality softened water. Nanofiltration removes nearly all viruses, most of the natural  organic matter and a range of salts.  Nanofiltration removes divalent ions, which make water hard, so it is  used to soften hard water.   Rainwater harvesting and integration into freshwater use is a significant  improvement area for water sustainability across our campuses. We plan to integrate rain water use into  primary freshwater use cycle across identified large campuses over the next two year period. Presently rain  water constitutes 2% of the total fresh water. We are encouraging employee to participate and share their view on the sensitive  issues like water and waste. We celebrate world water day along with the employees.  Responsible Sourcing Ground water, municipal water supplies and private purchase contribute to nearly 99% of the total fresh  water consumption. The water supplied by the municipal bodies and the industrial association are sourced  by them in turn from river or lake systems. Water that is purchased from private sources can be traced to  have been extracted from local aquifers.  We take care not to withdraw water from water bodies that are recognized to be particularly sensitive due  to their relative size, function, or status as a support source for endangered species. None of our operations  are significantly impacted by our withdrawal or are covered under any nationally or internationally  designated water conservation areas.  At three of our locations (Bengaluru, Chennai and NCR) we are  predominantly dependent on private sourcing of water supply through tankers, which in turn draw from  local aquifers. During summer periods, our sourcing could be impacted due to shortages or community  concerns.  We also have quality issues (high TDS), which results in treatment costs.  34 of our 59 locations in India are leased and located in prime city areas. For these locations, waste water is  discharged to CSTPs (Common Sewage Treatment plants) and to the municipal sewerage systems. We take  care not to discharge waste water into any subsurface waters, surface waters or sewers that lead directly  to rivers, oceans, lakes, wetlands, and ground water. The treated water from our sewage treatment plants  are tested and are in conformance with the parameters specified by the respective local pollution control  boards. <<Link to  PGWM/KSWN>> Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 118  Performance The per employee water consumption for the reporting year is 1.119 m3 per month as compared to 1.295 in  2015-16, an improvement of around 13.5% and absolute reduction of around 152 million litres of  freshwater.

The  amount of recycled water as a percentage of freshwater extracted is around 61.7%. This improvement in  efficiency is due to the ultra-filtration and RO projects for STP treated water we have undertaken across  our large locations.

Re-evaluation of  the water flow equation for every location, with broad inclusion of diverse treatment procedures will be  deployed. We will use the logic of comparison between the total water that flows in and that flows out of the  campus and account for the gaps observed. We will continue to expand the uses of treated water by further  increasing the scale of UF- RO treatment for usage in non-contact purposes.

Approach Our approach to waste and pollution management extends beyond the organizational boundaries to what  happens downstream all the way to the landfill. Our waste management strategies are centered around  either i) recycling the waste for further use or ii) arranging for safe disposal.  To operationalize our strategy, we follow the following processes.  Segregation of waste into organic, inorganic-waste, hazardous, packaging, bio medical and other  categories.  Recycling segregated waste either in-house or through outsourced vendor arrangements. 90% of the total waste from our IT India operations is recycled -through both, in-house recycling  units and through authorized vendor tie-ups.  A majority of the balance mixed solid waste is also handled through authorized vendors - however  its trail is not entirely known to us or verifiable and therefore, we have adopted a conservative  approach of classifying it as untreated waste.   ?Segregation is to be done at source (point of generation) with the intent of ensuring  recyclability of segregated waste. Further segregation of Municipal Solid Waste within the  campus may not be attempted as the segregated waste will be soiled and is not (or cannot  be) segregated. This may ultimately disposed in landfills – as the vendors will see no value  recoverable from waste.  ?Enable better segregation in work areas by removing individual single bins and ensuring  segregated waste is put in separate bins.  ?Location Hospitality team will work with Cafeteria and tuck-shop vendors to ensure use of  reusable cutlery and to report all waste, total generated in the campus and its disposal.  Mandating suppliers/vendors to take back waste generated inside the campus without a  view on its traceability (handling and final destination) does not absolve us of our  responsibility.  ?Vendor awareness on waste to be centered on product design, packaging etc.  Comprehensive and independent waste assessment audits audit across our locations for electronic  waste and solid waste streams.  The comprehensive external waste assessment we conducted across our locations for electronic waste  and solid waste streams pointed to areas of improvement in governance and traceability of waste  streams across the recycler ecosystem. We would work with our partners and vendors in driving better  practices and behaviors keeping in mind both human and ecological impacts of any changes. Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 121  Goals  The below goals have been set on the basis of an extensive independent audit done during 2012-13. While  our earlier goal centered on only the aggregate level of recycling, the recalibrated goals seek to be more  granular and are set at a category level. This will require close working of operations teams with partners  who have differentiated capabilities across the different waste streams and jointly explore areas of  improvement. Waste Management Performance against Goals  The series of figures below provide detailed statistics on the multiple categories of waste generation,  recycling and disposal pertaining to our operations.  Other waste includes broken furniture, tiles, and  worn/torn carpets – which is largely recycled.  MSW intensity decreased from 3.26 Kg to 1.55 Kg per employee per annum  Landfill intensity halved from 3.12 to 1.55 Kg per employee per annum.  100% recycling of inorganic waste. Waste segregation at source is implemented as a standard practice  at all locations and extensive communication with active involvement of employees and our partners  has been key to achieving the goal.  Presently, 80% of organic waste is handled incampus. 20% is sent as animal feed to farms  Modified Operational Control Procedures (OCP) and e-waste recycler requirements being rolled out in  FY2017 Q1  The total quantum of waste collected was 7484 tonnes in 2016-17, against 6368 tons in 2015-16. This  increase of 17% is primarily due to increase in Construction and Demolition (C&D) debris from extensive  renovation/retrofit work at some of our campuses  88.8% of the total waste from our IT India operations is recycled -through both, in-house recycling units  and through authorized vendor tie-ups. A small proportion is incinerated and the rest is sent to approved  landfills.  Details of different categories of solid waste disposal (All figures in metric, unless mentioned specifically)  is provided in the pie chart. This does not include C&D waste, all of which is sent to approved landfills. Waste Management Air pollution Air pollution is closely linked to energy reduction goals, especially from Scope 1 sources (Generated power  through DG sets).

Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 125  Electronic Waste Oil spills Air Emissions During FY 16-17, the total end of life E-waste collected and recycled through authorized vendors was 322  tons.  We have started working on the recommendation of e-waste audits conducted earlier for better  management of electronic waste. Based on the recommendations, e-waste recycler guidelines and  operating procedures have been revised as per the new e-waste guidelines from the government. These  now include comprehensive records verification for better material traceability.  In accordance with the new  E-waste rules of 2016, we are also considering refurbishing as one of the options for end of life disposal. There were no incidents of significant spills of oil or chemicals during inbound transportation in the  reporting period. We ensure adequate maintenance of our DG sets present in 47 of our locations, this helps in minimizing the  emissions of air pollutants like oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), oxides of Sulphur (Sox) and particulate matter. A  scheduled PPM (Planned Preventive Maintenance) is in place for carrying the maintenance of the DG sets  to check the efficiency of the DG sets. Monthly stack monitoring is also carried out to check NOx, SOx and  SPM levels to ensure the emissions are within the regulatory norms.  The weighted average of stack emissions of more than 100 DGs at 20 of our large and owned locations is as  follows. This is for three air pollutants for the full year. The quantum of the three pollutants in the reporting  year is 98.3 tons (NOx), 9.6 tons (Sox) and 18.8 tons (SPM).

We regularly monitor presence of Indoor air pollutants like VOC (Volatile organic  compounds), POP (Persistent organic pollutants) and other hazardous air pollutants.  The data across few  campuses in March 2016 shows negligible detection of such pollutants. In the next year, we plan to set up  comprehensive mechanisms to monitor and audit indoor air quality and report aggregate values of the  same across campuses. The quantity of refrigerants (R134-A, R404-A, R-407-A, R-407-B, R-407-C, R-410-A and R-22) in 2016-17  was 6.96 metric tons (up from 5.4 tons last year) for all owned (India) locations. Out of that, R-22, a ODS  substance under Montreal Protocol amounts to 2.6 tons. Based on the GWP (global warming potentials) as  per GHG protocol for these substances, this is equivalent to 11,134 tons of CO2 equiv. or 2.39 tons of CFC- 11 ODS/refrigetant. Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 127  Campus Biodiversity    IT Services is predominantly an urban-centric sector and the impacts on biodiversity are rarely direct and  not of the same order or scale as in biodiversity zones in the hinterland e.g. the Western Ghats reserve.  Therefore, our approach since inception more than five years back has been to turn our focus inward on our  own campuses, many of which have reasonably large non-built up spaces. Our goals are twofold: (i) to  convert five of our existing campuses to biodiversity zones and (ii) to design all our new campuses on  biodiversity principles. In our approach towards campus biodiversity, our program takes an integrated  approach towards the contribution in reducing energy and carbon intensity, improving water retention and  ambient air quality.   We have initiated two programs in the last three years to convert existing  campuses to biodiversity zones – (i) our Electronic City campus in Bangalore and (ii) our campus in Pune.  We also conducted a flora and fauna assessment for our new campus in Hyderabad, in association with CII  and WWF. The first stage of our campus biodiversity project - the  butterfly park – was completed in March 2013. The park is witness to hundreds of migratory butterflies  who stop over in the park for nearly a month in their 400 Km pre monsoon annual migration from western to  the Eastern Ghats in India. The second phase of the project, a ~3 acre Wetland park, was also completed in  2016. We also have a second project in Pune which includes five thematic  gardens – aesthetic and palm garden, spring garden, Ficus garden, spice and fruit garden – through  plantations of native spaces specific to the local geography. This would be a unique project in a corporate  campus with a dense year-round flowering of more than 240 species of native plants serving multiple  ecological purposes. These are long term multi-year projects and similar programs will commence at two of  our other campuses. In all these programs we work closely with expert partners in biodiversity,  conservation, ecological design and communications. A work environment which integrates biodiverse and natural design principles has multiple intangible  benefits for employees and visitors – builds a larger sense of connectedness and emphasizes values of  sensitivity and our place in the world around us. We regularly conduct photography, walks and plantation  activities for employees and their children.  One such initiative is the Nurture Your Patch program, an urban farming project at one of  our campuses. Selected employee teams undergo a session on urban farming from an experienced  landscape architect. They were provided with gardening equipment, seeds, compost, water points and  other know how. The teams are free to grow any variety of shrubs or small plants. Teams tend to their  patches every day and some of the teams have already harvested produce. In addition, our operations team  in two locations harvests produce regularly and donates to orphanages and special schools in proximate  areas. In association with ecobasics, we are also developing an  ecosystem assessment framework for urban built campuses – which will address all the ecosystem  services. This will take in observed floral and faunal species data along with other environmental data and  provide a template for baselining and action planning.

Driven by industry led growth and the  structural shifts in village based economy of agriculture and animal husbandry, we are seeing a significant  shift in population towards urban centers. According to a study by McKinsey and Co, there will be 69  metropolitan cities by 2025, each with a population of one million or more, which collectively will be home  to 78 percent of Indias urban population. Gandhi had written then that India is to be found in its 7 million  villages and not cities. It may not be too presumptuous to say now that the future of India lies in how well it  manages it cities.  Cities are seen as magnetic hubs of modern social development that attract enterprise through access to  skills and markets, engender social diversity through cosmopolitanism and trigger technology led  innovation and improvisations. However unprecedented growth, lack of foresight, political will and rent  seeking across the spectrum have exposed the weak foundations of many urban cities. Water, solid waste,  mobility, maintenance of commons like lakes/water bodies, ground water, parks and playground, public  health, inequality (slums comprise a fifth of the total population in Indian cities) get inadequate attention  from policy makers and public executive bodies.   A resilient city would seek to engage on important urban aspects with all its key stakeholders. Wipro  through its community programs is working closely with industry, government and communities in creating  platforms that enable working on some fundamental and sticky issues. Water  Participative ground water project:  To develop understanding of ground water and how it can inform  community led management.  KSWN – Karnataka state water network: In association with CII, a platform to bring together different  stakeholders to work on urban water issues. Since its inception in 2014, it has facilitated interventions  and exchange of ideas between five water sustainability zones/areas in the city. Mobility  Working with urban public transport body in Bangalore for better adoption of public transport by  employees.  Enabling employee groups on cycling and carpooling. Waste  Access to social security and benefits for citys informal waste pickers  Facilitated sessions on waste segregation and composting for employees and their families  Working on an e-waste program for the Electronics City Industrial Township Authority (ELCITA) cluster. Themes of Engagement Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 129  Participative Ground Water Management (PGWM)   Urban Waste Management and Welfare of Waste Pickers Ground water is a primary source of water in Bengaluru, especially for peripheral areas of the city which are  not connected to the city municipal supply (BWSSB). In the last three years, the program has attempted to  explore the issues of ground water in a 35 sq. km area around our corporate head-quarters in Bengaluru –  an area that is completely dependent on ground water for its needs and which is largely unregulated. This is  representative of many rapidly developing urban and peri-urban cities in India; in Bengaluru itself around  40% of its water needs is met by ground water. Our approach was to use a science based approach to  understand the hydrogeology of the area and engage communities through various platforms (citizen  science, advocacy, facilitation of interventions). The program involved extensive borewell monitoring, VES  (Vertical Electrical Sounding) studies and detailed studies in selected clusters. The idea was to evolve a  decentralized model of ground water management. The program has established the feasibility of shallow aquifer as a source of water as well as recharge and  its linkages with how we treat surface water systems like rivers, lakes, wetlands and wells as part of a  connected hydrogeological system. In the next phase of the program, we intend to expand to other areas of  the city and also continue the work on communication and advocacy.   Bangalore with a population of 95 lakh and spread over 800 sq. kilometers produces between 4000-6000  tons of waste per day. The responsibility for the proper handling, collection, transportation and disposal of  waste in the city lies with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). The predominant method of  disposal is dumping in open landfills, which has tremendously detrimental impacts on the quality of air,  water and soil. The BBMP has a sanctioned staff of 12,000 for waste management in the city, but only 7000  are on the rolls. The citizen to staff ratio is a paltry 401:1. (The Times of India May 2012). The present formal  system of waste collection is thoroughly inadequate with many areas left uncovered, resulting in garbage  piling up on street corners. The informal economy workers have long compensated for inadequate waste management systems in the  city by collecting discarded materials that have zero value and convert it into a tradable goods through  their labor in extraction, collection, sorting, grading and transporting. These informal economy waste  workers (numbering 15000- 20000) are also among the most vulnerable populations in the city. According  to one CHF survey a significant number of waste pickers are women who belong to socially marginalized  populations, including backward castes (conducted by Global Communities (formerly CHF International)  and MSSS (Mythri Sarva Seva Samithi)in 2010). The survey found a significant number of young (18 to 40  years), illiterate and economically & socially disadvantaged people engaged in waste picking in the city. In  addition to traditional waste pickers, a significant proportion of the migrant population in the city is  working with waste. The waste pickers access to water, sanitation and housing facilities in the city still  remains inadequate with the situation being worse among migrant waste pickers living in temporary  accommodation and lacking basic identity cards, no services to collect waste etc. The working conditions of  waste pickers are also deplorable. Safety gear is not a priority for formal economy waste workers and in the  informal economy; it is not even a possibility. Armed only with old shoes and clothes picked out from waste  heaps and a stick to sort through trash, the working conditions of informal waste pickers leaves a lot to be  desired. Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 130  The Hasirudala project aims to organize waste workers, i.e. waste-pickers in Bangalore to enhance and  upgrade their skills for innovation in waste management services leading to their increase in income by 10- 40%, their formal inclusion in the waste management market approved by Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagar  Pallike (BBMP) and increased access to social, nutrition and environmental security measures provided by  state and other institutions.  Hasiru Dalas significant achievement in its first year of inception has been to be able to integrate informal  waste workers in operating 27 Dry Waste Cleaning Centers (DWCC). The city administration directly signed a  memorandum of understanding with the waste pickers to operate dry waste collection centers known as  Kartavya because of organizations consistent advocacy with the municipal body. The given space has the  potential to be transformed into a cooperative fair trade scrap store and a place where public citizens,  officers of the BBMP and waste pickers can interact and share ideas. The following are some of the outcomes of this project during FY 2016-17.  Skill upgradation of around 100 waste pickers on terrace gardening, composting, zero waste wedding  and event waste management.  Health Care services through medical checkup camps covered around 450 waste pickers  Trained 100 women waste pickers on mushroom cultivation, with an objective of handling nutrition  issue.  Access to education for 800 children of waste pickers and informal waste workers through scholarships  for schooling. Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 131  3.3 Customer  Stewardship Information and communication technologies now play a central role in driving efficiency and productivity  improvements through dematerialization and automation for most businesses. This trend is being further  strengthened with the continuing influence and adoption of new disruptive technologies like Big Data,  Analytics, Internet of Things and Mobility. The trend of disintermediation is changing the way customer and  business interactions takes place.  Disintermediation gives consumers direct access to information that  otherwise would require a mediator. As a result, new business models are being created and e-commerce is  gaining wide acceptance. Unique opportunities for product innovation made possible by IT is resulting in  democratization of ICT making technology more accessible and affordable to customers. All these trends  contribute to IT becoming ubiquitous in everyday life addressing different needs of end users.   However, technology is not without its associated risks and challenges. The pervasive nature of technology  also raises concerns related to data mismanagement, increase in surveillance, loss of privacy, and possible  abuse. WEF Global Risks Report 2017 lists large-scale cyber-attacks and major data fraud/theft among  the top 10 in terms of likelihood. Customer stewardship hinges on meeting customer expectations by being  responsive to the emerging trends and offering portfolio of products and services which integrate resource  efficiency, dematerialization, organizational transparency, connectedness and collaboration. Engaging with  customers is critical to meet customer expectations and it is the foundation on which stewardship rests.  Wipro has in the past year focused on increasing service presence in our key markets by setting up local  delivery centers engaging the local community – in hiring and in sustainability initiatives. We have taken   our bimodal theme from last year forward, with a focus on helping our clients Drive the Future (Change  Strategy) of their businesses and to Modernize the Core of our clients businesses (Run Strategy).  Highlights of our customer centric growth over the last year are below:  On the digital front, Wipro Digital, while only three years old, continues to impress industry analysts and  clients, and in Q4 FY 17 it constituted 22.1 percent of our revenues.  We have consolidated and scaled up our Consulting arm at Wipro.   Wipro has invested in products, platforms, frameworks and solutions centered around Wipro HOLMES  Artificial Intelligence PlatformTM (HOLMES). In the last fiscal, the number of patents we held (and  applied for) increased by over 50 percent.  Over the last two years we have invested over USD 1 billion dollars in acquisitions, making sounds  investments in innovative business models like BPaaS (Business Process as a Service)  Wipro Ventures, has made four new startup investments in fiscal 2017 to bring our clients new  technologies that are reshaping the future of enterprises, especially in Cybersecurity, Customer Care  Automation, Business Process Automation and Big Data Lifecycle Management. Investments in new  technologies are also being nurtured within Wipro through the Horizon program, to incubate thinking in  Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cybersecurity, Digital, Industry 4.0, Internet of Things (IoT), and Software  Defined Everything (SDx). Customer Engagement  According to a research conducted by Harvard Business School, a 5% increase in customer retention can  result in a profit increase of up to 75%, depending on the industry. The key to retaining customers is  building strong relationships with them which is a sustained, ongoing and long-term process. But such  efforts are justified by the lifetime value (LTV) of the retained customer. Customer retention is eventually  more cost effective as it requires comparatively less service, at the same time providing more business. It is  also revenue enhancing as a satisfied customer may contribute to new customer acquisition through  positive referrals. Understanding Material Aspects for Customers The Annual risk assessment exercise conducted by Enterprise Risk Management Function has identified  Cyber security, Data Privacy, Information Security & related Business Continuity and Service Delivery as  major areas of risk management. For more details, refer to Organization Profile or Financial Stewardship  sections of this report.  Our internal materiality assessment and stakeholder feedback have identified customer privacy, data  security, customer satisfaction, innovation and open source as material issues to our business. This is  further reinforced by feedback from our customers which clearly indicates Customer Privacy, Data Security,  Customer Satisfaction, Innovation and Open Source as the most material issues to their business. Identified Material Aspects  Our report-map on these dimensions is shown below. GRI Aspects / Topics Section Customer Satisfaction Customer Engagement Customer Privacy Data Privacy & IT Security Innovation Next Gen Technologies Open Source Next Gen Technologies > > > > Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 133  We implement this framework through two channels. Customer Value  Creation Value creation to  customer, over and above  contracted Dissatisfaction  Reduction Actions on stated  areas of  dissatisfaction Assure Hygiene Actions to ensure standards  are maintained and avoid  future dissatisfaction Experience Enhancement Actions related to  engagement and  relationships Strategic Approach and Policy The Wipro Strategy is based on our vision of delivering maximum value to our customer businesses based  on a solid relationship of trust, collaboration and competence. This we ensure by providing solutions that  integrate deep industry insights, leading technologies and best in class delivery processes. Delivering on commitments and Making customers successful as stated in Spirit of Wipro is the bedrock  principle of our approach towards customer stewardship. Our new brand strategy, logo and Spirit of Wipro  values, unveiled in 2017, represents a higher level of engagement that helps clients leverage Wipros  expertise to address their business requirements and drive future opportunities in this digital era.  Approach to Customer Centricity Our unique Customer Centricity framework is used in all key accounts to drive appropriate actions that  continually help customer satisfaction. The key objectives of our framework are detailed below. Voice of  Customer (VOC) Customer surveys Customer connect Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 134  Voice of Customer The Voice of the Customer is heard at various levels i.e., at project level, program level, account level and  through direct feedback, informal meetings, governance meetings and senior management interaction with  the client. The processes include Program CSAT, program CSAT, Quarterly pulse surveys and the Annual  CSAT conducted through third party surveys. These are conducted formally and at appropriate intervals to  capture customer feedback on Wipro. The Strategic Marketing Group conducts surveys on brand  perception where they also understand customers expectations of Wipro and Wipros position relative to its  competitors. Regular visits by senior leaders to customers are another key source of information. We also  conduct webinars with our alliance partners to capture the customer voice. Customer Satisfaction Surveys (CSAT)  Annual Survey Pulse Survey (Quaterly) Project Feedback End User CSAT Short Pulse survey for  Q1, Q2 and Q3 for focused  accounts Project CSAT, Programme mile stone feedback Survey Administered by  Third-Party (Average Score) Ticket level feedback Tool Administered survey (Feedback typically  on scale of 1 to 5) Annual CSAT survey is  administered annually to  get feedback on various  facets of engagement  including core delivery,  presales, people  engagement and Wipros  value addition to customers  from CXO, Senior and  Quarterly Pulse Survey is  administered once in a  quarter for the Q1, Q2 and  Q3 of the financial year to  get feedback  predominately from  Senior and Middle  Project CSATs are  obtained to enhance  customers experience  while dealing with Wipro.  Customer feedback is  obtained on Projects and  Programs at different  points of time during  execution on different  aspects like Delivery,  End user CSAT feedback  is administered to  customer respondents  who are end users. These  feedbacks are analyzed  by respective program  Survey Administered by  Wipro Tool (Average  Score and % of 6+ projects) Conducted annually for all customers  across all strata to capture voice of  customer and align to customer  business requirements Survey Administered by  Third-Party (NPS and Average  score for other key questions) Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 135  The Customer Connect Process Wipro communicates and connects with its customers through a matrix framework. Every key account has  a dedicated Client Partner to own and manage the relationship. The Client Partner profiles the account and  proposes/ offers solutions that are strategically relevant to customers.  An execution process document  and system maintenance technical document for each engagement ensures that all customer needs are  documented and agreed between the two parties.  Business Unit heads interact and engage with customers via monthly governance meetings, quarterly  business review meetings, and client-visits every quarter. Service Line heads visit and attend all the  important meetings. In addition, the CEO visits key accounts regularly. Executive sponsors are assigned for  all mega accounts to maintain and build the relationship. Customer Centricity is also a key leadership quality on which Wipro leaders receive 360-degree feedback,  every year. Quantitative and qualitative feedback from peers, managers and direct reports is analyzed and  shared with employees. The feedback is also integrated with the performance appraisal process to ensure  that right actions are put in place to improve customer satisfaction. The Customer Satisfaction (C-SAT) Action Planning frame work CSAT is an important business objective and it is linked to employee performance linked payouts on a  quarterly basis. We follow the following framework to seek, understand and analyze customer feedback.  The customer feedback obtained through the surveys is analyzed and improvement opportunities are  identified.  Once actions are identified, the value creation actions (CVI) and Dissatisfaction Reduction  Actions are communicated to the customer. Frequent updates on progress, through quarterly business  reviews and other appropriate forums are provided to build customer confidence in the process, and  ensure that the actions taken truly have a positive impact on customer satisfaction. Senior leaders review  feedback reports at regular intervals in different forums such as Quality Improvement Councils and  Management Review Meetings. Governance of Customer Relationship Management The Customer Advocacy Group (CAG) in Wipro is part of the Quality organization and drives customer  satisfaction improvement initiatives for the organization. This group is responsible for enabling and  tracking the early warning system and for addressing alerts before they can potentially become serious  customer issues. The team is also responsible for driving effective closures of customer escalations. Performance Highlights  Revenue generated from existing customers / retained accounts is a good indicator of customer  satisfaction and retention. The revenue from existing customers saw a small dip from 98.1% to 98%.   Net promoter Score (NPS) measures customers engagement with Wipro and is measured on a 10-point  scale. The respondents based on their ratings are categorized as promoters, detractors or passives.  This measure is widely used across industries. Our Net Promoter Score shows a continuous  improvement trend as it has increased by 740 basis points for 2016-17 as compared to the previous  year.  Number of new customers acquired by Wipro in 2016-17 increased from 194 to 256; further, the number  of active customers increased from 1223 to 1323. Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 136  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 137 Sustainability Expectations from Customers Apart from technology driven value creation, our global customers also expect transparency and  compliance on different sustainability aspects within our operations and in our extended value chain.   Responses to most customer proposals and contract renewals require an extensive disclosure of our  sustainability programs and performance.  In many cases, customers require acceptance and alignment  with their supplier code of conduct that contain several sustainability related principles. Third party supply  chain CSR raters like Ecovadis and Verego regularly assess and profile our sustainability performance in  their platform which is used by more than 30 Wipro customers. In the recent assessment by Ecovadis, we  have achieved an overall CSR rating of Gold (highest among possible three levels). Verego has rated us  Best in Class across all the 5 areas (Leadership, Ethics, People, Community and Environment).  We also  have been benchmarked against over 4000 other companies that responded to CDPs 2017 supply chain  information request sent on behalf of 89 CDP supply chain members with over US$2 trillion spend and  received a disclosure score of 100. Data Privacy and IT security The Global Risk Report 2017 of the World Economic Forum includes (a) breakdown of critical information  infrastructure and networks and (b) massive incidents of data fraud/theft among the top risks faced by the  world.  With cloud services such as SaaS, PaaS and IaaS becoming increasingly important to the way businesses  operate, the resilience of critical information infrastructure becomes critical. It is crucial to ensure access  to systems and data at all times. Any service disruptions or suboptimal system performance can lead to  businesses incurring higher costs and suffering reputational damage. It can even become business  continuity issue, especially for organizations whose business models are technology centric. Such systemic  failures can negatively impact industrial production, public services and communications. The breakdown of IT infrastructure could be triggered by technical failures, weather events, natural  disasters or terrorist attacks. The Risk report identifies large scale state-sponsored, state-affiliated,  criminal or terrorist cyberattacks as a significant risk which can cause an infrastructure breakdown and/or  loss of trust in the Internet.  The magnitude of data to be handled by todays organization is gigantic. This abundance of data opens the  door to many opportunities in all spheres of life- economic, social, and political. But with big data which  can create big impacts comes big responsibilities. The globalized nature of the internet as well as the  intensive virtual interactions and extensive data storage makes this a significant risk to corporate  organizations. Any leakage or misuse or unauthorized access of information could expose companies to  legal and reputational risks. Insufficient protection of database and network, unclear management of  personal information and vague database access rules are the main reasons behind any data breach.  The nature of the IT services industry does not require Wipro to store any customer proprietary data in its  systems and networks. In rare circumstances where, as part of project requirement, it is needed to view  Customer data, it is accessed remotely - with the data being stored and hosted in customers systems. This  avoids the risk of customer information vulnerability in Wipro's systems. Policy on Protection of Data Privacy 'Protecting Customer Information' is a key section of Code of Business Conduct of Wipro and  communicates our stand on the protection of personal information of our employees, customers and  relevant stakeholders. Wipro mandates compliance to this code through periodical certification and  company -wide awareness and testing of the code every year. In addition to the section in Code of Conduct,  Wipro has also defined Privacy policy and this policy is published in the website (URL:   Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 138 http://www.wipro.com/privacy-policy/ ). This policy communicates   Wipros approach to protection of  personal information collected electronically. There is an internal Data Protection and Privacy policy  defined under Information Security Management System (ISMS) with the objective – to define collection,  protection and usage of personal data & company confidential information as per applicable laws and  regulations. We have also established and implemented Security Incident Management policy that covers  procedures for reporting and handling policy violations & data breaches.  Our policies are in compliance  with globally accepted data protection principles.  Wipros ISMS is published on an intranet portal - ISMS which provides applicable IT security and privacy  policies for different target segments (Employees, Third Party Contractors, Leadership team System  Administrators and Sales teams and contains all relevant details on policies, standards, procedures and  guidelines related to information security.  Policy in Action through the Information Security Management System To ensure effective implementation of privacy policy within Wipro, a comprehensive and mature framework  of systems and processes have been evolved. Applicable statutory regulations are identified and  documented with supporting compliance procedures and policies to manage the entire process of legal  and regulatory compliances. For example, generally accepted Data Protection (DP) principles pertaining to  fair and lawful purpose, adequacy, accuracy, retention of data, safeguards for processing and data  transfers are mapped to the processes and practices of Wipro's Information Security Management System  (ISMS). Privacy risk assessments are undertaken with the objective of identifying potential areas of risks relating  to privacy of employee data collected, processed and stored within Wipros internal Information Systems  within various geographies. The mitigation measures in-line with ISMS practices are implemented to  address the risks. Compliance verifications are performed through regular internal and external audits.  (ISO27001:2013 for Information Security and other Business Continuity framework principles). Changes to  applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies space across various geographies are monitored and  assessed for their impact on the enterprise from Information Security/ Business Continuity perspective.  Necessary inputs are sought from the Legal team to assess the impact for any legal risks involved while  undertaking key enterprise level initiatives. Automated monitoring tools and detective controls have been implemented for detecting leakages of  confidential data from Wipro. The data breach notification procedure template, which is deployed  specifically for each customer account/program/project, is also provided. A security incident notification  form is also designed for notifying the data breach incidents and published on the intranet portal  accessible for all employees. Data privacy specific training programs are designed and imparted to employees of customer accounts on  all applicable privacy regulations. In addition, innovative methods are employed to spread Information  security and privacy awareness amongst all Wipro users such as e-mailers, blogs, and theme based  awareness campaigns.  Wipro's technology infrastructure in various locations of operation ensures adequate resilience in the basic  IT infrastructure, which helps critical business operations run during disaster situations. Technology  disaster recovery planning includes physical infrastructure, computing infrastructure and communication  infrastructure. Wipros corporate (i.e. non-customer data) data assets residing in our enterprise information  systems and applications are backed up on a regular basis and the backup integrity tests are periodically  performed as per Wipro Information Security Policy.   Governance The Security Organization in Wipro is established with clear roles and responsibilities for implementing  information security and business continuity in the organization. The General Counsel of Wipro is the  authority to review the effectiveness and progress of information security and business continuity  programs. Information Risk Management & Policy Compliance Group (IRMC) headed by the designated  CISO (Chief Information Security Officer), a group that holds the overall responsibility of governing the  Information Security risk and compliance practices within Wipro. Further, on the Risk Management  initiatives, IRMC works closely with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team headed by Chief Risk Officer  (CRO), which holds the responsibility for data privacy and reports to General Counsel as well as Wipro  Board of Directors. It is generally understood and accepted internally that Information security and privacy  is a joint responsibility of multiple stakeholders from various departments/functions such as Information  Risk Management, Legal, Human Resources, Enterprise Risk Management office, senior leadership, Global  Delivery Organization and the internal Information Systems teams. Performance on Data Privacy and Information Security Wipro is certified under the ISO 27001:2013 standard which provides assurance in the areas of information  security, physical security and business continuity. Wipro has a well-documented Business Continuity  Management System in line with BS25999 standard. This is a program through which preparedness for  handling emergencies is addressed at business unit, location and cross functional levels.  We report any breaches of privacy policy through our public reports (Annual Financial Report) and in our  filings with the SEC. There were no incidents in the reporting year for which Wipro had to pay penalties or  revenue losses. There was 1 substantiated complaint concerning customer privacy and loss of customer  data. We have extended, and continue to extend, full co-operation to the investigating / law enforcement  authorities on the same. There were a total of 4 identified leaks, thefts, or losses of customer data, during  the year. There were no complaints received from outside parties and substantiated by the organization, or  from regulatory bodies. Innovation Human experience in interacting with machines is rapidly evolving. Breakthroughs in Man-Machine  Interfaces (MMI) using acoustics, gestures, biometrics, body movement and virtual reality coupled with  context-aware applications are introducing higher levels of user engagement. Such interactions are  dynamic, flexible, personalized, responsive, real-time and data driven. Growing project complexities,  competitive pressures, operational challenges and the need to maintain and grow margins is driving  companies to adopt technologies that will help them run business as usual, improve operational  efficiencies and provide competitive differentiation. Essentially, this will prepare organizations to  fundamentally change the way they do business.  Next generation digital technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics and  emerging collaborative development methodologies like Open Source are driving this change. These  emerging technological innovations can drive sustainability by way of digitalization and dematerialization,  system integration and optimization. For example: Digitalization and dematerialization  can reduce or eliminate the need for  an emissions-intensive product or  process System integration  improves  efficiency across  organization Optimization of processes, activities, and  functions improves efficiency through  simulation, automation, redesign or  control Analytics enable  better and smarter  decision-making Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 139  Strategic Approach to Innovation Wipro has a two-pronged approach to innovation – external and internal. Externally, we work jointly with  our customers and with various academic institutes, research organizations both from a recruitment  perspective as well as from a partnership perspective.  For joint innovation with customers, Wipro has primarily four models: Each model has specific use situations depending on the amount of investment and the nature of the  innovation problems that are addressed. We also assess maturity levels of participating stakeholders while  proposing these different engagement models. Wipro understands the necessity of having a strong Open Innovation Network and invests into building,  supporting and participating in various such networks and forums. The bulk of the company's Open  Innovation activity is aligned to the focus themes driven by the CTO Office and the strategic areas as  identified by the respective individual business units. On the Internal Innovation side, a number of initiatives have been started that are designed on concepts of  Open Innovation to inculcate a culture of innovation in people. They span the lifecycle of Idea Management  from Ideation to Development. Some of them are Directed Idea Campaigns sponsored by business units  (BU) which may want to crowdsource ideas around a defined Use Case or Problem Statement. Ideas coming  in as part of these are further taken up by the Sponsoring Business Units or the Idea Author is given a  chance to develop it wherein CTO Office supports in the form of infrastructure and mentoring. Technology  training and enablement initiatives like CodeStorm enable people to learn and become proficient in new  and emerging technology and languages by participating in Coding Contests and Hackathons.  Technology Themes for Innovation As part of a start-up engagement model, we have invested in building a world class ecosystem through a  US$ 100 million corporate venture capital fund, Wipro Ventures, aimed at investing in cutting edge start- ups in areas such as Digital, Internet of Things (IoT), Big data, Open source, Cybersecurity and Artificial  Intelligence (AI). In 2017, Wipro Ventures has made four new startup investments. Through the momentum  that was built in 2015-16, Wipro Ventures now has 9 such investments with a cumulative spend of $ 24.5  million in startups working in technologies that are reshaping the future of enterprises. Together with our  investee companies, we now have 10 joint commercial engagements in Security, Customer Care  Automation, Business Process Automation and Big Data Lifecycle Management.

Over the subsequent decades, accounting and reporting methods  were refined and institutionalized. In the last couple of decades, progressive calls for transparency and  accountability have led stock exchanges to enforce a number of requirements for corporate disclosures.   The King Report on Corporate Governance (1994, 2002, and 2009) is widely regarded as the first integrated  reporting framework on corporate governance and performance, covering both finance and non-financial  disclosures.  Compliance with the Kings framework is required by companies listed on the Johannesburg  Stock Exchange. Similarly, in India, the National Voluntary Guidelines released by the Ministry of Corporate  Affairs have been adopted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India for listed companies to publish a  Business Responsibility Report (BRR) as part of their annual financial report.  The International Integrated  Reporting Council (IIRC), a global coalition of regulators, investors, companies, standard bodies, the  accounting profession and NGOs, is facilitating adoption of integrated reporting framework <IR> as the new  corporate reporting norm. One of the core elements of the framework is accountability and stewardship of  the stocks and flows of the six forms of capital: financial, manufactured, intellectual, human, social and  natural. The first two forms of capital are covered in almost all annual reports while the others are covered  to varying degrees by some organizations depending on their context and understanding of impacts to  significant stakeholders.   In 2017, Wipro signed the commitment to move towards using the recommendations of the Task Force on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in our annual financial reporting.  TCFD is spearheaded by The  Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), which is an international consortium of business and  environmental NGOs.  By signing this, Wipro commits to implement the recommendations of the Task Force  on Climate-related Financial Disclosures in our Annual Reports.   The increasing recognition that social and environmental risks can affect a companys operational strength  and continuity has prompted active engagement from investors, regulators and government. Investors are  increasingly incorporating ESG criteria (Environmental, Social and Governance) into their investment  decision frameworks. Over the last decade, this has manifested in at least four different ways as shown in  the chart below.  In this section, we primarily focus on our engagement with the investor community and how accountability  and good business conduct are integral implements of financial stewardship.

A report map of material  issues and their coverage in this report is given below.  Economic Performance We are one of the leading providers of IT services globally. We develop and integrate innovative solutions  that enable our clients to leverage IT to achieve their business objectives at competitive costs. We use our  quality processes and global talent pool to deliver time to development advantages, cost savings and  productivity improvements.  Our IT Services business provides a range of IT and IT-enabled services which include digital strategy  advisory, customer centric design, technology consulting, IT consulting, custom application design,  development, re-engineering and maintenance, systems integration, package implementation, global  infrastructure services, analytics services, business process services, research and development and  hardware and software design to leading enterprises worldwide. Our vision is To earn our Clients trust and  maximize value of their businesses by providing solutions that integrate deep industry insights, leading  technologies and best in class execution. The markets we serve are undergoing rapid changes due to the  pace of developments in technology, innovation in business models and changes in the sourcing strategies  of clients. Pressures on cost-competitiveness and an uncertain economic environment are causing clients  to develop newer business models. On the technology front, digital business has changed the nature of  demand for IT services. Development of advanced technologies such as cloud based offerings, big data  analytics, mobile applications and the emergence of social media are shifting the point of decision-making  on IT sourcing within clients organization from the traditional Chief Information Officer to newer  stakeholders such as Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Digital Officer, Chief Risk Officer etc. These trends on  newer business models, emerging technologies and sourcing patterns provide us with significant growth  opportunities.  Our IT Products segment provides a range of third-party IT products, which allows us to offer  comprehensive IT system integration services. These products include computing, Platforms and Storage,  Networking Solutions, Enterprise Information Security, and software products, including databases and  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 152  operating systems. We have a diverse range of clients, primarily in the India and Middle East markets from  small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to large enterprises in all major industries.   Business Strategy The vision for our business is To earn our clients trust and maximize value of their businesses by providing  solutions that integrate deep industry insights, leading technologies and best in class execution. In doing  business we seek to emphasize our core values of being passionate about our clients success, treating  each person with respect, being global and responsible, and maintaining unyielding integrity in everything  we do. Our ambition for 2020 has set the direction of our strategy. Technology has become increasingly central and core to enterprises across industry segments. In addition,  consumerization of IT has led to blurring of boundaries between business needs and technology  enablement. This has led Wipro to place a strong focus on efficiency in the Run side of our clients  operations while also driving transformation on the Change side of our clients businesses. The Run  Strategy is about Modernizing the Core of our clients process and technology landscape, i.e., helping  clients achieve significant efficiencies in their core operations through various levers across our core  market segments. The Change Strategy is about Driving the Future and is focused on helping our clients  drive Digital transformation enabled by digital capabilities and assets delivered by Wipro and its partner  ecosystem. Refer to pages 26 - 29 of Wipro Annual Report for FY 2016-17 for detailed Business Strategy. Assessment of Financial and Economic risks  Our annual financial report and the Form 20-F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange commission for  the reporting year lists a number of external factors or risks that may impact our business. These  externalities are assessed regularly and inform business strategy. We present here a summary of the key  external risks identified and our approach towards them. The engagement is informed by three primary  factors (i) the different timescales in which they play out, (ii) the relative influence business has and (iii)  meeting the concurrent and diverse needs of its various stakeholders.  A significant portion of our revenues are in foreign currencies, from our wide  international customer base ; these currencies include U.S. Dollar, the United Kingdom Pound Sterling,  the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar while a large portion of our costs are in Indian  Rupees. The exchange rate between the Rupee and foreign currencies has fluctuated significantly in  recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. As our financial statements are presented in  Rupees, such fluctuations could have a material impact on our reported results. We also undertake  hedging strategies to mitigate exposure of exchange rate risk relating to foreign currency borrowing,  including entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps.  Some countries and organizations have expressed concerns about a  perceived connection between offshore outsourcing and the loss of jobs domestically. With high  domestic unemployment levels in many countries and increasing political and media attention on the  outsourcing of services internationally by domestic corporations, there have been concerted efforts in  many countries to enact new legislations to restrict offshore outsourcing or impose restrictions on  companies that outsource.   We derive approximately 55% of our IT Services revenue from the Americas  (including the United States) and 24% of our IT Services revenue from Europe. If the economy in the  Americas or Europe continues to be volatile or conditions in the global financial market deteriorate,  pricing for our services may become less attractive and our clients located in these geographies may  reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly. Reduction in spending on IT services may  Currency fluctuations:  Restrictive mobility legislations:  Global economic crisis:  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 153  lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability. Our clients are  concentrated in certain key industries. Any significant decrease in the growth of any one of these  industries, or widespread changes in any such industry, may reduce or alter the demand for our services  and adversely affect our revenue and profitability. For instance, the drop in global crude oil price has  significantly impacted the companies operating in the energy industry, impacting revenue and  profitability of our Energy, Natural Resources and Utilities industry vertical.  Disruptions in telecommunications: The offshore development center model necessitates maintaining  a resilient and active voice and data communication infrastructure between our offices in India, our  clients offices, and our software development and support facilities overseas. Redundancy and  business continuity measures are critical in the event of a telecom disruption.  Our profits for the period earned from providing services at client premises outside India  are subject to tax in the countries where we perform the work. Most of our taxes paid in countries other  than India can be applied as a credit against our Indian tax liability to the extent that the same income is  subject to taxation in India. Currently, we benefit from certain tax incentives under Indian tax laws.  These tax incentives include a tax holiday from payment of Indian corporate income taxes for our  businesses operating from specially designated Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Any change to these  incentives and other exemptions we receive due to government policies can impact our financial  performance.   Our wage costs in India have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the  U.S. and Europe for comparably skilled professionals, and this has been one of our competitive  advantages. However, wage increases in India may prevent us from sustaining this competitive  advantage and may negatively affect our profit margins. We may need to increase the levels of our  employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to retain talent. Unless we are able to continue to  increase the efficiency and productivity of our employees over the long term, wage increases may  reduce our profit margins. Further emerging low cost locations, like Eastern Europe, China or Southeast  Asia could also negatively affect our profits.  Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of  patent, copyright, trademark and design laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual  provisions to protect our intellectual property. We require employees, independent contractors and,  whenever possible, vendors to enter into confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their  relationships with us. These confidentiality agreements generally provide that any confidential or  proprietary information being developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential. These agreements  also provide that any confidential or proprietary information disclosed to third parties in the course of  our business be kept confidential by such third parties. However, our clients usually own the intellectual  property in the software we develop for them.

They are concerned about loss of management time and  resources dealing with such issues, legal liability and damage to reputation due to unethical practices like  bribery, corruption, anti-competition and anti-trust. Even though large businesses have formal systems to  ensure compliance and avoid unethical businesses, they are exposed to such risks from their supply  chains. Corruption and bribery are significant risks to businesses, and they are more pervasive in the  supply chain. This makes business functions dealing with suppliers and business partners vulnerable to  such risks. Policy Our corporation wide Code of Business Conduct (COBC) provides the broad direction for all business  transactions. The COBC is Wipros central and comprehensive compliance policy document that provides  the framework and a common language for ethical conduct for all employees as well as all our  stakeholders. The COBC applies to all employees and members of the Board of Directors of the Company, as  also to all individuals who serve the Company on contract, subcontract, retainer, consultant or any other  such basis. Suppliers, service providers, external professionals, agents, channel partners (dealers,  distributors and others) serve as an extension of the Company and their conduct and behavior while  carrying out business dealings with Wipro or on behalf of Wipro can have an impact on Wipro and its  reputation.  Other than COBC, we also have other policies like the abridged Policy on Related Party Transactions, Wipro  Supplier Code of Conduct, Code of Independent Directors and Code of Ethics for Principal Executive Officer  and Senior Financial Officers, which contextualize the communication for relevant stakeholders.  Approach From an anti-bribery compliance perspective, Wipro has the following processes internally to ensure an  ethical culture across our businesses.   A payment due diligence process where payments made by and on behalf of Wipro are reviewed to  ensure adherence to anti-corruption and anti-bribery  A Standard Operating Procedure to enable employees understand and comply with the requirements for  specific purposes like business courtesies, gifts, entertaining, charitable contribution, sponsorship, etc.  Employees are advised to avoid transactions which might give the appearance of offering or accepting  an improper payment, bribe or kickback.   Due diligence mechanisms, internal controls and assessments on its third parties such as channel  partners, dealers, collection agents, lead finders/hunters etcetera which includes a specific undertaking  from identified vendors, service providers, consultants to affirm compliance to our Code of Business  Conduct and more specifically to our anti-bribery policies  An Ombudsprocess for receiving and redressing employees complaints, through which employees are  encouraged to report any fraudulent financial or other information to the stakeholders, any conduct that  results in violation of the Companys COBC(on an anonymous basis, if employees so desire). For more  information, refer to Organization Profile <Link> As part of COBC training, Wipro conducts entry-level training to all its employees across levels worldwide  on corporate policies pertaining to Business Relationship, Gifts and Entertainment, Business Courtesies  and Conflict of Interest.  Compliance with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act, the Indian  Prevention of Corruption Act, are included as part of leadership training programs and of focused training  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 157  programs.  In addition to annual test and certification of Code of Business Conduct, a certification process  is enabled for employees travelling to High Risk Countries and employees working in certain functions.  Also, communication of COBC and their significance to Wipro are being done through emails, posters etc. Compliance Wipro has a continuing good track of ethical conduct and we comply with relevant legislations. There has  been no significant instances related to bribery, corruption, anti-competitive or anti-trust practices in the  reporting period across our business divisions.  Natural Capital Valuation Natural capital can be defined as the worlds stocks of natural resources which make human life possible.  Businesses rely on this natural capital to produce goods and deliver services. They depend on natural non- renewable resources (for example, fossil fuels and minerals) as well as natural renewable ecosystem goods  and services (for example, freshwater and pollination). Businesses also rely on natural capital for its ability  to absorb by-products of production such as pollution and water. Business extraction and production  activities can damage natural capital with long term economic and social consequences. These economic and social consequences manifest themselves as physical, regulatory and reputational  risks for companies. One of the most useful ways for companies to account for these risks is to quantify  and value the environmental impacts generated across their value chains in monetary terms. Traditional single parameter environmental metrics such as cubic meters of water or hectares of land  provide an indication of the scale of dependency on ecosystem goods and services or environmental  impacts. However, they often fail to identify optimization opportunities for business. Natural capital  valuation, on the other hand, provides a deeper insight because it also factors critical environmental  parameters such as regional water scarcity and the ecosystem services provided by land. There are several global and country led projects underway which aim to develop environmental accounts  and integrate them with traditional national accounts (GDP) including India. UNPRI, in 2010, estimated the  environmental costs due to activities of top 3000 companies at US$ 6 Trillion per year. The Natural Capital  Coalition (NCC), for example, is developing a Natural Capital Protocol to provide a standardized approach to  natural capital accounting and valuation for businesses. Wipro, in association with Trucost, completed its first natural capital valuation exercise for the financial  year 2013-14. The valuation looks at our global operational footprint - energy related emissions, water  consumption, air/water pollution, waste generation and, land use change, business travel, employee  commute – as well as the embedded natural capital in all goods and services that we procure from our  supply chain. The natural capital embedded in goods and services is primarily based on valuation  methodology that is based on Trucost's econometric Input-Output model which incorporates spending  across different sub-categories of procurement. Monetization of impacts is based on emerging models and  a selection of global and local factors - hence certain assumptions and accounting rules are inherent to the  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 158  Value Chain Split (in INR million) 2015-16 Valuation (INR million) 2015-16 % Contribution (%) 2016-17 Valuation (INR million) 2016-17 % Contribution (%) GHGs Air pollution Water consumption Water pollution Land use change Waste 0 1k 2k 3k 4k 5k 6k 7k Environmental  Indicator 2016-17:  Valuation ( INR million) %  Contribution GHGs 5,250 46% Air pollution 2,201 19% Water Consumption 2,824 25% Water pollution 697 6% Land use change 264 2% Waste 240 2% Total 11,476 100% Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 159  Environmental Indicator Valuation (in INR million) 2016-17: Valuation (INR million) Operational Supply chain: Purchased goods and services Supply chain: Fuel and energy related activities Supply chain: Business travel Supply chain: Employee commuting 2015-16: Valuation (INR million) Operational Supply chain: Purchased goods and services Supply chain: Fuel and energy related activities Supply chain: Business travel Supply chain: Employee commuting Value Chain 2016-17  Valuation  (INR million) 2015-16  Valuation  (INR million) 2014-15  Valuation  (INR million) % Change since 2015-16 % Change since 2014-15 Operational 3,226 3,815 3,580 -18% -12% Supply chain: Purchased  goods and services 2,159 1,428 792 51% 48% Supply chain: Fuel- and  energy-related activities 3,443 3,320 3,196 4% 19% Supply chain: Business  travel 1,285 1,595 1,249 -24% 31% Supply chain: Employee  commuting 1,363 1,319 1,258 3% 24% Total 11,476 11,476 10,075 0% 17% Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 160  The valuation for 2016-17 was completed in August 2017. The trends from previous years have not been  significantly different. In terms of GHG emissions, although Scope 3 emissions increased in some areas,  this was offset by a marked decrease in Scope 1 & 2 emissions, leading to a decline of nearly 10% year on  year.  Water consumption meanwhile showed a substantial increase year on year (26%) with most of this  attributable to supply chain water consumption.  The total environmental costs relating to Wipros operations and supply chain was equal to `11,476 million  for 2016- 17. The largest contributions came from GHG emissions (46%), air pollution (19%) and water  consumption (25%). The overall natural capital valuation  has remained flat from the 2015-16 financial  year and up 14% since 2013 - 14.The operational value chain stage (including business travel and  employee commuting) accounted for INR 5,874 million in the 2016-17 financial year. This is a 13% decrease  from the previous year. From a geography perspective, India accounts for 83% of the overall environmental  cost. The above figures are net of our positive valuation that are attributable to our environmental  initiatives.  For Wipro, this study provides useful indicators to understand impacts and assess the value of our  environmental programs. For external stakeholders like customers and analysts, these data points provide  a completely transparent full life-cycle understanding of our environmental footprint. Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 161  3.5 Supply Chain  Sustainability The impacts or externalities of businesses are frequently influenced by their supply chain processes.   Managing the environmental and social impacts of supply chain are interlinked to economic outputs over  the long term – they can help businesses avoid disruptions, meet evolving customer and business partner  requirements, foster innovation and protect the companys reputation and brand value. It can also help  further the business imperatives of efficiency, cost effectiveness and resilience in the supply chain.  However, the fundamental and compelling reason for sustainability engagement in our value chain stems  from our belief that it is the right thing to do in the larger interests of both, the suppliers as well as of  society. The context, scale and complexity of modern supply chains pose challenges for business to identify,  influence and control these impacts. Our supply chain management program is influenced by our  understanding of the multiple drivers as well as the challenges associated with it. Understanding the Stakeholder - Supply Chain The supplier ecosystem of Wipro can be broadly categorized into two broad heads.  One category can be  called as our primary supply chain which comprises of our contract employees involved in core delivery of  IT Services and Solutions. Such employees typically have gone through a minimum graduate degree  qualification and are experienced in specialized technology and consulting skills aided by an intensive in- house capability building program. We considered them as part of our supply chain as they not engaged   directly employed by Wipro. Our workforce currently includes more than 20,000 contract employees. The second component of our supply chain is product or services supply chain or secondary supply chain  which comprises of suppliers who provide products, business support services and utility management  services for our operations. The list of categories of procurement which form the secondary supply chain is  given below. Facility management requires a diverse set of support services ranging from hospitality, housekeeping,  catering, equipment maintenance among others and for this we have moved to a an IFMA arrangement  (Integrated Facility Management Services). A significant number of contract manpower is employed as part  of these facilities. Wipro actively encourages diversity in the supply chain and sourcing from the local economy. Wipro is an  Equal Opportunity employer and strongly advocates the same through its supply chain by encouraging  supplier diversity. Qualified enterprises owned by person with disability or women are identified and  engaged with. The spend from these suppliers constitute 3% total supplier spend (as declared by supplier  and not verified). Local sourcing reduces costs, provides local employment benefits and reduced  environmental footprint in sourcing. 45 % of suppliers spend is from suppliers based in India.

The suppliers are classified into two categories: Strategic suppliers and Tactical suppliers. The Global  Procurement Group finalizes the supplier categorization based on annual performance evaluation.  Strategic Suppliers are suppliers which are essential for the success of strategic business outcomes for  Wipro. Sustainability or other serious issues with such suppliers may seriously dent Wipros ability to meet  its objectives. Tactical Suppliers account for only a small part of the overall spend of Wipro. Understanding Material Aspects In determining material issues of a stakeholder, a structured risk assessment exercise is very useful.  Wipro's approach to identifying sustainability risks in the supply chain includes cross functional analysis of  the risks pertaining to different organizational functions. The Enterprise Risk Management function owns  the supplier economic risk assessment process and their focus is on ensuring continuous and non- interrupted supply of services/goods. Vendor Risk Assessment comprises a formal evaluation of a vendor  companys financial health which is determined by many factors including operational efficiency,  susceptibility to corruption etc. The Group Sustainability Function partners with Central Procurement Organization, Facilities Management  Group and other relevant stakeholders in identifying environmental and social risks in Wipro's supply chain  through independent studies conducted periodically. Wipro commissioned Fronesys and Trucost in 2012 to  conduct a preliminary risk assessment study of environmental and social risks in its supply chain. These  studies provided valuable insights for the initial risk mapping exercise and prioritizing areas of supplier  engagement. Trucost quantifies the natural capital impacts of Wipros operations and its supply chain using  primary activity data and accepted valuation methodologies. Fronesys undertook hot social spot  assessments for Wipro and identified high risk suppliers for engagement in terms of social risk for Wipro. The Ombuds process is also available for suppliers through a 24X7 hotline and on the internet. The concerns  raised through the Ombudsprocess are another source of identification of risks in the supply chain.

Identified Material Aspects  The understanding of risks in supply chain and our stakeholders concerns informed the outcomes of our  materiality determination exercise. Based on the identified risks, we have identified the following aspects  as material from a sustainability perspective. (We refer to our high proportion of contract staff - both, people involved in core delivery as well as skilled or  unskilled support staff who work in campus operations as people supply chain. In this section, we will  primarily address the secondary supply chain as the people supply chain aspect has been covered in detail in  Workplace Sustainability section of our report.)

Ethics - Wipro expects its suppliers to adhere to similar standards of ethics and integrity as its own  standards  Ecological Sustainability - We expect suppliers to supply products and services that exceed  environmental standards and to establish a program of ecological sustainability in their own operations  Workplace Responsibility - Wipro expects its suppliers to adhere to principles of human rights, employee  welfare, health and safety, minimum wages and fair working hours. We encourage sourcing from the local  economy and supplier diversity  The Procurement Organization  The responsibility of managing procurement related activities of Wipro rests with the Global Procurement  Group. The goal of the Procurement Group is to provide high quality products and services on a timely basis,  consistent with organizational objectives and policies and at the same time by adhering to the highest  ethical standards. The responsibility is divided among multiple buyer groups who handle different  procurement categories. The Procurement Group works along with Enterprise Risk Management, Internal  Audit and Legal teams to ensure compliance and to proactively address risks in the supply chain.  Supplier Engagement Program  At Wipro, we believe that a supply chain program should consider the socio-economic realities in the  geographies where we operate. The supply chain sustainability charter should go beyond legal compliance  and take into consideration emergent debates and issues. Fundamentally, our supply chain program is  driven more by responsible engagement and commitment as informed by our values, rather than a  compliance mindset. Policy and Guiding Principles Our Code of Business Conduct which provides the ethical guidelines and expectations for conducting  business on behalf of Wipro also directs Wipros relationship with its suppliers and is applicable to all  suppliers, agents, service providers, channel partners, dealers, distributors and vendors (Suppliers). In  addition to the COBC, the Supplier Code of Conduct (SCOC) of Wipro further strengthens and augments the  COBC with respect to environmental and social aspects of business practices, expected of our supply chain.  The SCOC covers key risks in the supply chain like forced or compulsory labor, prohibition on child labor,  equal employment opportunity and non-discrimination/ no harassment, minimum wages, environment,  health and safety, and compliance with anti-bribery laws. The code is aligned with the requirements of the  FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and the UK anti-bribery act. The document also gives an overview of  the process followed by Wipro so that it provides a ready reference template for its suppliers. The SCOC is  communicated to all suppliers and it is mandatory for suppliers to accept and sign it.  Wipro also has a procurement policy which acts as an internal decision-making guide related to  procurement. This policy details the procurement principles that the Global Procurement Group is expected  to adhere to as well as other aspects of procurement like supplier selection, supplier diversity etcetera. Our supply chain governance program is informed by four guiding principles  We are mindful of the fact that while one may have  ambitious policies, commitments and codes of conduct in place, it must take into account the complex  socio-economic realities in which it has to be operationalized. For example, in developing economies,  Understanding of the socio-economic context:  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 166  supplier staff may not be aware of the nuances of human and labor rights. In certain cases, the practice  may be due to livelihood issues – for example, excessive working hours in some cases may be the norm  to secure additional income.  Children in family owned or sole proprietorship could sometimes be  employed (or helping) in the business.   Enforcement of unilateral actions in such cases, does not  change the practice on the ground but only diverts attention from the problem at hand.  The secondary supply chain in many categories of  procurement extends across multiple branches/levels/tiers. Due to the factors mentioned in the first  principle, it would be nave of us to claim compliance across all the tiers. In many cases, our visibility is  limited to the first one or two tiers. For supply chain entities not critical or strategic to us – where  suppliers are not a core part of our business or where spend does not contribute to either a reasonable  proportion of the suppliers revenue or the available market supply. Our ability to influence supplier  practices is that much more limited. Industry bodies and large government procurement programs have  a larger role in influencing change.   Given the spread of supply chain across different geographies as well as  sectors, the compliance landscape can be quite complex. The impact of supply chain on different  stakeholders is dependent on the nature of business and operational context. As a result, the  compliance requirements of one supplier category can vary from another. However, it is often found  compliance is not reflective of the ground reality. At Wipro, we try to uphold all the regulations and  wherever there is a conflict, our best efforts are to minimize any dissonance  Managing supply chain externalities is of key  interest to business due to the deepening of complexities in the supply chain and the resultant risks.  Customers and investors are looking at compliance levels and ethics of organizations as a key  differentiator in their decision process.  Industry forums like Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition,  Sedex, Ecovadis etcetera are working towards indirectly driving continuous change in ethical and  responsible business practices in global supply chains. Industry ratings such as Dow Jones  Sustainability Index and CDP are increasingly giving importance to the supply chain performance of  organizations. There are many emerging standards and frameworks dedicated to this cause. We intend  to adopt and integrate best practices from all these sources to drive sustainability in our supply chain. Ability to monitor, influence and control:  Regulatory Compliance:  Integrating best practices in supply chain engagement:  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 167  Supplier Engagement Approach  Wipro has a multi-pronged approach towards supplier engagement which is represented below. ENGAGE   Engage with the  suppliers to improve their  capabilities in managing  their sustainability  performance INFORM   Communicate intent and  requirements to our  suppliers COLLABORATE Educate our suppliers on  environmental, social and  governance best practices  to be incorporated in their  business ASSESS  Audits and assessments  of suppliers UNDERSTAND  Understanding the context  and current compliance of  our suppliers and  developing policies and  processes A significant feature of our engagement is how we try and align our community or CSR (Corporate Social  Responsibility) programs with supplier engagement wherever it is possible. This can address some of the  fundamental issues at hand – for example our bridge program in education for children of migrant laborers  is an emerging area of engagement for our new infrastructure projects in in Bengaluru. Some specific requirements like eliminating conflict minerals in ICT equipment is difficult to monitor given  the complexities in the supply chain. In this context, our program is largely about seeking disclosures from  some of our key suppliers.  Programs and Processes Our supplier engagement program integrates a process of continuous evaluation, capacity building and risk  management. We expect these steps to encourage responsible behavior from our partners.  Environment  and social aspects are important factors in our supplier engagement and Wipro supplier code of conduct  (SCOC) must be mandatorily singed by all suppliers at the time of onboarding. We have identified material issues across main procurement categories – through desk-based study as well  as a few internal and external audits with a focus on human rights, labor practices and regulatory  compliance.  A dedicated vendor helpdesk handles supplier queries on payment issues, policy clarifications and provides  the initial contact for grievance redressal. Helpdesk received a total of 26931 tickets with respect to vendor  queries in the reporting year – with a two day SLA resolution percentage of 97.99%, which reflects the reach  and effectiveness of our initiative. The feedback from our vendors received through this initiative helped us  improve our processes and initiate new steps like automation of sharing payment advices, periodical  validation of vendor credentials in our database as well as self service payment status intranet link for  internal stakeholders to update partners/vendors. Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 168  Ombudsprocess: Supplier Diversity:  Local Procurement:   Our organization wide multi-lingual Ombuds process is available 24x7 (phone and  internet enabled) for our Suppliers and Contractors.  Wipros Ombudsprocess allows and encourages any  affected stakeholder including suppliers and contractors to report breaches of the COBCE and any other  matter of integrity to the concerned Ombudsman. While a good proportion of Ombudsprocess cases are  anonymous, based on self-disclosure, we know that there were 36 complaints reported by suppliers during  the year (previous FY 33). Wipro is an Equal Opportunity employer and strongly advocates the same through its  supply chain by encouraging supplier diversity. Qualified enterprises owned by person with disability or  women are identified and engaged with. The spend from these suppliers constitute 3% total supplier spend  ( as declared by supplier and not verified).  Wipro encourages sourcing from the local economy. Local sourcing reduces costs,  provides local employment benefits and reduced environmental footprint in sourcing. 45 % of suppliers  spend is from suppliers based in India.  Highlights of the year  Purchased more than 12,000 EPEAT registered electronic products in 2016  Received EPEAT Purchaser Award from Green Electronic Council (US) The Path Ahead  Our Supply Chain Engagement is a journey where sustainability increasingly becomes central. Our focus for  the next couple of years will be the following:  Supply Chain Audits/Assessments covering compliance and sustainability risk aspects: We have signed  up an independent social compliance audit program which covers all people related and people  intensive sourcing from the year 2017-18.  In the first year, we plan to cover all 215 suppliers based on  this sourcing grouping. On an ongoing quarterly basis, we will conduct social compliance audits for a  selected sample.  Supplier Diversity Program for Facilities Management category: To engage diverse suppliers for sourcing  specific sub-categories of products/services.  Green Procurement program for ICT Hardware and Electronic End of Life: To engage on key aspects with  10 strategic suppliers based on our Green Procurement Guidelines. For desktops, laptops and  display equipment our guidelines are in accordance with the EPEAT (Electronic Product  Environmental Assessment Tool) standard from Green Electronics Council.  Managed Print Services: This outcome-based model helps bring operational efficiency through  better controls, analytics, reduced resource consumption (paper, toner) and planned asset refresh.  E-Waste management: All empaneled vendors are independently verified as per Wipro e-waste  management guidelines. We continue to focus on requirements of regulatory compliance, asset  recovery and traceability of material. Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 169  At Wipro, we think it is critical for business to engage with the multiple social and ecological challenges  that face us. Such engagement must be deep, meaningful and formed on the bedrock of long term  commitment; for that is the only way by which real change can happen on the ground. This is also reflective  of the fact that such an approach serves both, enlightened business interest and social good. Understanding the Stakeholder In the social space, our stakeholders are multiple and can be differentiated on the basis of domains and  the overarching objectives of engagement. For example, in Education, some of the work that we do has  direct impact on students from disadvantaged communities while our other programs are targeted at  partners and teachers in the education ecosystem. Our primary stakeholders are as follows:   An important stakeholder for us is disadvantaged sections of communities, living in the  proximity to our operations. Our operations and facilities are situated in both urban and rural areas. Our  domains of engagement with the community are in the fields of Education, Primary Health Care,  Disability and Disaster Rehabilitation. Within these domains, we choose to focus on those areas that  have direct impact on the community. The geographies of community engagement span India, the U.S.A,  South Africa, Latin America, Australia and select countries of Europe and South – Asia. Communities - 3.6 Partnering for Social Change   Non-governmental organizations and civil society networks are  important implementation partners for our different community initiatives. We engage with them from  at different stages of the Planning-Implementation-Review cycle.  Employees play a significant role in our community initiatives by way of monetary  contribution and voluntary participation. Our social transformation initiatives are now nearly fifteen years old. We decided to focus on Education and  Communities when we started then. How did we choose these domains over others? Education is probably  the most important catalyst of social development as it can bring about change that is truly sustainable  and durable over the long term; our focus on our communities stems from the fundamental responsibility  and tenet of corporate citizenship that every business should engage deeply with its proximate  communities. Over the years, partnering with our stakeholders has given insights into their concerns and  requirements. This has also helped us to engage in critical social issues with sensitivity, rigor and  responsibility. Understanding Stakeholder Priorities NGO & Community Organizations -  Employees -  Policy and Strategy Our approach to social responsibility and sustainability rests on three important pillars.  The Strategic: We choose domains and issues to engage with that are force multipliers for social change  and sustainable development. Social responsibility is as much about being a sustainable organization  as it is about external initiatives. Therefore, some of our areas of engagement lie at the convergence of  business goals and social purpose.  The Systemic: Within the chosen domains, we choose to engage on systemic issues that require deep,  meaningful and challenging work. Given the nature of social change, this implies commitment over the  long term, typically for several decades because real, genuine change takes long to happen  The Deliberative: Our emphasis on depth and on long term commitment implies a deliberative approach  that precludes spreading ourselves thin or engaging in cheque book philanthropy. By implication, this  also means that we are wary of expanding and growing our social programs as ends in themselves. Urban communities Engagement  partners Rural communities Healthcare, livelihood,  primary education,  water and sanitation,  environment Mobility, waste,  pollution,education,  health Future  generations Environmental sustainability education Capacity building, institution development Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 171  Domains of Engagement Wipros social initiatives center on the following dimensions. COMMUNITY CARE Engaging with the community  on issues of primary concern  to them EDUCATION Engaging in deep and  meaningful systemic work in  the area of school and college  education ECOLOGY* Addressing serious  challenges in energy, water,  solid waste and biodiversity  Primary Healthcare  Education for  Underprivileged  Children with Disability  Environment  Disaster Rehabilitation  School Education in India -  WATIS  School Education Outside  of India - USSEF  Sustainability Education -  earthian  Engineering Education -  Mission 10X  Skill - centric Technology  Education WASE, WiSTA  Energy & Carbon  Water  Waste  Biodiversity *Refer to section on Urban Resilience and Advocacy and Public Policy for more information on our engagements in Ecology domain. Social Programs Expenditure The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Expenditure CSR spend as disclosed in Directors Report of  Annual Report 2016-17 is Rs. 1598 Mn. Of this, Rs. 1,863 Mn. is spent on programs related to the above  mentioned domains. Refer to 93 - 94 of our Annual Report FY 2016-17 for more information on CSR spend. Governance The review of our social programs is done at multiple levels. Every three to four years, the program strategy  is reviewed with the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), and revised as needed. Every year, an annual review  and goal setting exercise is done with the CSO and presented to the Chairman and Group Executive Council  (GEC). Every quarter, the progress is reviewed by the Chairman as well as to the Board Committee on CSR. Our work with organizations is usually in the nature of programmatic support. They typically span a period  of three years and may be extended further, if needed. We work closely with our partners and review the  progress and participate in important decisions along with them during the lifecycle of the project.  However, our fundamental philosophy is to leave it to our partners to design and run their programs as they  deem appropriate since they know best. Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 172  Community Care Wipro has a presence in more than 50 countries around the world; of our workforce of more than 160,000  employees, 11% of which comprise nationalities other than Indian. We think it is crucial to engage with  proximate communities wherever we have significant presence. This is a reaffirmation of our belief that at  its core, social responsibility and sustainability must transcend and should not be restricted to India for a  global company like ours. In the context of rural communities, seeing the larger integrated picture is  important when executing programs in individual domains. Issues of healthcare, education, access to  energy, water and sanitation and livelihoods are often closely inter-linked. If executed well, the outcomes in  individual domains can impact the larger canvas of community development. For example, the work that we  do for long term rehabilitation after natural disasters helps strengthen the resilience of the affected  communities in different ways e.g. strengthening of livelihoods, improved access to education.

In addition, the trust also works on long-term rehabilitation of affected communities after natural  disasters. The Wipro Cares funding model is based on voluntary employee contributions that are matched by Wipro.  This model is a great example of where employees play a key role in terms of both, volunteering and  monetary contribution. During 2016-17, nearly 40,000 Wipro employees engaged with Wipro Cares either  through volunteering or by way of monetary contributions or both. More than 9,000 employees from more  than 40 chapters collectively spent more than 26,500 hours in voluntary engagement on a wide range of  community and environmental initiatives.  Inputs and Program Outcomes  Wipro Cares partners with not-for-profit organizations for implementation of projects in our chosen  domains. Our engagement with organizations by way of inputs include:   financial support to focus on their key objectives  regular engagement through meetings, field visits and planning and review at important stages  In the narrative below, we outline some of the key outputs and outcomes for 2016-17 at a domain level. Primary Healthcare Access to primary health care is a key determinant of an individuals future trajectory in life, including the  ability to engage in productive livelihoods and responsible citizenship. Wipro Cares works with partners  who oversee the delivery of good quality primary health care services to underserved communities in  Nagaland and Maharashtra. In 2016-17, we started working in the slums of Mumbai to address the issues  of malnourishment among pregnant and lactating mothers as well as children between the age groups of  0-5 years. The North-East is relatively underserved in terms of development and therefore, it was realized  as imperative to start engaging in the region. Our work in Nagaland is in remote, inaccessible villages where  availability of primary health care services has been weak or non-existent till now. Similarly, we work in the  remote tribal district of Gadchiroli in Maharashtra. In both instances, the primary goals are to build the  capacity of the local community in managing their health needs, to augment government infrastructure  and to train health workers to address the unique needs of the communities.  Output Outcome  Established new partnership in Mumbai,  Maharashtra to address the issue of  malnutrition in low income neighborhoods  and continued support to existing partner  in Nagaland and Gadchiroli, Maharashtra.  Underprivileged families in slums of  Mumbai having increased access to  guidance, awareness and treatment to  address the challenges and issue of  malnutrition among pregnant and  lactating mothers and children between 0- 5 years of age.   Around 150 women and children in  Mumbai benefitting from the services to  prevent and cure malnutrition.  Around forty thousand people across 59  villages provided with access to affordable  primary health care services.  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 175  Education for underprivileged children Wipro Cares complements Wipros other initiatives in education by supporting in a more direct way, access  to educational opportunities for underprivileged children from marginalized communities. Our work  focuses not only on getting children enrolled in schools but also enabling retention and better learning  outcomes through remedial education. Through our partnerships, we also aim to provide counselling  services for children and parents, to support nutrition and healthcare needs of the children, to develop  vocational skills among adolescents and to facilitate holistic development of all children.  Output Outcome  Established five new partnerships and  continued support to existing partners,  thereby reaching out to eight states across  the country through twenty-one projects  targeting communities like migrant labour,  urban slum children,  orphan/institutionalized children  More than 68500 children belonging to  underprivileged communities in cities  across India now have access to formal or  non-formal education Children with disability Started in 2014, this important initiative focuses on early childhood care followed by education for children  with disability. This has scaled in size and scope significantly. Education for children with disability is never  about just schooling. It is linked to a whole host of other enabling factors like availability of nutrition,  community support, specially trained teachers, assistive devices, access to healthcare etc. Our approach  tries to integrate these dimensions to the extent possible. Our work in this space covers multiple categories  of disability and focuses on early intervention and inclusive education. Output Outcome  Established partnership in new  geographies through one new partnership  in the National Capital region and  continued support to existing partners,  thereby reaching out to six states through  twelve projects  Early mainstreaming promoted through  early intervention and inclusive education  Increased awareness of disability among  underprivileged communities  Enhanced ability of families to manage the  needs of children with disability  Educational and rehabilitative needs of  2500 underprivileged children with  disabilities from socio-economically  underprivileged backgrounds met.  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 176  Community Ecology Effective management of urban solid waste continues to be a pressing challenge for our cities. While the  use of right technology, good governance and the active participation of civil society are important  determinants of success, the work of the informal sector is often unrecognized. In this regard, Wipro Cares  continues to strengthen a project, initiated in 2014-15, which focuses on providing social, nutritional and  health security to workers in the informal sector in Bangalores solid waste management domain. In  addition, the program also provides a comprehensive skills upgradation program for such workers Output Outcome  Continuation of project and partnership  working towards welfare of waste pickers  Skill up-gradation of informal waste  pickers to engage in organic waste  management, organic terrace gardening  etc.   2700 waste pickers benefitted with access  to social and health security measures. Disaster rehabilitation In the event of natural disasters, disadvantaged communities get affected the most as the already fragile  basis of their livelihoods gets further weakened. Starting with the Gujarat earthquake in 2001, Wipro Cares  has responded to several natural calamities in which Wipros employees have risen to the occasion and  played a sterling role both in terms of volunteering efforts and funding. We deliberatively focus on the more  difficult challenge of long term rehabilitation of the affected communities in preference to immediate or  near-term relief. In 2016-17, we started working for economic rehabilitation of women fish-workers in  Cuddalore who were affected by the Tamil Nadu floods of December 2015.  Output Outcome  Established new partnership to work  towards economic rehabilitation of flood  affected women fish workers in Cuddalore,  Tamil Nadu and continued support of  partner organization in Uttarkashi.  Farmers cooperative set up in Uttarkashi  to facilitate market linkages in 22 villages.  Protecting livelihoods and sustenance of  income of 1000 women fish-workers  through Micro-enterprises and  participation in formal markets through  production and sale of value added  products.  Promotion of organic agriculture and allied  activities and strengthened local  livelihoods   Economic rehabilitation of communities in  22 villages affected by 2013 Uttarkashi  floods  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 177  Wipro Applying Thought in Schools (WATIS) Context The challenges in school education in India could be broadly classified as issues of access and quality, with  equity being a cross-cutting concern. There have been significant strides made in the matter of access.  While there are still pockets in many parts of the country where schools are not easily accessible, the  majority of the population today has access to public schools. However, inadequate staffing and other  resources in the schools remains an areas of concern. A large number of children continue to stay out of  school, dropping out after enrollment. Rote learning is still a predominant feature of our education system.  While on the one hand, classrooms and lessons disconnected from the childs life and context alienate the  child from learning with understanding, on the other hand, the focus on attaining higher grades pushes out  holistic development of the child as an educational aim. Affluent parents invest significant amount of  personal resources to provide education for their children. Inadequate resources and capacities in public  schools (and low fee paying private schools), where a large majority of the children study, add to a growing  inequity in the educational system. These and our other concerns in School Education are articulated in a  document titled Our Concerns on School Education available in our website. The multitude and  complexity of these issues manifests in the slow and gradual pace of progress in education as an effective  instrument of human development and social change. We think this is the natural order of how it should be  and trying to change it becomes invariably counter-productive. There have been many efforts at the Centre and in the States in the areas of policy, legislation and  curricular and examination reforms. Civil society organizations have been working consistently on the  ground to improve access and quality. All these efforts have led to many changes and improvement in  education. The National Curricular Framework 2005 recognizes holistic development of the child, learning  with understanding and connecting the learning to the lives and contexts of the children as some of the key  tenets of education. The Right to Education Act 2009 made elementary education a right of all children up  to the age of 14. However, effective implementation of these policies and reforms requires systemic  capacities across all levels in the education system.  Wipro Applying Thought in Schools was setup in 2001 to work towards addressing these issues in  education. These issues are complex and systemic and require deliberative, sustained, long-term efforts.  We believe that civil society organizations have an important role to play in bringing about such an  educational transformation. Our core focus, therefore, has been to develop capacity in civil society  organizations to work on issues of  education reform in a systemic manner. Till 2015, Wipro Applying Thought in Schools had cumulatively  supported 51 organizations which had  implemented 113 educational projects and initiatives. Drawing on the lessons from this period, we decided  to significantly increase the number of organizations that we support in the coming years.   As part of our strategy,  we initiated a Seeding Program for Educational CSOs  in 2016. The program  focuses  on new and young start-ups in school education through a structured program of fellowships for the  founders. We supported 26 Fellows from 14 organizations working across an interesting spectrum of  educational ideas in 2016-17 under this new initiative. Our hope is that such early stage support will  eventually help build a bulwark of strong educational organizations across the country which are deeply  committed to change in school education. In addition, we also supported five new organizations under the  regular grants program in the same period with the differentiating strategy being that these organizations  have deep experience in other community development domains and this is the first time they are entering  into the school education space as it is closely inter-linked with the other issues. Overview of Our Work Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 178  In FY 2017-18, we plan to cumulatively support about 25 new organizations through both, the grants and  seeding programs.   We work in partnership with civil society organizations in the following ways:  Providing financial support to organizations so that they  gain experience and practical understanding in  school education and they are able to build greater capacities to work across different contexts and  geographies in the country.   Supporting organizational learning and development by facilitating a reflective learning network of  educational organizations, and by nurturing early stage organizations with the support of established  ones. Our support to organizations typically spans a period of three years which may be extended further, based  on the need and potential. We involve closely in the work by staying in touch with our partners and the field,  through visits, review meetings and calls, and by participating in key decisions. At the end of the support  period, a comprehensive review is carried out along with the partner where the need and potential is  assessed and a decision is taken about further support. The issues and challenges in education are deep-rooted and complex, sustained work is required at all  levels of the education system to address these issues. We have chosen capacity building of civil society  organizations who do such sustained and systemic work as our lever of change. Such an approach does not  produce immediate visible results. The impact of our work in education is in many ways, indirect, non-linear  and manifests only in the longer-term and often in unforeseeable ways. This is important because it  represents strengthening of institutional capacity for reforms in education.  The outcome we aim for through our program is the growth in the capacity of our partner organizations.  Many of our partners have grown significantly in their impact in education at the state and national levels.  They enhanced their capabilities and effectiveness in areas and domains they have been working in and  developed new capabilities over the years.  Another important outcome has been our partner network itself. Our Annual Partners' Forum has emerged  as a unique annual gathering of educational community, where practitioners get together to engage in  reflective discussions and exchanges. New possibilities emerge, key educational issues are discussed and  learnings and experiences from different contexts cross-leveraged in these gatherings. IOOI (Input, Output, Outcome and Impact) is a framework often used for Impact Assessment in social  interventions. Since the intended long-term impact of our work is educational change at the systemic level  and our strategy operates in a non-linear fashion, impact in education is not something that can be easily  assessed. Instead, we focus on outcomes at the level of capability building and growth of our partners. The  outcomes as we report them are based on our interactions with our partner organizations, field visits,  review meetings and reports from partner organizations. They have not been verified through independent  assessments. In this section, we look at the following:   Inputs, Outputs & Outcome for this year at a program level - captures the overall financial outlay for the  program (Input) and the key Output and Outcomes.  Organization-wise Outputs and Outcomes using a couple of representative examples.  Approach  Program Outcomes and Impact Understanding Impact  Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 179  Input, Output & Outcome at Program level (2016-17) The financial outlay for our work in 2016-17 was INR 65.52 million. The below table lays out some of the key  outputs and outcomes this year at a program level. Teacher Training Workshops conducted by our partner organization Simple Education  Foundation in Jammu & Kashmir Output Outcome  Focused outreach strategy for accelerated  expansion of organization grants  developed.  Developed a framework on ecosystem  support for early-stage and shifting  organizations from other domains to  education as capacity building has  emerged as critical need  19 new organizations were supported  during 16-17 ;  of these 14 organizations  (26 fellows) were supported through  seeding fellowships and 5 through  organization support grants  EZ Vidya organized a sharing workshop  with partners on CCE/Authentic  Assessment to seek feedback on  their  work and to create an opportunity to share  and discuss others work in this area  Orientation workshops were held for both  cohorts of Seeding Fellows  16th Partners Forum on organizational  sharing was held in April 2016. The 3-day  forum was a well-attended affair with  close to 100 participants from various  organizations.  Organizational capacities are also getting  developed through stronger leadership  and improved systems and processes  Vikramshilas pilot project on social science  education in Tripura has received positive  responses from teachers as well as state  education functionaries  Cumulatively, 25 organizations continue to  receive support since inception of our new  strategy.   Continued support for 23 organizations  through programmatic grants, one-time  grants, fellowships and publications Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 180  Punarchith A collective that focuses on evolving alternative perspectives and activities related to education,  environment, democracy, and society. They seek pathways and perspectives that would lead to ideas and  learning for an equitable and just society. Their flagship program is the Integrated Learning course, which  consists of a six-month course for rural youth and focuses on enabling rural youth to gain knowledge and  skills in the arenas of sustainable agriculture, engaged citizenship and self-development. - The ILP  course has developed pedagogies that integrate knowledge systems and act as formats which facilitate  learning for life or enable life-skills.  The organization is based in Chamarajanagar district, Karnataka and  has been working there since 2011.  Output Outcome  Four batches of students/youth learners  have undergone the Integrated Learning  Program (ILP) across two sites- Nagavalli  and Hanur.  Resource materials based on an integrated  approach have been developed. This  includes components on  agriculture/ecology; social issues;  citizenship; general skills: computers,  accounts and Kannada.   New module on millets was introduced for  the last batch in addition to existing  modules keeping in mind the drought  situation and the needs that arise due to  it.  An alumni network has been initiated as a  way to sustain learners interests and as  provide a support structure to their work.    A handbook on teaching social issues is  also being completed and this will be in  Kannada   A pool of teachers or resource persons has  been built and they form an excellent  source for alternative teaching-learning  pedagogies.

Some of the outcomes achieved over the  years has been:  The ILP team has also provided teaching-learning support to  teachers in a few private schools in their vicinity. Over 20 and  administrators have received training and continuous support so  far.  We hope that the teaching-learning materials and new  pedagogies for engaging with youth that have been developed can  be shared with other institutes and education departments.  The impact of the course has been significant among some of the  learners. The parents and the learners note not only a change in  their lives in terms of their abilities to engage with rural work but  also in their abilities to be responsible and active persons in their  families and communities   The alumni network are currently in the process of forming a  production co-operative and they have already started engaging  in value-added production of their agricultural produce and some  of their products are being sold through the network to  individuals and to organic food/grocery outlets in Mysuru and  Bengaluru.  Though having arisen from the needs of the ILP, resources such as  a handbook of social issues written in Kannada, an English to  Kannada lexicon for key social science words etc. has been  initiated. We hope that these would be useful for a larger  community as well.

Wipro and its Stakeholders Wipro Sustainability Report 2016-17 183  Community Initiatives in South Africa – Wipro Siyapha Siyapha translates to We Give in the Nguni language in South Africa. In line with Wipros principle of good  citizenship, Wipro in South Africa has instituted a set of policies, practices and initiatives that contribute  towards some of the social goals of South Africa. These initiatives are in line with the Broad-Based Black  Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) Act of South Africa, which aims to distribute wealth across a broad a  spectrum of previously disadvantaged members of South African society. The Act is centered on five  elements - ownership, management control, skills development, enterprise and supplier development, and  socio-economic development. Companies are expected to have a social strategy that addresses all these  areas. The BBBEE Act aims to enhance the economic participation and representation of previously  disadvantaged South African communities in the economy. Wipro, South Africa strives to contribute  towards these goals through appropriate policies and business practices. For example we have a strong  focus on localization of the workforce in South Africa. We also have a procurement policy in place that  ensures maximum local procurement possible in line with the BBBEE Act and other related regulatory  requirements. Wipro Siyapha brings together multiple initiatives under the pillars of skill development, enterprise  development and socio-economic development. Skill Development through Internship programs Wipro is extending its global expertise in IT services to South African nationals through its WEESA (Wipro  Employability Enhancement for South Africa) program. Interns are selected following an intensive process  consisting of aptitude tests and personal interviews. Upon selection, interns undergo a six months training  exercise which includes a rigorous 3-month technical and soft skills training at Wipros Centre of  Excellence in Johannesburg and a 3-month on-the-job training at client sites. Interns who do well in the  program are offered employment in Wipro South Africa. Wipro Overseas Internship Program also offers a  few of these interns the opportunity for a further two -month training in India. We also offer a one month  graduate training program in Wipros Bangalore, India facility for the associates of one of our banking  clients in South Africa. Enterprise and Socio-Economic Development In line with Wipros long commitment to education as an area of social change, our Enterprise Development  (ED) and Socio-economic Development (SED) initiatives in South Africa also have a strong focus on  education. Under the ED & SED pillars, Wipro has supported the setting up of computer learning incubators  and libraries in schools and community centres in rural areas. We have also supported after-school centers  in urban disadvantaged areas. We are currently in the process of devising a long-term strategy to  contribute to improvement in education in South Africa which will be similar in many ways to our school  education programs in India. In addition to this, employee contribution through volunteering and donation drives are organized regularly  to encourage a culture of giving and participation by employees. Key Updates for 2016-17: We completed the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) pre- verification for 2016-17  financial period under new codes, anticipating a Level 3 rating. We are in conversations with potential  implementation partners for the teacher development initiative. 21 interns successfully completed their  theoretical and on-the job training programs. We partnered with the Industrial Development Corporation to  provide information technology infrastructure and improve computer literacy amongst educators, learners  and community members.
