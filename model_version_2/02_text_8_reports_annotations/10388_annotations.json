DNV Assurance Statement    COSCO Sustainability Report 2008      Page 1 of 2                                                                                                                       DNV Assurance Statements – 2009609012  Det Norske Veritas (DNV) has been commissioned by the  management of China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company  (COSCO) to carry out an assurance engagement on  COSCO’s Sustainability Report 2008 (‘the Report ’) in its  printed format.  This is the forth time COSCO has published its Annual  Sustainability Report and invited a third-party agency to  conduct an independent assurance.  Scope of Assurance  The Scope of DNV’s assurance is to assess whether the  disclosed critical information, data and management  support systems are in compliance with the relevant  reporting principles and criteria of reliability.  Limitation of Assurance  DNV’s assurance team visited the head office of COSCO in  Beijing, but did not visit any site office or external  stakeholders.  DNV selected three second-tier subsidiaries for on-site  assurance at their locations in China:  •  COSCO Container Lines Company Ltd. (Shanghai)  •  Qingdao Ocean Shipping Company Ltd. (Qingdao)  •  COSCO Logistics Co., Ltd. (Beijing)  Assurance Approach  The assurance engagement was conducted from November  2008 to July 2009 and performed in accordance with the  requirements of the “DNV Assurance Protocol for  Sustainability Reporting”. The Report has been evaluated  against the following criteria:  Adherence to the principles of stakeholder inclusiveness,  materiality,  responsiveness,  completeness,  reliability,  neutrality, comparability and accuracy as set out in the  \"AA1000 Assurance Standards 2008” and The Global  Reporting Initiative (‘GRI’) 2006 Sustainability Reporting  Guidelines Version 3.0.    The DNV assurance team has undertaken the following  work to reach conclusions regarding the Report:  •  Information search in public media to identify concerns  of COSCO stakeholders  •  Evaluation and ranking of the material CSR risks of  COSCO, based on the “DNV Assurance Protocol for  Sustainability Reporting”  •  Interviews with COSCO’s senior management team to  understand the top level commitment and strategic  approach to sustainability  •  Interviews  with  departmental  representatives  to  understand the management procedures and their status  of implementation  •  Examination and tracking of reported data and  information, including a site-visit, to verify the  methodology of data compilation and aggregation  •  Comparison of COSCO’s CSR reporting data over  several years to understand the progress and trends in  corporate social responsibility performance  Conclusions  In our opinion, the Report provides a fair representation of  the level to which COSCO’s sustainability policies have  been implemented throughout its business units. No  material or systematic errors were observed in the reporting.  Compared with last year’s report COSCO has included  more details in the explanations of their mission, vision and  values, and has included a systematic SWOT analysis of the  main impacts, risks, opportunities and solutions which have  formed the basis of the company’s strategy map.  In the process of the assurance engagement, DNV also  identified some opportunities for improvement which have  been included in the DNV Assurance Report.  Stakeholder Inclusiveness  The Report illustrates COSCO’s commitment to be  accountable to stakeholders and ensure that stakeholders  participate in the identification of relevant issues and  solutions.  The formal engagement mechanisms for interaction with  stakeholders and the selection criteria of responding  indicators could be further improved to coordinate and  balance the expectations of stakeholders.  Materiality  The  Report  discloses  the  company’s  sustainability  performance indicators and information regarding the main  stakeholders affected.  DNV recommends that further improvements focus on  developing policy and judgment criteria of material issues  based on industry best practices, and quantification of  material indicators.     DNV Assurance Statement    COSCO Sustainability Report 2008      Page 2 of 2                                                                                                                       DNV Assurance Statements – 2009609012  Responsiveness  The Report illustrates COSCO’s mission, strategy and  performance  indicators,  providing  objective  data  corresponding to the major concerns of the main  stakeholders.  To further improve the clarity of their communication to  stakeholders in the future, COSCO is recommended to  include information about their concrete commitments and  an action plan which reflects stakeholders’ concerns.   Completeness  The Report disclosed the key issues and performance  information of the 2008 reporting period which covered  COSCO head-office and all subsidiaries.  Regarding areas of improvement, it is recommended that  the Report increase the focus on social indicators (e.g.  related to labor relations such as statistics and analysis of  the rate of work-related injuries and loss of working time)  and environmental indicators (such as waste management  generated from ships).  Reliability  COSCO has established a dedicated Corporate Social  Responsibility management office and processes to collect,  compile and analyze data and information. These  procedures are found to be effective.  Accuracy  DNV has not found any material inaccuracies in the  reported data that may significantly affect the comparability  of selected key performance indicators. However, it is noted  that for the future the reporting boundaries and definition  for some performance indicators should be more clearly  defined.                        Neutrality  The DNV assurance team concluded that the information  contained in the report is unbiased and reflect a balanced  view  of  COSCO’s  corporate  social  responsibility  performance.  Comparability  The information in the Report is presented in a format that  allows users to see positive and negative trends in  performance on a year-to-year basis. The company could  further improve comparability by reinforcing horizontal  comparisons with the industry.  DNV is confident that COSCO will improve their corporate  social responsibility management systems and the quality of  the report on a continuous basis.  DNV’s Independence  The independence of DNV’s assurance engagement team is  ensured by internal control procedures and the following  principles:  •  The total independence of assurance staff during  working period.  •  Keeping confidentiality of all the sensitive information  of COSCO;  •  No conflicts of interests between Assurance staff and  COSCO.   DNV expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility for  any decision a person or entity would make based on this  Assurance Statement.
