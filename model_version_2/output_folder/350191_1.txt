Notes to the consolidated statement 
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Accounting policies include Danish Financial Statements Act 99.a and 99.b and UN Global Compact. EKF’s CSR re-
porting will be available on www.ekf.dk. 
 
NOTE 2: TRANSACTION OVERVIEW  
In 2016, EKF issued new export credit guarantees worth DKK 13.9 billion. EKF calculates environmental and social 
impacts based on our medium/long term transactions of which there were 30 issued in 2016.  
 
Of the guarantees issued in 2016, 17 potentially had adverse environmental and/or social impacts, hence were 
classified as A or B projects1. Of the 17 projects, two involve transactions on projects where EKF has already been 
involved in previous years, hence they are excluded from this year’s impact reporting . The remaining transactions 
total 11 and are considered to have very little or no environmental and/or social impacts, and are therefore not 
included in the calculations. EKF also conducted 21 company evaluations of environmental and social management 
systems and human rights.  
 
In 2016, 8 transactions also fall under the Equator Principles all of which involve project finance.2  
 
Separately, EKF approved 260 working capital guarantees and capital expenditure guarantees.  
 
 
 
 
                                                 
1 Under the OECD Common Approaches “A projects” include projects with potential significant adverse environmental and/or social impacts 
which are diverse, irreversible and/or unprecedented and “B projects” include projects with potential adverse environmental and/or social 
impacts. Typically, these impacts are few in number, site-specific, few if any are irreversible, and mitigation measures are more readily 
available.
