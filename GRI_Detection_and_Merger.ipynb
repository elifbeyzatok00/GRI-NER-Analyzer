This due to the growing inflation in the cost of raw material which could not be compensated with price increments. \\nOperation profit showed a decrement of 7.0% which can be explained \\nby the consolidation of five months of operation in the US business, unexpected integration expenses in the Central America acquisitions, as well as the inflation of expenses in Mexico, above the increment of gross profit.\\nAs a consequence of this, the 2016 EBITDA increased 0.7% to reach \\n6,861 million pesos. At the same time, the EBITDA margin decreased 130 base points, from 14.1% to 12.8%. \\nDuring 2016, consolidated gross profit  \\nincreased 243 million pesos to reach  \\na closing figure of 4,193 million pesos, or 6.2% \\nabove last year’s. 02 /  2016 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT\\n01LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS\\nYear 2016 was a year full of  \\nimportant challenges due to the  \\nexchange rate, however, Lala Group \\nhas been able to provide solid  \\nresults, to expand its geographic  \\npresence and to invest to prepare  \\nfor future growth. \\nDuring 2016, we developed internal abilities in regards to \\nplanning, purchases and logistics, which allowed us to be-come more efficient and create a decrement in our margins. We also invested heavily in the expansion of our internation-\\nal presence by acquiring “La Perfecta” in Nicaragua, and the distribu-tion agreement reached with Florida Bebidas in Costa Rica and with these activities, we have increased our presence in Central America. Similarly, with the acquisition of the brands and added value portfolio in the US, we have now entered the largest dairy products market in the world. \\nDuring this past 2016, acquisitions outside Mexico had an effect in the \\nconsolidated level of Grupo Lala. We are expecting an improvement in the results of these acquisitions during 2017. \\nINVESTMENTS\\nFrom January to December 2016, a total of 2,863 million pesos of capi-tal was invested, of these, 73.0% was mainly destined to the increment of property, factory and equipment.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/350101_2.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='03 / LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS / 2016 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT\\n01INNOVATION\\nStrengthening our portfolio of products through innovation is a \\nstrategic priority. In year 2016 we innovated via the launching of new products, functionalities and new presentations, and with these, we were able to boost the consumption of dairy products in Mexico and to meet the demands of more consumers. The launching of the line LALA 100® in its different presentations is amongst the most important launchings of 2016. This not only met our expectations but surpassed them and boosted the growth of the fresh milk category in Mexico.

Reporting Structure\\n1.1  Reporting Principles\\nCovestro provides comprehensive and transparent information on all issues that are material to the \\ncompany and our stakeholders. We measure our sustainability performance using both financial metrics \\nand non-financial indicators, all of which are published in the Covestro Annual Report. Through this \\nprocess, we aim to show how environmental and societal considerations are closely linked to our long-\\nterm business success. \\nThe Annual Report and supplementary sustainability information comprise our annual sustainability \\nreporting. The reporting period encompasses the period from January 1 to December 31, 2016. The \\nmost recent Annual Report and GRI Report were published in February 2015.\\nCovestro’s sustainability reporting follows international guidelines and recommendations, including \\nthose on the definition and selection of non-financial indicators and on reporting. Our sustainability \\nreporting is prepared in accordance with the “Core” option of the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines \\ndrawn up by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), following the GRI Implementation Manual. A GRI Index \\ncan be found at the end of this document. \\nIn selecting and measuring indicators, the recommendations of the European Federation of Financial \\nAnalysts Societies (EFFAS) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for non-financial \\nmetrics were both taken into account in accordance with the rules in German Accounting Standard \\nNo.\\xa020 (DRS 20). Our greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) are recorded in line with the requirements \\nof the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol).\\n1.2  Data Collection for Non-financial Metrics\\nCredible reporting is based on transparency and data validity. Covestro uses various recognized  \\ninformation systems and databases for this purpose.\\nOur Group-wide safety and environment performance metrics are compiled for the Group as a whole \\nusing our site information system. This system covers all fully consolidated companies in which Covestro \\nowns at least a 50% interest. Irrespective of Covestro's precise share, the performance metrics for these \\ncompanies are fully consolidated. Data on occupational injuries, transportation and environmental  \\nincidents are collected at all sites worldwide. Environmentally relevant indicators are measured at all \\nproduction sites. Our human resources metrics are ascertained through our global SAP HR information \\nsystem.

Covestro also participates in the chemical industry’s dialog with the German \\nFederal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. In addition, members of the German Bundestag  \\nvisited Covestro’s sites and plants several times. \\nIn its Code of Conduct for Responsible Lobbying, Covestro has created clear and binding rules for its \\ninvolvement in the political sphere. The Code is applicable across the Group and requires transparency \\nand openness in working with representatives of political institutions. It stipulates that Covestro shall \\nmake no direct donations as a corporation to political parties, politicians, or candidates for political office. \\nIn line with applicable law there, a political action committee (PAC) was set up in the United States that \\nis available only to Covestro employees, but remains completely independent of the Group. This PAC \\nmanages individual voluntary donations by employees to support political candidates, ballot initiatives \\nor legislative decisions in the United States. In addition to having an internal code, Covestro signed up on a voluntary basis to the European transparency register. The purpose of the register is to record and keep a check on lobbying activities at the EU level, requiring the disclosure of various company-specific information including, for example, the interests of related activities and the number of staff involved in \\nlobbying work at Covestro. Detailed regulations also apply to lobbying work in the United States.  \\nThese include, for instance, a duty to report all political interactions, on a quarterly basis, which  \\nCovestro meets in full.\\nSocietal stakeholders\\nThe public, neighbors and non-governmental organizations\\nOur sites around the world consider the effect of their business activity on the neighborhood and society \\nin general and take account of this in their operational and strategic decisions.

T o the extent that we can exert a significant \\ninfluence, key sustainability issues were incorporated into the Group’s strategy and are therefore the \\nfoundation of many of our activities. This relates to our products and processes as well as our conduct \\nwith respect to stakeholders. \\nEach year, we analyze the interests, expectations and requirements of our key stakeholders across the \\nGroup, which are then reflected in the major sustainability issues we define. This process is known as a \\nmateriality analysis and is used to document and evaluate how stakeholders inside and outside the \\ncompany assess the importance of sustainability issues for Covestro. The issues identified as material \\ngive us direction for our company’s business positioning, goals and strategy development. The starting \\npoint for the current materiality matrix is based on the findings from the 2015 materiality analysis. We \\nre-evaluated these taking into account current trends and developments. In addition, our new sustain-\\nability goals for 2025 were also incorporated. For each of these elements, a clear definition was developed. \\nIn addition to the sustainability issues themselves, we included “global challenges” that align with the \\nUN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Sustainability Management\\nVery high relevance for Covestro and very high relevance for stakeholders\\nInnovation\\nInnovation is an essential pillar of our present and future business success. It involves developing innovative \\nmaterials and products as well as improving production and handling processes. In this way, we seek to \\nmaintain and extend our position in the global market. Many of our product and process innovations \\naddress current global issues such as climate change, the scarcity of fossil fuels, urbanization and  \\nincreasing mobility. Our particular focus is on solutions that enable customers to reduce their individual \\nenvironmental footprint as well as offering additional improvements (e.g., closed loops). Innovations like these are developed in-house or in partnerships.\\nProduct stewardship\\nOur aim is to minimize the risks our products present to health, safety and the environment throughout \\ntheir life cycle – from research and development through production, marketing and customer application \\nto final disposal.\\nFor Covestro, product stewardship is of fundamental importance from both a strategic and an operational \\npoint of view. We follow a systematic approach, based on suitable IT reporting systems and globally \\napplicable internal regulations, in order to ensure we meet legal requirements as well as our commitment \\nto global product stewardship. Accidents are recorded in a global information system and evaluated \\nregularly. Where necessary, appropriate action is taken.See section 4  \\n\"Innovation\" and in our Annual Report, Combined Ma-nagement Report, section 4  \"Innovation\"  \\nSee section 9  “Product Steward -\\nship” and in our An-\\nnual Report, Com-\\nbined Management Report, section 9 \"Product Steward -\\nship\" As a result, we have updated the materiality analysis in four stages: \\n1  Strategic review of the global trends underlying the analysis and the resulting challenges for Coves -\\ntro and the industry in general\\n2   Interviews with external stakeholders such as industry players, customers, investors, scientific  \\ninstitutions and associations\\n3  Internal validation with Covestro’s own experts from various organizational units\\n4  Release of the updated matrix by the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)\\nThis process resulted in the identification of the most important global challenges and sustainability \\nissues for Covestro.

In 2016, Covestro took second place in workplace \\nattractiveness in a ranking by the Association of Employed Academics and Executives in the Chemical \\nIndustry (VAA - Chemistry Managers). \\nFor Covestro as a global company, safeguarding and promoting human rights form a material component \\nof our corporate responsibility. In particular, this entails promoting equal opportunity and the right to \\ncollective bargaining. This creates a foundation for a good relationship with staff, employee represen -\\ntatives and trade unions. We signed the UN Global Compact initiative in September 2015. \\nOur basic values and our understanding are expressed in our human resources policy. Special directives \\nand instructions govern human resources management globally, regionally and at our sites.\\nGlobal challenges: Climate change; Increasing mobility and transport\\nGlobal warming and the resultant change; Increasing in extreme weather phenomena pose an enormous \\nchallenge to the world. In order to comply with the internationally agreed target of limiting global warm-ing to less than two degrees Celsius, emissions of greenhouse gases must be lowered to a minimum in all areas. The transportation sector is responsible for 14% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. \\nThese challenges are being addressed at Covestro with innovative products and processes and  \\nresource- and energy-efficient production processes. For example, the use of lighter materials for  \\nvehicles and aircrafts can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and cut emissions. At the same time, Covestro itself can contribute to reducing emissions and resources used by optimizing processes.\\nVery high relevance for Covestro and high relevance for stakeholders\\nHealth and safety in operations\\nIn order to ensure the safety of our employees and all people involved in our activities (plant, process \\nand transportation safety), we continually update our safety management activities and improve our \\nsafety culture.\\nPreventing accidents and incidents in day-to-day work and promoting health in the workplace are key \\naspects of corporate responsibility and therefore Covestro’s highest priority – in the operation of our \\nproduction facilities and on work-related travel and transportation routes. Safety remains a top priority \\nin our Group-wide HSEQ measures and is anchored in directives and globally applicable core processes.\\nResource- and energy-efficient operations\\nCovestro’s production processes require considerable amounts of energy and petrochemical raw \\nmaterials as feedstock. We therefore continually strive to reduce costs, energy and resource usage, as \\nwell as emissions. The same is true for water use. We use the goals defined in our Integrated Management \\nSystem as well as procedure and process descriptions to systematically work towards achieving this \\nobjective.

Cooperating with scientific institutions builds our  \\ninnovative capabilities and helps us develop innovative products and technologies.\\nIn addition, we also make donations to contribute to the improvement of society, as well as participate \\nin partnerships to assist underserved communities. This is not just part of our corporate responsibility: it \\nalso helps to ensure that our company is acceptable to the public at large. Covestro is, and will continue \\nto be, committed to engaging in local communities, innovation and science, education and employee \\nvolunteering. \\nReduced emissions and waste in operations\\nCovestro aims to reduce environmentally harmful emissions such as greenhouse gases (Scope 1 and 2) \\nin accordance to GHG Protocol) and fine particulate matter as well as solid waste and substances that pollute the water. \\nAs part of Covestro’s integrated HSEQ management activities, we set ourselves the goal of halving our \\nspecific greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 compared to a 2005 baseline. We expect this to positively \\naffect the environment as well as reduce costs. Covestro reports the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions \\nin line with the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol). \\nGreenhouse gas emissions at Covestro are largely due to the generation and consumption of energy, \\nwhich we are continually monitoring and optimizing through our energy management system STRUCT ese™ \\n(Structured Efficiency System for Energy). Products and solutions from Covestro also help conserve \\nresources and cut emissions in a number of key industries and central areas of life.\\nFor Covestro as a chemical company, reducing waste, undertaking recycling and minimizin emissions \\ninto water are of both financial and environmental importance. The aim is to keep both,  \\nconsumption of materials and disposal volumes, as low as possible and to minimize wastewater volumes \\nand pollution. Rules for the handling of waste and wastewater at Covestro are set down and defined in the HSEQ policy.\\nGlobal challenges: Urbanization; Finite resources\\nAlthough research indicates that no fossil fuel bottlenecks are expected in the near future, long-term, \\nforward-thinking action on this issue is appropriate. Efforts to reduce energy and resource usage  \\nare focused mainly on cities, as buildings account for about 40% of all energy consumed globally. \\nEnergy-efficient construction solutions are essential to achieve improvements here. \\nAt Covestro, we address these challenges through resource- and energy-efficient production and in -\\nnovative products and applications that contribute to cutting resource usage, for instance, insulation \\nsuitable for improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings. \\nHigh relevance for Covestro and high relevance for stakeholders\\nBusiness ethics\\nIntegrity is the basis of every action taken by Covestro. Drawing on our sense of responsibility and \\nethical principles, we ensure that our conduct in respect of all stakeholders is appropriate in every way.\\n \\nOur Corporate Compliance Policy defines the principles and rules for our conduct within the company \\nand in relation to our external partners and the general public.

Sustainability Management\\nSustainable procurement\\nAssessing, reviewing and auditing suppliers with regard to sustainability criteria is vital for making  \\nprocurement decisions. We also aim to promote fair and environmentally conscious conduct along the \\nprocurement supply chain.\\nFor Covestro, adherence to sustainability standards along the entire supply chain is an elementary \\nfactor in value creation and, at the same time, a key lever in minimizing risk. At Covestro, we expect our \\nsuppliers to respect and implement the principles in our Supplier Code of Conduct. This code is based \\non Covestro’s sustainability principles and defines the expectations we have of our partners throughout \\nthe value chain. The code is integrated into electronic ordering systems and contracts throughout the Group as part of the process of selecting and evaluating suppliers. \\nFurthermore, Covestro is a founding member of the T ogether for Sustainability industry initiative.  \\nThe global auditing program that is part of this initiative is used to regularly evaluate the sustainability \\npractices of our suppliers.\\nGlobal challenges: Endangered marine life; Vulnerability of of the poor\\nPlastic waste is increasingly threatening marine life in the world’s oceans and on coastlines. Covestro \\nworks with international organizations to ensure that as little plastic waste as possible enters our waters. \\nT o this end, the company supports the industry-wide Zero Plastics to Landfill and Zero Plastics to the \\nOcean initiatives. The Zero Plastic to Landfill initiative aims to reduce the amount of plastic waste dumped \\nin European landfills to zero by 2025. We also embrace the Zero Pellet Loss initiative to prevent plastic \\npellets and other particles from entering the environment. \\nPoor populations especially suffer when events such as climate catastrophes and health crises occur. \\nWe aim to work with customers as well as governmental and non-governmental organizations to improve \\nthe living standards of ten million people in underserved markets. Our focus is on affordable housing, \\nsanitary facilities and food security. \\nThese key aspects are already reflected in our new sustainability goals and are part of our Integrated \\nManagement System. They will continue to be included when we revise and update our sustainability \\nagenda.\\n3.3  Standards and Certifications\\nFor the operational implementation of our commitment, we use our integrated management system \\nand defined corresponding global minimum standards in the form of rules and regulations. Adherence \\nto processes and workflows is regularly checked through internal audits and external certifications. This \\ncan result in changes to the management system. In 2016, we began reviewing and aligning our existing \\nHSEQ management system with the newly revised ISO\\xa09001:2015 and ISO\\xa014001:2015 standards. By \\nthe end of 2017, we strive to have our Integrated Management System certified to these ISO Standards.\\nBased on energy consumption, the coverage of our business activities with HSEQ management systems \\nis as follows.See section 2 \\n\"Strategy\" and sec -\\ntion 4 \"Innovation\" and in our Annual Report section \"Pushing Boundari-es\" as well as sec -\\ntion 2 and 4 in the Combined Ma-nagement Report\\nStandards and Certifications1 \\n2014 2015 2016  √\\nCertification to external standards\\nCertified according to various quality management  \\nstandards such as ISO\\xa09001 100 100 100\\nCertified to ISO\\xa014001/EMAS validation 93 95 95\\nCertified to OHSAS\\xa018001 17 54 90\\nCertified to ISO\\xa050001 35 39 40\\n1  in % of business activity based on energy consumption\\n√  Audited as described in the independent assurance report on p. 50 et seqq.See section 6  \\n“Procurement”  \\nand in our Annual Report, Combined Management  \\nReport, section 6 \"Procurement\"'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/350131_1.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='16\\nGRI Supplementary Report 20163.4  Value Creation3.

Innovation\\nIn 2016, Covestro aligned its corporate strategy even more closely with sustainable development and \\nset measurable targets. As a result, our innovation efforts are also guided by our understanding of  \\nsustainable development. By 2025 we intend to spend up to four-fifths of our project R&D expenses on \\ndevelopment to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \\nCovestro’s understanding of innovation is broad and incorporates product and technology development, \\nprocess engineering, as well as business processes optimization and new business model development. \\nAn example of customer-centered innovation is evident in the way we support customer order management \\nby taking into account external events, such as extreme weather conditions, into our delivery and logistics \\nprocess. In this way, we ensure optimally reliable deliveries and prevent supply bottlenecks for our  \\ncustomers. \\nWe optimize our own processes with what are known as functional innovations, such as STRUCT eseTM, \\nour energy management system developed in-house, which is used to manage our production facilities \\nas energy-efficiently as possible.Furthermore, we work on innovative business models. We have designed processes including one for \\nthe textile industry for manufacturing polyurethane-coated fabrics for clothing and shoes, which is \\nmarketed under the brand name INSQINTM. Thanks to solvent-free processing, INSQINTM greatly simpli-\\nfies the required occupational safety measures, lowers the risk of environmental pollution, and reduces \\nwater and energy usage considerably.\\n2016 saw the start of the commercial production of a new, pentamethylene diisocyanate (PDI)-based \\ncrosslinker. Its carbon content consists of up to 70% renewable raw materials. Various customers have received initial shipments that can now be used to conduct thorough application testing.\\nMany of our innovation activities focus on partnerships and collaborations with third parties. In 2016, \\nwe joined the Carbon2Chem project, which aims to use gases from the steelmaking process, including \\nCO2, as a feedstock for chemical products. A number of corporations and scientific institutions are \\nparticipating in this project sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. \\nCovestro is particularly interested in manufacturing plastics from steel mill gases. In parallel, we already \\nuse carbon dioxide from chemical industry waste gases to manufacture an important component of \\nflexible polyurethane foam. In 2016, the first production facility using this technology began operating in Dormagen (Germany).\\nIn 2016, we awarded the Covestro Science Award, a prize recognizing outstanding research in polymer \\nscience, for the first time. German scientist André Bardow won the award for his pioneering work in life \\ncycle analysis, particularly of CO\\n2-containing polymers. Bardow is Chair of T echnical Thermodynamics \\nat RWTH Aachen University. The prize was awarded as part of the Covestro Science Celebration – a \\ntheme day we organized at the world’s largest plastics trade fair K\\xa02016 in Düsseldorf, where we invited \\nleading scientists to visit our booth. \\nIn recognition of excellence within the company, we additionally awarded four employees the inaugural \\nCovestro Science Medal at K\\xa02016. They succeeded in making specific improvements to the surfaces \\nof components made of polycarbonate blends to improve their quality and functionality. Since surface \\nquality is extremely important in this segment, this research creates considerable value for Covestro.\\n \\nIn order to fully leverage the creativity and wealth of ideas in the company, we promote networking and'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/350131_1.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='In order to fully leverage the creativity and wealth of ideas in the company, we promote networking and \\nthe exchange of information among employees in as many areas as possible.

Employees\\nCompliance and social responsibility\\nIntegrated Compliance Management is the framework for systematically identifying and evaluating \\ncompliance risks and defining compliance processes. These include risks relating to fair and respectful \\nworking conditions. If there are signs of violation, employees can contact their Compliance Officer at \\nany time, anonymously if required. All suspected cases of compliance violations are recorded through-\\nout the Group in accordance with uniform criteria. This is true for all labor law-related issues such as \\nworking conditions, human rights, possible cases of discrimination and possible violations of the rights \\nto exercise the freedom of association and collective bargaining. Additional information is available in \\nthe “Compliance” section and in the GRI Content Index in this report. If material risks arise from legal \\ndisputes and proceedings, these are published in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \\nIn the year under review, around 55% of our employees worldwide were subject to collective or company \\nagreements.√  The contractually agreed working hours of our employees do not exceed 48 hours per \\nweek in any country. An exception is made for functional reasons for the employees of the fire brigade \\nat one German facility. At various country companies, the interests of the workforce are represented by \\nelected employee representatives who have a right to be consulted on certain personnel-related decisions.\\nOur sustainable human resources approach also includes ensuring a high level of social protection for \\nour employees. As well as competitive compensation, we offer our employees numerous additional \\nbenefits. For example, almost all our employees worldwide either have statutory health insurance or can \\nobtain health insurance through the company. In the year under review, Covestro expanded or improved \\nthe quality of the health benefits provided for employees in many countries. As of December\\xa031, 2016, access to a company pension plan was available for 78.2% of the workforce.√\\nAt all Covestro locations, severance payments meet legal requirements. Pre-retirement and retirement \\npayments are subject to local regulations. For instance, in Germany, employees are able to transfer \\nsalary and time components (converted into money) to a long-term account. The accumulated salary \\nbalance can be used at a later point in time for legally defined purposes such as pre-retirement leave. 5.2  Employee Metrics\\nSee section 13 \\n“Compliance” and section 14 “GRI  \\nIndex”'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/350131_1.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content=\"22\\nGRI Supplementary Report 2016\\n 6.  Procurement\\n6.  Procurement\\n6.1  Procurement of Key Products\\nIn 2016, Covestro’s procurement spend in Germany, the United States and China accounted for just \\nunder 79% of Covestro’s global spend. Most of this amount – around 78% – was accounted for by \\nsuppliers in the individual countries.√  In terms of our main sites, a total of 78% of total procurement \\nspend was allocated to local suppliers.√\\n6.2  Sustainability in the Supply Chain\\nCovestro regards adherence to sustainability standards within its supply chain as both a vital factor for \\nvalue creation and a crucial lever for minimizing risks. In order to develop and establish a sustainability \\nstandard for our supply base, we are working with the T ogether for Sustainability (TfS) initiative of the \\nchemical industry.\\nIn 2011, Covestro – formerly Bayer MaterialScience and part of the Bayer Group – was one of the six \\nfounding members of the TfS initiative. Since the launch of TfS, the now 19 TfS members have evaluated \\nthe sustainability practices of 6,383 suppliers using online assessments and conducted in addition  \\n724 on-site supplier audits.√  In 2016, a total of 1,773 supplier assessments and 241 audits have been \\ncompleted globally, including in China, India and Brazil.√For additional infor -\\nmation, see the \\nwebsite of TfS at http://tfs-initiative.com 6.1  Procurement of Key Products\\nThe online assessments are carried out via the established provider EcoVadis, which is accredited by \\nTfS. The objective of these assessments is to gauge the sustainability practices of supplier companies \\nin line with corporate social responsibility (CSR). The questionnaire for the assessment is filled out by \\nthe supplier. It is based on internationally accepted sustainability standards and includes 21 criteria \\nbroken down into the following topics: environmental protection, working conditions and human rights, \\nfair business practices and sustainable sourcing. It is adapted dynamically according to the industry \\nsector, company size and country risk. The information provided must be backed up by appropriate \\ndocumentation. The CSR experts at EcoVadis then analyze the answers according to international \\nstandards and compile them in a scorecard accessible online that shows in detail where improvements \\ncan be made. \\nExternal, independent auditors accredited by TfS conduct on-site audits at selected companies and, if \\nnecessary, re-audits based on TfS sustainability criteria to verify the statements made by suppliers. \\nThe TfS members can access the assessment and audit results via an online platform, which also offers \\ncontent for purposes of continually monitoring improvements.ecoVadis  \\nCorrective \\n action planecoVadis \\n assessment\\ntfS   \\nCorrective  \\naction plantfS a udit\\necoVadis Re- assessment  \\nor f ollow-up a udit\\nSustainability Rating Integrated  \\nin Covestro's Supplier evaluationRisk  \\nClassification\\nSupplier  \\nperformance  \\nDevelopment\\u200a/\\u200a \\nImprovement\\nSupplier \\n Selection\\naward DecisionSupplier Code of Conduct  \\n& Sustainability Clause\\nSupplier nomination &  \\nRisk analysistfS p rocess model\\nSupplier \\naware -\\nnessSupplier \\nnomi-\\nnationSupplier Sustainability  \\nperformance evaluationSupplier Development\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/350131_1.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='23\\nGRI Supplementary Report 2016\\n 6.  Procurement\\nIt is Covestro’s goal to have the supplier base conducting a re-evaluation at least every three years, \\ndepending on the results. In 2016, 308 assessments and 29 audits were therefore initiated by Covestro.√ \\nAn initial assessment was carried out at 175 new suppliers. In total, evaluation results no more than three \\nyears old are available for 614 Covestro suppliers.√ \\nCovestro discusses necessary improvement directly with suppliers and agrees the corresponding \\ntargets with them. Implementation of the required improvements is verified continuously. Based on these \\nresults, re-assessments were conducted at 127 suppliers during the year under review, approximately \\n60% of which notably improved their sustainability performance.√ \\nSupplier performance development is particularly important to Covestro and to the TfS initiative, which \\nregularly organizes Supplier Days and promotes continuing education. In addition, TfS provides a wide range of information and online training on its website.\\nThe TfS initiative aims to drive its global audit and assessment program internationally. Therefore, TfS \\ncooperates with various associations and organizations around the world. Another important step was taken in this regard in October 2016: A master agreement was signed with China Petroleum and Chem-ical Industry Federation (CPCIF) to jointly promote and improve sustainability in China. \\n6.3  Conflict Minerals \\nInternational regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States obligate companies to disclose \\nthe origin of certain raw materials to ensure that “conflict minerals\", such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and \\ngold from the Democratic Republic of Congo or its neighboring states, do not enter their products \\nthrough the supply chain. Covestro uses tin in production and therefore monitors all suppliers to make \\nsure they do not source raw materials containing tin from the affected areas through their supply chains \\nand deliver these to us.\\nIn order to clearly communicate our requirements regarding conflict minerals, we made these part of \\nour Supplier Code of Conduct. Covestro has obtained confirmations of conflict metal compliance from 100% of the identified suppliers potentially affected by this issue (153 material/supplier pairs).√  A list of \\npotentially affected suppliers and the validity of all existing supplier confirmations are permanently \\nmonitored. 6.3  Conflict Minerals'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/350131_1.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='24\\nGRI Supplementary Report 2016\\n 7.  Production\\n7.  Production\\n7.1  Production Sites\\nCovestro operates around 30 production facilities in Europe, Asia and the Americas. The eight largest \\nsites in Baytown, Shanghai, Dormagen, Krefeld-Uerdingen, Leverkusen, Brunsbüttel, Antwerp, and Map \\nT a Phut alone account for approximately 86% of our total production activities in terms of energy usage. \\nIn addition, the company’s worldwide operations include sales, technology, and innovation centers as \\nwell as additional smaller production sites in line with the philosophy of doing business in the closest \\npossible proximity to customers. These small-scale production facilities are designed mainly for regional \\npurposes.\\nA key component of the Covestro strategy is continuous optimization of our production worldwide. The \\ngoal is to operate plants that are more efficient than those of the competition.\\nThe following significant changes at the sites occurred in 2016: \\n•  Shanghai (China): Commissioning and start-up of new PCS and HDI production capacity, and therefore \\ncompletion of the Golden Tiger program to expand the site\\n• Brunsbüttel (Germany): Expansion of MDI production by 2018\\n•  Kimhae (South Korea): Shutdown of polycarbonate sheet production at the site due to a downturn  \\nin the regional buyer market and non-competitive cost structures\\n7.2  Investments\\nIn addition to ongoing investments in property, plant and equipment to optimize production and expand \\nproduction facilities, we continually invest in forward-looking strategic measures and projects that  \\nactively contribute to protecting our environmental resources. Particularly notable in 2016 was the \\ncommissioning of two pilot plants for saltwater recycling at the Krefeld-Uerdingen and Shanghai  \\nproduction sites in January 2016 and October 2016, respectively.

In the Shanghai project, we are on track over three years to \\nuse approximately one-third less salinated water than previously required for manufacturing poly -\\ncarbonates. \\n7.3  Quality Management\\nIn order to update and optimize our existing HSEQ management system in line with the revised \\nISO\\xa09001:2015 (Quality management systems) and ISO\\xa014001:2015 (Environmental management \\nsystems) standards, we have started to review the applicable Group directives and, where necessary, \\nrewriting them. We are incorporating the changes in the standards and reviewing the existing directives in view of the reorganization of the company to determine whether they are necessary for the future, as well as identifying potential for simplifying or streamlining these guidelines. \\nBy the end of 2017, our Integrated Management System is expected to be certified to the new  \\nISO standards.A selection of other \\nmeasures imple -\\nmented in 2016 is presented in sec -\\ntion 4 \"Innovation\" and section 11  \\n\"Environmental  \\nProtection\" and in our Annual Report, Combined Manage -\\nment Report, sec -\\ntion 4 \"Innovation\" 7.1  Production Sites'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/350131_1.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='25\\nGRI Supplementary Report 2016\\n 8.  Distribution and Logistics\\n8.  Distribution and Logistics\\n8.1  Distribution\\nIn order to ensure high customer satisfaction, error-free distribution is our foremost quality target. Customer \\nsatisfaction is systematically analyzed on a global scale. T o this end, we regularly evaluate customer \\ncomplaints that are entered and processed in a global management system. Moreover, we obtain  \\nevaluations from our customers. We take feedback from our customers and derive corrective and  \\npreventive measures in order to further increase quality and customer satisfaction and thereby lower \\nthe error rate and the incidence of complaints. In 2016, we made significant progress in this regard. \\nWorldwide, a total of 5,284 complaints were submitted by 2,145 customers.√  This is a rate of 7.42  \\ncomplaints per 1,000 deliveries, which is below the 2015 figure of 7.61 complaints per 1,000 deliveries.√ \\nDespite this gratifying decrease, our efforts continued unabated in 2016 with the focus still on damaged \\npackaging and missed delivery dates.\\n8.2  Transportation and Packaging\\nIn 2016, the logistics service providers we contracted worldwide completed more than 426,649 deliveries \\nto our customers.√  The volume delivered amounted to 5.37\\xa0million metric tons, with the share of goods \\nshipped exclusively by rail or waterway totaling 16.3%.√  Road transportation by truck remains our most \\nimportant form of transportation. In many places, the capacity situation in regional as well as global \\ntransportation markets was often strained. The logistics industry is generally being very cautious about \\nmaking investments in additional transportation equipment for all modes of transportation. In nearly all \\ncountries, the regional transportation markets continued to be adversely impacted by a major structural \\nlack of qualified drivers. Nonetheless, Covestro has been able to maintain the reliability of its transportation \\nnetworks at a very high level thanks to the careful selection of effective service providers.\\nA number of projects were undertaken to optimize packaging material procurement. This reduced the \\namount of raw materials used, thus contributing to our sustainability position. Avoiding the need for \\ncoating the interiors of steel drums saved considerable amounts of internal coating material, for instance. \\nIn another project, we are currently optimizing our PE bags for shipping polycarbonate granules. Chang -\\ning the composition of the bags will both improve their robustness and reduce the amount of raw  \\nmaterials used in their manufacture. Pallets are another area where we are using fewer raw materials. \\nUsing special pallets for securing loads as a substitute for standard chemical industry pallets, we have \\nbeen able to lower the timber requirements per pallet by approximately one-third. Based on our  \\ncalculations, this corresponds to a forested area around the size of five soccer fields per year.\\nIn terms of packaged goods logistics, we also saw improvements in sustainability. For instance, in  \\ncertain facilities, the loading weight of sacks and bulk bags on pallets has increased by around 25% to \\nimprove the utilization of cargo space capacity and to save on load carriers.  8.1  Distribution'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/350131_1.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='26\\nGRI Supplementary Report 2016\\n 9.  Product Stewardship\\n9.  Product Stewardship\\nCovestro has a systematic approach including reporting systems and global guidelines for compliance \\ncontrol, incident notification and reporting that includes product stewardship aspects. Any incidents \\nare tracked in a global information system and frequently evaluated. The systematic approach includes \\nroot cause analysis for corrective actions in order to continuously improve our product stewardship \\nperformance. \\nOur product portfolio does not contain any products that are banned by UN listing or through interna-\\ntional conventions. In 2016 no material case of incident of non-compliance with regulations and volun-tary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services has been recorded or is \\nknown to us, nor has any material case of incident of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary \\ncodes concerning product and service information and labeling occurred in 2016.√ \\nOur own system to create safety information covers mandatory information on content, safe use of the \\nproduct, as well as relevant disposal information. We apply systematic evaluations for new products and \\napplications and systematically utilize IT tools to support this process.Animal studies are essential to assess the safety of our products, especially to humans, but also to the \\nenvironment. For these studies, Covestro respects the 3Rs principle. The aim of the 3Rs principle is to\\nreduce the use of laboratory animals, replace them through other methods, and refine and improve the\\ntest procedures wherever possible. Covestro only contacts and selects research institutes and organi -\\nzations that meet our animal welfare principles. Compliance with our animal welfare requirements is \\nregularly monitored, and information provided in supplier self-evaluations is verified through on-site \\naudits. For example, this is valid with regard to the registration processes within the European Union, the \\nUnited States and China, which prescribe results from toxicological and ecotoxicological studies by law.See section 13 \\n“Compliance”'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/350131_1.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='27\\nGRI Supplementary Report 201610.1  Occupational Health and Safety10.  Safety\\n10.  Safety\\nThe safety of employees, suppliers, customers and plants is a top priority for Covestro. We continually \\nupdate our safety management activities based on global minimum requirements and standards, and \\nour leading corporate safety culture. We not only focus on the safety and health of our employees at \\nwork every day, but also on preventing potential environmental and health hazards which could result \\nfrom leaks in production facilities or accidents while transporting hazardous and other materials. \\nOur 2016 Annual Report contains extensive reporting on safety. However, some additional information \\nis included here to cover further aspects.\\n10.1  Occupational Health and Safety\\nProtecting the health and safety of our employees at work and during work-related activities is among \\nour top goals. This effort aligns with our social and ethical responsibility as an employer and our financial \\nresponsibility as a company. After all, workplace accidents and work-related illnesses can have a markedly \\nnegative effect on our business.\\nPotential risks are evaluated based on uniform Group-wide criteria to prevent workplace accidents and \\nwork-related illnesses as effectively as possible. Nonetheless, should an incident occur, we investigate \\nthe root cause. We have introduced a methodology for this purpose that addresses, in particular,  \\nbehavioral factors. Recommendations for further action are derived from the findings and implemented \\nto prevent these risks from arising again.\\nFor the eighth successive year, Covestro invited all employees to submit their suggestions for the \\ncompany’s annual CEO Safety Award to further promote safety in the company. This award recognizes \\noutstanding safety initiatives at the sites and underscores the importance of safety for our employees and processes. All ideas are first reviewed internally by the relevant Safety Councils, and then the best \\nsuggestions are evaluated by a panel of professionals with participants from outside the company,  \\nincluding peer companies. The winners were presented with their awards by the Chairman of the Covestro Board of Management (CEO) Patrick Thomas.\\nIn 2016, a total of 82 recordable occupational incidents occurred involving our employees and those of \\nthird-party companies (contractors).√  The reportable accidents recorded were those resulting in days \\nmissed, alternative work, or medical treatment (accidents requiring treatment beyond first-aid).\\nIncident rates are regularly analyzed by site and by region. Fluctuations provide an indication of structural \\ndifferences that must be taken into account when analyzing and deciding on measures. \\nIn 2016, we focused on safety walk-throughs in the plants and offices to maintain a high level of safety \\nawareness throughout the company. This effort was reinforced with a brochure and regular reporting \\non outstanding examples of safety in practice.Recordable Incident Rate (RIR)1 of Covestro employees by Region\\n2014 2015 2016  √\\nT otal 0.30 0.34 0.31\\nEMLA20.34 0.45 0.32\\nNAFTA30.40 0.43 0.48\\nAPAC40.21 0.13 0.18\\n1  The rate is calculated per 200,000 hours worked. \\n2  Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America.\\n3  United States, Canada and Mexico.\\n4  Asia/Pacific \\n√  Audited as described in the independent assurance report on p. 50 et seqq.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/350131_1.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='28\\nGRI Supplementary Report 201610.

All tasks performed at a plant across its entire life cycle must be carried \\nout with technical competence and great care.\\nWe establish the foundation for the safe operation of a system as early as its construction, in part through \\nthe choice of materials and the design of equipment and machines. In addition, we use systematic risk \\nanalyses to identify possible disruptions to operations and define suitable safety measures that effectively \\nprevent these disruptions or limit their possible effects.\\nWe carry out both temporary and permanent technical alterations to and optimizations of our systems \\nto meet the demands of technical progress and improve sustainability and efficiency. Using the  \\nmanagement of change procedure, planned alterations are examined for their relevance to safety. If \\nnecessary, the system’s safety concept is adapted. A multi-stage approval and review process ensures \\nthat alterations take place in a controlled fashion, that all safety aspects are considered and that any \\nnecessary safety measures are defined. \\nMaintenance and inspection tasks and technical alterations frequently require work that has the potential \\nto be dangerous. Such work is carried out in steps, individually or bundled, within the scope of planned \\nsystem downtimes, and managed with the help of a work permit in which all the steps in the process are \\napproved via signature. Careful planning and a careful hazard assessment are the foundation of the \\nsafety measures and work steps documented in the work permit, which must be approved by the plant’s \\nmanagement. This includes detailed descriptions of the work to be carried out. All those who perform \\nthis work must receive instruction as regards the work itself and the defined safety measures. Approval \\nto carry out work will not be given until all the conditions have been met: the current condition of the \\nsystems must permit the work to be performed and all the safety measures defined for the work must \\nbe in place. In addition, depending on the type of work to be done, safety officers may be used to  \\nsupervise the work. Moreover, in the event of certain potentially dangerous tasks, emergency response \\npersonnel may be informed preventively and included on-site in the safety measures.\\n10.3  Environmental and Transportation Safety\\nFor a company that sees more than 3,000 deliveries worldwide per day carried out by nearly 200 trans -\\nportation service providers, selecting the right suppliers is a key factor in ensuring safety and customer satisfaction. \\nIn every region, we choose our transportation and logistics providers based on an assessment system \\ndeveloped at industry level that reviews the effectiveness of supplier management systems in terms of \\nhealth, safety, the environment and quality (HSEQ).\\nIn Europe, we extended the assessment based on CEFIC SQAS (the safety and quality assessment \\nsystem of the European Chemical Industry Council) to include service providers specializing in trans -\\nporting packaged goods. In the past, this tool was only used to select service providers for large loads, \\nwhereas other suppliers were assessed and chosen based on more general criteria, such as certification \\naccording to ISO\\xa09001. \\nIn North America and Mexico, we increased the frequency with which we conduct motor carrier assessments \\naccording to the American Chemistry Council protocol and review the effectiveness of improvement \\nmeasures. Audit frequency is derived from a risk assessment and ensures effective monitoring of our \\nsuppliers. \\nWe also use assessment and monitoring systems established at industry level and aimed at ensuring \\ntransportation safety in Latin America and Asia.

Direct emissions from our own plants (Scope\\xa01) are determined at all production locations \\nand relevant administrative sites. Emissions are calculated based on the specific activity rates, e.g., fuels \\nused, and the relevant material parameters. The calculation includes nitrogen oxide (N2O), methane and \\npartially fluorinated hydrocarbons in addition to CO2. \\nIndirect emissions (Scope\\xa02) are calculated in accordance with the methods outlined in the GHG Protocol \\n(as amended 2014) by multiplying the quantities of energy sourced by the corresponding production \\nsite-specific emissions factors. This makes the data calculated highly representative of each site. If no \\nspecific factors are available, the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) country-specific emissions factor is used. The Scope\\xa02 emissions are compiled in parallel. This is done using location-based method and the market-based method outlined in the updated standards (dual reporting). We base our calculations \\nof specific emissions on the requirements of the GHG Protocol up to 2014 for the purpose of better \\ncomparability with the historical data.\\nIn 2016, the total volume of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remained at almost the same level as the \\nyear before (minus 0.2% ). √ While direct GHG emissions rose by 10.0% indirect GHG emissions fell by \\n6.1%.√  One of the reasons for the shift from indirect to greater direct emissions was that, during the \\nreporting year, we began to produce steam internally that was originally externally sourced. At the most \\nimportant production sites, which account for more than 95% of our energy consumption, the produc -\\ntion volume rose by 5.5% in 2016.

Covestro wants to improve the lives of ten million people in underserved markets \\nby 2025, not only with products and engineering that benefit society and reduce the impact on the \\nenvironment, but also by brokering access to education, technology and a better life – according to the \\ncompany’s purpose “T o make the world a brighter place.” Our values of being curious, courageous and \\ncolorful are a commitment to making a difference. These values are reflected in the UN Sustainability \\nDevelopment Goals to transform the world by 2030 and stimulate action in areas of critical importance \\nfor humanity and the planet. At Covestro, we aim to use our position as one of the world’s largest polymer \\ncompanies to partner with organizations in many regions to foster environmental, societal and economic \\nimprovement. A central function supports the planning and implementation of the partnerships and \\ndonations across the Covestro Group designed to advance the UN Sustainability Goals. \\nIn its first year as an independent company, Covestro invested more than €1,000,000 in charitable  \\nactivities within the areas shown in the following table.√ \\nAsia \\u200a/\\u200aPacific\\nSince 2011, Covestro, formerly Bayer MaterialScience, has been collaborating with T ongji University in \\nShanghai (China) within the context of the Covestro-T ongji Eco-Construction & Material Academy to \\nfoster innovation in energy-efficient construction through teaching, research and development of programs \\nfor upcoming talent. Effective October 2016, Covestro took over custody of this program from the \\nBayer Foundation, contributing more than €150,000 to scholarships and professorships for the School \\nof Material Science & Engineering and School of Architecture and Urban Planning for the purpose of \\nincreasing scientific knowledge about eco-building design. \\nSupporting the Swachh Bharat (Clean India) mission, which is in progress with a target of 154\\xa0million \\ntoilets to be built by 2019, Covestro has collaborated with Habitat for Humanity and Vaspar Eco Solutions \\nto create efficient and low-cost toilet solutions. The production is done in KediBanautha, a small village \\nof about 2,000 inhabitants in the Gautam Budh Nagar district of India near our Greater Noida site. \\nEurope, Middle East, Africa and Latin America \\nSince 2008, Covestro and RWTH Aachen University (Germany) have been jointly operating the CAT \\nCatalytic Center in Aachen. One important goal has been to use the climate-affecting gas CO2 as a new \\nraw material for polyurethane foam. In 2016, Covestro inaugurated a plant at its site in Dormagen  \\n(Germany) to start production of the new material on an industrial scale.

Corporate Citizenship\\nIn the UK, Covestro was the headline sponsor for the 2016 annual Design Innovation in Plastics  \\ncompetition – the longest established student plastics competition of its kind in Europe. It produced \\nhigh-quality entries which ranged from an innovative horse strap which prevents injury, a dog feeder to \\nprevent lungworm and a ball to improve dog mouth hygiene. This competition has boosted many students \\nin their careers as well as raising the awareness among universities of fostering innovative thinking. \\nCovestro continues to work with the Moscow-based fashion studio “Begraniz Couture” specialized in \\ndesigning outfits for disabled people. In 2016 we organized a five-day “fashion workshop” at our premises \\nin Leverkusen (Germany), inviting fashion-design students and product designers to learn about Uni -\\nversal Design. As a result, the participants designed two outfits for disabled people considering the \\nspecial needs and material properties. \\nCovestro continues providing its support for sports and cultural events at the Dormagen, Krefeld-Uerdingen \\nand Leverkusen sites in Germany. Similarly, in 2016, Covestro became a sponsor of the German Ice \\nHockey League (Deutsche Eishockey Liga or DEL), since its high-tech materials are well suited for that \\nsport to protect athletes from injury. \\nIn cooperation with the university hospital in Düsseldorf (Germany), Covestro organized three events at \\nits property, where employees could get themselves typecasted for bone marrow donation. \\nUnited States, Canada and Mexico \\nOur U.S. sites supported employee volunteering and fundraising initiatives. Among others, employees \\nacross the United States raised €500,000 for the Workplace Campaign of the charity “United Way” \\nthrough a combination of creative fundraisers and payroll deductions. \\nCovestro employees have also been volunteering for Habitat for Humanity in the Kanawha and and \\nPutnam Counties. This included renovation work, partial demolition and the construction of homes for \\nthe needy. \\nFurthermore, Covestro sponsored the MRI Humanitarian Materials Initiative award hosted by Penn State \\nUniversity, to support ongoing research that is aimed at providing long-term and sustainable solutions \\nto problems in under-resourced regions of the world.

Compliance\\n13.  Compliance\\nIntegrity is the basis of all of Covestro’s entrepreneurial activities. Drawing on our sense of responsibility \\nand ethical principles, we ensure that our conduct in respect of all stakeholders is appropriate in every \\nway. As a result, Covestro will forgo any business that would only be possible by violating laws or internal \\ncompany rules. \\nThe way each employee conducts the company’s business can affect Covestro’s public image. There -\\nfore, Covestro does not tolerate any violation of applicable laws or internal regulations.\\nOur Corporate Compliance Policy details our commitment to fair competition, integrity in business \\ndealings, the principles of sustainability and product stewardship, the upholding of foreign trade laws \\nand insider trading laws, the separation of business and private interests, proper record-keeping and \\ntransparent financial reporting, and fair, respectful and nondiscriminatory working conditions. \\nOur managerial employees have a vital part to play in implementing the Corporate Compliance Policy. \\nAs role models, they must help to ensure that this important code of conduct is adhered to in practice. \\nManagers may lose their entitlement to variable compensation components and be subject to disciplinary \\nmeasures if systematic violations of applicable law entailing loss or possible damage to Covestro occur \\nin their sphere of responsibility and could have been prevented if they had taken appropriate action. \\nCompliant and lawful conduct forms part of the performance evaluations of all managerial employees.\\n Every employee is required as a matter of principle to immediately report any infringement of the Cor -\\nporate Compliance Policy unless this is not permitted by national law. Employees can personally report \\npotential compliance violations to the Compliance Officer, or use a hotline and email address accessible \\nworldwide that also permit anonymous reports. A Group directive stipulates the guidelines for handling compliance incidents at Covestro, the associated responsibilities and processes, and the consequences derived from investigation results. \\nAll potential compliance incidents are recorded in a central database. Confirmed cases are evaluated \\nand organizational, disciplinary or legal actions are taken, if necessary. In addition to the potential financial \\nloss for the company, nonfinancial criteria such as damage to Covestro’s reputation and the hierarchy \\nlevel of the employees involved are also included in the evaluation. The Supervisory Board’s Audit  \\nCommittee receives a report each quarter on the total number of compliance incidents and a summary of the most serious cases.\\nCompliance risks are systematically identified and evaluated during our risk management process. If \\nnecessary, measures to minimize risk are defined. This focuses on the areas of antitrust law, anticorruption \\nmeasures, export controls, conflicts of interest, insider trading and antidiscrimination policies. A local \\nrisk assessment covering antitrust law and anticorruption measures has been conducted for each \\ncountry in which a Covestro Group company is domiciled. With regard to anticorruption, gifts and invi-\\ntations, tenders, donations and collaboration with certain business partners such as customs agents \\nhave been identified as high-risk areas. Through extensive communication and training, Covestro helps \\nemployees develop a lasting awareness of appropriate conduct and integrity as well as the potential \\nconsequences of non-compliance. \\nRisks arising from pending or ongoing legal disputes and proceedings are reported quarterly by all \\nCovestro companies. Relevant cases are reported to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, \\nand the major risks are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the “Legal \\nRisks” section.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/350131_1.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='39\\nGRI Supplementary Report 2016\\n 14.

Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, \\nimplementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the GRI Report, \\nwhich is free of material misstatements due to intentional or unintentional errors.\\nAudit Firm’s Independence and Quality Control \\nWe have complied with the German professional provisions regarding independence as well as other \\nethical requirements.\\nThe audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional standards – in particular the \\nProfessional Code for German Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für \\nWirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer“: “BS WP/vBP”) as well as the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer \\n(“Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW”): Requirements to quality control for audit firms (“Entwurf \\neines IdW Qualitätssicherungsstandards 1 „Anforderungen an die Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschafts -\\nprüferpraxis” (IdW EQS 1)”) – and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control  \\nincluding documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements,  \\nprofessional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\\nPractitioner’s Responsibility \\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the sustainability information marked with „√“ in the GRI \\nReport based on our work performed. \\nWithin the scope of our engagement we did not perform an audit on external sources of information or \\nexpert opinions, referred to in the GRI Report. \\nWe conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements \\n(ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial \\nInformation” published by IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance  \\nengagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us \\nto believe that the sustainability information marked with „√“ in the GRI Report has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI-Criteria.\\nIn a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a \\nreasonable assurance engagement and therefore significantly less assurance is obtained than in a \\nreasonable assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgement. \\nThis includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatements of the sustainability information \\nmarked with „√“ in the GRI Report with regard to the GRI-Criteria.
