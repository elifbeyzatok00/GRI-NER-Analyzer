GRI Supplementary Report 20162.  Strategy
2.1  Company Guidelines
Sustainability management at Covestro contributes to the development of customer-focused products 
as well as to the protection of the environment through resource-efficient and low-emissions production, 
and creates economic value. Specific requirements on important sustainability issues are defined in our 
internal regulations and guidelines in order to advance the sustainability aspects of our strategy.
•  Creating value: Ongoing value creation is the primary objective of Covestro. We develop solutions 
that create value for customers, society and the environment, as well as for employees and investors.
•  Sustainability: Our aim is to align economic targets with environmental and social goals. Ensuring that 
our business activities embrace sustainability reflects our purpose “T o make the world a brighter place.”
•  Innovation: Innovation is necessary for mastering the global challenges of our time and for creating 
value in the long term. As a result, we develop new products, applications and technologies that focus 
on sustainable development.
•  People: Covestro’s success is based on the strong commitment of our employees. We want to  
motivate and offer them an attractive workplace. 
•  HSEQ (Health, Safety, Environment and Quality): Occupational health, safety, environmental protec -
tion, energy efficiency and quality management are key factors in achieving our aims. Continuous 
improvement is the primary goal of our Integrated Management System.
•  Compliance: Covestro’s corporate conduct is characterized by a sense of responsibility as well as 
ethical principles. Strict compliance with all legal requirements and voluntary pledges by Covestro is therefore considered to be of the utmost importance.
Specific committees have been appointed at Covestro to define and manage important sustainability issues. These include the development and implementation of targets and action programs. 
2.2  Sustainability Goals
Covestro fully supports the United Nations’ sustainability goals (SDGs). We have analyzed the influence 
that our activities, products, initiatives and our engagement can have on these goals. The SDGs and the 
findings of the analysis are incorporated into our sustainability agenda. 
In 2016, Covestro set five ambitious goals to be reached by 2025, which are aligned with the SDGs. We 
will report regularly on the progress made.
In addition, occupational health and safety, energy efficiency and environmental protection goals have 
been defined as part of our Integrated Management System.2.  Strategy2.1  Company Guidelines

3.  Sustainability Management
3.1  Stakeholder Dialog 
We are committed to active, open and honest dialog with our stakeholders – whether in the immediate 
vicinity of our sites or at national or global level. Our main stakeholder groups include Covestro’s partners 
as well as financial market participants, regulators and social interest groups. Addressing their interests 
is very important in respect of our strategy development, our decision-making and our risk management 
activities. For further informa-
tion, see our Annual Report, Combined Management Re -
port, section 21 "Opportunities and Risks Report" 
We adopt an open communication approach. Depending on specific issues and relevance, our various 
departments identify and prioritize key stakeholders and appropriate formats to address them. 
Partners 
Collaboration with customers, employees and suppliers is a prerequisite for the long-term success of 
our company. We also value the cooperation with – and the active participation in – industry-relevant 
associations and scientific institutions. We are in frequent contact with all of these groups, both at senior 
management level and through various departments. 
In addition, Covestro participates in a number of international industry trade shows. In the year under 
review, these included major events such as K 2016, Chinaplast, the American Institute of Architects 
(AIA) National Convention, Roof India, Light+Building, and JEC World Composites.  Stakeholder Dialog

GRI Supplementary Report 20163.1  Stakeholder Dialog 3.  Sustainability Management
Regulators
We maintain a regular dialog with authorities, ministries, politicians and key stakeholders of regulatory 
affairs at the local, regional, national and international level. This dialog takes the form of contributions to 
public consultations, involvement in specialist workshops, association activities and specific discussions 
with policymakers. The focus of Covestro’s representation of its public policy interests in 2016 was on 
the areas of chemicals and energy policy, low-carbon economy, circular economy, transportation and 
environmental and climate protection. Dr. Klaus Schäfer, the Board of Management member responsible 
for Production and T echnology, participated in a symposium on EU energy policy held in Brussels  
(Belgium) by the Economic Council of the CDU, the co-governing party in Germany. Attended by  
40 selected European participants from the fields of politics, business and science, key issues concern -
ing Europe’s energy future were considered from various angles and corresponding plans developed in 
subsequent workshops. Covestro also participates in the chemical industry’s dialog with the German 
Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. In addition, members of the German Bundestag  
visited Covestro’s sites and plants several times. 
In its Code of Conduct for Responsible Lobbying, Covestro has created clear and binding rules for its 
involvement in the political sphere. The Code is applicable across the Group and requires transparency 
and openness in working with representatives of political institutions. It stipulates that Covestro shall 
make no direct donations as a corporation to political parties, politicians, or candidates for political office. 
In line with applicable law there, a political action committee (PAC) was set up in the United States that 
is available only to Covestro employees, but remains completely independent of the Group. This PAC 
manages individual voluntary donations by employees to support political candidates, ballot initiatives 
or legislative decisions in the United States. In addition to having an internal code, Covestro signed up on a voluntary basis to the European transparency register. The purpose of the register is to record and keep a check on lobbying activities at the EU level, requiring the disclosure of various company-specific information including, for example, the interests of related activities and the number of staff involved in 
lobbying work at Covestro. Detailed regulations also apply to lobbying work in the United States.  
These include, for instance, a duty to report all political interactions, on a quarterly basis, which  
Covestro meets in full.
Societal stakeholders
The public, neighbors and non-governmental organizations
Our sites around the world consider the effect of their business activity on the neighborhood and society 
in general and take account of this in their operational and strategic decisions. This includes an active, open and honest dialog allowing Covestro to be recognized as a reliable and trustworthy partner that is committed to its social responsibility. Dialog with neighbors, the public and non-governmental organi-zations (NGOs) is initiated on a case-by-case basis. When capital investment projects are undertaken, the neighborhood is proactively informed and involved. In the United States, dialog takes place through 
Community Advisory Panels (CAPs). These panels organize regular meetings with local government and/
or neighborhood representatives, in order to provide information on current issues. In Germany, dialog 
with neighbors is conducted through the Chempark neighborhood offices. Especially when new facilities 
begin operation, we reach out for direct dialog with stakeholder groups in the community. Numerous 
guests from the community and the business, science and political arenas attended the opening of our

Media
An important component of our stakeholder dialog is contact with the media. The channels for our 
media work include press releases, press conferences, background discussions, individual interviews 
and journalist visits as well as social media channels such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and Y ouT ube. 
We also continually inform the media and all other stakeholders about current developments on our 
website. In addition to press releases, we publish financial information, such as annual and quarterly 
reports, as well as presentations and speeches from conferences and meetings. 
3.2  Material Sustainability Issues
As a corporation, Covestro is part of society and has a responsibility with regard to current challenges 
such as climate change, resource scarcity, health and poverty. T o the extent that we can exert a significant 
influence, key sustainability issues were incorporated into the Group’s strategy and are therefore the 
foundation of many of our activities. This relates to our products and processes as well as our conduct 
with respect to stakeholders. 
Each year, we analyze the interests, expectations and requirements of our key stakeholders across the 
Group, which are then reflected in the major sustainability issues we define. This process is known as a 
materiality analysis and is used to document and evaluate how stakeholders inside and outside the 
company assess the importance of sustainability issues for Covestro. The issues identified as material 
give us direction for our company’s business positioning, goals and strategy development. The starting 
point for the current materiality matrix is based on the findings from the 2015 materiality analysis. We 
re-evaluated these taking into account current trends and developments. In addition, our new sustain-
ability goals for 2025 were also incorporated. For each of these elements, a clear definition was developed. 
In addition to the sustainability issues themselves, we included “global challenges” that align with the 
UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs). These are influenced by Covestro directly through our 
business activities or indirectly through our other commitments.

3.4  Value Creation
Covestro aims to create sustainable value for all stakeholder groups in the value chain.
Our value added calculation presents the value added we have generated as the company’s contribution 
to the gross national product of the individual country, and shows its distribution during the fiscal year. 
We define value added as the company’s business performance minus its outlays, such as material 
expenses, other expenses or depreciation, amortization and impairment losses. In 2016, the Covestro 
Group’s business performance amounted to €12.0 billion. Value added came to €3.1 billion. The state -
ment of allocation shows that the majority of it benefited the employees, who received €1.9 billion in the 
form of personnel expenses. The stockholders accounted for €0.3 billion of value added, lenders for 
€0.1 billion and the government for €0.4 billion.

 9.  Product Stewardship
9.  Product Stewardship
Covestro has a systematic approach including reporting systems and global guidelines for compliance 
control, incident notification and reporting that includes product stewardship aspects. Any incidents 
are tracked in a global information system and frequently evaluated. The systematic approach includes 
root cause analysis for corrective actions in order to continuously improve our product stewardship 
performance. 
Our product portfolio does not contain any products that are banned by UN listing or through interna-
tional conventions. In 2016 no material case of incident of non-compliance with regulations and volun-tary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services has been recorded or is 
known to us, nor has any material case of incident of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary 
codes concerning product and service information and labeling occurred in 2016.√ 
Our own system to create safety information covers mandatory information on content, safe use of the 
product, as well as relevant disposal information. We apply systematic evaluations for new products and 
applications and systematically utilize IT tools to support this process.Animal studies are essential to assess the safety of our products, especially to humans, but also to the 
environment. For these studies, Covestro respects the 3Rs principle. The aim of the 3Rs principle is to
reduce the use of laboratory animals, replace them through other methods, and refine and improve the
test procedures wherever possible. Covestro only contacts and selects research institutes and organi -
zations that meet our animal welfare principles. Compliance with our animal welfare requirements is 
regularly monitored, and information provided in supplier self-evaluations is verified through on-site 
audits. For example, this is valid with regard to the registration processes within the European Union, the 
United States and China, which prescribe results from toxicological and ecotoxicological studies by law.See section 13

10.3  Environmental and T ransportation Safety
In 2016, we carried out a campaign in Europe to focus on near-misses during unloading operations in 
order to improve safety in ground transportation. Our freight forwarders were challenged to inform their 
drivers about potential hazards and encourage them to report near-misses. The campaign was an off -
shoot of our 2015 fuel depot assessments performed at and with our customers. 
Covestro is active worldwide in key committees and associations focused on transportation and distri-
bution safety, and campaigns for industry-wide safety standards for product transportation. 
In 2016, Covestro registered nearly 900,000 loads transported via road, rail, water and air.√  Seven 
transportation incidents were reported and one environmental incident.√  The following is a breakdown 
of transportation incidents by mode of transportation:
At our production facility in Antwerp (Belgium) a leak occurred in a sealing flange on July 28, 2016, when 
a pump was restarted after maintenance. This resulted in the release of ten cubic meters of chlorobenzene, 
about two cubic meters of which were absorbed into the soil. The contaminated soil was removed and 
disposed of through incineration. In order to avoid such incidents in the future, various preventive  
measures were taken, such as special leakage testing. transportation Incidents by mode of t ransportation

GRI Supplementary Report 201611.1  Energy Consumption11.  Environmental Protection
11.  Environmental Protection
We aim to use all natural resources as efficiently as possible while reducing emissions to a minimum. 
The management tool we use for this purpose is our continuously updated Integrated Management 
System. We also use sophisticated data management systems to identify and realize potential efficien -
cy improvements and reduce the environmental effects of our production activities as much  
as possible.
Covestro’s goal is to halve direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases per metric ton of product 
based on 2005 levels, and to do so by 2025. In addition, by 2030 we also want to halve the specific 
energy consumption of our production facilities compared with the same baseline (2005). Doubling  
our energy efficiency in this way will be a significant lever in reducing indirect specific greenhouse  
gas emissions.
In 2016, we were able to optimize our energy efficiency further, achieving an increase of 34.5% compared 
with the baseline year 2005.√  This represented an improvement of 5.9% over 2015.√  Once again, our 
energy management system STRUCT eseTM made a contribution to this achievement. At the same  
time, specific greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 equivalents) dropped by a total of 40.9% from our  
baseline year, 2005.√  Specific emissions in 2016 sank by 3.6% compared with 2015.√  Our innovative 
products and processes help ensure that our customers can also increase efficiency and reduce  
environmental impacts. 
11.1  Energy Consumption
Our production volume grew by 5.5% in 2016, while at the same time our energy consumption remained 
approximately at the prior-year level.√  The company’s total energy consumption was down 0.44%, and 
equivalent primary energy consumption was down 0.81%.√  Equivalent primary energy consumption 
comprises the fuels used directly at Covestro for the purpose of generating energy and the forms of 
energy sourced from outside the company (secondary energy), such as electricity, steam, and refrigeration, 
recalculated to reflect the energy required to generate them. We were able to unlink energy consumption 
from the increase in production through efficiency improvements in our production facilities. In addition, 
the high level of capacity utilization at our plants positively affected this trend.

 12.  Corporate Citizenship
In the UK, Covestro was the headline sponsor for the 2016 annual Design Innovation in Plastics  
competition – the longest established student plastics competition of its kind in Europe. It produced 
high-quality entries which ranged from an innovative horse strap which prevents injury, a dog feeder to 
prevent lungworm and a ball to improve dog mouth hygiene. This competition has boosted many students 
in their careers as well as raising the awareness among universities of fostering innovative thinking. 
Covestro continues to work with the Moscow-based fashion studio “Begraniz Couture” specialized in 
designing outfits for disabled people. In 2016 we organized a five-day “fashion workshop” at our premises 
in Leverkusen (Germany), inviting fashion-design students and product designers to learn about Uni -
versal Design. As a result, the participants designed two outfits for disabled people considering the 
special needs and material properties. 
Covestro continues providing its support for sports and cultural events at the Dormagen, Krefeld-Uerdingen 
and Leverkusen sites in Germany. Similarly, in 2016, Covestro became a sponsor of the German Ice 
Hockey League (Deutsche Eishockey Liga or DEL), since its high-tech materials are well suited for that 
sport to protect athletes from injury. 
In cooperation with the university hospital in Düsseldorf (Germany), Covestro organized three events at 
its property, where employees could get themselves typecasted for bone marrow donation. 
United States, Canada and Mexico 
Our U.S. sites supported employee volunteering and fundraising initiatives. Among others, employees 
across the United States raised €500,000 for the Workplace Campaign of the charity “United Way” 
through a combination of creative fundraisers and payroll deductions. 
Covestro employees have also been volunteering for Habitat for Humanity in the Kanawha and and 
Putnam Counties. This included renovation work, partial demolition and the construction of homes for 
the needy. 
Furthermore, Covestro sponsored the MRI Humanitarian Materials Initiative award hosted by Penn State 
University, to support ongoing research that is aimed at providing long-term and sustainable solutions 
to problems in under-resourced regions of the world. Covestro donated to a project that investigates 
moringa-coated sand filters for water purification.
