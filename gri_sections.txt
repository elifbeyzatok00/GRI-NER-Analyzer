WATER CARE
[G4-EN9, G4-EN10]
In Lala, we support the  
conservation of the forest where Mexican Picea inhabits so it can sustain its ability to retain water and therefore  infiltrate the aquifers. We also help preserve the Cuatrociéne-gas Ecological Reservation and the Nazas River Watershed in the Comarca Lagunera. We implemented a  
self-supply strategy,  
which comes from the need  
to release water needed in the area. This means that that the water dependence on networks dropped from 18% to 2%.WE BELIEVE IN

2.1  Company Guidelines
Sustainability management at Covestro contributes to the development of customer-focused products 
as well as to the protection of the environment through resource-efficient and low-emissions production, 
and creates economic value. Specific requirements on important sustainability issues are defined in our 
internal regulations and guidelines in order to advance the sustainability aspects of our strategy.
•  Creating value: Ongoing value creation is the primary objective of Covestro. We develop solutions 
that create value for customers, society and the environment, as well as for employees and investors.
•  Sustainability: Our aim is to align economic targets with environmental and social goals. Ensuring that 
our business activities embrace sustainability reflects our purpose “T o make the world a brighter place.”
•  Innovation: Innovation is necessary for mastering the global challenges of our time and for creating 
value in the long term. As a result, we develop new products, applications and technologies that focus 
on sustainable development.
•  People: Covestro’s success is based on the strong commitment of our employees. We want to  
motivate and offer them an attractive workplace. 
•  HSEQ (Health, Safety, Environment and Quality): Occupational health, safety, environmental protec -
tion, energy efficiency and quality management are key factors in achieving our aims. Continuous 
improvement is the primary goal of our Integrated Management System.
•  Compliance: Covestro’s corporate conduct is characterized by a sense of responsibility as well as 
ethical principles. Strict compliance with all legal requirements and voluntary pledges by Covestro is therefore considered to be of the utmost importance.
Specific committees have been appointed at Covestro to define and manage important sustainability issues. These include the development and implementation of targets and action programs. 
2.2  Sustainability Goals
Covestro fully supports the United Nations’ sustainability goals (SDGs). We have analyzed the influence 
that our activities, products, initiatives and our engagement can have on these goals. The SDGs and the 
findings of the analysis are incorporated into our sustainability agenda. 
In 2016, Covestro set five ambitious goals to be reached by 2025, which are aligned with the SDGs. We 
will report regularly on the progress made.
In addition, occupational health and safety, energy efficiency and environmental protection goals have 
been defined as part of our Integrated Management System.2.  Strategy2.1  Company Guidelines

 2.  Strategy
The five goals to be achieved by 2025 are outlined below:
Our project portfolio is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals  
We will align our research and development projects (R&D) to address the UN SDGs. 
By 2025, 80% of our R&D project spending will be targeted in areas that specifically 
contribute to achieving these goals, either undertaken in partnership with or endorsed 
by recognized institutions. 
Many of our innovations and research activities already promote our efforts toward 
mastering global challenges. These include the solutions developed for the Solar 
Impulse project, improvements in resource efficiency, and cost-effective and  
environmentally and socially friendly products.
100% of suppliers compliant with our sustainability requirements 
All our suppliers with recurrent annual spending exceeding €100,000 will be assessed 
and are expected to achieve compliance with Covestro’s sustainability requirements. 
This group covers some 97% of the total purchasing volume. The remainder of our 
suppliers must comply with our code of conduct through accepting the conditions 
of our purchase orders or contracts. We also seek to partner with our key suppliers 
to assist them in advancing their sustainability performance.
Reduce specific greenhouse gas emissions by 50% 
We aim to reduce our specific greenhouse gas emissions – those generated per 
metric ton of product produced – by 50% compared to our base year 2005. 
T en million people in underserved markets benefited by our business 
solutions
We have undertaken to contribute to improve the lives of ten million people in  
underserved markets, primarily in developing and emerging countries, by the year 
2025. In collaboration with customers, governmental and non-governmental  
organizations we intend to develop affordable solutions based on our technologies 
and products to jointly provide new business models and business solutions that 
can be employed to the economic and social benefit of those in this sector. We 
intend to focus primarily on affordable housing, sanitation and food security appli-
cations in which our materials offer significant benefits.
Getting the most out of carbon
Our products are based on carbon. In order to ensure we are delivering positive 
returns on our use of this element, we aim to work with our value chains, public and 
non-profit sectors to establish and employ a methodology to ensure our use of 
carbon delivers optimal productivity.
Our carbon productivity initiative aims to increase the return on carbon invested 
throughout the value chain.
For example, by investing carbon in the manufacture of polyurethane insulation foam, 
we can save up to 70 times that investment through the life of this material due to 
lower energy consumption and reduced emissions.

3.1  Stakeholder Dialog 
We are committed to active, open and honest dialog with our stakeholders – whether in the immediate 
vicinity of our sites or at national or global level. Our main stakeholder groups include Covestro’s partners 
as well as financial market participants, regulators and social interest groups. Addressing their interests 
is very important in respect of our strategy development, our decision-making and our risk management 
activities. For further informa-
tion, see our Annual Report, Combined Management Re -
port, section 21 "Opportunities and Risks Report" 
We adopt an open communication approach. Depending on specific issues and relevance, our various 
departments identify and prioritize key stakeholders and appropriate formats to address them. 
Partners 
Collaboration with customers, employees and suppliers is a prerequisite for the long-term success of 
our company. We also value the cooperation with – and the active participation in – industry-relevant 
associations and scientific institutions. We are in frequent contact with all of these groups, both at senior 
management level and through various departments. 
In addition, Covestro participates in a number of international industry trade shows. In the year under 
review, these included major events such as K 2016, Chinaplast, the American Institute of Architects

3.4  Value Creation
Covestro aims to create sustainable value for all stakeholder groups in the value chain.
Our value added calculation presents the value added we have generated as the company’s contribution 
to the gross national product of the individual country, and shows its distribution during the fiscal year. 
We define value added as the company’s business performance minus its outlays, such as material 
expenses, other expenses or depreciation, amortization and impairment losses. In 2016, the Covestro 
Group’s business performance amounted to €12.0 billion. Value added came to €3.1 billion. The state -
ment of allocation shows that the majority of it benefited the employees, who received €1.9 billion in the 
form of personnel expenses. The stockholders accounted for €0.3 billion of value added, lenders for 
€0.1 billion and the government for €0.4 billion.

6.1  Procurement of Key Products
In 2016, Covestro’s procurement spend in Germany, the United States and China accounted for just 
under 79% of Covestro’s global spend. Most of this amount – around 78% – was accounted for by 
suppliers in the individual countries.√  In terms of our main sites, a total of 78% of total procurement 
spend was allocated to local suppliers.√
6.2  Sustainability in the Supply Chain
Covestro regards adherence to sustainability standards within its supply chain as both a vital factor for 
value creation and a crucial lever for minimizing risks. In order to develop and establish a sustainability 
standard for our supply base, we are working with the T ogether for Sustainability (TfS) initiative of the 
chemical industry.
In 2011, Covestro – formerly Bayer MaterialScience and part of the Bayer Group – was one of the six 
founding members of the TfS initiative. Since the launch of TfS, the now 19 TfS members have evaluated 
the sustainability practices of 6,383 suppliers using online assessments and conducted in addition  
724 on-site supplier audits.√  In 2016, a total of 1,773 supplier assessments and 241 audits have been 
completed globally, including in China, India and Brazil.√For additional infor -
mation, see the 
website of TfS at http://tfs-initiative.com 6.1  Procurement of Key Products
The online assessments are carried out via the established provider EcoVadis, which is accredited by 
TfS. The objective of these assessments is to gauge the sustainability practices of supplier companies 
in line with corporate social responsibility (CSR). The questionnaire for the assessment is filled out by 
the supplier. It is based on internationally accepted sustainability standards and includes 21 criteria 
broken down into the following topics: environmental protection, working conditions and human rights, 
fair business practices and sustainable sourcing. It is adapted dynamically according to the industry 
sector, company size and country risk. The information provided must be backed up by appropriate 
documentation. The CSR experts at EcoVadis then analyze the answers according to international 
standards and compile them in a scorecard accessible online that shows in detail where improvements 
can be made. 
External, independent auditors accredited by TfS conduct on-site audits at selected companies and, if 
necessary, re-audits based on TfS sustainability criteria to verify the statements made by suppliers. 
The TfS members can access the assessment and audit results via an online platform, which also offers 
content for purposes of continually monitoring improvements.ecoVadis

 6.  Procurement
It is Covestro’s goal to have the supplier base conducting a re-evaluation at least every three years, 
depending on the results. In 2016, 308 assessments and 29 audits were therefore initiated by Covestro.√ 
An initial assessment was carried out at 175 new suppliers. In total, evaluation results no more than three 
years old are available for 614 Covestro suppliers.√ 
Covestro discusses necessary improvement directly with suppliers and agrees the corresponding 
targets with them. Implementation of the required improvements is verified continuously. Based on these 
results, re-assessments were conducted at 127 suppliers during the year under review, approximately 
60% of which notably improved their sustainability performance.√ 
Supplier performance development is particularly important to Covestro and to the TfS initiative, which 
regularly organizes Supplier Days and promotes continuing education. In addition, TfS provides a wide range of information and online training on its website.
The TfS initiative aims to drive its global audit and assessment program internationally. Therefore, TfS 
cooperates with various associations and organizations around the world. Another important step was taken in this regard in October 2016: A master agreement was signed with China Petroleum and Chem-ical Industry Federation (CPCIF) to jointly promote and improve sustainability in China. 
6.3  Conflict Minerals 
International regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States obligate companies to disclose 
the origin of certain raw materials to ensure that “conflict minerals", such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and 
gold from the Democratic Republic of Congo or its neighboring states, do not enter their products 
through the supply chain. Covestro uses tin in production and therefore monitors all suppliers to make 
sure they do not source raw materials containing tin from the affected areas through their supply chains 
and deliver these to us.
In order to clearly communicate our requirements regarding conflict minerals, we made these part of 
our Supplier Code of Conduct. Covestro has obtained confirmations of conflict metal compliance from 100% of the identified suppliers potentially affected by this issue (153 material/supplier pairs).√  A list of 
potentially affected suppliers and the validity of all existing supplier confirmations are permanently 
monitored. 6.3  Conflict Minerals

8.  Distribution and Logistics
8.1  Distribution
In order to ensure high customer satisfaction, error-free distribution is our foremost quality target. Customer 
satisfaction is systematically analyzed on a global scale. T o this end, we regularly evaluate customer 
complaints that are entered and processed in a global management system. Moreover, we obtain  
evaluations from our customers. We take feedback from our customers and derive corrective and  
preventive measures in order to further increase quality and customer satisfaction and thereby lower 
the error rate and the incidence of complaints. In 2016, we made significant progress in this regard. 
Worldwide, a total of 5,284 complaints were submitted by 2,145 customers.√  This is a rate of 7.42  
complaints per 1,000 deliveries, which is below the 2015 figure of 7.61 complaints per 1,000 deliveries.√ 
Despite this gratifying decrease, our efforts continued unabated in 2016 with the focus still on damaged 
packaging and missed delivery dates.
8.2  Transportation and Packaging
In 2016, the logistics service providers we contracted worldwide completed more than 426,649 deliveries 
to our customers.√  The volume delivered amounted to 5.37 million metric tons, with the share of goods 
shipped exclusively by rail or waterway totaling 16.3%.√  Road transportation by truck remains our most 
important form of transportation. In many places, the capacity situation in regional as well as global 
transportation markets was often strained. The logistics industry is generally being very cautious about 
making investments in additional transportation equipment for all modes of transportation. In nearly all 
countries, the regional transportation markets continued to be adversely impacted by a major structural 
lack of qualified drivers. Nonetheless, Covestro has been able to maintain the reliability of its transportation 
networks at a very high level thanks to the careful selection of effective service providers.
A number of projects were undertaken to optimize packaging material procurement. This reduced the 
amount of raw materials used, thus contributing to our sustainability position. Avoiding the need for 
coating the interiors of steel drums saved considerable amounts of internal coating material, for instance. 
In another project, we are currently optimizing our PE bags for shipping polycarbonate granules. Chang -
ing the composition of the bags will both improve their robustness and reduce the amount of raw  
materials used in their manufacture. Pallets are another area where we are using fewer raw materials. 
Using special pallets for securing loads as a substitute for standard chemical industry pallets, we have 
been able to lower the timber requirements per pallet by approximately one-third. Based on our  
calculations, this corresponds to a forested area around the size of five soccer fields per year.
In terms of packaged goods logistics, we also saw improvements in sustainability. For instance, in  
certain facilities, the loading weight of sacks and bulk bags on pallets has increased by around 25% to 
improve the utilization of cargo space capacity and to save on load carriers.  8.1  Distribution

9.  Product Stewardship
Covestro has a systematic approach including reporting systems and global guidelines for compliance 
control, incident notification and reporting that includes product stewardship aspects. Any incidents 
are tracked in a global information system and frequently evaluated. The systematic approach includes 
root cause analysis for corrective actions in order to continuously improve our product stewardship 
performance. 
Our product portfolio does not contain any products that are banned by UN listing or through interna-
tional conventions. In 2016 no material case of incident of non-compliance with regulations and volun-tary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services has been recorded or is 
known to us, nor has any material case of incident of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary 
codes concerning product and service information and labeling occurred in 2016.√ 
Our own system to create safety information covers mandatory information on content, safe use of the 
product, as well as relevant disposal information. We apply systematic evaluations for new products and 
applications and systematically utilize IT tools to support this process.Animal studies are essential to assess the safety of our products, especially to humans, but also to the 
environment. For these studies, Covestro respects the 3Rs principle. The aim of the 3Rs principle is to
reduce the use of laboratory animals, replace them through other methods, and refine and improve the
test procedures wherever possible. Covestro only contacts and selects research institutes and organi -
zations that meet our animal welfare principles. Compliance with our animal welfare requirements is 
regularly monitored, and information provided in supplier self-evaluations is verified through on-site 
audits. For example, this is valid with regard to the registration processes within the European Union, the 
United States and China, which prescribe results from toxicological and ecotoxicological studies by law.See section 13

Our goal is to minimize emissions into wastewater. These emissions are largely dependent on our pro -
duction volumes and the relevant current product portfolio. 
The volume of process wastewater increased by 10.4% in 2016.√  The share of the company’s process 
wastewater worldwide purified at a wastewater treatment plant operated by Covestro or a third party 
amounted to 74.7% worldwide.√  Following careful analysis, 25.0% was categorized as environmentally 
safe and returned to the water cycle. A remaining part was disposed of mainly through incineration.√
T otal organic carbon (TOC) emissions into wastewater decreased by 2.6%.√  In contrast, the volume of 
nitrogen emitted into wastewater was up 46.8%.√  This was amongst others vor mainly due to mainly 
due to an increase at the German production sites in Krefeld-Uerdingen and Dormagen caused  
by higher production activities. Phosphate emissions were down 11.4% in 2016, with the largest  
decreases reported at the facility in Kaohshiung (T aiwan).√  In global terms, Covestro’s phosphate  
emissions are low. The volume of inorganic salts introduced into wastewater rose by 3%.√  In contrast, 
emissions of heavy metals were down sharply by 24.5%, particularly at the German sites in Leverkusen 
and Brunsbüttel.√  In Brunsbüttel, a plant closure halved the quantity of copper released.

In January 2016, a pilot plant for recycling industrial wastewater began operating at the Krefeld-Uerdingen 
site. The circulation procedure is being promoted by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature 
Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety within the scope of the Environmental Innovation Program 
and is currently in the technical trial phase. Thanks to the new process developed in collaboration  
with Covestro, the chlor-alkali electrolysis process is intended to reduce the use by up to several  
10,000 metric tons of salt and several 100,000 metric tons of fully desalinated water annually. This equals 
an emissions savings of several thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalents per year. Furthermore,  
this can reduce the amount of salinated wastewater that is released into the Rhine River.
