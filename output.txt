Materiality* 
CapitaLand has a regular review, assessment and feedback process in relation to ESG topics. Key to this is an annual 
Group-wide Risk and Control Self-Assessment exercise which entails the identification, assessment and documentation 
of material risks and corresponding internal controls. Such material risks include fraud and corruption, environmental, 
health and safety, and human capital risks which are ESG-relevant. Other existing channels for feedback to ensure 
relevance of issues include: 
Environment
Regular dialogue/feedback sessions with government agencies (e.g. Building and 
• 
Construction Authority, National Environment Agency)  
Active participation in Singapore Green Building Council
• 
Social
Regular dialogue with government agencies and unions  
• 
Active participation in Singapore Workplace Safety and Health Council  
• 
Regular employee engagement survey
• 
Governance
Engagement with Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (SIAS) for its annual 
• 
Corporate Governance Conference  
Engagement where appropriate with Singapore Exchange
• 
Through regular stakeholder engagement, CapitaLand identifies and reviews material issues that are most relevant and 
significant to the Group and its stakeholders. For CapitaLand, priorities are ranked based on the likelihood and potential 
impact of issues affecting business continuity and development. For external stakeholders, priority is given to issues 
important to society and applicable to CapitaLand. CapitaLand therefore prioritises its sustainability efforts and reporting 
on issues that are most material to its business and stakeholders. This report covers CapitaLand’s international portfolio 
in over 20 countries unless otherwise indicated. For more information on stakeholder engagement, please refer to the 
Social and Relationship Capital, Human Capital and Environmental Capital chapters.

Global Sustainability Report 2016
Introduction
Risks, Challenges and Opportunities
Climate Change
Climate change risks and opportunities are identified and mitigated through CapitaLand’s Enterprise Risk Management 
(ERM) framework, and its externally certified ISO14001 Environmental Management System (EMS). 
 
Climate change brings about different effects in different geographies including rising sea levels, violent storms, long 
intense heat waves, flash floods and fresh water depletion. 2016 also saw the Earth’s warmest year with data showing 
that 2016’s global temperatures are approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  
 
By the close of COP22 (22nd UN Climate Conference) in November 2016, 111 governments had already ratified the 
Paris Agreement. Together they account for three quarters of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Singapore 
committed to reduce its emissions intensity3 by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030, and stabilise greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions with the aim of peaking around 2030. In December 2016, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures4 published its recommendations for a clear, efficient, and voluntary disclosure framework that improves 
the ease of both producing and using climate-related financial disclosures.   
 
The challenge for each nation is to strengthen its resilience against climate change risks, manage its GHG emissions 
and achieve economic growth in a sustainable manner. As countries are rallying for actions to mitigate climate 
change, more stringent regulations may be expected and companies may be faced with increased expectations from 
stakeholders. An example was the year end shrouding of northern China in smog. In response, China’s parliament 
levied environmental protection taxes on industry from 2018.  
 
CapitaLand is positioned to face such challenges as it has in place a target to achieve green certification of its existing 
properties by 2030. It is ISO 14001 certified for its environmental management system in 15 countries. It recognises 
the importance of innovation in managing its environmental footprint and differentiating the company from its peers. 
It encourages innovative green features in its developments. More than S$2.5 million has been invested in innovative 
features for three of its projects. 
 
For more information, please refer to Environmental Capital chapter.  
 
Demographic Change 
As people lead longer lives, many countries will increasingly encounter challenges of ageing populations in their 
urban spaces. The pace of world population ageing is accelerating. By 2030 many middle-income countries will 
have aged considerably. By 2050, those aged 60 years or over, are projected to account for 34% of the population of 
Europe, 28% of Northern America, 26% of Latin America and the Caribbean, 25% of Asia, 23% of Oceania, and 9% of 
Africa5. In this regard, CapitaLand has taken the lead in implementing social integration designs into its Sustainable 
Buildings Guidelines. For its new Singapore projects, a target has been set to achieve Universal Design Gold as 
assessed by Singapore’s Building and Construction Authority. For more information, please refer to Social and 
Relationship Chapter. 
 
3	 Emissions Intensity refers to the amount of greenhouse gas emitted per dollar GDP. It is a measure of how efficient a country is in terms of 
greenhouse gas emissions relative to its economic activities.
4	 This taskforce was created by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body set up by the G20 to monitor risks to the financial system. 
It recommended a framework to give investors, lenders and underwriters greater clarity on how future-proofed a company is in a world that 
is getting worryingly warmer, and is an attempt to move climate-related issues into the mainstream of financial filings. The financial risks from 
climate change, outlined in this report, range from abrupt changes in energy costs and hiked insurance premiums, to property damage from 
floods and storms and the upfront cost of low-emissions technology.

Industry Transformation – Convergence of Online and Offline 
As the pace of technological advancement within and outside of the real estate sector quickens, consumer spending 
and the culture of work will change.  
 
In 2016, CapitaLand launched C31 Ventures to invest in new-economy startups relevant to its businesses and created 
the new brand lyf to tap into the millennial market for serviced residences.  
 
CapitaLand leveraged digital technology to improve its mall customers’ experience. In 2016, it enhanced CapitaStar, 
a key digital platform to build brand loyalty, with the pilot of the Sparkle artificial intelligence chatbot in Singapore 
to connect shoppers with the products and services. CapitaStar members can tap on virtual concierge services, 
including ride hailing and restaurant booking through CapitaLand’s partnerships with new economy partners Grab 
and Chope respectively.
 
Ascott has also expanded its collaboration with Tujia China’s largest and fastest growing online apartment sharing 
platform with the launch of the Somerset Tujia brand. It also forged a new partnership with Fliggy, formerly known as 
Alitrip making its products and services accessible to hundreds of millions of Chinese travellers. 
 
For the future of the work place, CapitaLand started working with Collective Works in Singapore, UrWork in China and 
Toong in Vietnam.  
 
CapitaLand commenced the redevelopment of Funan DigitaLife Mall. The new integrated development is set to become 
an experiential creative centre within Singapore’s civic district, where it is envisioned to serve as a technology-enabled 
hub to connect retail, cultural, learning and business opportunities. It will feature a multi-level landscape with the creation 
of a series of gardens, including urban farms and edible gardens. The urban farm aims to showcase sustainable food 
production with a range of technologies, demonstrating the diversity and cyclical relationships of crop production.

President & Group CEO’s Message
Dear Stakeholders, 
 
2016 has been eventful with continued geo-political uncertainties and economic headwinds in our core markets 
Singapore and China. Advances in technology continue to impact the way we live, work and play.  It has direct 
implications to CapitaLand’s businesses and influence the way we design and deliver our products to meet our 
customers’ expectations and preference.  
 
According to scientists from the UK Met Office, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2016 beat 2015 to become Earth’s warmest year since 1850. The Paris 
Agreement on Climate Change entered into force on 4 November 2016 and our core markets Singapore and China 
also made national level commitments. The Singapore government just announced its plans for a carbon tax in 2019 
and to increase water price by 30% from July 2017.  
 
As a sustainable real estate developer, we want to build a lasting company that adds value to our stakeholders across 
our diversified global real estate portfolio of integrated developments, shopping malls, serviced residences, offices and 
homes. Such global developments will spur us to continually strive for operational efficiency, and leverage on innovation 
to build resilient and sustainable real estate of the future.  
 
We share the United Nations Global Compact’s (UNGC) commitment to deliver lasting benefits to people, communities 
and markets and became a signatory in 2015. Even before then, we had been adopting universal principles on human 
rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption, as well as taking strategic actions that advance the development 
of society. Despite the challenging environment, we continued to deliver a set of resilient and healthy financial results 
of S$5.3 billion of total revenue and S$2.4 billion of earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) from our continuing 
operations. The Group’s return on equity improved to 6.6%, up from 6.1% in 2015.  
 
We persisted in our drive for operational efficiency and achieved energy and water consumption reductions of 18.8% 
and 21.8% (per m2) respectively for our operational properties, and reduced our carbon emission intensity by 26.2%, 
compared to the base year 2008. This amounted to utilities cost avoidance in excess of S$108 million for the Group since 
2009 and helps us mitigate fluctuations in the global utility costs and resource scarcity. By end 2016, we installed 
over 80 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in 30 of our properties in Singapore, China, Belgium, Germany and 
Japan. The total electricity charged at these stations by EVs exceeded 130 MWh which can be translated to more than 
613,000 km travelled by EVs. 
 
We understand how buildings touch the lives of our stakeholders, and remain committed to developing buildings 
that are accessible to all in the community. I am glad that to date, 12 of our Singapore developments have achieved 
Universal Design Mark from Singapore’s Building and Construction Authority for their accessible features, with 5 of 
our properties achieving the highest accolade of Universal Design Mark Platinum. 
 
As we continue to expand our footprint to new growth markets and existing gateway cities, we remain vigilant in 
conducting our business and interacting with stakeholders in a fair and ethical manner, maintaining the highest level 
of integrity. 
 
We recognise that the long-term success of our business is closely linked with the health and prosperity of the 
communities we operate in. We offer our staff three days of paid Volunteer Service Leave each year, so that they can 
play their part in building communities beyond their roles as real estate professionals, and encourage staff to use up 
all their volunteer leave with a donation to a charity of their choice. In 2016, over 2,100 staff in CapitaLand properties 
contributed more than 16,000 volunteer hours.   
 
We are committed to re-skill our people to remain relevant in the changing landscape. In 2016, we continued to organise 
regular evening sharing sessions featuring speakers from within the company, as well as industry experts, to share 
their experiences on game changing trends and innovation. These were attended by over 560 staff who invested over 
3,000 training hours. Staff located outside of the venue could join the session via private streaming. Our overall training 
exceeded 54 hours per staff on average in 2016, well above the recommended industry standards.

President & Group CEO’s Message
To ensure a good understanding of local socio-political environment and cultural sensitivities, we continued our 
localisation strategy for overseas operations with locals accounted for about 83% of the employees based in Singapore 
and 98% of employees based in China in 2016.  
 
We are one of the first Singapore companies to voluntarily report on our sustainability performance since Financial Year 
(FY) 2009. This was well before the Singapore Exchange issued sustainability reporting guidelines and its plans to 
introduce the “comply or explain” listing rule for sustainability reporting for FY 2017. We are glad that our effort has been 
recognised by international and regional listings and accolades. We are the only Singapore company to receive the 
“Silver Class” distinction in real estate in The Sustainability Yearbook. We are also listed in the Dow Jones Sustainability 
World and Asia Pacific Index, FTSE4Good Index Series, as well as the MSCI Global Sustainability Indices and STOXX® 
Global ESG Leaders Indices. More importantly, more than 87% of our staff volunteers expressed their pride and 
enjoyment working in a company with a positive and vibrant corporate culture. 
 
For our company’s continued success, we want good people who are professionally competent, with good character. 
This sustainability journey takes continual effort and we urge our stakeholders to share our Group’s commitment to 
transparency and innovation so that together we can improve the economic, environmental and social well-being of 
the communities we operate in.

Each year, the Nominating Committee (NC) undertakes a process to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board as a 
whole and the Board Committees. An external consultant was engaged to facilitate the evaluation process for the 
Board’s performance in FY 2016. The consultant is independent of and is not related to the Company or any of its 
Directors. As part of the process, questionnaires were sent by the consultant to the Directors and Management and 
the findings were evaluated by the consultant and reported, together with the recommendations of the consultant, to 
the Chairman of the Board (also Chairman of the NC). One-on-one interviews were also conducted. The interviews 
focused on seeking clarifications to the feedback obtained from the responses in the questionnaires, and broader 
questions were also raised to help validate certain survey findings. The evaluation categories covered in the 
questionnaire included Board composition, information management, Board processes, corporate integrity and 
social responsibility, managing company performance, strategy review, Board Committee effectiveness, President 
&Group CEO performance and succession planning, Director development and management, and managing risk and 
adversity. The Board has considered and followed up with the findings and recommendations of the consultant. In 
respect of individual Directors, formal evaluation is carried out by the NC as and when a Director is due for retirement 
by rotation and is seeking reelection. 
 
Code of Business Conduct 
The Group adheres to an ethics and code of business conduct policy which deals with issues such as confidentiality, 
conduct and work discipline, corporate gifts and concessionary offers. Clear policies and guidelines on how to handle 
workplace harassment and grievances are also in place. 
 
The detailed policies and guidelines are published on the Group’s intranet (iHub) and accessible by all staff. The 
policies CapitaLand has implemented aim to help detect and prevent occupational fraud mainly in three ways. 
 
First, the Group offers fair compensation packages, based on practices of pay-for-performance and promotion based 
on merit, to its employees. The Group also provides various healthcare subsidies and financial assistance schemes to 
alleviate the common financial pressures its employees face. 
 
Second, clearly documented policies and work procedures incorporate internal controls which ensure that adequate 
checks and balances are in place. Periodic audits are also conducted to evaluate the efficacy of these internal controls. 
 
Finally, the Group seeks to build and maintain the right organisational culture through its core values, educating its 
employees on good business conduct and ethics.

Bribery and Corruption Prevention Policy 
The Group adopts a strong stance against bribery and corruption. In addition to clear guidelines and procedures for 
the giving and receipt of corporate gifts and concessionary offers, all employees of the Group are required to make 
a declaration on an annual basis when they pledge to uphold the core values and not to engage in any corrupt or 
unethical practices. This serves as a reminder to all employees to maintain the highest standards of integrity in their 
work and business dealings. 
 
The Group’s zero-tolerance policy against bribery and corruption extends to its business dealings with third-party 
service providers and vendors. Pursuant to such a policy, the Group requires that certain of its agreements with third 
party service providers and vendors incorporate anti-bribery and anti-corruption provisions. 
 
A whistle-blowing policy and other procedures are put in place to provide the Group’s employees and parties 
who have dealings with the Group with well-defined, accessible and trusted channels to report suspected fraud, 
corruption, dishonest practices or other improprieties in the workplace, and for the independent investigation of any 
reported incidents and appropriate follow-up action. The objective of the whistle-blowing policy is to encourage the

reporting of such matters – that employees or external parties making any reports in good faith will be able to do so 
with confidence that they will be treated fairly, and to the extent possible, be protected from reprisal. 
 
This is reinforced by the Group Policy and Procedure on Business Malpractice Incidents (BMIs) Reporting that 
facilitates line/functional managers to swiftly report any BMI discovered in their workplace or in the course of their 
work directly to their CEOs. 
Substantiated BMI cases are reported quarterly to the CapitaLand Audit Committee meetings and shared with the 
Risk Champions regularly. Actions taken could include the termination of staff contract, and /or reporting to the 
appropriate external authorities. In 2016, there were 4 BMI cases substantiated and the appropriate actions were 
taken. None of the cases were pertaining to anti-competitive or money laundering behavior. 
 
CapitaLand made no payment/donations to politicians or political parties as it expects its projects to be judged on 
their merits. 
 
Dealings in Securities 
CapitaLand has adopted a securities dealing policy for the Group’s officers and employees which applies the 
best practices recommendations in the Listing Manual. It has issued guidelines to Directors and employees in the 
Group, which sets out prohibitions against dealings in the Company’s securities (i) while in possession of material 
unpublished price-sensitive information, (ii) during the two weeks immediately preceding, and up to the time of the 
announcement of, the Company’s results for each of the first three quarters of its financial year and, (iii) during the 
one month preceding, and up to the time of announcement of, the Company’s results for the full financial year. Prior to 
the commencement of each relevant period, an email would be sent out to all Directors and employees of the Group 
to inform them of the duration of the period. 
 
Directors and employees of the Group are also prohibited from dealing in securities of the company and other 
relevant listed entities in the Group if they are in possession of unpublished price-sensitive information of the company 
and other listed entities by virtue of their status as Directors and/or employees. As and when appropriate, they would 
be issued an advisory to refrain from dealing in the relevant securities.  Under the policy, Directors and employees 
are also discouraged from trading on short-term or speculative considerations. They are also prohibited from using 
any information with respect to other companies or entities obtained in the course of their employment in connection 
with securities transactions of such companies or entities. 
 
Other Ethical Management Issues 
CapitaLand is committed to best practices and complies with the relevant legislations and requirements. 
 
CapitaLand supports ethical marketing of its products and services, including the marketing of residential projects, 
commercial leasing or serviced apartment sales. As such, we adhere to the Singapore Code of Advertising Practice 
(SCAP) and any other rules and regulations that apply. The SCAP was formulated against the background of 
national law, international law and practice, including the International Code of Advertising Practice published by the 
International Chamber of Commerce.  
CapitaLand is looking into updating its communications/ marketing Code of Conduct and will communicate to 
communications and marketing heads of department. 
CapitaLand ensures that timely and accurate information is disseminated in the markets that it operates. This is 
particularly important in our residential developments where marketing collaterals and ‘show flats’ presentation are 
done as accurately as possible to avoid misleading potential homebuyers. In Singapore, CapitaLand adheres to the 
Urban Redevelopment Authority’s housing developers rules. Shopping mall and office building marketing activities, 
such as advertisements and promotions (A&P), are generally guided by external A&P consultants where CapitaLand 
stipulates they ensure compliance to local marketing requirements.

Training 
CapitaLand implemented initiatives to ensure that all staff understand the Group’s core values and principles that 
shape the way the Group works and functions. This is a compulsory module in the CapitaLand Immersion Programme 
(CIP) for new staff from various countries. For existing staff, there are dedicated training courses in Singapore on 
“CapitaDNA: Strengthening Core Values” where specific examples and applications of core values in the workplace are 
shared. As the majority of CapitaLand staff are based in China, this training module has been offered there. In 2016, 
more than 120 new staff from Singapore, China and other countries participated in CIP. More than 1,500 staff attended 
the CapitaDNA courses in Singapore, China, Malaysia and Vietnam. In addition, close to 120 staff clocked in over 880 
hours of training pertaining to ethics and code of conduct such as preventing and detecting money laundering, profiling 
and investigation techniques.  
 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) 
Risk management is an integral part of CapitaLand’s business at both the strategic and operational levels. A proactive 
approach towards risk management supports the attainment of CapitaLand’s business objective and corporate strategy 
of ONE CapitaLand, thereby creating and preserving value. 
 
CapitaLand recognises that risk management is just as much about opportunities as it is about threats. To capitalise 
on opportunities, the company has to take measured risks. Therefore, risk management is not about pursuing risk 
minimisation as a goal, but rather optimising the risk-reward relationship within known and agreed risk appetite levels. 
CapitaLand takes risks in a prudent manner for justifiable business reasons. Its Board of Directors is responsible for the 
governance of risk across the Group. 
 
CapitaLand’s ERM Framework sets out the required environmental and organisational components which enable the 
company to manage risks in an integrated, systematic and consistent manner. The ERM Framework and related risk 
management policies are reviewed annually and was previously validated by external ERM consultants. 
 
An effective internal control system and an independent review and audit process are the twin pillars that underpin 
the Group’s ERM Framework. While the line management is responsible for the design and implementation of 
effective internal controls using a risk-based approach, the Internal Audit function reviews such design and 
implementation to provide reasonable assurance to the Audit Committee on the adequacy and effectiveness of the 
internal control system. 
 
Annually, the Risk Assessment Group (RAG) facilitates and coordinates the Group-wide Risk and Control Self-
Assessment (RCSA) exercise that requires business and corporate executive leaders to proactively identify, assess 
and document material risks as well as the corresponding key controls and mitigating measures needed to address 
them. Material risks and their associated controls are consolidated and reviewed at the Group level before they are 
presented to the Risk Committee, Audit Committee and the CapitaLand Board. 
Awareness of and preparedness for potential risks affecting its business continuity help CapitaLand minimise the 
impact of disruption to its business operations. CapitaLand has a Business Continuity Management Policy to guide 
the business units in the implementation of business continuity plans. Periodic exercises were conducted and results 
recorded and continual improvements made. The Information Technology team has a disaster recovery strategy 
which it tests and reviews annually. 
 
CapitaLand believes that having the right risk culture and people with the right attitude, values and knowledge 
are fundamental to the Group’s success. Therefore, the RAG continues to proactively enhance risk management 
knowledge within the Group to promote a culture of risk awareness by conducting a survey. 
 
Sustainability risks identified include fraud and corruption risk, environmental risk, health and safety risk and human 
capital risk.

Based on the ERM framework established and the reviews conducted by Management, both internal and external 
auditors, as well as the assurance from the President & Group CEO and the Group CFO, the Board concurs with 
the recommendation of the CapitaLand Audit Committee and Risk Committee and is of the opinion, that the Group’s 
system of risk management and internal controls addressing financial, operational, compliance and information 
technology risks is adequate and effective to meet the needs of the Group in its current business environment as at 
31 December 2016.

activities to encourage a 
environmental mindset among staff 
and stakeholders 
Over 280 CapitaLand properties participated in WWF Earth Hour, 
pledging to go beyond the hour with year-long sustainable initiatives 
Six stakeholder engagement awards were given out for encouraging 
pro-active and creative stakeholder engagement initiatives.
1	 Iconic projects refer to Raffles City developments, Grade A offices and projects involving star architect.
2	 Green Building Evaluation Label (GBEL) administered by China’s Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development.
3	 Green Building Index (GBI) is Malaysia’s industry recognised green rating tool for buildings to promote sustainability in the built environment.
4	 This is computed from 40 completed projects and projects under construction, based on their submissions for BCA Green Mark and LEED green rating.
5	 This is based on computation of data from 126 properties in 2009, 142 in 2010, 148 in 2011, 164 in 2012, 161 in 2013, 172 in 2014, 174 in 2015 and 
178 in 2016. Properties excluded those undergoing asset enhancement initiatives and newly operational properties. Cost avoidance is computed by 
multiplying the absolute energy (kWh) and water (m3) savings against the annual average tariff rate for Singapore on a business-as-usual (BAU) basis.

Managing our Environmental Footprint 
CapitaLand’s Environmental Management System (EMS) is a key tool in managing the Group’s environmental footprint 
across its global and diverse portfolio, with more than 12,700 staff. This EMS, together with CapitaLand’s Occupational, 
Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) are integrated as CapitaLand’s Environmental, Health and Safety 
Management System (EHSMS). CapitaLand’s EHSMS is audited by a third-party accredited certification body to ISO 
14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards. ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 are internationally recognised standards for the 
environmental management of businesses and occupational health and safety management of businesses respectively. 
CapitaLand’s EHS Committee and the SBU EHS Committees are responsible for driving the EHSMS. 
CapitaLand Environmental, Health and Safety Policy6 
As an international corporate social citizen, CapitaLand is committed to protecting the environment and upholding 
the occupational health and safety of everyone in the workplace*, and will: 
Carry out exemplary Environmental, Health and Safety practices to minimise pollution and health and safety risks 
• 
Seek continual improvement on its Environmental, Health and Safety performance 
• 
Comply with pertinent legislations and other requirements 
• 
Implement the CapitaLand Sustainable Building Guidelines and Occupational Health and Safety programmes 
• 
We make this policy readily available to all employees, suppliers, service providers and partners. 
*This includes implementing an EHS Management System.
Since 2012, the Group achieved ISO 14001 certification for its EMS in 15 countries7 – Singapore, Australia, Belgium, 
China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Spain, Thailand, United Kingdom (UK) 
and Vietnam – covering all markets with investment properties. This encompasses all business functions including 
property development, property management as well as corporate management and operations. 
Risk Management of Environmental Aspects and Impacts 
As part of the certified EMS, new or updated legal requirements are reviewed quarterly and compliance is evaluated 
annually. In 2016, CapitaLand complied with the environmental laws and regulations in Singapore, Australia, Belgium, 
China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Spain, Thailand, UK and Vietnam. 
CapitaLand’s EMS provides a systematic process to manage the Group’s environmental impacts and to continuously 
improve its environmental performance. A key element is to identify and manage significant environmental aspects of 
its business operations that can potentially have a negative impact on the environment. The significance level of each 
environmental aspect and impact is assessed using a risk assessment technique based on factors comprising the 
likelihood of the occurrence, severity of the impact and control measures implemented. 
CapitaLand strives to minimise impacts such as resource depletion, carbon emissions and waste generation. This is 
done by setting environmental targets such as green building rating targets, carbon emissions, energy, water and 
paper usage reduction targets, stakeholder engagement activities, and implementing various measures to achieve 
them. The targets are linked to the remuneration to staff including top management. For more details, please refer to 
the table “2016 Key Performance Indicators”. 
6	 This EHS Policy was developed for the understanding and implementation by all staff in CapitaLand.
7	 This excludes countries where CapitaLand does not have any investment projects.

Training 
To facilitate effective implementation of CapitaLand’s EHSMS, training and awareness programmes are planned and 
conducted for all staff. New staff are inducted to the EHSMS, as well as CapitaLand’s EHS policy and briefed on the 
roles they play. For the implementation of CapitaLand’s EHSMS, Heads of Departments in administration, operations, 
and project development, including heads of operating properties, design managers and project managers, undergo 
more detailed training. In 2016, more than 8,600 CapitaLand staff attended at least one EHS-related training amounting 
to more than 83,000 training hours. 
To overcome the challenge of its extensive international portfolio, CapitaLand has a “Train the Trainer” method for 
its EHS Implementor Training Programme. This ensures that there are trainers based in countries where CapitaLand 
operates to minimise travelling by trainees. An e-learning module on Introduction to EHS was launched in 2016. 
Global Internal and External Audits 
CapitaLand has in place an internal audit system to ensure the conformance and effective implementation of its EMS to 
ISO 14001 international standards. Internal audits are conducted in the 15 markets where it has investment properties at 
least once a year covering at least 50% of the sites in each country. External audits are conducted annually by a third-
party accredited certification body.
 
High Performance Sustainable Developments and Assets 
Green building ratings and certifications help assure and demonstrate the quality of CapitaLand projects and portfolio. 
These ratings serve as an external validation that key environmental aspects have been considered in the Group’s 
project design, development and operations. 
Green Building Rating 
Green building rating targets are set at the outset of CapitaLand projects8. This aids resource management as green 
rated buildings are more resource efficient to construct and operate. 
The target for Singapore projects is minimum Green Mark GoldPLUS, two levels above the legal requirement of Green 
Mark Certification, administered by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) in Singapore. The target for 
projects outside Singapore is certification by a green rating system administered by a national government ministry/ 
agency or a World Green Building Council (WGBC) recognised Green Building Council. The green rating target for 
iconic projects outside Singapore is set at one level above certification. 
Greening Existing Buildings in the Portfolio 
CapitaLand is committed to achieving minimum Green Mark certification for all of its existing stock of properties by 
2020, in support of the Singapore government’s Green Building Master Plan. It has also set an internal target to green 
all its existing properties outside Singapore by 2030 with each achieving minimum certification level by a green rating 
system administered by a national government ministry/agency or a WGBC recognised Green Building Council. As at 
end 2016, it has already achieved green certification of almost 50% (by m2) of its global portfolio. 
Life Cycle Management: CapitaLand Sustainable Building Guidelines 
CapitaLand’s Sustainable Building Guidelines (SBG) is an in-house guide developed since 2007 to ensure environmental 
considerations are factored in at all stages of a project, from feasibility, design, procurement, construction, operation 
to redevelopment. It covers developments and refurbishments, and joint venture developments where CapitaLand 
has management control and the largest stake. Originally titled Green Buildings Guidelines, it was renamed in 2014 to 
reinforce the company’s holistic approach towards sustainability. 
8	 This is for new projects or development projects with gross floor area of at least 2,000 m2.

Mitigating Climate Change Risks and Identifying Opportunities through Design 
Climate change brings about different effects in different geographies including rising sea levels, violent storms, long 
intense heat waves, flash floods and fresh water depletion. As countries rally for action to mitigate climate change, 
more stringent regulations may be expected and companies will face increased expectations from stakeholders. By 
adopting the SBG, CapitaLand aims to future-proof its developments by addressing the risks of climate change right 
from the design stage. The localised context of each project is to be studied in detail, and appropriate measures 
taken in consideration of climate change. SBG also sets guidelines for buildings to be less energy reliant, e.g. setting 
green rating targets above legal requirements, and also encourage the use of renewable energy whenever possible. 
CapitaLand developments that are future-proofed against changing climatic conditions and of higher operating 
efficiency would likely be valued by stakeholders. 
The SBG is regularly reviewed to ensure continuous improvement, with a focus on four key objectives of minimising 
carbon footprint and energy consumption, water management, generation of waste, and promoting biodiversity in the 
life cycles of its developments. Changes since inception include higher green building rating requirements, increased 
focus on biodiversity, use of certified wood and design for accessibility. 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
A key component of the SBG is the mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). An EIA is carried out during 
the feasibility stage of any development project. The significant findings of the EIA and their cost implications, if any, 
are incorporated in the investment paper submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. 
The EIA focuses on identifying any environmental threats or opportunities related to the project site and its 
surroundings, covering areas such as floods, biodiversity, air quality, noise, connectivity, heritage and resources. 
Biodiversity 
CapitaLand is committed to preserving the biodiversity of its sites as well as the wider area wherever possible. This 
is done by addressing any distinctive ecological features of the site, taking into consideration nature reserves on or 
near the site, protecting plant and animal species on the site and removing invasive plant species on or near the site. 
External experts will be engaged to provide expert advice when appropriate. 
With its focus on gateway cities in Asia, most CapitaLand projects and properties are located in urban and built-
up areas. There are no sites located within protected areas and no material biodiversity risk identified. Instead, 
CapitaLand encourages greenery within its projects as it enhances the liveability of the project for its end-users and 
vitality of the surrounding communities over the long term. For its Funan redevelopment project in Singapore, the 
project will feature a multi-level landscape with the creation of a series of gardens, including urban farms and edible 
gardens. The urban farm aims to showcase sustainable food production with a range of technologies, demonstrating 
the diversity and cyclical relationships of crop production. More than 430 trees were conserved at 13 completed 
projects or projects under development. SBG encourages the use of certified wood and other more sustainable wood 
materials and products, such as composite wood, engineered wood and bamboo. In China, a number of CapitaLand 
residential projects feature composite wood or engineered wood for their interior finishings.  
Some possible concerns to biodiversity include the flow out of waste or toxic materials from construction sites and 
properties. With CapitaLand’s EMS, this flow out (e.g. waste water), if any, is monitored and minimised.

LEED for Existing Building: Operations and Maintenance 
US Green Building Council 
Raffles City Shanghai, China 
Gold Level  
LEED for Existing Building: Operations and Maintenance 
US Green Building Council 
 
Raffles City Shanghai (RCS) is an integrated development that comprises a shopping mall and Grade A office 
which first opened in 2004. Raffles City Beijing (RCB) is an integrated development that comprises a shopping 
mall, Grade A office tower and serviced residences, which opened in 2009. Both operational buildings achieved 
their green building certification, LEED Gold, in 2016. The LEED rating is assessed and awarded not only for 
the enhanced building performance but also property management practices as well.  Prior to this green rating, 
both properties had implemented the CapitaLand EHS Management System which is certified ISO 14001 and 
OHSAS 18001.   
  
Energy Efficiency 
High-albedo (reflective) material was installed on the roof to reduce the solar heat gain. Both properties 
implemented energy efficiency measures including the retrofitting of air-conditioning, lighting and control systems, 
resulting in an 88 points score for RCS’s energy performance based on the US EPA’s Energy Star standard.  
 
RCS also installed a magnetic water treatment system which improved its chiller system efficiency by more than 3%.  
 
Water Efficiency 
Upgrading of water fixtures in toilets resulted in more than 40% savings (24,000 m3) in potable water usage 
(compared to LEED-EBOM baseline). Water meters were installed to measure water consumption for the entire 
building, including sub-metering for irrigation system, cooling towers, boilers, water features, to monitor usage 
and identify water saving potentials.  
 
Overall, the estimated annual utility savings is RMB 360,000 (S$72,000). 
 
Waste Management 
RCB and RCS divert about 69% and 98% (by weight) of their waste from landfills for recycling. In addition, 
RCS recycled 4,000kg of e-waste during its asset enhancement initiative. 
 
Connectivity and Green Transport 
Both properties are well connected to the subway station via multiple subway lines. More than 1,000 bicycle 
lots are provided to encourage green transportation. RCB and RCS have also installed a total of seven electric 
vehicles charging stations.  
 
Stakeholder Engagement 
Tenant surveys were conducted through online platforms to collect feedback on indoor environment quality 
(IEQ) prior to their AEIs. An almost 80% response rate was obtained from RCB and 53% from RCS, and 
overall, more than 80% of the respondents were satisfied with the IEQ. Action was taken on feedback such 
as thermal comfort and incoming sunlight. Communication platforms such as brochures, display panels 
and social media were used to educate occupants and visitors on what they can do to play their part in 
environmental sustainability. This outreach is in line with the World Green Building Council programme on 
“Better Place for People”.

Tracking Our Environmental Results 
CapitaLand Environmental Tracking System 
CapitaLand developed an in-house online Environmental Tracking System (ETS) to better track energy and 
water usage, waste generation and carbon emissions of its managed and owned operational properties. 
These include CapitaLand’s office buildings, shopping malls, serviced residences and integrated 
developments worldwide. 
The management team of each property submits monthly data and uploads supporting documentation online. 
The consolidated data is analysed at the SBU and Group levels against reduction targets. This facilitates a better 
understanding of consumption patterns and identification of areas for eco-efficiency improvements. 
Since 2012, ETS includes the tracking of energy and water usage of CapitaLand development sites as well as 
energy and paper consumption of CapitaLand’s corporate offices in Singapore and overseas. 
Regular desktop audits are conducted to minimise data entry inaccuracies. 
 
CapitaLand Eco-efficiency Commitments 
CapitaLand established long-term and annual targets for the reduction of carbon emissions, energy and water 
usage per m2 in its properties worldwide. As the Group has achieved its 2015 targets and is on track to meet its 
2020 targets, the Group reviewed and set new 2030 targets. It is also looking at setting a science-based carbon 
reduction target. 
 
Long-term targets (using 2008 as base year): 
Reduce carbon emissions intensity by 23% by 2020
• 
9, and 30% by 2030 
Reduce energy intensity by 20% by 2020, and 25% by 2030 
• 
Reduce water intensity by 20% by 2020, and 30% by 2030 
• 
Carbon Emissions 
CapitaLand is committed to address climate change risks through 
the reduction of its energy consumption as well as its other carbon 
emissions in its business operations. It is aware that the building sector 
accounts for around 30-40% of global energy use and more than 30% 
of global CO2 emissions10. Improving energy efficiency represents the 
largest and most cost-effective way to mitigate those emissions.  
CapitaLand’s total carbon emissions11 (Scope 1, 2 and 3) in 2016 is 
555,489 tonnes CO2e. Operational properties12 account for the largest 
proportion of CapitaLand’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions (552,141 tonnes 
CO2e or 99.4% of total carbon emissions) and remains the focus of 
CapitaLand’s energy efficiency initiatives. CapitaLand’s corporate 
offices account for 0.6% of total carbon emissions. 
9	 CapitaLand has a long-term target of achieving 20% in energy reduction per m2 by 2020 (2008 base year). This would translate to an estimated 
carbon emissions intensity of 5.5 kg CO2/m2/month in 2020, a 23% reduction in carbon intensity by 2020 (using 2008 as base year). This assumes 
that the portfolio and energy consumption pattern remains unchanged from 2014 and based on 2014 carbon emission factors.
10	“Buildings for Our Future”, GBPN in partnership with KPMG, 2013.
11	This is computed mostly from purchased electricity consumption under Scope 2, and some direct energy consumption under Scope 1 as defined 
by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol and using individual country CO2 emission factors retrieved from the IEA Statistics – CO2 emission 
factors from fuel combustion 2016 edition. Scope 3 emissions are computed from staff business travel by air.
12	The Group’s portfolio of operational properties increased from 142 in 2008, 167 in 2009, 182 in 2010, 195 in 2011, 210 in 2012, 199 in 2013, 204

Global Sustainability Report 2016
Operational Properties Carbon Emissions Intensity (kgCO2e/m2) 
Despite an increase in absolute carbon emissions due to an expanded property portfolio, CapitaLand continued 
to reduce its carbon emissions intensity13 to 5.3 kg CO2e/m2/month, a 26.2% reduction compared to 2008 intensity 
levels. Compared to baseline intensity levels, a total of 145,400 tonnes of CO2e emissions was avoided in 2016. 
Embodied Carbon – Development Projects 
The carbon emissions from direct and indirect energy consumption at 25 construction projects was approximately 
27,831 tonnes in 2016. 
CapitaLand also aims to minimise its carbon footprint not only through reducing carbon emissions arising from the 
consumption of fuelled energy from its construction and operation activities but also from the embodied carbon in the 
production and distribution of building materials. For three projects in Singapore and two projects in China that were 
completed in 2016, embodied carbon emissions arising from materials usage at these projects was about 1.03 million 
tonnes14 or 1,340 kg/m2. The data collated is based on the entire construction period. 
Energy 
In 2016, the Group’s operational properties’ and corporate offices’ total energy consumption was 1,057 GWh (3.81 
million GJ). Indirect energy consumption accounted for about 88% (3.35 million GJ) and direct energy consumption 
from gas, diesel and other fuels accounted for about 12% (0.46 million GJ15) of total energy consumption. 
CapitaLand’s corporate offices in 11 countries account for 0.3% of the Group’s total energy consumption in 2016. The 
offices consumed 2,685 MWh of electricity, a 31% improvement in the electricity consumption per m2 compared to 
2009. 
25 CapitaLand projects under construction in Singapore, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam consumed about 47,725 MWh 
of energy.  
Operating Properties Energy Intensity (kWh/m2) 
Despite an increase in total energy use due to expansion in its operational portfolio, CapitaLand reduced its energy 
intensity16 measured in kWh per m2 by 18.8% from base year 2008. Using a ‘Business as Usual’ (BAU17) approach, 
it is estimated that more than 432,000 MWh of energy consumption was avoided, resulting in an estimated cost 
avoidance of S$100 million since 2009. 
The reduction in energy intensity or energy usage per m2 is computed at the property and SBU level. The reduction 
targets are KPIs for the property managers and the SBU CEOs. 
CapitaLand is on track to achieving its 2020 energy intensity reduction target. The Group continues to implement 
various energy conservation measures, some of which are listed below. It also focuses on innovation to reduce 
energy consumption. 
13	Computation of carbon emissions intensity excludes new properties which have been in operation for less than 12 months, properties undergoing 
asset enhancement initiatives (AEI) and corporate offices. The number of properties are 127, 145, 152, 174, 189, 175, 191, 174 and 178 for the 
period from 2008-2016 respectively.
14	The materials are concrete, cement, sand and aggregate, steel, bricks, aluminum, glass, paint, ceramic tiles and granite. Densities and 
coefficients used for computation of the embodied carbon emissions of these materials are obtained from the Inventory of Carbon & Energy (ICE) 
Version 2.0.
15	Direct energy consumption from gas, diesel and other fuels (gasoline) are approximately 424,875 GJ, 24,488 GJ and 12,012 GJ respectively.
16	Computation of energy intensity excludes new properties which have been in operation for less than 12 months, properties undergoing asset 
enhancement initiatives (AEI) and corporate offices. The number of properties are 127, 145, 152, 174, 189, 175, 191, 174 and 178 for the period 
from 2008-2016 respectively.
17	The assumption is that energy consumption in subsequent years will continue at 2008 levels (base year) unless energy improvement measures 
are adopted.

A strategic approach to water management and quality enhances the efficiency, resilience and long term value of 
the Group’s portfolio. CapitaLand is committed to reducing water consumption, reusing water and preventing water 
pollution, especially in countries where the availability of clean water and sanitation are of concern. A regular survey 
was conducted to better understand water source and discharge for each property. Almost all of CapitaLand’s 
operational properties’ water consumption is derived from municipal supplies18. 
In 2016, the Group’s operating properties’ total water consumption was about 10.4 million m3.19 This includes the use 
of 1.1 million m3 of recycled water20 and collected rainwater. 
CapitaLand recognises the importance of effectively managing water consumption and the quality of water run-off 
leaving its project sites and requires its main contractors appointed to be ISO 14001 certified and monitor the waste 
water discharge into watercourse or sewer. 25 CapitaLand projects under construction in Singapore, China, Malaysia 
and Vietnam consumed about 1.1 million m3 of water. At its Singapore development sites, waste water is generally 
recycled and reused for vehicular washing. 
Operating Properties Water Intensity (m3/m2) 
The increase in water consumption is largely attributed to the expansion of the Group’s property portfolio, as well as 
increased activities carried out in the properties and weather conditions. CapitaLand reduced its water intensity21 
measured in m3/m2 by 21.8% from baseline year 2008. The slight increase in water intensity from 2015 was mainly 
18	Two properties extract groundwater mainly for emergency and non-potable use. One property extracts groundwater for potable use with the 
appropriate treatment system in place. Meters are installed to monitor water usage.
19	This includes 2,882 m3 of water consumed mostly for drinking and washing of cups at the CapitaLand corporate offices.
20	Mostly NEWater, treated waste water produced by PUB, the national water agency of Singapore, which has been further purified using advanced 
membrane technologies and ultraviolet disinfection.
21	Computation of water intensity excludes new properties which have been in operation for less than 12 months, properties undergoing asset 
enhancement programmes and corporate offices. The numbers of properties are 123, 141, 148, 169, 186, 172, 188,171 and 175 for the period 
from 2008-2016 respectively.

due to increase in occupancy and human traffic at its properties. The reduction in water usage per square metre is

Waste Management 
Waste Recycled 
CapitaLand aims to manage waste at its properties responsibly. As waste generated at its operational properties is mostly 
from its tenants, residents and the general public, CapitaLand engages its stakeholders through various means to minimise 
and recycle waste. Recycling bins are made available at its properties for its tenants, shoppers and serviced residents. 
CapitaLand implements waste management strategies as part of its EMS. However, data in certain countries and 
properties is not readily available or cannot be consolidated due to local supply chain issues. In 2016, more than 
4,700 tonnes of recyclable waste22 was collected from 100 properties in 15 countries. This includes 7,033 kg of 
e-waste collected at Singapore office buildings. 
CapitaLand launched an e-waste collection and recycling initiative at eight of its office properties in Singapore. 
The initiative aimed to encourage tenants to safely dispose and recycle their personal and corporate e-waste. 
During the collection period from 15 August to 31 December 2016, the total amount of e-waste collected was 7,033 
kg. CapitaLand plans to continue the initiative in 2017. CapitaLand also partnered with StarHub to roll out e-waste 
recycling bins at 10 of its malls in Singapore to encourage shoppers and tenants to adopt e-waste recycling.
  
Paper Conservation in CapitaLand Corporate Offices 
CapitaLand reduced its paper usage by more than 56% per employee compared to 2009. These savings are 
attributable to the conscious effort by every employee to reduce paper usage. In 2016 almost 16 tonnes of used 
paper were collected from its corporate offices for recycling. 
Paper accounts for the main stream of waste generated from CapitaLand corporate offices. To reduce paper usage, 
CapitaLand has established a systematic paper management and recycling programme. This includes default settings 
for double-sided and black and white printing, encouraging the use of e-mails, e-fax and promoting a “think before you 
print/copy” attitude to encourage employees to use less paper. Recycling bins (including secured bins) are conveniently 
located at corporate offices to encourage employees to recycle used paper. Work processes are increasingly made 
available online to avoid paper consumption, e.g. CapitaLand implemented the Human Resource e-Letters initiatives 
across various SBUs in Singapore, Malaysia, and China since 2014. The e-Letters initiative enables employees to view 
their Annual Increment, bonus, and Restricted Cash Plan letters online. Corporate offices in Singapore implemented 
“Follow-me” printing to track paper usage more effectively and minimise wastage. 
22	Whilst recycling facilities are made available at CapitaLand properties, not all public waste collectors are able to furnish the recycled waste collected 
in weight as requested for reporting purposes. In 2016, about 78,300 tonnes of non-recyclable waste was generated at 134 properties in Singapore, 
China, rest of Asia and Europe. These included integrated developments, shopping malls, serviced residences, and office buildings.

CapitaLand actively promotes the use of environmentally-friendly paper. In Singapore, letterheads and name cards 
have been printed on recycled paper since 2011. CapitaLand annual reports were printed with recycled paper 
from 2006 to 2010 and with Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) paper from 2011. Biodegradable soy-based ink from 
renewable resources is used to print the annual report. 
Resource Management at Development Projects 
CapitaLand requires its main contractors to implement proper waste management procedures to minimise 
construction waste, properly manage and dispose the waste generated. An estimated 5,700 tonnes of construction 
waste was recorded for four development projects in Singapore in 2016. For its China development projects targeting 
LEED certification, the projects have set a target of at least 75% of construction waste to be diverted from landfill. 
CapitaLand continues to build up capacity to leverage Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology to improve 
the design and construction process through more integrated project coordination. BIM can perform clash detection 
before construction, identifying situations where mechanical and electrical pipes will clash with structural members. 
This detection saves time and cost of remedial work and minimises material wastage. BIM is implemented in 12 
projects under development in Singapore, China and Vietnam. 
 
Green Transport 
As of end 2016, CapitaLand has installed over 80 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in 30 CapitaLand 
managed properties in Singapore, China, Belgium, Germany and Japan. The total electricity charged at these 
stations exceeded 130 MWh (estimated travel distance of more than 613,000 km23) in 2016. 
Over 90% of CapitaLand properties24 worldwide are conveniently located in close proximity to transport hubs 
such as bus-stops and train/subway stations. This allows easy access to the surrounding communities and 
facilities. Free shuttle bus services to transport hubs are made available at some of its shopping malls. 
Bicycle parking facilities are also available at close to 100 of its properties. In Singapore, there are more than 
500 bicycle lots in its 15 office buildings and shopping malls, with around 180 of these in the Civic District 
and CBD to cater to tenants and employees who want to cycle to work. Shower facilities are also available in 
CapitaLand’s own headquarters in Capital Tower for staff who cycle to work. There are more than 7,000 bicycle 
lots in its overseas office buildings and shopping malls.  
In support of Singapore’s move towards a car-lite society and to promote healthy living, Funan will offer full 
amenities and end-of-trip facilities for cycling enthusiasts. Funan’s proposed streetscape on its ground floor 
features multiple access points and gentle slopes, which will make it easy for cyclists and pedestrians alike to 
enter the building.

Top Management Commitment and Staff Involvement 
CapitaLand champions OHS with top management commitment and staff participation through an integrated 
Environmental Health and Safety Management System (EHSMS) and stakeholder engagement activities. CEOs are 
accountable for the OHS performance of their strategic business units (SBUs). Please refer to the management 
structure and EHSMS in the Environmental Capital chapter of this report. 
 
All staff assume personal responsibility towards OHS and are encouraged to be forthcoming in reporting all OHS-related 
incidents, including non-compliances and non-conformities to the relevant business unit management representatives. 
This list is updated in the CapitaLand intranet. 
 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Tied to Remuneration 
CapitaLand incorporates OHS KPIs which are linked to remuneration of all staff, including top management. 
 
Robust OHS Management System 
CapitaLand’s approach to health and safety is guided by its OHS Management System. Established in Singapore in 
2009, it extends to Australia, Belgium, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Spain, 
Thailand, Vietnam and the United Kingdom (UK). CapitaLand’s EHS policy outlines the company’s commitment to 
manage OHS issues. Please refer to the EHS policy outlined in the Environmental Capital chapter of this report. 
 
Certified to International Standards 
The OHS Management System has been externally audited by a third-party accredited certification body to OHSAS 
18001 standards, a recognised international standard for OHS Management Systems. 
 
Since 2012, the Group achieved OHSAS 18001 certification for its OHS Management System in 15 countries1 – covering 
all markets with investment properties. This encompasses all business functions: property management, property 
development, corporate management and operations. 
 
Global Internal and External Audits 
CapitaLand has put in place an internal audit system to ensure that the conformance and effective implementation of its 
OHS Management System is aligned with OHSAS 18001 standards. Internal audits are conducted in all 15 countries 
where CapitaLand has investment properties at least once a year, covering at least 50% of the sites in each country. 
In addition, external audits are conducted annually by a third-party accredited certification body. 
 
An annual audit of the OHS Management System provides assurance to top management and external investors that 
it is legally compliant and aligned with the company’s best practices. 
 
Compliance 
Legal requirements are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and compliance to these requirements are evaluated annually. 
 
Risk Management of OHS Hazards 
Identifying OHS hazards and assessing their risks are a key component in CapitaLand’s OHS Management System. 
CapitaLand strives to eliminate or minimise such hazards and risks though various measures.

Hazards Identification and Risk Assessments (HIRA) are reviewed annually or when appropriate, for example, following 
a change in processes. 
 
OHS hazards are identified for the administration, development and operational functions of CapitaLand’s businesses 
and their risks are assessed. Examples of hazards include ergonomics, falling from height, falling objects and working 
in an enclosed space. The SBUs have put in place various SOPs to minimise the occurrence of such hazards. 
 
Training and Awareness 
To facilitate the effective implementation of its OHS Management System, training and awareness programmes are 
planned for all staff. Please refer to the Environmental Capital chapter of this report for more details on EHS training 
programmes. In addition, every employee was briefed on how to respond to OHS incidents at the workplace. And 
as part of staff well-being, CapitaLand regularly organises lunchtime talks relating to health and related issues like 
parenting to help manage stress for staff.  It also organises financial resilience talks such was financial planning 
where over 100 staff attended. Some of the abridged material is made available on the CapitaLand intranet for the 
staff to access in their own time. 
 
Measures to Mitigate Risks of Serious Diseases 
CapitaLand responds to the threat of serious diseases in a timely manner by putting in place appropriate measures 
to mitigate risks. When necessary, the human resource department disseminates medical and travel advisories to all 
staff. Information on pandemic planning is made readily available for all staff on the staff intranet.

Staff Wellness 
CapitaLand aims to provide a work environment that is safe and contributes to the general well-being of its employees. 
 
In Singapore, CapitaLand implemented a Total Well-Being Programme to promote staff health and well-being. It included 
an annual free on-site health screening (optional test packages were included to provide more comprehensive coverage). 
Staff health screening results were benchmarked against national statistics and trended. High total cholesterol indicator 
worsened compared to the year before but was better than the national average, whilst weight management remains an 
area of concern. Regular exercise sessions, e.g. yoga and Zumba classes, continued to be organised to promote an 
active lifestyle. Tips on healthy living and exercise were updated on the CapitaLand intranet. 
 
OHS Stakeholder Engagement* 
CapitaLand understands the important role that end-users of its buildings and its supply chain play. It actively involves

National Policy Making 
CapitaLand participates actively in national efforts towards workplace health and safety. In Singapore, this included 
being a member of the Workplace Safety and Health Council (Construction and Landscape) Committee. 
 
Tenants and Community 
As part of CapitaLand’s OHS Management System, emergency response procedures are in place for potential 
OHS risks. Periodic briefings and annual evacuation drills are conducted to ensure that tenants are familiar with the 
response plan. 
 
In China, CapitaLand collaborated with 90 local fire departments, government agencies and associations to organise 
fire drills at 45 malls to raise safety awareness among more than 14,000 participants including tenants and shoppers. 
This included live fire extinguishing session, involvement of local fire departments, simulation of fire and evacuation. 
This was well-received by the local authorities.  
 
Supply Chain Management 
CapitaLand works closely with its contractors and suppliers who are committed to high quality, environmental, health 
and safety standards. Contractors are only appointed for its projects upon meeting the Group’s stringent selection 
criteria, one of which is safety. 
 
CapitaLand is also looking into establishing a Suppliers’ Code of Conduct for its business operations, to influence its 
suppliers to operate responsibly, improve energy and water consumption efficiency and reduce overall emissions. 
The Suppliers’ Code of Conduct aims to set out the Company’s requirements of its contractors in the areas of legal 
compliance, anti-corruption, human rights, health and safety, as well as environmental management. 
 
Vendors and Service Providers 
For building operations, CapitaLand’s contractor management guidelines require all contractors to comply with local 
government and other legal requirements. Contractors and service providers in Singapore and overseas are required 
to submit a copy of their risk assessments in cases where their activities may affect the occupational health and safety 
of CapitaLand employees or visitors. 
 
Vendors and service providers are sent a copy of CapitaLand’s EHS Policy. They have to ensure that their staff 
are sufficiently trained or briefed on environmental, health and safety measures. Contractor house rules stipulate 
requirements such as deploying personal protective equipment, reporting of accidents and proper disposal of debris 
and toxic waste. 
 
Since 2012, CapitaLand offices in Singapore only appoint bizSAFE5 Level 3 and above certified vendors and service 
providers upon contract renewal or signing of new contracts. Where possible, CapitaLand intends to stipulate similar 
requirements for its overseas offices. In 2016, more than 94% of its Singapore corporate offices’ and operating 
properties’ vendors and service providers6 were bizSAFE Level 3 and above certified. 
 
Main Contractors 
CapitaLand requires main contractors appointed for its development projects to be OHSAS 18001 certified or to 
engage an independent accredited assessor to conduct site OHS legal compliance audits. All six main contractors 
appointed in 2016 fulfilled these requirements. 
5	 The bizSAFE programme is advocated by the WSH Council in Singapore to promote workplace safety and health in small and medium 
enterprises. There are five levels.
6	 This refers to term contractors/service providers where their work is on-site at CapitaLand properties or offices.

CapitaLand also tracked the health and safety performance of its main contractors at its worksites in Singapore 
and overseas. 
CapitaLand undertook various initiatives to improve the Accident Frequency Rate7 (AFR) and Accident Severity Rate8 
(ASR) of its main contractors at its sites. In 2016, CapitaLand worsened its AFR at its Singapore construction sites, 
registering 0.7 cases for every million man-hours worked, which is lower when compared with Singapore national 
average of 1.7 for the same period. Whilst the ASR worsened to 63.6 man-days lost per million man-hours worked, this 
is still significantly lower than Singapore national average of 159 man-days lost in 2016. 
 
Despite best efforts to ensure site safety, there were three fatalities of CapitaLand’s contractor staff in China. Appropriate 
actions were taken against the contractor. Lessons from the fatality incidents were shared across business units, and the 
Group’s commitment to strengthen its safety standards was reinforced.  
CapitaLand strongly encourages its main contractors in Singapore to apply for the WSH SHARP9 awards and for 
overseas main contractors to target performance and apply for local safety awards.

CapitaLand has an integrated human capital strategy to recruit, develop and motivate employees. KPIs, both for the 
business as well as for people development, are in place to ensure that employees’ performance goals are aligned 
with the Group’s business objectives. Employees are provided with appropriate development opportunities to perform 
well in their job. 
 
CapitaLand was voted winner for the Property and Real Estate Sector, Randstad Award 2016. The Randstad Awards11 
are based on the results of the largest employment survey of employer branding research in 25 countries globally. 
 
Anti-child Labour and Anti-forced Labour 
With a global workforce of more than 12,700 employees, CapitaLand is committed to be a workplace of choice for its 
employees. 
 
CapitaLand upholds the spirit of international human rights conventions, such as the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions, against coerced labour and discrimination in 
any form. To date, Singapore has ratified 20 ILO Conventions covering four key areas of employment standards: child 
labour, forced labour, collective bargaining, and equal remuneration. CapitaLand has aligned its policies with these 
four key areas in Singapore and overseas. This includes the signing of the Employers Pledge for Fair Employment 
Practices with The Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP12) and a commitment to the five key 
principles of fair employment as follows: 
Recruit and select employees based on merit, such as skills, experience and ability, regardless of age, race, 
• 
gender, religion or family status. 
Treat employees fairly and with respect and implement progressive human resource management systems. 
• 
Provide employees with equal opportunities for training and development based on their strengths and needs, 
• 
to help them achieve their full potential. 
Reward employees fairly based on their ability, performance, contribution and experience. 
• 
Abide by labour laws and adopt Tripartite Guidelines which promote fair employment practices. 
• 
In 2016, there was no reported incident relating to discrimination, child labour or forced labour in CapitaLand.
 
Promoting Fairness and Diversity 
As an international company, CapitaLand embraces diversity in various aspects including different cultures, nationalities 
and languages. There are more than 80 nationalities working within the Group. CapitaLand believes that regardless of 
ethnicity, age or gender, employees can make a significant contribution based on their talent, expertise and experience. 
CapitaLand propagates a localisation strategy for its overseas operations. This ensures that the teams on the ground 
have a good grasp of local socio-political and cultural sensitivities to help deliver targeted business outcomes for the 
Group. In 2016, locals accounted for about 83% of the employees based in Singapore and 98% of employees based in 
China. Of these locals, 40% were holding managerial and senior management positions in Singapore and 14% in China.  
CapitaLand identifies talent internally and externally to build bench strength as well as talent pipeline for leadership 
succession planning. CapitaLand recruits talent through a network of local and overseas universities, and also 
attracts young talent early through scholarship programmes such as the CapitaLand-Building and Construction 
Authority Singapore Scholarship. Apart from fresh graduates, CapitaLand also employs experienced and mid-career 
professionals as well as industry veterans. New hires represented 23% of the total headcount in 201613. 
11	In Singapore, 5,000 employees and job-seekers between the ages of 18-65 were surveyed. These respondents were asked to identify companies 
they recognize and indicate if they would like to work for them. This is then followed up with an evaluation of attractiveness factors, such as 
salary, benefits, work atmosphere and job content, for each of the companies.
12	The Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) was formed in May 2006 to promote non-discriminatory employment practices and 
to shift mindset among employers, employees and the general public towards fair employment practices for all workers in Singapore. Members 
include employer representatives, union leaders and government officials.

The gender pay gap is between 2-21% for male and females with no clear trend of gender gap at all levels except 
senior management which was at 21% variance. An analysis of comparable roles showed that CapitaLand rewards 
men and women fairly for similar work and that the gap reflects the lower representation of women at senior levels 
within the organization. 
Re-employment Opportunities 
The Singapore government implemented the reemployment legislation in 2012 to enable more people to work beyond 
the current statutory retirement age of 62, up to 65 in the first instance and subsequently, up to 67 years old. Before 
the legislation, CapitaLand already had a reemployment policy of extending employment to employees who have 
reached the mandatory retirement age but are still able and willing to continue contributing to CapitaLand. The 
reemployment will continue at full pay, although it is permissible by the law to reduce pay upon reemployment as 
more companies move away from seniority-based wage system for reemployed workers. This policy is applicable to 
all staff globally. In 2016, a total of 107 staff were above retirement age15. 
 
Respect for Freedom of Association 
CapitaLand is committed to maintaining harmonious labour relations. It respects all employees’ right to freedom 
of association and the right to be members of trade unions. In Singapore, CapitaLand is guided by the Industrial 
Relations Act that allows representation of staff by trade unions for collective bargaining, thus providing them with an 
avenue to seek redress for any industrial disputes. CapitaLand and the union enjoy a cordial working relationship, 
promoting positive working conditions and improving productivity for the mutual benefit of employees and the 
company. Currently, 40% of the bargainable workforce and junior executives in Singapore are union members. 
Globally, 12% of its workforce is covered by collective agreements*. During the year, the union did not express any 
concerns on employee health and safety issues as the OHS management system is externally audited. 
 
Talent Management 
CapitaLand seeks innovative, dynamic and talented employees to take the company into its next phase of growth. 
It also adopts a multi-pronged approach to manpower planning, i.e. developing internal talent and hiring young 
talent, mid-career and industry veterans. CapitaLand continuously builds its management bench strength through 
the identification of high potential talent as part of the regular succession planning process. Talent management 
decisions are driven by a set of organisational core competencies as well as position-specific competencies. 
CapitaLand’s performance management and talent development programmes provide developmental opportunities 
to nurture employees’ capability and personal traits, underpinned by its core values, through formal classroom 
trainings, on-the-job exposure, job rotation and mentoring/coaching.

CapitaLand Limited
Global Sustainability Report 2016
Human Capital 
The Board’s Executive Resource and Compensation Committee (ERCC) regularly reviews the succession plans for the 
key positions in the company including President & Group CEO and other key management personnel in CapitaLand. 
On an annual basis, CapitaLand identifies and reviews suitably qualified candidates from both within and outside of the 
Group who could be considered for key positions when the need arises in the immediate, medium, or longer term. 
 
Positive Work Environment 
CapitaLand recognises that a positive work environment is essential to attract, motivate and retain talent. A total well-
being programme has been put in place to promote personal development, health and work-life harmony. Initiatives 
include a flexible medical and benefits plan, flexible work arrangements, employee engagement initiatives and 
subsidised rates for employees staying at Ascott’s serviced residences. Part-time employees are entitled to the same 
benefits on a pro-rata basis. CapitaLand advocates a pay-for-performance philosophy to drive ownership of collective 
goals, leading to a high performance culture which creates long-term shareholder value. Its robust performance 
management system ensures that all employees receive regular performance and career development reviews. 
In 2016, 435 eligible female employees went on maternity leave and 322 returned to work. CapitaLand also provides 
paid paternity leave to all male employees in Singapore and countries where practicable. 163 eligible male employees 
took paternity leave. In Singapore, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is a comprehensive social security savings plan 
introduced by the Singapore government to enforce savings by salaried workers to help CPF members work towards a 
secure retirement. Under the CPF scheme, CapitaLand and its employees make monthly contributions to the employees’ 
CPF account in accordance with the prevailing regulations. 
Apart from complying with Singapore’s statutory requirements on making monthly contributions to employees’ CPF 
accounts, the Group also adheres to the respective social security contribution or pension plan obligations of the 
countries it operates in. 
 
Fair Remuneration 
All staff sign employment contracts with clear terms and conditions and their progress are subject to a formal annual 
performance assessment. 
 
To ensure that CapitaLand remains competitive and continues to attract and retain the right talent, the Group engages 
external consultants to benchmark the company’s compensation packages against different markets. All regular 
full-time employees undergo an annual performance review where there is an open discussion on the employee’s 
performance, areas for improvement, developmental needs and career planning. 
 
The Group rewards and motivates employees with comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits 
programmes. CapitaLand’s compensation packages, which include short-term cash bonuses and long-term equity- 
based reward plans, are benchmarked against different geographical markets and industries to ensure competitiveness. 
The performance based Restricted Share Plan (RSP) is an attractive long-term incentive offered to employees of 
managerial grades to provide them with a personal stake in the Group, contingent on achieving performance targets. 
This better aligns employee and shareholder interests to deliver business results. For non-managerial grade employees, 
an equivalent Restricted Cash Plan (RCP) gives equivalent cash awards when business targets are met. The incentive 
pool is funded by the Group’s profitability and economic value added (EVA) performance, to award employees based 
on their job responsibilities and individual work performance.  
 
Regular benchmarking against different geographical markets and industries, as well as innovation in compensation 
strategies ensures CapitaLand remains competitive and continues to attract and retain talent. 
 
The remuneration of key management executives is also tied to a set of key performance indicators including their 
efforts in building the management bench strength and in the development of talent.

partners, Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). 
 
These guidelines also suggest various arrangements such as providing company retraining programmes for workers, 
redeployment of workers to alternative areas of work, implementing, flexible work arrangements, and managing wage 
costs through a flexible wage system.

series of fireside chats providing an informal learning platform where industry experts are invited to share insights on 
topics and trends related to our business, especially developments in the global tech scene.  By organising these 
casual discussions, the company hopes to inculcate a spirit of lifelong learning and help equip employees with the 
knowhow to navigate a constantly changing world with topics ranging from mobile payments, change management, 
digital realities to the office of the future. Staff located outside of the venue could join the session via private streaming. ​
Other training organized by the CapitaLand training arm included analytics, change management and diversity 
related training. Over 960 employees invested over 3,600 hours attending these sessions in 2016.

Human Capital 
Staff Engagement* 
CapitaLand actively engages its employees through various avenues, including regular communication sessions held 
by senior management for effective flow of information and alignment of business goals and objectives across all 
levels of workforce. 
 
Quarterly staff communication sessions by the President & Group CEO allow the Group’s senior management team 
to communicate and interact with staff. These sessions are webcast live to CapitaLand offices in Singapore and 
overseas. During these staff communication sessions, information on the Group’s results and key business focus are 
shared with employees. These sessions include a question and answer session, where employees can pose and vote 
on questions via an online platform, via email, or in person. 
 
CapitaLand practises an open-door policy, allowing all employees to obtain a fair review and a prompt response to 
problems or concerns relating to any aspects of employment with the Group. This includes harassment, grievance 
handling and whistle blowing policies applicable to all employees. Staff members can also raise their concerns to a 
higher level of management or the Human Resource Department. 
 
Information such as employment terms, benefits and practices, Ethics and Code of Business Conduct is made 
available to all employees through CapitaLand’s intranet portal iHub. 
 
Since the 2015 global Employee Engagement Survey21 (EES), 169 focus group meetings were organised across 18 
countries and various follow up actions were taken. 
Innovation 
CapitaLand encourages a collaborative, innovative and entrepreneurial culture within the company. It created 
platforms for staff to make suggestions and organised training programmes to encourage employees to think 
differently and to be innovative. 
 
In 2016, CapitaLand organised regular evening sharing sessions featuring speakers from within the company, as well 
as industry experts, to share their experiences on game changing trends and innovation. These were attended by 
over 560 staff who invested over 3,000 training hours.  
 
CapitaLand organised the CapitaLand & CNN Future Cities: Asia Forum which brought together a panel of change-
makers from the government, real estate and technology sectors to discuss what it takes to be the builder of 
future cities and the catalysts for change as Asia’s bustling metropolises evolve into smart cities. During the event, 
CapitaLand launched its fully automated artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot on its CapitaStar digital platform.  
  
As sustainability is integral to CapitaLand’s business, it conducted a competition to encourage and identify outstanding 
EHS Innovations within the Group which contribute to the environment and its business. In 2016, six EHS Innovation 
Awards were given out.
21	In 2015, 93% of the Group’s staff in over 20 countries participated in the Group’s third Employee Engagement Survey (EES). Employee engagement 
score increased from 80 points in 2012 to 87 points in 2015 which exceeded the global real estate, property and asset management norm. An 
independent consultancy firm was appointed to administer the survey and to ensure confidentiality in soliciting honest responses from the staff.

Stakeholder Engagement 
Employees 
CapitaLand actively engages its employees through various avenues, including regular communication sessions held 
by senior management for the effective flow of information and alignment of business goals and objectives across all 
levels of workforce. For more details, please refer to staff engagement in the Human Capital chapter. 
 
Customers 
CapitaLand conducts regular resident satisfaction surveys in all its serviced residences and tenant surveys at its 
shopping malls and office buildings. The feedback obtained is reviewed and relevant follow-up actions are taken to 
improve serviced residents’ experience and improve service levels to tenants. 
 
In 2016, tenant surveys were conducted through online platforms to collect feedback on indoor environment quality 
(IEQ) in Raffles City Shanghai and Raffles City Beijing prior to the asset enhancement initiative (AEI) with over 80% of 
the respondents satisfied with the IEQ. Action was taken on feedback such as thermal comfort and incoming sunlight. 
More details can be found in the “Greening of Existing Buildings” case study in Environmental Capital Chapter.  
 
In 2015, CapitaLand conducted its second biennial customer satisfaction survey of its office tenants in Singapore. 
Customers indicated more interest in two value-adding concepts amongst a few concepts proposed in the survey. 
The two concepts were further developed with tenants’ needs in mind and resulted in Just Use, which was launched 
as a pilot project in 2016; and Collective Works Capital Tower, a joint venture between CapitaLand and Collective 
Works to offer coworking spaces. Just Use is an online multi-service offering that aggregates the demands of the 
office community, allowing them convenient access to curated goods and services as well as special bulk discounts. 
Coworking has been evolving and gaining popularity in Singapore. CapitaLand has formed a joint venture with 
Collective Works to establish a coworking space at Capital Tower.  
 
CapitaLand’s serviced apartments subscribe to ReviewPro, a leading provider of online reputation management 
analytics for the hospitality sector. Its Guest Rating Score™ (GRS™) is an independent assessment of the individual 
properties’ quality rating based upon consumer reviews from around the internet. The GRS™ is calculated by 
analysing more than 100 million consumer reviews in 40 languages from more than 100 leading online travel agencies 
and review sites. This allows CapitaLand to benchmark and respond by making the necessary operational and 
service improvements to create a better customer experience for the guests. 
 
A key tenant engagement programme for CapitaLand malls in Singapore was the Biz+ Series. In keeping with the 
digital theme, the 2016 programme focused on helping retailers to bridge the online-to-offline (O2O) gap. Events 
included a CEO Breakfast Roundtable that brought leading retailers together to discuss ways to better connect 
with millennial consumers. A series of seminars was organised with industry experts on topics such as new mobile 
payment modes and digital marketing strategies. The intention is to continue to work closely with retail tenants to 
embrace the latest retail trends and identify innovative opportunities. 
 
Investors and Analysts 
There is an increasing call for more transparency, stakeholder engagement and sustainability reporting. CapitaLand’s 
commitment to sustainability management and reporting has been affirmed by international sustainability performance 
benchmarks such as Dow Jones Sustainability Index and FTSE4Good. 
 
Conveying timely, full, accurate and credible information to our shareholders, investors, analysts and the media is important 
to CapitaLand. This is done through announcements on SGXNET, the CapitaLand website www.capitaland.com and 
other communication channels. Underlying CapitaLand’s investor and analyst communications is its Shareholders’ 
Communications and Investor Relations (IR) policy which is available at http://investor.capitaland.com.

Global Sustainability Report 2016
The IR team maintains regular interaction with shareholders through the Annual General Meeting (AGM), biannual 
media and analyst results briefings as well as meetings and conferences with investors and analysts, roadshows and 
site visits. CapitaLand also organises CapitaLand Investors’ Day events for equity and debt investors. 
 
The Group Communications team engages the media regularly through official announcements and news releases, 
media and analyst briefings, interviews with senior management and many networking events. The team also works 
very closely with the media in its efforts to profile CapitaLand’s management and corporate developments of the 
various business units, as well as its sustainability and corporate social responsibility initiatives. It also leverages on 
social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube to communicate key messages. 
 
In 2016, CapitaLand met over 770 institutional investors and arranged more than 70 visits for investors to CapitaLand 
properties in Singapore, China and Vietnam. CapitaLand hosted a CapitaLand Investors’ Day events with over 60 
investors participating. CapitaLand also held 5 non-deal roadshows in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe, 
China (including Hong Kong) and Thailand. For more information, please refer to CapitaLand Limited Annual Report 
2016, page 55-57. 
 
Supply Chain 
CapitaLand works closely with its contractors and suppliers who are committed to high quality, environmental, health 
and safety standards. Contractors are only appointed for its projects upon meeting the Group’s stringent selection 
criteria, including environment and safety. 
 
For building operations, CapitaLand’s contractor management guidelines require all contractors to comply with local 
government and other legal requirements. Preference is given to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certified companies. 
 
CapitaLand requires main contractors appointed for its development projects to be ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 
certified, or to engage an independent accredited assessor to conduct site EHS legal compliance audits. In line with 
our global commitment to human rights, CapitaLand also inserted a clause in the main contractor specifications to 
ensure no child labour and forced labour at the CapitaLand project sites. 
 
For more information on the performance monitoring, please refer to supply chain segment in the Human Capital 
chapter. 
 
Government Agencies and Regulators 
CapitaLand participates in stakeholder consultations organised by key government agencies so as to furnish 
feedback on proposed regulatory changes that impact the company’s business. This allows CapitaLand to plan 
ahead, in view of the cost of regulatory alignment. Engaging regulators and relevant industry bodies has enabled 
CapitaLand to be aware of industry challenges, placing the company in a better position to leverage on existing and 
future opportunities for growth. 
 
CapitaLand is committed to regulatory compliance. Procedures are in place to ensure that its activities and operations 
comply with existing regulatory requirements through regular monitoring, evaluation and auditing of the CapitaLand 
EHS management systems (for more details, please refer to Environmental Capital chapter). Some of CapitaLand’s 
projects also set new benchmarks in the area of sustainability and innovation through the design and use of 
technologies. More than S$2.5 million was invested in innovative features for three of its projects. 
 
Community/NGOs 
CapitaLand is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and a Gold member of the Global Compact Network 
Singapore. It is also a founding member of the Singapore Green Building Council.

Community Development Investment and Value 
Community development is a key focus of CapitaLand’s sustainability strategy. This has built strong social capital and 
goodwill for CapitaLand in the communities it operates in. It supports various stakeholder engagement activities which 
include environmental sustainability, health and safety, social integration as well as helping underprivileged children.  
Helping Underprivileged Children 
CapitaLand recognises that the long-term success of the company is closely intertwined with the health and prosperity 
of the communities in which it operates. CapitaLand Hope Foundation (CHF), CapitaLand’s philanthropic arm, was 
established in 2005. A registered charity in Singapore, CHF believes in investing in the fundamental needs of education, 
healthcare and shelter of underprivileged children to relieve them of hardship and help them to eventually break 
the poverty cycle. Every year, CapitaLand allocates up to 0.5% of its net profit to CHF and supports its day-to-day 
operations with staff from the various functional departments within the company.  
In 2016, CapitaLand invested more than S$2.4 million through CHF to benefit underprivileged children and over 
S$0.5million in other community development initiatives.  
To measure the impact of CapitaLand’s community development investments in sustained programmes, it referenced the 
impact of the CapitaLand Kids’ Food Fund based on the London Benchmark Group (LBG)1 model for impact assessment. 
 
CapitaLand Kids’ Food Fund, Singapore  
This programme aims to improve food security and nutrition for underprivileged children. In 2016, it was further 
extended to children undergoing medical treatment for specific conditions at the paediatric ward of National 
University Hospital (NUH) through the establishment of CapitaLand-NUHkids Nutrition Fund. This was important 
as Associate Professor Marion Aw, Senior Consultant, NUH, Paediatric Feeding and Nutrition Clinic shared that 
children with chronic illnesses were at risk of stunted physical growth and delays in their cognitive development 
because of their medical condition. 
With the donation of S$50,000 from CHF, the Fund aimed to improve the nutrition of paediatric patients from 
financially challenged background. 32 beneficiaries were supported through the Fund, 12 more than the 
original 20 beneficiaries targeted. About 63% of the beneficiaries have seen an improvement in weight since 
being supported under the programme; out of which, 80% met the optimal weight gain, as advised by NUH. 
10 month old beneficiary Johnny (not his real name) suffered from a congenital heart condition and was 
hospitalised for five months in NUH neonatal intensive care. His medical condition affected his growth, 
stagnating his weight and he was below the 3rd percentile for growth based on his age. Unable to feed orally 
and requiring the use of a feeding pump 24 hours a day for his nutrition, the CapitaLand-NUHkids Nutrition 
Fund paid for the cost of the feeding pump, bags and Johnny’s nutritional feeds and Johnny met the optimal 
weight gain of 26 grams/day within three months. Johnny is currently able to feed normally and continues 
to gain weight. He will continue to receive help till July 2017 and will be seen by the dietitian until his weight 
exceeds the 3rd percentile. 
Three year old Kate (not her real name) was diagnosed with kidney failure at birth and unable to feed orally, 
requiring a feeding tube to meet her nutrition needs. Her elderly grandfather was paying for Kate’s costs of 
medical treatment and he also had to support a family of 10 along with his son. The Fund helped pay for the costs

condition improved tremendously and she exceeded the optimal weight gain of 8.7 grams/day over the four-
month funding period. She will be funded till May 2017, and have her routine medical check-ups with her doctor.

CapitaLand Hope Schools 
New school facilities 
funded by CHF create a 
more conducive learning 
environment, while staying 
in dormitories allow the 
children to focus on their 
studies and foster character 
development. CapitaLand 
Nang Yen Primary Hope 
School was the first Hope 
School funded by CHF in 
Vietnam
CapitaLand Nang Yen Primary Hope School located in Phu Tho Province, one of the most 
impoverished provinces in Vietnam. The original school was built in 1975 with makeshift 
classrooms made from clay and leaves. In 2011, CHF donated VND2.2 billion (about S$ 
140,000) to fund the construction of new school buildings and facilities, including a two-storey 
block with 10 classrooms, a library-cum-reading room, and upgraded equipment for outdoor 
activities for close to 200 pupils from surrounding villages with education from Grade 1 to 5, 
equivalent to that offered by primary schools in Singapore. CapitaLand staff based in Vietnam 
regularly visited the school to better understand the needs of the students and the community.  
 
In 2016, over 50 CapitaLand staff volunteers and senior management embarked on a five-
day volunteer expedition and helped build more toilets and sheltered walkways to cater to the 
growing pupil population, cemented damaged walls, and refurbished the library with more 
shelves, which were filled with books gathered from the local community through a book 
donation drive organised by CapitaLand staff in Vietnam. A series of educational activities, 
including sports sessions, art and craft workshops, and CapitaLand’s signature Little Architect 
Programme, were also organised for the pupils. From the post-volunteer survey conducted 
in March 2016, 100% of the staff volunteers had expressed appreciation for the spirit of 
community development at CapitaLand and will continue to embrace this corporate culture. 
For more information, please watch this video of the 2016 volunteer expedition at https://www.

(SDG 4)
CapitaLand Therapy for 
Children Project 
Support the treatment and 
rehabilitation needs of 
underprivileged children with 
physical disabilities through 
financial assistance
In 2016, 30 underprivileged children with physical disabilities from Sichuan and Shaanxi 
provinces received treatment as part of a continual partnership with China Foundation for 
Poverty Alleviation and China Association of Persons with Physical Disabilities. To date, a 
total of 160 children with physical disabilities have benefitted from CHF’s support and now 
have improved mobility.
(SDG 1)
Advocating Staff Volunteerism  
CapitaLand is a strong advocate of volunteerism and was one of the first companies to formalise three days of Volunteer 
Service Leave (VSL) for its staff. In 2016, over 2,100 staff in CapitaLand properties tapped on this VSL policy to volunteer 
more than 16,000 hours in volunteer activities in Asia and beyond.  In addition, staff also volunteered after office hours as 
CapitaLand encourages its staff to volunteer in their own time – over 210 staff continued to volunteer in CapitaLand 
initiatives during their personal/own time for more than 3,500 hours. The estimated 
salary cost to CapitaLand in 2016 based on VSL taken was over S$200,000.  
In recognition of staff’s social contribution as volunteers, CHF donates S$5002 to 
an approved Institution of a Public Character (IPC) in Singapore or International 
Non-Profit Organisation or RMB1,000 to a China-based children’s charity of the 
staff’s choice when he/she has taken all three days of VSL within the year. 
In 2016, 147 staff qualified for this donation incentive and about S$$60,000 will be 
pledged for donation by CHF in 2017. 
Based on some post-volunteer surveys, more than 87% of staff volunteers feel 
proud working in CapitaLand, and enjoy working in a company with a positive and vibrant corporate culture. For more 
information on CHF, please visit www.capitalandhopefoundation.com. 
2	 The donation must be used to support programmes that align with CHF’s objective of helping underprivileged children aged 16 years and below 
in the areas of education, healthcare and shelter in communities where CapitaLand operates.
3	 The Group calculated its VSL based on leave taken during office hours. Data from previous years have been revised to ensure consistency in 
year on year comparison. *GRI 102-48

Social Integration of CapitaLand Properties 
CapitaLand is committed to building safe, accessible, vibrant and quality real estate developments to enhance the 
lives of its shoppers, tenants, serviced residence guests, homeowners and members of the community. Its social 
integration criteria include: 
Ensuring accessibility in the built environment to people of different age groups and varying mobility; 
• 
Connectivity to public transport, roads, amenities and between buildings; and 
• 
Providing community spaces as public gathering points. 
• 
 
These criteria are integrated into the CapitaLand’s Sustainable Building Guidelines to ensure that they are considered 
from the start of the project development process. Universal Design (UD) considerations ensure that public spaces in 
CapitaLand projects are accessible to users of different age groups and varying abilities. These include: 
Seamless connectivity to the external surroundings, e.g. bus-stops, adjacent buildings, streets and sidewalks; 
• 
Barrier-free access from accessible parking lots/family lots to lift lobbies; 
• 
Sheltered and barrier-free drop-off areas; 
• 
Accessible (handicapped) parking lots, family lots; 
• 
Designated pedestrian lanes in carparks; and 
• 
Amenities such as accessible toilets, lifts and nursing rooms. 
• 
 
CapitaLand champions the UD concept in Singapore. In 2016, CapitaLand obtained four Universal Design Awards 
from Singapore’s Building and Construction Authority (BCA). 
 
The Group’s overseas developments are to comply with local UD / barrier-free codes and guidelines, and are 
encouraged to adopt BCA’s UD Guide in the absence of local codes and guidelines. 
 
More than 70%4 of CapitaLand’s completed and operational properties worldwide met all criteria for social integration. 
 
More than 95% of CapitaLand’s properties worldwide have at least one disability access enabled facility. These 
facilities include accessible alighting and boarding bays, lifts, parking lots and public toilets. Its shopping malls in 
Singapore and Japan are guide-dog friendly. 
 
Over 90% of CapitaLand’s properties worldwide are conveniently located in close proximity to transport hubs such 
as bus-stops and train/subway stations. This allows easy access to the surrounding communities and facilities. Free 
shuttle bus services are also available at some of its shopping malls. Bicycle parking facilities are also provided at 
many of its properties. All CapitaLand integrated developments are well integrated with public transport facilities. 
 
Close to 90% of CapitaLand’s shopping malls, office buildings and integrated developments have atrium event 
spaces and/or children play areas. These provide communal spaces to promote community engagement. Family or 
nursing rooms are a common feature at CapitaLand’s shopping malls. 
 
Almost all CapitaLand residential projects have disability access enabled facilities, including accessible alighting and 
boarding bays, lifts, parking lots and public toilets.

“Building for Tomorrow. Walk 
for Hope” Experiential Charity 
Event 
CHF donated RMB1,000,000 to improve educational and healthcare rehabilitation services 
to hearing-impaired children in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Chengdu. 
CapitaLand organised its second “Building for Tomorrow. Walk for Hope” experiential 
charity event in these five Chinese cities on 16 January 2016 to raise awareness of the 
needs of hearing impaired children.  
Close to 3,500 participants comprising CapitaLand’s senior management and staff, 
community volunteers including members of the public, business associates, local 
government officials and celebrities, undertook so called ‘hardship challenges’ in the 6-8 
kilometres walk. Participants were given headsets to listen to simulated noise recordings 
during the walk and participated in listening games where they had to pick out words and 
phrases amidst the sound interference so that they could empathize the daily challenges 
faced by the hearing-impaired children.

Campaign. It was the ninth year 
that CapitaLand participated in 
the annual global sustainability 
movement to raise awareness 
on climate change and 
encourage individual action.
More than 280 CapitaLand’s properties across Asia and Europe participated in the WWF 
Earth Hour initiative by turning off the façade and non-essential lights through the night on 
19 March 2016 and organised activities with key messages on saving energy and water, 
taking public transport and recycling, beach cleanup, tree planting to engage tenants, 
shoppers, residents and public.

Biz+ Series 2016, a tenant 
engagement programme 
comprising seminars, 
workshops and networking 
sessions, was themed on 
‘‘Bridging the Online-to-Offline 
(O2O) Gap in Retail’
Three seminars were held centred on this theme to help retailers be aware of and identify 
growth opportunities in the evolving consumer retail landscape. Industry experts in new 
mobile payment modes and digital marketing tactics were invited to share insights on how 
retailers can engage customers from the online to the offline space. 
A CEO breakfast roundtable session titled ‘Upsize: Millennial Customers’ was organised 
in September 2016 where leaders of various retail brands came together for a lively 
discussion on ways to adapt to the millennials to secure their business and loyalty as they 
become the upcoming influential group of consumers in the next 15 years.

Global Sustainability Report 2016
Independent Assurance Statement
To the Management and Stakeholders of CapitaLand Limited 
CapitaLand Limited (CapitaLand) engaged Ere-S Pte Ltd (Ere-S) to carry out an independent assurance of 
CapitaLand’s Sustainability Report 2016 (the Report). The engagement took place between March and May 2017. 
Scope  
The assurance encompassed the entire Report and focused on all figures, statements and claims related to 
sustainability during the reporting period January 2016 to December 2016, with the limitations stated below. This 
covers the selected information provided with reference to the GRI Standards disclosures as shown in the Assurance 
column of the Report’s GRI Content Index. A verification on the alignment of the entire Report with the Singapore 
Exchange (SGX)’s new rules on sustainability reporting for listed companies was also included as part of the 
assurance process.  
Limitations 
The assurance did not cover financial data, risk management structures, technical descriptions of buildings, 
equipment and production processes or other information not related to sustainability or already supported by 
existing documents, such as previous CapitaLand Sustainability Reports, which were externally assured by Ere-S, 
CapitaLand’s Annual Report and third-party audits and certifications (e.g. BCA Green Mark, LEED, ISO 14001 and 
OHSAS 18000).  
Ere-S did not check whether all elements provided in the GRI guidance (What to Report) on each indicator had been 
fully reported and whether CapitaLand’s approaches listed in the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) table 
were specifically aligned with the SDGs.  
Type of assurance and criteria 
The assurance engagement was conducted in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) and in line with the requirements of a Type 2 assurance of the AA1000 Assurance 
Standard (AA1000AS 2008).  
AA1000AS consists of evaluating the company’s sustainability framework and processes using the criteria of the 
AA1000 AccountAbility Principles (AA1000APS 2008), namely inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness. AA1000AS 
also requires an evaluation of the quality of the reported sustainability performance information. For this, Ere-S 
employed the reporting principles of the GRI Standards (reliability, accuracy, balance, comparability, timeliness, 
clarity, sustainability context and completeness).  
A moderate level of assurance under AA1000AS was provided for this engagement. A moderate assurance is 
restricted to desktop review, management-level evidence gathering and data verification. 
The verification on SGX’s reporting rules was based on clauses 3 to 6 of the “SGX-ST Listing Rules Practice Note 7.6 
Sustainability Reporting Guide”, which include SGX reporting principles and the required five primary components of 
a report (material ESG factors, policies practices and performance, targets, sustainability reporting framework and 
board statement). 
Responsibility and independence 
This statement represents the independent opinion of Ere-S, whose responsibility was to provide the assurance, 
to express conclusions in relation to the agreed scope and to prepare the assurance report and this assurance 
statement for the management of CapitaLand alone and for no other purpose. The management of CapitaLand was 
responsible for the preparation of the Report and all statements and figures contained within it. Ere-S has not been 
involved in the development of the Report or the disclosed management processes; neither has Ere-S been engaged 
by CapitaLand for other projects. The activities of EreS are independent of CapitaLand and contain no financial 
interest in CapitaLand’s business operations.

63
CapitaLand Limited
Global Sustainability Report 2016
Independent Assurance Statement
Assurance methodology 
The assurance procedures and principles used for this engagement are compliant with ISAE 3000 and were drawn 
from a methodology developed by Ere-S, which consists of the following steps: 
1.	 Identify statements and data sets, which are classified according to the relevant data owners and the type of 
evidence required for the verification process. 
2.	 Carry out interviews with key functional managers and data owners at CapitaLand’s corporate office in Singapore. 
Data verification included the following: 
Enquiring about the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the Report disclosures, including performance 
• 
information, policies, procedures and underlying management systems. 
Requesting evidence of the data sources and explanation of relevant collection and calculation methods to 
• 
substantiate the figures and claims. This includes limited sampling of quantitative data to validate relevant 
sources and other supporting documents. 
Challenging the claims made in the Report and, where possible, confirming the presented evidence, including 
• 
calculation methods, criteria and assumptions, with multiple data owners and other documentation from internal 
and external sources, such as previous CapitaLand sustainability reports. 
3.	 Assess the collected information and provide recommendations for immediate correction where required or for 
future improvement to the Report content.  
For statements on the number (or absence) of complaints, incidents and cases of non-compliance to regulations (GRI 
disclosures 205-3, 307-1, 406-1, 416-2, 417-3, 418-1 and 419-1), Ere-S assessment was essentially based on internal 
documents from CapitaLand’s feedback and reporting systems. 
Findings and observations 
Evaluation of the adherence to AA1000 AccountAbility Principles 
Inclusivity - How the organisation engages with stakeholders and enables their participation in identifying issues and 
finding solutions.  
Multiple platforms for engaging with the company’s key stakeholder were observed throughout the whole company. 
These include diverse surveys, meetings, online channels and use of social media. Employees, customers and 
investors benefit the most from continuous and strong engagement by the company. While collaboration with other 
stakeholder groups tends to be less sustained, it also appeared solid on a project or event-basis.  
Particular engagement with stakeholders was observed during the reporting period in Singapore and included 
interactions with the local union relating to changes affecting staff. There was also evidence of additional effort in 
engaging with first-tier contractors to further strengthen the company’s global sustainable supply chain management. 
 
Materiality - How the organisation recognises issues that are relevant and significant to it and its stakeholders. 
Overall, evidence of regular review of sustainability risks and opportunities, including identification of issues, setting 
targets and assessing performance, was observed at the top levels. These processes belong to CapitaLand’s frameworks 
on enterprise risk management, audit and global sustainability management, which are all overseen by the Board. 
More specifically, evaluation of material issues was also observed through the company’s certified environmental, 
health and safety (EHS) management structure, which provides regular internal and third-party assessments on the 
compliance of the company’s processes and performance to regulations and international standards. Observed 
mechanisms to identify other social-related issues include the above-described engagement channels and internal 
reporting platforms.     
Commitment from top management to recognise and mitigate sustainability issues is also reflected in the environmental 
and social topics found in CapitaLand’s risk register and key performance indicators (KPIs) linked to the remuneration 
of top managers.  


========================================
--- Sayfa 64 (Gerçek Sayfa 66) ---
64
CapitaLand Limited
Global Sustainability Report 2016
Responsiveness - How the organisation responds to stakeholder issues and feedback through decisions, actions, 
performance and communication. 
Response to stakeholders’ concerns during the reporting period was evidenced globally for employees, customers, 
investors and community partners (for philanthropic projects). While actions taken as a result of engagement with 
government agencies, suppliers, unions and industry bodies were mostly observed in Singapore, nothing came to our 
attention to indicate that the response mechanisms would not be equally applied at overseas business units. 
Sharing of information on CapitaLand’s sustainability policies, processes and performance appeared comprehensive, 
timely and ongoing. Key information was made available to all stakeholders through diverse platforms and events, 
such as the company’s website, sustainability report, intranet, newsletters, emails and meetings with relevant staff, 
including senior managers.          
Evaluation of the adherence to the GRI reporting principles (quality of the Report content) 
Overall, the Report presents CapitaLand’s sustainability priorities, processes and performance in a clear and detailed 
way. The scope of the Report is global and reflects the industry value chain and sustainability context. There is evidence 
of CapitaLand’s effort to align its reporting approach with the latest industry practices and reporting requirements, 
specifically regarding the company’s investors and the new SGX rules.  
Compared to previous sustainability reports, the Report is more comprehensive. Additional disclosures include 
information on Sustainable Development Goals alignment, new targets on carbon and water intensity, and new 
performance indicators such as turnover by gender and age, gender pay gap and the number of employees on 
paternity leave.  
Report content is moderately balanced with statements pertaining to work-related injuries and fatalities in the workforce 
and the supply chain, business malpractice incidents and cases of non-compliance, as well as supply chain stop orders 
and fines. 
Data sets and descriptions of the relevant calculation methods provided during the assurance interviews were 
comprehensive and well-structured. In most cases, data sources were generated by the company’s in-house data 
systems, such as the environmental tracking system (ETS) and the HR system, which allow effective assessment 
of the data collection and calculation processes, including formulas, conversion factors and units used to generate 
the reported performance figures.  
The level of reliability and data accuracy was reinforced by the internal desktop audit repeated in 2016 by the reporting 
team to validate data entries from various business units. In addition, Ere-S executed this year a more thorough 
assessment of some data trails, such as the collection of performance figures on construction material used by 
contractors. These additional control procedures provided stronger confidence in the overall level of reliability and 
accuracy of the quantitative performance disclosures found in the Report.  
All figures and statements within the assurance scope could be validated through evidence and clarifications presented 
by the data owners during interview. A few minor inconsistencies, such as unclear statement or missing definition of a 
term, were found during the assessment and subsequently addressed by CapitaLand’s reporting team. 
Evaluation of the adherence to SGX rules on sustainability reporting 
According to Ere-S verification findings, the Report content adheres adequately to SGX sustainability reporting 
principles and rules, including the required five primary components.  
Conclusion 
On the basis of a moderate assurance engagement according to the above-listed criteria, nothing has come to our 
attention that causes us not to believe that, in all material respects, CapitaLand’s Sustainability Report 2016   
–	 provides a credible and fair representation of the organisation’s sustainability profile and application of the 
AA1000 AccountAbility Principles. 
–	 includes statements and figures that achieve an adequate level of reliability and accuracy. 
The assurance findings also provide confidence that the Report has been prepared in accordance with the 
Reporting Principles of GRI Standards and the SGX requirements on sustainability reporting.
