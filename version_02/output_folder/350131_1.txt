3.4  Value Creation
Covestro aims to create sustainable value for all stakeholder groups in the value chain.
Our value added calculation presents the value added we have generated as the company’s contribution 
to the gross national product of the individual country, and shows its distribution during the fiscal year. 
We define value added as the company’s business performance minus its outlays, such as material 
expenses, other expenses or depreciation, amortization and impairment losses. In 2016, the Covestro 
Group’s business performance amounted to €12.0 billion. Value added came to €3.1 billion. The state-
ment of allocation shows that the majority of it benefited the employees, who received €1.9 billion in the 
form of personnel expenses. The stockholders accounted for €0.3 billion of value added, lenders for 
€0.1 billion and the government for €0.4 billion.

4.  Innovation
In 2016, Covestro aligned its corporate strategy even more closely with sustainable development and 
set measurable targets. As a result, our innovation efforts are also guided by our understanding of 
 
sustainable development. By 2025 we intend to spend up to four-fifths of our project R&D expenses on 
development to address the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
Covestro’s understanding of innovation is broad and incorporates product and technology development, 
process engineering, as well as business processes optimization and new business model development. 
An example of customer-centered innovation is evident in the way we support customer order management 
by taking into account external events, such as extreme weather conditions, into our delivery and logistics 
process. In this way, we ensure optimally reliable deliveries and prevent supply bottlenecks for our 
 
customers. 
We optimize our own processes with what are known as functional innovations, such as STRUCTeseTM, 
our energy management system developed in-house, which is used to manage our production facilities 
as energy-efficiently as possible.
Furthermore, we work on innovative business models. We have designed processes including one for 
the textile industry for manufacturing polyurethane-coated fabrics for clothing and shoes, which is 
marketed under the brand name INSQINTM. Thanks to solvent-free processing, INSQINTM greatly simpli-
fies the required occupational safety measures, lowers the risk of environmental pollution, and reduces 
water and energy usage considerably.
2016 saw the start of the commercial production of a new, pentamethylene diisocyanate (PDI)-based 
crosslinker. Its carbon content consists of up to 70% renewable raw materials. Various customers have 
received initial shipments that can now be used to conduct thorough application testing.
Many of our innovation activities focus on partnerships and collaborations with third parties. In 2016, 
we joined the Carbon2Chem project, which aims to use gases from the steelmaking process, including 
CO2, as a feedstock for chemical products. A number of corporations and scientific institutions are 
participating in this project sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. 
Covestro is particularly interested in manufacturing plastics from steel mill gases. In parallel, we already 
use carbon dioxide from chemical industry waste gases to manufacture an important component of 
flexible polyurethane foam. In 2016, the first production facility using this technology began operating 
in Dormagen (Germany).
In 2016, we awarded the Covestro Science Award, a prize recognizing outstanding research in polymer 
science, for the first time. German scientist André Bardow won the award for his pioneering work in life 
cycle analysis, particularly of CO2-containing polymers. Bardow is Chair of Technical Thermodynamics 
at RWTH Aachen University. The prize was awarded as part of the Covestro Science Celebration – a 
theme day we organized at the world’s largest plastics trade fair K 2016 in Düsseldorf, where we invited 
leading scientists to visit our booth. 
In recognition of excellence within the company, we additionally awarded four employees the inaugural 
Covestro Science Medal at K 2016. They succeeded in making specific improvements to the surfaces 
of components made of polycarbonate blends to improve their quality and functionality. Since surface 
quality is extremely important in this segment, this research creates considerable value for Covestro.
 
In order to fully leverage the creativity and wealth of ideas in the company, we promote networking and 
the exchange of information among employees in as many areas as possible. A company-wide idea 
management platform was introduced for this purpose in 2016. Moreover, we set up the Idea.Garden, 
 
a place for casual meetings and discussions among employees, at our company headquarters in 
Leverkusen. It is also open to guests. For instance, a workshop was held for design students in which 
their task was to design functional fashion for physically disabled people from Covestro materials.

5.1  Strategy and Processes
The Human Resources (HR) strategy is derived from Covestro’s company strategy. The HR goals follow 
the corporate goals as well as the corporate values. The overarching goals are set by the Head of HR 
in conjunction with Covestro’s CEO. Based on these, three to five supporting goals related to the in-
dividual tasks are set by each HR department. They are agreed upon with the next level(s) of manage-
ment and documented. Monitoring, instructions and reviews, as well as potentially necessary changes, 
take place in regular meetings between supervisor and employee. 
5.2  Employee Metrics
