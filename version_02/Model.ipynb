Certainly, 2021 did not draw us out of the COVID-19 pandemic as we had  hoped: our economy and communities unfortunately continue to struggle  with the outbreak’s lingering impacts. Our mission to tackle environmental,  social, and political challenges has therefore never been clearer.  I am proud to say that Henkel has taken further bold action in 2021, for  which we were once again recognized by key sustainability ratings.  Despite the challenging environment, we remained resilient and resolute  in our commitment to embed sustainability into the heart of our business.  We advanced commitments to becoming a climate-positive company  by converting the first of many sites to climate-neutral production. We  reduced waste by using more recycled packaging material with help from  partners like Plastic Bank, which turns plastic waste into Social Plastic®  for product packaging. And we elevated sustainable financing by  launching a “Sustainable Finance Framework,” tying company financing  to transparent ESG criteria.  Beyond this, we also reinvigorated our culture by defining a new com- pany purpose: Pioneers at heart for the good of generations. It is built  from our roots and carries our long-standing legacy of innovation,  responsibility, and sustainability into the future. This lies at the center  of Henkel’s strategic framework “Purposeful Growth,” our formula for  success in the current decade. With these achievements in mind, we also spent the last year developing  our sustainability strategy – how can we be faster, bolder, and go further?  We want to drive the sustainability transformation towards a regenerative  planet and thriving communities, acting as a trusted partner to our  stakeholders. We pushed ourselves to define our roadmap beyond our  2025 targets and shape new ambitions for 2030 and beyond.  Looking ahead, we are well prepared: sustainability is deeply anchored  in our business strategy and alive in our purpose. With that foundation,  our sustainable transformation continues – because a true pioneer is never  finished and continuously seeks out the next frontier! On behalf of everyone at Henkel, I would like to thank you for your interest  in our 2021 Sustainability Report.

This spirit is deeply  anchored in our DNA, and it drives our success story of innovation,  responsibility and sustainability into the future. Henkel AG &amp; Co. KGaA is operationally active as well as being the parent  company of the Henkel Group. In this capacity, it is responsible for  defining and pursuing the company’s goals. It is also responsible for the  management, governance and control systems, including risk manage- ment, as well as the allocation of resources. Henkel AG &amp; Co. KGaA   performs its responsibilities within the legal scope afforded to it as part  of the Henkel Group, with the affiliated companies otherwise operating  as legally independent entities. Operational management and control is  the responsibility of the Management Board of Henkel Management AG  in its function as sole Personally Liable Partner. The Management Board  is supported in this by the central corporate functions.  Henkel is organized into three operational business units: Adhesive  Technologies, Beauty Care, and Laundry &amp; Home Care.  Adhesive Technologies offers a broad and globally leading portfolio of  high-impact solutions in adhesives, sealants and functional coatings.  The business unit is composed of four business areas: Automotive &amp;  Metals, Packaging &amp; Consumer Goods, Electronics &amp; Industrials, and  Craftsmen, Construction &amp; Professional.  The Beauty Care business unit is globally active in the consumer goods  business area with hair cosmetics, body care, skin care and oral care  products. It is also active in the professional hair salon business world- wide. We hold leading positions in numerous markets and categories  in both business areas.  The Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit occupies leading market positions  in both its Laundry and Home Care business areas. Our product portfolio  ranges from heavy-duty and specialty detergents, laundry additives,  dishwashing products, hard surface and WC cleaners, to air fresheners  and insect control products.  The business activities of our three business units are supported by the  central functions of Henkel AG &amp; Co. KGaA, our Global Supply Chain  organization and our Global Business Solutions organization, with its  Shared Service Centers. This enables the optimum utilization of corporate  network synergies.  Implementation of the business activities at the country and regional  level is the responsibility of the national affiliated companies. Their  operations are supported and coordinated by regional centers. The   executive bodies of these national affiliates manage their businesses  in line with the relevant statutory regulations, supplemented by their  own articles of association, internal procedural rules and the principles  incorporated in our globally applicable management standards, codes  and guidelines. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  06 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE BUSINESS MODEL VALUE ADDED STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  VALUE ADDED Henkel’s innovative products and solutions create value in its business  units for its stakeholders – across the entire value chain. We operate  174 production sites in 56 countries worldwide, invest in research and  development, maintain close cooperation with our suppliers, and con- tribute to economic development in our target markets. As an employer,  we  create jobs in industrial countries, as well as in emerging and devel- oping economies, and we generate purchasing power through wages  and  salaries. The taxes and levies we pay help to finance communities  and support public infrastructure. Value added statement 2021  The value added statement shows that most of the generated sales flow  back into the global economy. The largest share of the value added –  60.2 percent – went to our employees in the form of salary and pension  benefits. Central and local governments received 9.8 percent in the  form of tax revenues; lenders received 1.6 percent in the form of interest  income. We distributed 13.9 percent of the value added as dividends to  our shareholders. The value added remaining in the company is available  for investments in future growth.

This makes us an important local employer and business partner.  The issue of the social added value of products is especially important in  emerging markets. Products that are geared to the needs of lower income  groups have more than just economic potential. They also make positive  contributions to social well-being, for example to hygiene and health in  the home. In order to meet needs that differ greatly around the world, we  pursue different strategies depending on the market situation.

STRATEGY  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  09  SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY  Responsibility for people, planet and society Our corporate purpose defines the common ground that unites all of us at  Henkel: Pioneers at heart for the good of generations. With our pioneering  spirit, our knowledge, our products and technologies, we want to enrich  and improve the lives of billions every day and shape a viable future for  the next generations. Sustainable business practices have been an integral  part of our    company culture for decades, and are also a central element  of our vision of the future.  Our sustainability strategy is inspired by our purpose. We will actively  drive the transformation to a sustainable economy and society, help to  protect and regenerate the natural environment, contribute to strong  communities and to strengthen trust with our stakeholders. Together with innovation and digitalization, sustainability is at the  heart of our corporate strategy (   “Purposeful Growth” agenda) to shape  competitive edge and enable us to grow our company and create value  for our customers, consumers and all of our stakeholders. Transformation towards sustainable development At Henkel, we see sustainability as a constant endeavor to make progress  on present topics and keep learning about new issues, based on scientific  knowledge. Global climate change is one of the greatest challenges  humanity is facing today, requiring urgent and ambitious action. It is  also critical to protect and regenerate life-support systems like forests,  water and  biodiversity, for present and future generations. At the same  time, we are seeing global poverty and social inequality increase, in part  because of the COVID-19 pandemic. And in the process, we acknowledge  that companies like Henkel play a role in meeting these challenges and  bringing about transformational change.  “ Our corporate purpose  describes our ambition to  act for the good of present  and future generations.   With the help of our new  sustainability strategy, we  will accelerate our trans­ formation and evolve our   portfolio and processes   even more strongly towards  sustainability.” CARSTEN KNOBEL Chair of the Management Board HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  10 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY MATERIAL ISSUES TARGETS AND AMBITIONS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGS TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  This is a collective undertaking. For several years now, our customers,  partners and consumers have expressed an increasing interest in   sustainability-oriented products and solutions. They are looking to  understand and track sustainability contributions along the value chain.  Investors are also placing increasing emphasis on the sustainability of  their investments. The issue of corporate responsibility is gaining further  importance in media reporting, as is the discussion of sustainability  issues on public platforms such as social networks. In addition, at the  political level, we have seen great progress toward a shared understanding  of global priorities over the past few years, most notably the global   climate agreement in Paris in 2015 and the climate summit in Glasgow in  2021, as well as the    17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Global  awareness of issues such as climate change, the circular economy,  human rights, and the management of water and biodiversity are on the  rise. This underscores the urgency of a comprehensive transformation  towards sustainable development.  We will build on our particular strengths, such as the innovation of our  business units, the outstanding knowledge of our employees, as well as  various contact points of our products and technologies with customers  and consumers. We see our company as an important player and partner  in society, and we intend to work with others to create fundamental change. Three dimensions of our strategy Building on our previous strategy, we developed our → 2030+ Sustain- ability Ambition Framework in 2021 encompassing three dimensions:   • Regenerative Planet: We want to enable a circular and net-zero carbon  future by transforming our business, products and raw materials  underpinned by science and innovation.  • Thriving Communities: We want to help people lead a better life  through the collective strength of our business and brands by   supporting equity, education and wellbeing.  • Trusted Partner: We want to drive performance and systems change  with integrity through our values-based culture, deep rooting in science  and our passion for technology. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  11 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY MATERIAL ISSUES TARGETS AND AMBITIONS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGS TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Levers for change We also defined how we aim to make progress across our value chain by  defining three key levers to achieve systemic change:  • Products and technologies are at the heart of everything we do. We  create more value for our customers and consumers by constantly  innovating to offer  better performance with a reduced ecological foot- print.  • People are the focal point for our business and our sustainability-  related activities. This includes our employees, who contribute to   sustainable development – through their expertise in daily work and  in their private lives. It also includes the people in our supply chain,  our  customers and consumers, our neighbors, our shareholders and  the communities we operate in.  • Partnerships play a decisive role in driving sustainability in our value  chain and beyond. We help our customers and consumers to reduce  their ecological footprint and to use resources responsibly. We work  together with our suppliers to promote sustainable practice and  respect for human rights, and we cooperate with partners to share  knowledge and drive systemic solutions forward together. Our targets and ambitions Our new sustainability strategy revolves around implementing our   ambitions through concrete measures and projects to achieve practical  progress. We will build on the success of recent years and our medium-  term targets for 2025 and beyond, → for which we provide detailed  information in this Sustainability Report. With our → 2030+ Sustainability Ambition Framework, we have developed  new long-term ambitions in the three dimensions of → “Regenerative  Planet,” → “Thriving Communities” and → “Trusted Partner” to drive  further progress.  We have robust plans and investments in place to advance on our sustain- ability transformation. We expect to continue to develop our strategic  framework, responding with agility to stakeholder expectations, new  scientific insights and emerging issues.

HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  13 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY MATERIAL ISSUES TARGETS AND AMBITIONS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGS TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  MATERIAL ISSUES  Development of our strategy, targets and  roadmaps for implementation There are numerous challenges and new developments facing society,  and Henkel as a company. These include aspects such as the environment,  employee and social topics, respecting human rights, and combating  corruption and bribery. These topics and others are also reflected in the  international    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For the develop- ment of our sustainability strategy and the definition of the related targets  and ambitions, we engage in dialog with the Management Board and  form working groups that act under the guidance of the → Sustainability  Council. In these groups, we evaluate trends and developments, while  also reviewing the expectations of our stakeholders and analyzing our  environmental footprint along the value chain. Engaging in dialog with stakeholders to gain new perspectives → Dialog with our stakeholders helps us to obtain insights and per- spectives from inside and outside our company, and fosters a common  understanding of expectations and priorities. In 2021, we conducted a  comprehensive survey of our stakeholders. We have also engaged in dialog  with opinion leaders, the professional public, academia, international  rating agencies and analysts for many years. Sustainability analysts and  professional institutions regularly evaluate how companies manage the  economic, environmental and social aspects of their business activities. We  welcome these → external assessments of our sustainability performance,  as they lead to greater transparency in the market and show us how  our performance is assessed. We also consider the assessment criteria  of various financial and sustainability-oriented ratings and the guidelines  of the Global Reporting Initiative (→ GRI). Identifying relevant topics To determine and categorize relevant topics for our business activities  and reporting, we engage in a continuous process of recording and   evaluating the challenges and opportunities of sustainable development  using various tools. We assess the importance of the topics for the   company, environment and society, and also for our stakeholders. When  selecting the topics, we go beyond the definition of materiality included  within the CSR Directive Implementation Act (“CSR-RUG”) in conjunction  with Sections (§§) 289b to 289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB).  The results of this process can be broken down into the three dimensions  of Regenerative Planet, Thriving Communities and Trusted Partner, each  with three themes that we identified in a materiality analysis. In these  nine topic areas, we want to drive sustainable development around the  world and along the value chain with our business activities.

To assess  our footprint, we use representative → life cycle appraisals across all  product categories. We also assess data on the raw materials and packaging  materials we use, as well as the transport operations.  This enables us to identify hot spots as fields of action that are most   relevant to sustainability for the company as well as for every product  category and specific products on the basis of scientific measurement  methods. Viewed across our entire portfolio, improvements in input  materials and in the use phase are the decisive factors when it comes to  our water and → CO2 footprints. We systematically integrate the assessment tools and findings into our  → innovation process. By combining product performance and quality  with responsibility for people and the environment, we strive for all  of our new products to make a contribution to sustainable development. Definition of targets and roadmaps for implementation  Based on this assessment and our priorities, we have set specific targets  for 2025 and beyond as well as additional long-term ambitions that  will help transform the economy and society toward sustainability.  Engagement with our stakeholders and the broader framework of our  strategy, which was further developed in 2021, have also revealed new  areas of focus that we will work on together. Some of these ambitions,  such as those related to → water resources and → biodiversity, are still in  their early stages, and assessment methods are constantly evolving. We  will work with experts and partners to contribute our experience and  develop coordinated action plans. To implement our strategy, we have  also established → management systems, standards and guidelines, as  well as related processes and organizational structures that provide a  framework for measures to implement these concepts. We continuously  review our targets and roadmaps for implementation, and develop them  further when necessary.

As a company, we are convinced that the goals  provide a shared focus that can empower collaborative action and will  accelerate progress toward sustainability. Sustainable consumption,  packaging and plastics, combating climate change, water, human rights,  equal opportunities and education are important topics for our work.  The following examples highlight our contribution to the implemen- tation of the global development goals and demonstrate the range of our  activities.  By continuously reviewing our companyʼs goals and initiatives, we  ensure that these are aligned with the    SDG priorities that are relevant  for us. Our activities support the SDGs because we have a long history  of working intensively on various aspects of sustainability, as well as  a broad product portfolio and a presence across diverse markets. In the  context of our social commitment, for example, we track the percentage  of projects we support that contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Committed to protecting the climate  In view of the urgent need to reduce CO2 emissions, it is our long-term  vision to become → climate-positive in production by 2030 and to make  progress in further relevant parts of our value chain. On the way, we plan  to achieve a 65-percent reduction in the carbon footprint of our production  by 2025. We also want to obtain 100 percent of our electricity from  renewable sources by 2030. In addition, we want to leverage our → brands  and technologies to help our customers, consumers and suppliers save  100 million metric tons of CO2 in the period from 2016 to 2025. Promoting sustainable   consumption We support the goal of promoting sustainable and resource-efficient   consumption. Our products and technologies are key to this because they  are used in millions of households and industrial processes every day. We  focus on developing products that lead to resource efficiency in everyday  use. We also strive to encourage responsible use of our products through  targeted communication. This is important because the environmental  footprint of many of our products is determined during the use phase.  The    Henkel footprint calculator helps individuals to calculate their  CO2 footprint.

Improving quality of life  With our social engagement activities, we aim to support people around  the globe and improve their quality of life. For example, the volunteer  efforts by our employees have provided support for social projects in   Guatemala, in cooperation with the organization    United Way Worldwide.  The focus is on education, financial stability and health. Our → corporate   citizenship has been an integral part of our corporate culture ever since  the  company was established by Fritz Henkel in 1876. Turning waste into opportunities  It is our continuous ambition to reduce the flow of plastic waste into  nature, especially into the oceans. In 2017, Henkel became the first major  global consumer goods company to work with the social enterprise  → Plastic Bank. In 2019, we extended this partnership for another five  years. The aim is to reduce plastic waste in nature, including the oceans,  while also providing new opportunities for people in poverty – especially  in countries with no or insufficient recycling infrastructure for waste   disposal. We plan to steadily expand this commitment in the coming years.  Promoting sustainable   palm oil As part of our responsibility, we aim to support sustainable practices in the  palm oil industry along the entire value chain. By supporting → sustainable  palm (kernel) oil, we contribute to sustainable forest management and  prevent deforestation. Collaboration with representatives from across the  industry is at the heart of our approach. We aim to increase the availability  of sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil on the market, for example,  through collaborative projects that enable → smallholder farmers to certify  their crops as sustainable, increase productivity and improve their livelihoods. Providing access to good education   We aim to promote access to high-quality education and increase the number  of young people and adults with relevant abilities and skills. → Schwarzkopfʼs  Million Chances initiative was launched in 2016 to support women and  girls in building a successful future for themselves. The long- running  project Shaping Futures gives young people the opportunity to gain   professional training in basic hairdressing techniques. Henkel is also the  main sponsor of the → Teach First Deutschland initiative. In this way, we   support the commitment of university graduates who, as additional teachers,  support children in schools in socially disadvantaged  communities.

Henkel systematically anchors → sustainability assessment criteria in  its innovation process to manage product development in line with  our sustainability strategy right from the start. In 2021, we employed  an average of around 2,600 people in research and development, and  invested 504 million euros in these activities.  Sustainability is a central pillar of the innovation strategies of the   Laundry &amp; Home Care and Beauty Care consumer goods businesses.  They place particular focus on developing their product portfolios using  resource-efficient technologies with sustainable packaging solutions  and optimized ingredients, and are driving the expansion of sustainable  brands such as Love Nature,    Pro Nature,    Nature Box or    N.A.E.  (Naturale Antica Erboristeria) with a holistic approach.  Our Adhesive Technologies business unit combines technical material  expertise and science-based innovation to support our industrial   customers and business partners in achieving their sustainability goals.  Customized solutions help to increase energy and material efficiency,  recycle valuable resources and improve safety during the manufacturing  and use phases, as well as for end users. Contribution of our product portfolio to  sustainability  Our business units – Laundry &amp; Home Care, Beauty Care and Adhesive  Technologies – are responsible for adapting our → sustainability strategy  to their operating needs. They align their brands and technologies to  sustainability in line with the specific challenges of their product portfolio.  They also work on sustainable products and tomorrow’s key technologies.  Achieving our ambitious new → targets means integrating sustainability  even more closely into our brand and business strategies in the future. Our goal is to transform our company and our product portfolio sustain- ably so that we can stand at the side of our stakeholders as a reliable  partner. We strive to ensure that each new product contributes to   sustainability. We also intend to provide our customers and consumers  with a comprehensive sustainability profile of our products by 2025.  Our aim is to offer increasingly better solutions, products and services  that also have a positive impact on the environment and society, and  therefore make a positive contribution to value.   504 million euros in  research and  development around 2,600 employees in research   and development HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  24 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Promoting sustainable consumption Our products are used millions of times a day in households and indus- trial processes. This is why we concentrate on developing products that  enable resources such as energy and water to be used efficiently during  everyday life. Our aim is to help our customers and consumers save → CO2  through our products and expertise. Through targeted communication,  we also strive to encourage responsible-minded behavior while using  our products. This is especially important because the use phase accounts  for up to 90 percent of the environmental footprint of many of our  products. The importance of the use phase is also shown in the    Henkel  footprint calculator. It shows that not only companies, but also each  individual can make a contribution to greater sustainability through  their behavior.  To promote sustainable consumption, Henkel partnered with cosmetics  companies Unilever, LVMH, L’Oréal and Natura to establish an    Eco  Beauty Score Consortium in September 2021. The goal is to develop an  industry- wide system for assessing the environmental impact of cosmetic  products to make it easier for consumers to make sustainable shopping  decisions. This approach, which is based on the latest research, is  designed to take into account the entire product life cycle. We also have  plans to create a database of standard cosmetic ingredients and their  environmental impact. up to 90 % of the environmental footprint of our   products is generated during their use Developments in Laundry &amp; Home Care Our clear vision in our Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit is: “Together  Creating a Cleaner World”. We believe that our team, our customers,  and our suppliers have to innovate together to provide better solutions,  products and services – and to create value for consumers and society.  We focus on resource-efficient technologies, innovative    products,  and optimized → packaging and ingredients to maximize cleaning   performance. In 2021, Laundry &amp; Home Care made significant progress in promoting a  circular economy. Our    partnership with Plastic Bank and the use of  Social Plastic® in much of our product packaging contributes to our  commitment to prevent plastic waste in nature while improving living  conditions for people in poverty. The bottle body of the limited edition  Pril dishwashing product is made from 100 percent Social Plastic® and  the bottle cap is now made from 84 percent recycled material. We also  promote the circular economy in the selection of our ingredients. In  partnership with BASF, we have succeeded in transforming vegan bio- mass from agricultural waste into active ingredients, which we use in  our Love Nature laundry and dishwashing detergents.  In addition to the ongoing portfolio transformation and innovation strat- egies in sustainability, Henkel acquired a leading provider of sustainable  homecare solutions,    Swania SAS, based in Nanterre, France, in July  2021. This acquisition expanded Laundry &amp; Home Care’s position in the  market for sustainable laundry and home care products. Our sustainable  brand portfolio now includes strong sustainable brands such as Maison  Verte (   EU Ecolabel certified) and the vegan brand You (   ECOCERT  labeled), which appeals to a young, tech-savvy target audience.

This includes the relaunch of our    Fa brand, with shower product   formulas that consist on average of 94 percent ingredients of natural  origin (including water; calculated according to the ISO standard). All of  the products for men and a large number of the Fa shower products for  women now also have transparent packaging. This optimizes recyclability  and supports the circular economy. The transparent bottle bodies are  made of 100 percent recycled PET (excluding the cap), 25 percent of  which is Social Plastic®. The caps have also been modified and use  10 percent less plastic than before.  While recycling remains an important consideration in terms of sustain- ability, refill solutions are also becoming more important. Refill packs  for products from our ECOCERT-certified natural cosmetics brands     N.A.E. and    Nature Box have been available in stores since 2021. We  also offer refill packs for some Fa shower gel and liquid soap products.  These refill packs hold the contents of two shower gel bottles. The refill  packs can, when disposed of correctly, be recycled. Their manufacture  requires around three-quarters less plastic than bottles of the same  capacity.  Refill packs are just one component of the sustainability commitment of  our hair and body care brand Nature Box. It is the first consumer goods  brand worldwide to use Social Plastic® as a packaging material for its  entire bottle portfolio. All bottle bodies are made of 100 percent recycled  plastic. These liquid products have been supplemented since 2021 by  solid conditioners in recyclable packaging made of FSC-certified paper,  in addition to solid shampoos and shower care products. Nature Box  combines high standards of production and quality with a long-term  sense of responsibility. For this reason, the brand’s team collaborates  with the international development organization    Solidaridad and the  specialty chemicals company Solvay. It supports smallholders in the   sustainable farming of guar and palm kernel oil, both feedstock materials  used to make ingredients found in this product range.  The    Syoss brand is another example of the sustainable transformation  of our product portfolio. Following the comprehensive relaunch of our  hair care lines in 2020, we launched a new generation of hair sprays in  2021. Syoss Compressed Micro Sprays in 200 ml format are only half  the size of conventional products that can be used the same number  of times. This means that less aluminum and propellant gas are used,  reducing the spray’s environmental footprint. The reduced weight and  volume during transport also results in lower CO2 emissions.

We develop customized technological solutions for  this. Even though our products typically make up only a small proportion  of the end product, they can be a relevant factor that help our  customers  achieve their sustainability goals. We analyze the sustainability contribution of our products during  product development and systematically evaluate the contribution  of our existing    portfolio. This transparency has allowed us to anchor   sustainability as an integral part of our strategic orientation while   forming the basis for aligning our business for the challenges of the  future and  identifying the most important levers we can use to con- tribute to solving global challenges.   • Our products conserve resources by promoting the efficient use of  energy and materials. They also help cut emissions in production and  application, for example, by using electrically conductive adhesives  from the    LOCTITE® ABLESTIK range to make solar panels more   productive. These technologies and others can also be found in our  CO2-saving portfolio.   • Our solutions ensure that valuable resources are kept in the cycle. We  do this by using renewable raw materials in production, and by   promoting the reuse and recycling of materials at the end of their life  cycle. For example, we use    LOCTITE® LIOFOL coatings for solutions  that can be fully recycled with paper without affecting the quality of  the recycled material.   • We are committed to continuously optimizing the safety of our  products  while going beyond legal requirements and working actively to  avoid substances of concern. Our    TECHNOMELT® PUR adhesives,  for example, have been developed to contain a particularly low   proportion of isocyanates.  We also strive to use our broad market access to put innovative approaches  into practice across industries: for example, the use of renewable carbon  sources through the mass balance principle. This is a transparent model  for tracking the amount of certified and non-certified material along  the entire production process.

These apply to all employees  worldwide, in all of the business areas and cultural spheres in which  we operate.  The Code of Conduct contains the most important corporate principles  and behavioral rules. It is supplemented by guidelines for dealing with  potential conflicts of interest, which are designed to prevent corruption. The codes and corporate standards specifically address the issues of  compliance with competition and antitrust law, safety, health, environ- mental and social standards, human rights and public affairs. They also  provide the basis for implementing the    UN Global Compact. You can  find the following codes and standards on our    website:   • Purpose, Vision, Mission and Values,   • Code of Conduct,   • Code of Corporate Sustainability,   • Responsible Sourcing Policy,   • Safety, Health, and Environmental (SHE) Standards,   • Social Standards,   • Public Affairs Standard.  Steering sustainable economic activity The implementation of our sustainability strategy is based on globally  uniform codes and standards, integrated management systems, and an  organizational structure with clearly defined responsibilities. Within  Henkel, efficient processes also contribute to environmental protection  and occupational health and safety, while additionally reducing resource  consumption and costs. We use a variety of methods and tools to assess  and manage our corporate sustainability and to measure the progress  that we make toward our objectives across the entire company and our  value chain.  Risk management as a prevention tool Group-wide risk management also makes an indispensable contribution  to our strategic focus on sustainability and enables us to identify potential  risks and business opportunities at an early stage. As part of the non-  financial reporting process, a risk analysis has been conducted in line  with the concepts and processes for risk mitigation that are described  in this report. During this analysis of our own operations, our business  relationships, our products and our services, no material risks were  identified that meet, or will meet, the criteria of “having severe  negative  consequences” and “being very probable” according to the definition  set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of section 289c, as well as section 315c of the  German Commercial Code (HGB).

Sustainability Council  Chaired by Sylvie Nicol, Chief Human Resources Officer, the Sustainability  Council is the central decision-making body for our global sustainability  activities. On behalf of senior management, the committee performs  coordination, initiative and control functions in relation to sustain- ability issues. These include strategic topics as well as issues that are  operationally relevant, such as climate change and its effects, human  rights,  sustainable products and technologies, packaging, product safety  and management systems. The Sustainability Council sets up project  groups to deal with sustainability topics, and monitors the results. It also  handles cross-departmental projects and regularly monitors the extent  to which sustainability targets are met. This includes the progress of  our climate- related corporate targets and initiatives, for example. The Sustainability Council is made up of top managers from all of the   business units and functions of the company. It normally meets six  times a year. In addition, the members take decisions on matters as  required during the year.

Key  sustainability topics for Henkel are coordinated by a specialist  unit that reports directly to the Management Board and which serves as  the  company-wide interface for sustainability. Ulrike Sapiro, Chief   Corporate Sustainability Officer, has been head of this specialist unit  since May 1, 2021.  Management conferences and specialist committees  In addition to the central role of the Sustainability Council and the  interaction between the various units and functions, international   management conferences and the sharing of information in specialist  committees form an important basis for the ongoing development of  Henkel’s  sustainability policy. These meetings deal with new scientific  findings, practical experience, changes in laws and regulations, and  other current topics. The objective is to initiate new projects within  Henkel, as well as to further develop approaches to solving problems  and to encourage employees to share their experiences with one another. Business units  The business units (Adhesive Technologies, Beauty Care and Laundry &amp;  Home Care) are also responsible for adapting our sustainability strategy  to their operating needs, as well as providing the resources needed for  its implementation. They align their brands and technologies, and  the sites involved, to sustainability in line with the specific challenges  and priorities of their product portfolio. The research and development  departments of our three business units work on key technologies and  supply the basis for tomorrow’s sustainable products. Regional and national companies  Managers in the regional and national companies steer the implemen- tation of Henkel standards and compliance with legal requirements in  their respective regions. With the support of the corporate functions and  the operating business units, they develop an implementation strategy  appropriate to the individual sites and their local circumstances.

Footprint across the entire value chain We use representative life cycle appraisals for all product categories to  assess our footprint along the entire value chain. We also assess data  covering the raw ingredients and packaging materials we use, as well as  relevant transport operations. We have assessed more than 99 percent of  our annual sales through life cycle appraisals: more than 67 percent has  been evaluated through representative life cycle analyses and about  32 percent through simplified life cycle appraisals. In this way, we ensure  validated greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting along the value chain.   In preparing life cycle analyses, we use our own primary data as well  as data from our partners along the supply chain. If such data is not  available, we draw on secondary data from existing databases of life cycle  analyses, average values, and emission factors. To further develop metrics  and indicators, we collaborate with external partners on topics such  as product carbon footprints and water footprints. We also participate  in international initiatives such as the    Sustainability Consortium  and the    Consumer Goods Forum’s Measurement Group. We are also  over 99 % of annual sales is covered   through life cycle appraisals Measurement and evaluation over the entire   life cycle  We use a variety of methods and tools to assess our progress across the  entire company and our value chain. We are continuously developing  these methods and tools, which include trend and market analyses, as  well as the evaluation of ratings and life-cycle analyses. In addition to  the achievement of our → sustainability targets, we continuously review  our management processes and optimize them where needed. This  includes measures in the areas of environmental protection and occupa- tional safety, technical developments and process optimization to  reduce resource consumption and costs. These measures are supported  and implemented by our three business units, as well as our regional  and national companies and our corporate functions. Together, they  contribute to the achievement of our sustainability targets. Our innovation process employs a variety of tools to systematically analyze,  measure and evaluate our products. Hot spots can be identified as fields  of action that are most relevant to sustainability for every product category  on the basis of scientific measurement methods. Our researchers have  to identify the points in the value chain and the strategic areas in which  the product offers concrete advantages. Each product receives a separate  sustainability profile based on this data. To make it easier to optimize  our products while they are being developed, we integrate the environ- mental profiles of possible raw ingredients and packaging materials into  the information systems of our product and packaging development  teams. This allows the footprint of a new formulation to be calculated as  early as the development phase. Our three business units also collaborate  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  32 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  involved in standardizing the methodology for calculating footprints and  the associated data exchange for all participants in the automotive value  chain as part of the    “Catena-X Automotive Network”. In addition, we have further developed our “EasyLCA” software tool  for the fast calculation of CO2 footprints for product formulations. This  is a quick way to make the footprint of formulations transparent for  decision-making processes during the product development process.  In order to measure the contribution of individual products to climate  protection, experiments are being carried out worldwide to measure  product carbon footprints. Unlike complete life cycle analyses, this  involves determining only the climate-relevant greenhouse gas emissions  throughout the value chain of a product – from the purchase of the raw  materials through to production, use and disposal. However, until now  there has been no standardized method for determining the carbon foot- print of a product. For this reason, Henkel participates in pilot projects  in the USA and Europe with the aim of driving forward the development  of a reliable and internationally harmonized method of determining   carbon footprints. Sustainability assessment by our business units In collaboration with the European Commission and various stakeholders,  in 2014 the Europe-based International Association for Soaps, Detergents  and Maintenance Products (Wasch-, Pflege- und Reinigungsmittelverband     A.I.S.E.) launched a pilot project on the Product Environmental Footprint  (PEF) of heavy-duty liquid detergents for machine applications to reduce  the overall footprint of products. Henkel, represented by the Laundry &amp;  Home Care business unit, was joined in the project by other companies,  national industry associations, and the external organizations    CESIO,     Global Standards 1,    SGS, the    Sustainability Consortium, the     Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, and the    Technical  University of Berlin. The pilot project resulted in the publication of  rules based on product categories and life cycles. This is the first method  based on a harmonized and transparent life cycle assessment throughout  Europe. However, it is not yet sufficiently mature at the current stage of  development to allow accurate product comparisons, as LCA science  is still evolving. For example, some impact assessment methods are  not yet ready to be applied to comparative, detailed assessment at the  product level or to market communication. However, they are useful for  reviewing, prioritizing, and managing the eco-design of products within  the  company. We  support A.I.S.E.’s objective of integrating a harmonized  PEF method into the product assessment of the long-standing    “Charter  for Sustainable Cleaning”. This method had been in place since 2006  and is regularly updated.

As part  of this effort, in 2021, with the help of cross-departmental innovation  teams in Laundry &amp; Home Care, we laid the foundations for developing  a country-specific consumer app based on the latest scientific research.  This internal pilot project has made it possible for us to compare different  third-party assessments with our own data. This provides valuable  insights for our product development. We initially began with new  health criteria, but we are also taking into account criteria relating  to the environment and product performance. Our Beauty Care business unit has calculated the environmental foot- print of more than 200,000 product formulas over the past six years.  Each formula comes with a compact sustainability report that clearly  summarizes relevant categories, such as carbon footprint, biodegrad- ability, data on ingredients of natural origin (according to the ISO 16128  standard developed for cosmetic products), as well as their proportion  of the overall product formula. There is also a database that provides  sustainability data for all relevant raw materials. This makes it possible to  compare the sustainability profiles of specific raw materials. At all times,  the standardized methodology, the comparability of the reports and the  raw material properties provide our developers with easy access to infor- mation about how our formulas contribute to sustainability, as well as  full transparency about potential optimization approaches for a reduced  overall footprint. Our Adhesive Technologies business unit has introduced an internal  portfolio assessment process to analyze the sustainability contribution  of our portfolio. By integrating this assessment into our strategic  management and product development, we are able to sustainably align  our portfolio based on the latest scientific facts. The assessment criteria cover different dimensions of sustainability  and were determined on the basis of a customer-oriented approach.  They focus on CO2 reduction and energy efficiency, the circular economy,  health and safety, water conservation and quality across the value chain.  A systematic and fact-based approach means that appropriate supporting  documentation must be available for all products with a contribution  that is judged to be significant. We have trained more than 900 employees from our Adhesive Technologies  business unit in the implementation of this portfolio assessment process  since it was developed.

The survey confirmed that  our  target groups place great importance on our efforts to integrate sustain- ability into all of our activities and product life cycles, and that they also  have a strong focus on the environmental impacts that occur during the  individual phases of our products’ life cycles. The sustainability topics our  stakeholders particularly prioritize are → materials and waste, → energy  and climate, and → water and wastewater. A  special focus is also placed  on the → mental health and well-being of employees. Our stakeholders  consider Henkel to be well positioned in addressing these key issues.  Another result of the survey was that Henkel is perceived as a reliable  partner by 87 percent of the stakeholders. This is due to our commitment  to high industry standards, our clarity of direction, our reliability and  competence, and last but not least, our employees.  We are in close dialog with our stakeholders on a continuous basis. The  following overview shows a current selection of the main dialog formats  and activities, as well as the expectations placed on our company.  Additional information on collaboration and partnerships can be found  on our    website. 87 % of our stakeholders consider  us to be a reliable partner around 700 stakeholders  surveyed STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT Dialog with our stakeholders Understanding the social demands that stakeholders of all kinds place  on our company is a key component of our → sustainability management.  This includes our customers, consumers, suppliers, business partners,  employees, shareholders, investors, neighbors and  local communities,  associations and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), academia,  as well as politicians and government authorities.  To better understand the expectations and perspectives of our stakeholders  and to engage in dialog that is more targeted and solution-oriented, we  make use of specific surveys and continuously monitor the opinions  at several levels: in direct dialog, in multi-stakeholder initiatives, and  through dialog platforms. Cooperation with NGOs and opinion leaders  gives us insights into global challenges and enables us to respond to issues  at an early stage. Stakeholder  dialog is a key element of our approaches to  innovation and risk management, and helps us to  continuously develop  our sustainability strategy and reporting.  Stakeholder survey confirms Henkel as a reliable partner In 2021, we once again conducted a comprehensive survey of our stake- holders to identify which topics have priority for them and to map the  current expectations of the various stakeholder groups as part of the  development of our → sustainability strategy. Another aim was to obtain  a clear picture of our international sustainability reputation. We followed  both a quantitative and a qualitative approach, with in-depth interviews  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  35 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Customers &amp;   consumers ... are increasingly interested  in sustainable products and are  looking to understand their  impact along the value chain.   • Calculating their CO2 footprint  with the    Henkel footprint   calculator  • Our    “Be smarter.”-initiative  encourages water-saving  behavior and responsible waste  management  • Our    “Fritz for Future” pod- cast provides information on  important sustainability topics Associations &amp; NGOs  ... expect us to actively promote  sustainable development.

For many of our employees, this includes   regular dialog with stakeholders – both on specific topics and on sustain- ability in general. Experts at our various company sites and in our  business units engage in discussion with relevant stakeholder groups  on specific local and regional challenges. This allows us to develop  customized concepts and solutions that can be implemented and  assessed effectively. In 2021, as in each year, Henkel employees met with  politicians, scientists and scholars, businesspeople and members of the  public. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many events were again held in  virtual formats to protect the participants.   • Sustainable packaging and the circular economy were key topics of  discussion at many stakeholder dialog events in 2021. In November  2021, Henkel invited key stakeholders from the packaging and consumer  goods industry to the    “Sustainability Days 2021”. By bringing  together the entire value chain in the field of packaging and consumer  goods, Henkel has established a strong platform for discussions and  solutions for current and upcoming topics – from circular economy  and energy saving to health and safety and many more. The business  fields this year will include end of line packaging and labeling, flexible  packaging, paper solutions, tapes and labels and – for the first time –  personal hygiene.   • Recyclable packaging and  sustainable product applications were also  addressed in April 2021 at the “Better Future Conference – Sustainability,”  an initiative of WELT AM SONNTAG. In an interview, Carsten Knobel,  Chair of the Management Board, highlighted how Henkel is embedding  sustainability in the company and among consumers.   • In May 2021, the    ChangeNOW Summit took place for the fourth time  in a row as an online format in which Henkel France was a partner.  ChangeNOW is one of the world’s most important innovation platforms  and brings together a large number of actors from various sectors,  all committed to promote sustainable development. At this event,   representatives from Henkel and the social enterprise    Plastic Bank  discussed the challenges of the circular economy.  • In the digital Futuretalk, hosted by the Futurewoman initiative, Henkel  representatives discussed with other experts the extent to which plastic  can be part of the solution for greater sustainability and where concrete  action is needed.   • Another focus was the discussion on diversity and inclusion. At a  panel discussion during the “Better Future Conference – Diversity” of  WELT AM SONNTAG in November 2021, Sylvie Nicol, Executive Vice  President Human Resources and Chair of the Sustainability Council,  discussed the relevance of an inclusive, strong leadership culture to  promote diversity, equal opportunity and inclusion in the company.

The involvement is an expression of a public commitment on the part  of the participants and their companies.  • In November 2021, the    Henkel Xathon, an ideation hackathon for  female founders, took place for the third time. The aim of the hybrid  event was to promote female entrepreneurs and talents in the technology  industry, strengthen their business innovation and support them in  building a relevant business network. It was hosted by Henkel dx  Ventures, Henkel’s platform for open innovation and collaboration,  together with the initiative Global Digital Women. A key focus this  year was the rapidly accelerating direct-to-consumer (D2C) sector,  influenced by changing consumer behaviors towards hyper-personal- ization across all channels.  • Henkel was again a partner of the    German Sustainability Award  in 2021 and took the opportunity to engage with stakeholders on  German Sustainability Day. Ulrike Sapiro, Chief Sustainability Officer  at Henkel, provided insights into how Henkel is actively driving the  transformation to a sustainable economy and society in a plenum on  the topic “Accelerating Transformation – Embracing Challenges as  Opportunities”. The German Sustainability Award is an initiative of  the Stiftung Deutscher Nachhaltigkeitspreis e. V. in cooperation with  the German Federal Government, the German Council for Sustainable  Development, economic associations, local government associations,  civil society organizations and research institutions.   • In November 2021, the annual partnership meeting between the develop- ment organization    Solidaridad and Henkel took place virtually. The  participants discussed cooperation to support → smallholders and  local initiatives to promote → sustainable palm (kernel) oil. In addition  to the milestones that have already been achieved, the development  of Henkel’s palm (kernel) oil strategy and future cooperation with  Solidaridad were also discussed. This collaboration will continue to  focus on improving livelihoods for  smallholders. To further scale  up our joint actions, we started developing our Partnership  Theory of  Change in 2021. This framework will help us to define our strategic  actions in the future as well as to define and achieve a concrete impact.

It is supported by integrated management systems  and an organizational structure with clearly defined responsibilities.  The General Counsel &amp; Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the  Chair of the Management Board. He is supported by the Corporate   Compliance Office, our interdisciplinary Compliance &amp; Risk Committee,  and 50 locally appointed compliance officers all over the world. Our   Corporate Data Protection Officer is also part of our Compliance orga- nization. Together, this organization coordinates the flow of information  and helps our employees to implement our requirements locally – for  example, through specially adapted training courses. The General  Counsel &amp; Chief Compliance Officer reports any infringements, as well  as the measures taken to deal with them, to the Management Board  and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on a regular basis.  Our internal reporting and complaints channels are supported by a   compliance hotline, which was set up to enable employees to report  infringements of our    Code of Conduct, internal standards, or applicable  laws anonymously. It is run by an independent external provider and is  available globally, allowing both open as well as anonymous reporting.  The hotline and alternative reporting channels are available to employees  and third parties. Focus on communication and training  Since we operate on a global scale, our employees find themselves   working within a variety of legal systems and value systems. Many of  our employees work in countries where, according to surveys by   organizations such as    Transparency International, there is a greater  risk of encountering corrupt practices. The same expectations apply to  all employees at all locations without exception: Henkel strictly opposes  the infringement of laws and standards, and rejects all dishonest business  practices. To impart clear rules of conduct to our employees, and   especially to avoid any conflicts of interest in everyday working situations,  we focus on regular training courses and communication measures. Our  managers play a key role with regard to compliance. Given their position  within the company, they bear a special responsibility to set an example  for their staff. For this reason, all of our managers across the globe must  participate in our mandatory Compliance eLearning program and  attend relevant training courses. The program addresses many different  compliance topics, such as data protection, competition law and anti-  corruption. In 2021, more participants took part in these compliance  training courses (52,471 registered participants) than in previous years.  Zero tolerance for violations of regulations  Improper conduct is never in Henkel’s interest. The Management Board  and senior management circles at Henkel all subscribe to this fundamental  principle. Improper conduct undermines fair competition and damages  our trustworthiness and reputation. Our employees attach great  importance to a correct and ethically impeccable business environment.

In the course of the  audits, a total of 852 corrective actions were agreed upon. The audits   covered all major units of the company: Sales, Marketing, Purchasing,  Finance, HR, IT, Supply Chain, Operations and SHE. Compliance with  our SHE Standards was audited at 25 sites, resulting in the initiation of  a total of 127 optimization measures. We examined compliance with our  Social Standards in three assessments.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion of our 2021  audits was again conducted using a “remote audit” approach. This  requires powerful infrastructure, as well as the digitalization of pro- cesses and documents. Our overall assessment of our experience of  this remote audit approach remains positive, although the effectiveness  and efficiency of the approach is limited in certain audit areas and  when auditing across different time zones. In 2021, SHE audits were in  part supported by third-party vendors to enable on-site audits. All audit results are included in the Corporate Audit department’s annual  report to the Henkel Management Board and the Audit Committee of the  Supervisory Board. In addition to the regular audits, Corporate Audit also  conducted an assessment of internal control systems. In 2021, Corporate  Audit also trained 3,122 employees worldwide on compliance, risk   management and internal controls, in the course of seminars and  during audits. We react forcefully to violations of laws, codes and standards. Where  necessary, we initiate appropriate disciplinary measures. In 2021, four  employees received written warnings, and 27 contracts were terminated  as a result of conduct violating compliance rules.  Data protection and compliance management systems  Henkel’s compliance culture involves continuous    monitoring and  improvement of the compliance process. Against this background, our  data protection management system was reviewed and confirmed by  external auditors in 2019 in accordance with the IDW PS 980 auditing  standard – with regard to the appropriateness, implementation and  effectiveness of the data protection processes. Henkel has previously  had similar external audits related to competition law and anti-corruption  carried out on several occasions. Results of our audits  The Head of the Corporate Audit department reports directly to the Chair  of the Management Board. We carry out regular audits based on our risk- based audit planning at our production and administration sites, and at  our subcontractors and in logistics centers, to verify  compliance with  our codes and standards. The audits are a key instrument for identifying  risks and potential improvements.   70 audits conducted   around the world HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  40 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Since many of our products pass into wastewater after use, their com- position has been designed to minimize the impact on the environment.  Wastewater from chemical engineering applications is treated using  state-of-the-art technology to remove harmful substances and is then  disposed of properly.  In selecting and using ingredients, we also follow controversial   discussions about the safety of chemical ingredients in products. As a rule,  we respond by critically reviewing the scientific basis of our assessments  with particular care. If this gives rise to reservations about product safety,  and if the scientific data and findings cannot dispel these doubts, we  either avoid using a substance altogether or restrict its use so that it will  still meet our stringent safety criteria.  At the same time, it is becoming increasingly important to enable  consumers to learn about the ingredients contained in our products. In  line with this, we will enhance global transparency about the substances  used and their respective safety. Regular audits are carried out to verify compliance with corporate product  safety requirements and procedures. The business units are responsible  for the implementation of the respective measures.  PRODUCT SAFETY Product responsibility as an important lever   for sustainability Our customers and consumers should be able to rest assured that our  products are safe when used as intended. All raw materials and finished  products are subjected to numerous assessments and tests to ensure a  high level of safety during production, use and disposal. This is based on  ensuring compliance with statutory requirements and more extensive     Henkel standards.  Our product developers and    product safety experts assess ingredients  according to the latest scientific findings and safety data. They   continuously track Henkel products on the market and incorporate the  insights gained into the assessments. We follow a risk-based approach  in accordance with scientific standards when assessing the consumer  safety and environmental compatibility of materials and products. A  key step in this assessment process is that, in addition to the safe  concentration for using a substance, we also determine the extent to  which humans or the environment are exposed to it. Since exceeding  the safe concentration for use may result in a risk to humans and / or  the environment, we restrict the use of the substance in these cases to   relatively low concentrations and / or certain product categories. In   individual cases, this can also lead to a substance not being used at all.

This looks at the properties of the individual ingredients,  their concentrations in the product and the conditions under which the  product will be used. Products for use on the human body are additionally  evaluated dermatologically. The results of these evaluations and assess- ments then form the basis for defining the required precautionary and  protective measures for safe use of the product. These measures are   specifically adapted as appropriate, taking account of whether the product  is to be used by consumers or industrial professionals, and can range  from package design features, through to detailed instructions and  warnings, or restrictions regarding use.  Controversially discussed ingredients  Scientists and the general public often take different views regarding the  risks that chemical substances might pose. There are many reasons for  this. Particularly often, we see that a direct link is made between the  potential hazard a substance may have for humans or the environment  and the ensuing risk, without taking into account the extent to which  humans or the environment are actually exposed to that substance. It is  our view that a differentiation must be made between hazard and risk,  and that this is in fact essential to ensure that safety assessments of  ingredients reflect reality.  Identifying hazards – assessing risks  In assessing the safety of a product, the first step our experts take is to  determine whether its ingredients could pose a hazard to people or the  environment. An exposure analysis is carried out in a second step to  clarify the extent to which people or the environment could be exposed  to this substance. This analysis is important as, in most cases, a harmful  effect will only occur when the quantity and concentration of the   questionable substance reach a certain level. The results of these two  steps have to be combined to arrive at a comprehensive risk assessment.  It is only by considering this overall picture that our experts can make  reliable statements about whether a product will be safe when it is used.  A simple example is acetic acid, which represents a potential hazard  because it can cause serious harm in high concentrations due to its   caustic properties. When used as vinegar in diluted form in our food,  however, it does not pose a risk.  Evaluation of the substances used  Regarding substances with certain dangerous properties, we have  decided that these shall not be used at all for specific applications. For  other substances, we have introduced strict internal constraints and  restrictions and, by doing so, we often go beyond legal requirements.  In other cases, we work to further improve health compatibility by   developing alternative ingredients. One example of this is the switch  from solvent-based to water-based formulations for our consumer and  contact adhesives.

Furthermore, we believe being present in these  markets and supporting the non-animal testing agenda will ultimately  help to gain acceptance for alternatives to animal testing. We and other  manufacturers in our industry cannot rule out the possibility that an  ingredient was tested on animals at some point before it was introduced  to the market. In particular, this is because we mostly source our ingre- dients from suppliers, and manufacture very few ingredients ourselves.  In this context, it is also important to know that ingredients used in  products including detergents, cleaning products and adhesives are  chemical substances. This means they must be secured by the respective  manufacturer in line with the relevant legal requirements for chemicals,  such as the    REACH regulation in Europe. In some cases, animal testing  is still required by law to ensure safety and compatibility for humans and  the environment. This is because recognized alternative methods are  not yet available for all aspects of testing. We use recognized, alternative  testing methods or existing data to demonstrate the safety of our ingre- dients. For 40 years now, we have been intensively committed to  developing alternative testing methods ourselves. Henkel was one of the  companies that founded the    ‘European Partnership on Alternative  Approaches to Animal Testing’ (EPAA) in 2005, together with the Euro- pean Commission and several industry associations. Since then, this  partnership has advanced numerous projects that have successfully  promoted alternatives to animal testing and made them useable for  conducting safety assessments in line with the REACH regulation. Product recall process  Although our products undergo numerous tests and assessments to  ensure a high level of safety, unforeseen deviations from our high quality  standards may occur in very rare cases. In preparation for any such  cases and to ensure the best possible health and safety of customers and  consumers, in 2009 Henkel introduced a corporate standard for potential  product crises and product recalls that applies to all sites. This global  corporate standard defines binding procedures, clear responsibilities  and guidelines for an appropriate and rapid response if deviations and  unforeseen events were to occur in connection with our products, despite  all of the safety precautions we have taken. Following a fundamental  revision of this corporate standard, our internal target groups were  informed about new content in 2020 through training sessions and short  presentations. A digital training course has also been available since the  end of 2020. Innovations and alternative test methods  We have a clear    commitment: We do not test our cosmetic products,  our detergents and cleaning products, or our adhesives for industrial  customers, consumers and craftspeople on animals. Unfortunately, we  cannot claim that animal testing no longer plays any role at all. This is  because there are some countries where animal testing is still mandatory  to obtain market and/or regulatory approval for products such as   cosmetics, detergents and cleaning products, or adhesives. We are working  together with the relevant industry associations to convince the authorities  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  43 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Enhancing human health and safety We test and assess our raw materials and finished products throughout  the entire product lifecycle to make sure they meet the highest standards.  Of course, our customers share our commitment to health and safety –  and their focus is being sharpened by regulatory changes that aim to   protect consumers. A new chemical strategy for sustainability, for example,  is expected to be included within the Green Deal in the European Union.  Adapting our product formulas in Adhesive Technologies is just one  of the ways that we seek to enhance safety and help our customers to  exceed regulatory requirements. For example, our Loctite 2400 thread- locker is not required to display any hazard symbols, risk statements or  safety-related warnings on the packaging because it does not contain  any substances of concern.  Wherever possible, questions regarding the skin compatibility of  ingredients are now investigated with the help of in-vitro tests. In-vitro  tests have been developed over the past decades by Henkel in cooperation  with external partners. They have been proposed for international  recognition by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Develop- ment (OECD) as a substitute method for animal testing.  For this purpose, Henkel uses    epiCS® skin models produced in its  own laboratories under the    Phenion® brand. The epiCS® technology  includes reconstructed human epidermal equivalents, which are   officially  recognized by the OECD for assessing skin-corrosive potential,  and, since April 2019, also assessing skin-irritant potential. Our scientists are currently working to ensure that the skin models,  which are the size of a one-cent coin, can also be used to research other  chemical safety issues. You can find more information on the website  of the European Commission’s    Scientific Committee on Consumer  Products.  Computer-aided analysis is also playing an increasingly important role  in our testing and assessment strategies. Additionally, we make our  expertise available to legislators through a range of associations to  shorten the lengthy processes leading to recognition of an alternative  test method and to promote the acceptance of proven alternatives.

In the areas of strategic sustainability in sourcing mentioned above, a  large number of indicators are collected and made available to measure  the value contribution as a basis for strategic sourcing decisions.   Henkel currently has business partners from 119 countries. About  75 percent of our purchasing volume comes from countries that belong  to the    Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD).  However, we are increasingly opening up new purchasing markets  in countries that are not OECD members. We place the same exacting  demands on business partners worldwide. We expect their business  business partners from 119 countries SOURCING  Responsible sourcing underpins holistic growth  Our responsible sourcing approach focuses on sustainability aspects  along our supply chains for the benefit of people and our planet. Inten- sive dialog and close cooperation with our suppliers are essential for  achieving sustainable business, process and production practices. Over  a decade ago, we established a framework for sustainable procurement  in the supply chains of the chemical industry based on cooperation,  trust and responsibility.   100 percent responsible sourcing strategy Our ambition is to commit to 100 percent responsible sourcing together  with our partners. The key element here is our    responsible-sourcing  strategy, which places a clear focus on a shared fundamental approach.  We are firmly convinced that we can only establish sustainable procure- ment practices if every single decision-maker in the global supply  chains acts in the spirit of sustainability. This requires a fundamental  recognition of this responsibility, as well as adopting the right attitude  and building skills and knowledge.  Our strategy is based on our comprehensive → risk management and   → compliance approach. The aim here is to gather and provide transparent  key figures on the sustainability performance and risks of our suppliers  as a basis for fact-based decision-making in sourcing processes and the  awarding of contracts. The transparency gained in this area also benefits  risk management and risk mitigation, as well as dialog and cooperation  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  45 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Cooperation with strategic suppliers and partners Our current cooperation with our suppliers centers on the definition and  implementation of a common plan for Henkel’s sustainability targets for  2025 and beyond. We use different platforms and forums to develop   pioneering innovations in the field of sustainable products and technol- ogies together with our suppliers. We use target agreements with our  strategic suppliers to manage transparency, sustainability performance  and innovation potential in the area of sustainable sourcing solutions.  As part of our risk management approach, we are working to improve the  transparency of our upstream supply chains with regard to sustainability  risks. To support climate action across the value chain, we also require  our suppliers in the raw materials and packaging sectors to be transparent  about the emissions levels of their product portfolios. We expect them  to make a contribution to reducing CO2  emissions along their supply  chains in line with our science-based target for Scope 3 greenhouse gas  emissions. This approach addresses about 50 percent of our indirect  emissions in the area of raw materials. In addition, we encourage sustain- able innovation by engaging in dialog with suppliers and setting individual  targets. This is how we ensure that focus topics such as biodegradability are  systematically integrated into Henkel’s holistic approach to sustainability.  conduct to be consistent with our sustainability requirements. In selecting  and working with our business partners, we also consider their perfor- mance with regard to safety, health, environment, social standards and  fair business practices. This is based on our corporate    Safety, Health  and Environment Standards. Our corporate purchasing standards  apply worldwide, and we have supplemented these with an updated     Responsible Sourcing  Policy in 2018. The Chief Procurement Officer  (CPO) is responsible for all procurement activities and responsible   supply chain management. He reports directly to the Chief Financial  Officer (CFO).  Binding supplier code Compliance with the cross-sector Code of Conduct of the German     Association of Materials Management, Purchasing, and Logistics  (BME) is mandatory for all of Henkel’s suppliers worldwide. The BME  Code of Conduct is based on the ten principles of the    UN Global  Compact. This Code of Conduct makes international application   possible and, in addition to the Responsible Sourcing Policy, also serves  as the basis for contractual relationships with our strategic suppliers.

We expect our suppliers to acknowledge  our supplier code of conduct as well as our Responsible Sourcing Policy.  Our onboarding process is anchored in a globally uniform registration  system and provides a standardized summary of our sustainability  requirements. Step 3: Initial assessment or audit  At the start of a new business relationship, suppliers are asked to either  disclose existing sustainability performance results, or to undergo a  self-assessment that provides transparency about their sustainability  performance. We do this for the majority of our external purchasing  volume using a methodology developed by EcoVadis, an independent  sustainability assessment specialist. These questionnaires cover  expectations in the areas of safety, health, environment, quality, human  rights, employee standards and anti-corruption.  We also piloted the    IntegrityNext software-as-a-service solution in  2021 for suppliers with lower purchasing volumes. A compact assessment  questionnaire is used to make the sustainability performance and risks  of suppliers in various purchasing segments transparent. Selected suppliers undergo initial audits as an alternative to the  assessment of the self-assessment questionnaires. Our supplier base  also includes contract manufacturers from which we source around  10 percent of our production tonnage each year. Our requirements  regarding quality, environmental, safety and social standards are an   integral part of all contractual relationships and order placements, and  are reviewed as necessary. Six-step process as an integral component   of our procurement activities Our six-step Responsible Sourcing Process, which generates indicators  on the sustainability performance of our suppliers, is a central element  of  our strategic risk management and compliance approach. We use the  resulting transparency to support our buyers in working with suppliers  to continuously improve sustainability performance in the value chain.  These continuous improvement processes are based primarily on  know ledge transfer and competence building with respect to process   optimization, resource efficiency, and environmental and social standards.  The Responsible Sourcing Process is an integral component of our  sourcing activities. This process is initiated before the start of any new  cooperation. It culminates in a recurring cycle of review, analysis and  continuous improvement with existing suppliers. Using this process  for the audit and assessment of the sustainability performance of our  suppliers, we cover about 93 percent of our purchasing volume in the  areas of packaging, raw materials, and contract manufacturing.  Step 1: Pre-check and risk assessment  Henkel uses an early warning system for sustainability risks in global  purchasing markets. We begin by evaluating the potential risks in a  region or country. In doing so, we concentrate on countries identified by  international institutions as being associated with heightened levels of  sustainability risks. The assessment includes the criteria “Human Rights,”  “Corruption” and “Legal Environment”. This also includes the assessment  of risk-value chains. Risk value chains are related to industries and  sectors that we consider to potentially represent a sustainability risk for  our company. This helps us to identify countries and purchasing   markets that may require special precautions.

Our audits consist of on-site inspections (e.g., at production sites of our  suppliers) and include both factory inspections and discussions with  employees at all levels of the hierarchy.  Step 4: Analysis of the performance assessment  External sustainability experts, as well as the supplier owners in our  Purchasing team, analyze the results of the audits or the results of the  self-assessment questionnaire to identify sustainability deficits and  improvement areas. At the same time, the suppliers are assigned to   different sustainability risk classes. A standardized process following  an assessment or audit ensures that our suppliers implement the  corrective actions that have been specified. Repeated serious non-  compliance leads to termination of the supplier relationship.  Step 5: Corrective actions and continuous improvement process  Independently of the results of an audit or assessment, we ask our  assessed suppliers to draw up a Corrective Action Plan and to work on  the defined areas of potential optimization. We monitor the progress  made in the implementation together with our suppliers in the course  of the period until the re-assessment or re-audit takes place. Step 6: Re-Assessment / Re-Audit  We use recurring re-assessments or re-audits to monitor the performance  progress of our suppliers and ensure a continuous improvement cycle  consisting of evaluation, analysis and corrective measures. Data on the  measured sustainability performance of our suppliers is made available  in real time via digital platforms.  Development or termination of the supplier relationship  As part of our supplier management activities, we work intensively with  our suppliers to improve sustainability performance. We strive to initiate  positive change throughout the value chain, through training programs  and joint projects. During 2021, we did not receive any notifications of an  infringement by any of our strategic business partners that would have  given cause for terminating our relationship with that supplier.

The TfS initia- tive today consists of 34 members representing total expenditures of more  than 267 billion euros. It aims to harmonize increasingly complex supply  chain management processes with regard to sustainability and to optimize  dialog among worldwide business partners. Above all, synergies are to be  created so that resources can be used more efficiently and with a minimum  of administrative effort, not only among the member companies but also  with all of our shared suppliers.  Together for a sustainable supply chain A strong partner in the “Together for Sustainability”   (TfS) initiative In 2011, Henkel and five other companies in the chemical industry  introduced the initiative    Together for Sustainability – Chemical Supply  Chains for a Better World (TfS). It is based on the principles of the     UN Global Compact and the Responsible Care Initiative of the  Responsible Sourcing Process Six-step supplier management process  • Implemented in all regions, in all business units and for all  material groups  • Managed by the Sustainability team within Purchasing and  executed by the global Purchasing team  • Complemented by supplier audits conducted by the Safety,  Health and Environment (SHE) team Sustainability as an   integral component of all  procurement activities HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  49 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  At the heart of the audits and online assessments of the TfS initiative is  the core idea: “An audit for one is an audit for all!”: Suppliers then only  have to undergo one assessment or one audit. The audits are carried out  by a number of selected, independent audit companies. For the online  assessments, TfS works with    EcoVadis, a sustainability performance  assessment specialist.  Around 18,000 assessments and audits have taken place since TfS was  founded. Performance is assessed in the areas of management, environ- ment, health and safety, labor and human rights, and issues of ethical  corporate governance. The measures then introduced are reviewed via  re-assessments or re-audits. Follow-up monitoring and subsequent  supplier management are the responsibility of the individual member  companies. An online platform is used to make the results available to  all members of the initiative.  The initiative not only expanded to include additional member   companies in 2021, it also established a regional working group in   Singapore, headed by a Henkel representative. Together with the   Chinese Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation, TfS is working  to raise awareness of the initiative in China.  18,000 TfS assessments and audits 34 member companies   of the TfS initiative Another working group was also launched in 2021 with the goal of  establishing a global program to collect and share information on Scope  3 greenhouse gas emissions. This includes developing a standardized  approach for measuring greenhouse gas emissions data in the chemical  industry. This also includes defining a data  collection and sharing   process using a scalable platform, designing a supplier engagement  program, and maintaining dialog with key stakeholders.  In 2021, the initiative also developed the    TfS Academy. After completion  of the pilot phase, the Academy will provide a learning environment for  both of the core target groups, buyers and suppliers, as well as other  key stakeholders within TfS member companies. The TfS Academy will  initially offer more than 200 learning contents in four languages. Training and development of suppliers and employees  During the year, Henkel continued to focus on building up and expanding  the expertise of its buyers and suppliers. Henkel experts trained both  purchasing experts and suppliers in focus areas like palm oil, greenhouse  gas emissions and conflict minerals. Experts at TfS, together with repre- sentatives of the strategic supplier evaluation partner EcoVadis, were  also trained in content related to the assessment process. In total, about  2,360 participants were trained in various webinars in four languages  (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese) in 2021. At the annual conference  of the Chinese Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation, personal  training was provided for about 370 suppliers on site in Ningbo for the  second year.

During the year, 970 employees completed  eLearning courses on sustainability topics in purchasing. We placed a  special focus on human rights due diligence training in purchasing.  About 370 employees in the Purchasing area underwent extensive  human rights training in 2021, focusing on human rights due diligence  in supply chains.  Honoring our suppliers  Henkel has regularly honored suppliers for special achievements for many  years. In 2021, the    Adhesive Technologies business unit presented  BASF with the Sustainability Award for its outstanding contributions to  achieving our sustainability targets and ambitions. BASF’s contributions  include joint development projects for improved health and safety  standards, for reducing the company’s carbon footprint by sourcing raw  materials based on the biomass balance process for new adhesive  products, and the partnership in the ReciChain initiative for tracking  plastics and plastic products.  The    Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit presented the 2021 Sustain- ability Award to Firmenich and Takasago in recognition of their achieve- ments in the development of new biodegradable capsules for fragrances.  We use this technological development for fabric softeners and laundry  detergents. It also fulfills the criteria of biodegradability and fragrance  performance and longevity.  The    Beauty Care business unit presented the Sustainability Award  for 2021 to Sasol, whose Parafol chemical line allows us to replace cyclic   silicones from antiperspirant sprays. This is an important step in adapting  our products to the current specifications and needs of consumers. Close collaboration with partners  In addition to our work in the Together for Sustainability initiative, Henkel  is a member of    AIM-PROGRESS, a forum of companies from the  consumer goods industry. The objective here is also to encourage member   companies to share experiences in the area of sustainable sourcing  and utilize synergies. The forum also focuses on holding regional supplier  events to improve sustainability performance within the value chain.  We are also a founding member of the    Action for Sustainable Deriva- tives (ASD) initiative. It brings together organizations from along the  palm oil derivative supply chain to support efforts to increase transpar- ency and promote compliance with NDPE (No Deforestation, No Peat,  No Exploitation) principles to positively transform the palm oil industry.

This topic is already highly relevant for investors and the  global financial markets today and is increasingly gaining in importance.  This means that the proportion of investors who use sustainability   criteria as a basis for both their strategic portfolio management and their  specific investment decisions is increasing. Institutional investors are  increasingly including sustainability in their risk and opportunity  management, as they are  convinced that sustainable companies are  more successful in the long term. This development is also being  actively promoted by political decision-makers at global level – with  concrete legal requirements and initiatives for greater climate and   environmental protection. For example, the European Commission’s     “Green Deal” includes measures for the financial market. In this  respect, sustainability is an increasingly critical success factor for  competitiveness as an issuer on the capital market. ESG (Environment,  Social, Governance) is therefore a key pillar of our financing strategy. Integrated dialog with our shareholders For many years now, we have been engaged in intensive dialog with  our shareholders on the topic of sustainability. As part of our capital  market communications, we regularly report on our strategy, goals, and  concrete initiatives and progress in this area. Sustainability has been an  integral part of our financial reporting in our Annual Report since 2001.  It is also a significant topic at our Annual Press Conference as well as  Annual General Meeting – not least because it is deeply anchored in  Henkel’s corporate strategy, culture and values. In addition, we engage  with investors both in one-on-one meetings as well as at conferences  and roadshows. In particular, events with a special focus on ESG offer an  important platform for these exchanges. We also provide transparent  information about our positions, activities and progress in the area of  sustainability by responding to in-depth questionnaires from investors.  This also provides us with detailed insights into the interests and  requirements of capital market players with regard to relevant ESG criteria. Sustainable financing Henkel implemented innovative solutions in the area of  sustainable  finance at an early stage. We introduced an ESG Framework for Pension  Asset Management in 2015 and updated it in 2020 by integrating  ESG  ratings for active fund managers and ESG index benchmarks for  passively managed investments. In 2018, Henkel was the first company in  Germany to conclude a syndicated    “Sustainability-Linked Loan,” a  “ Sustainability criteria  continue gaining importance  in investment decisions and  hence also in our Investor  Relations activities. We have  once again demonstrated  our commitment to sustain- able finance and integrated  ESG as a central pillar in our  financing strategy.” MARCO SWOBODA CFO and Executive Vice President Finance / Purchasing / Global Business  Solutions HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  52 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  credit facility linked to Henkel’s performance in the Sustainalytics,  EcoVadis and ISS-oekom sustainability ratings. In July 2020, we also  became the first company worldwide to issue a    “Plastic Waste Reduction  Bond”. The bond consists of two tranches of 70 million US dollars and  25 million euros and has a maturity of five years. The proceeds will be  exclusively invested in projects participating in Henkel’s activities to  reduce plastic waste. This bond underscores our commitment to pro- moting a circular economy and reducing plastic waste. We further expanded our commitment to sustainable finance in October  2021, by defining the    “Sustainable Finance Framework”. This     framework enables the issuance of two types of bonds: Sustainability-  Linked Bonds and Green Bonds. The financing costs for Sustainability-  Linked Bonds are linked to the achievement of sustainability targets,  while the proceeds from the issuance of Green Bonds are used exclusively  for sustainable investments. The framework was reviewed by the inde- pendent ESG rating agency ISS ESG, which confirmed the environmental  added value and the compliance of the framework with the Green  Bond and Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles of the International   Capital Market Association (ICMA). Henkel successfully issued two     Sustainability- Linked Bonds with a volume of 720 million euros  under the framework in November 2021.  With this “Sustainable Finance Framework,” we aim to align our business  as well as our financing with our commitments and values by creating a  direct link between our → sustainability strategy and our funding strategy.  This underscores our commitment to achieving our sustainability targets,  as well as our Henkel Finance team’s ongoing commitment to actively  supporting our sustainability agenda. EU taxonomy  In view of global warming, the European states have committed themselves  to more climate protection. In this regard, both the Paris Climate  Agreement and the European Green Deal view sustainable investments  as an important starting point. A key instrument in this context is the     EU taxonomy – an EU-wide classification system for sustainable  economic activities with the aim of promoting investment in them. According to the “Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to  facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU)  2019/2088,” an economic activity is considered environmentally   sustainable if it substantially contributes to achieving one or more of  the environmental objectives. At the same time, an economic activity  must not significantly harm the other environmental objectives. The  environmental objectives defined in terms of the Taxonomy Regulation  are: climate change  mitigation; climate change adaptation; the sustainable  use and protection of water and marine resources; the transition to a   circular economy;  pollution prevention and control; and the protection  and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. In addition, the economic  activity must be carried out in compliance with the minimum social  safeguards and comply with the technical screening criteria established  by the EU Commission by means of delegated acts. The technical screening  criteria specify the performance requirements for a specific economic  activity, determining under what conditions the activity makes a substan- tial contribution to achieving a particular environmental objective and  does not significantly harm the other objectives.

The Delegated Act covers economic activities of about 40 per- cent of listed companies in sectors that account for nearly 80 percent of  direct greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. These sectors include energy,  forestry, manufacturing, transport, and buildings. After a thorough examination involving all of our relevant business units  and functions, we came to the conclusion that our economic activities  are not covered under the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act and are  consequently not taxonomy-eligible. We therefore deduce that  Henkel, with its core business activities, is not identified as a relevant  source of emissions. Consequently, the share of taxonomy-eligible   economic activities accounts for 0 percent of our total sales and – as a  consequence – the related capital expenditures as well as operating  expenses also amount to 0 percent. The share of taxonomy non-eligible  economic activities in our total sales and capital expenditures and   operating expenses therefore amounts to 100 percent. In addition, the capital expenditures and operating expenses to be  reported include those related to the acquisition of production from  taxonomy-aligned economic activities and to individual measures that  reduce the carbon footprint or greenhouse gas emissions of the target  activities, as well as to individual building renovation measures. As the  reporting requirements for fiscal year 2021 relate exclusively to   taxonomy- eligible investments and expenditures and reliable statements  on taxonomy-alignment are not possible or such an assessment is not  required for this reporting period, we are unable to report any correspond- ing expenditures here either. We did not take into account the “Draft  Commission Notice” published on February 2, 2022, as the drafting  process was almost complete at that time. We will continue to intensively examine whether our economic activities  are covered by the delegated acts yet to be adopted on the remaining four  environmental objectives.

Turnover is determined  in accordance with IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”.  For more information on revenue, please refer to the corresponding  item “Sales” in the consolidated income statement on page 180 of the     Annual Report 2021. For more information on the principles of revenue  recognition, please refer to section 24 (pages 273 and 274) of the Annual  Report 2021. The determination of capital expenditure (CapEx) follows  IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment” (IAS 16.73(e)(i) and (iii)), as well as  IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” (38.118(e)(i)) and IFRS 16 “Leases” (IFRS 16.53(h)).  Capital expenditures for 2021 are calculated based on the aggregate of  the corresponding lines “Acquisitions,” “Additions to existing operations,”  and “Additions of right-of-use assets” under property, plant and equipment  in the Annual Report 2021 on page 211, as well as “Acquisitions” and  “Additions” under intangible assets, page 205 in the Annual Report 2021.  Goodwill is not included in capital expenditures in the context of EU  taxonomy reporting. For more information on property, plant and  equipment, intangible assets and leases, please refer to pages 205 to 215  of the Annual Report 2021. For estimates, assumptions and judgments  in connection with the aforementioned key performance indicators,  please refer to page 197 of the Annual Report 2021.  Operating expenses (OpEx) include direct non-capitalized costs that  relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-  term leases, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures  relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equip- ment. This includes research and development expenses recognized as  an expense in our income statement during the reporting period in  accordance with IAS 38 (see page 275 of our Annual Report 2021). Lease  expenses were determined in accordance with IFRS 16 and include  expenses for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets (see page  214 of our Annual Report 2021).

In parallel, we also want to continuously  improve our energy efficiency. In line with our vision, the sites will  become    climate-positive in terms of their carbon balance when surplus  CO2-free energy that Henkel does not need for its own purposes is supplied  to third parties. Along the journey toward this goal, we are still pursuing  our target of making a 65-percent reduction in the carbon footprint of  our production sites by 2025 compared to the base year 2010. In addition  to the major opportunities presented by the accelerated transition to  climate-neutral solutions, we also see a number of challenges, including  changing framework conditions and accounting methods that differ  around the world, as well as the local availability of climate-neutral  technologies. “ As market leader for adhe­ sives, sealants and functional  coatings, we are making  an important contribution  to climate protection by  becoming climate­positive  and leveraging our technolo­ gies and solutions to enable  CO2 savings along the value  chain.” JAN-DIRK AURIS Member of the Management Board Adhesive Technologies Our climate change mitigation activities Climate change is one of the major global challenges of our time.  We are committed to the 1.5 degree target of the Paris Climate Agreement.  We take → climate change and its impacts into account as part of our  sustainability and risk management approach, and across our entire  value chain. It is  relevant for us from two perspectives: One is the potential  impact of our business activities on the global greenhouse gas balance,  and the other is the potential impact of climate change on our business  activities. In the context of our → sustainability strategy, we consider  our direct and indirect CO2 emissions and their potential impact on the  climate. We are starting by focusing on our own sites, which we can  influence directly. We plan to achieve a reduction in the carbon footprint  of our production. We will achieve this by continuously → improving  our energy efficiency and by increasingly making use of power, especially  electricity, that is generated by → renewable sources.  We are always exploring ways to achieve climate neutrality faster for  selected sites. Based on our progress in these areas and the experience  we have gained, we have decided to bring forward our ambition for 2040  by ten years: By 2030, we intend to achieve a → climate-positive carbon  footprint for our production sites. To do this, we are planning to replace the fuels we need to generate thermal  energy at our sites with CO2-free alternatives such as biogas or biomass  by no later than 2030. We continue to strive towards our existing goal of  sourcing 100 percent of the electricity we purchase for production  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  60 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  In addition to our activities at our own sites, we want to leverage our  influence on areas of our value chain that are particularly relevant to  CO2 emissions. We determine this data using the recognized methods of  the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Analysis shows that the product  use phase has the greatest impact on our CO2 footprint. Our products  are used in millions of households and industrial processes every day.  Accordingly, our goal is to work with our customers, consumers and  suppliers to save 100 million metric tons of CO2 over the ten-year period  from 2016 to 2025. To achieve this, we have developed a CO2 savings  portfolio that can be used as a basis for quantifying the exact contributions  made by products to reducing emissions. We also want to reduce the  footprint of the raw materials and packaging that we use by 30 percent  by 2030 compared to a 2017 baseline. One component of this is our  packaging strategy, as CO2 emissions can be reduced by using recycled  material, for example.  In 2020, the    Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) confirmed that  our science-based emissions reduction targets, which we derived based  on our long-term goals, are consistent with the initiative’s criteria. Our  targets for Henkel’s greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) are in line  with the reductions required to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  We have committed to reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions per metric  ton of product by 67 percent by 2030 compared to 2017, and we have  converted our existing climate targets with the reference year 2010  accordingly to the more current reference year 2017. Our    target for  value chain emissions (Scope 3) also meets SBTi’s criteria for ambitious  value chain targets, which means it is in line with best practice. By  2030, we aim to reduce our emissions from raw materials and packaging  that meet Scope 3.1 “Goods and Services” of the GHG Protocol by 30 per- cent per  metric ton of product compared to 2017.  The effects of climate change on potential risks and   opportunities When assessing the potential impact of climate change on our business  activities, we consider the entire value chain – from the raw materials  we purchase through to the marketing of our products. We draw on the  findings of our comprehensive risk and opportunity assessment process.  We identify and assess climate-related risks based on the recommenda- tions of the    Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD). The recommendations made by the reporting department are  assigned to the core areas of governance, strategy and risk management  of a company. This framework addresses how an organization manages  climate- related risks and opportunities, how the actual and potential  impacts of climate- related risks and opportunities on the company’s  business are assessed, and how the organization identifies, assesses,  and manages climate- related risks if they are considered to be material. To this end, we identify relevant impacts in two major risk categories:  transition risks associated with the transition to a low-emission economy  and society; and physical risks, such as the increased probability of  extreme weather events in the future. In line with the timeframe of our  current sustainability strategy and our Group-wide risk management  approach, we are initially focusing on the period up to 2030. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  61 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  With respect to sourcing, the raw material palm (kernel) oil is particularly  interesting, as the yield of the plantations and consequently prices are  influenced by prevailing weather conditions. Our main focus is on   monitoring the El Niño weather phenomenon and managing its impacts.  Based on the scenarios issued by the IPCC and IEA that we have applied,  we do not expect any climate changes in the period up to 2030 that  would lead to a significant long-term increase in the prices of our palm  (kernel) oil-based raw materials. We primarily based our analysis of possible climate-related production  losses on the new    IPCC report published in 2021. Henkel will continue  to develop its assessment of these risks in the future, even though  we  currently assume that the risk to our sites from intensified climate  events is low, based on the current interpretation of the climate scenarios.  Where relevant, we have put in place a system for managing weather and  other geohazards.  The transition risks also present opportunities for Henkel: to position  itself as a company with a proactive climate protection strategy, to  improve its own competitiveness by optimizing its production and raw  material base, and to create added value for customers and consumers  with  innovative solutions and strong brands. Henkel’s CO2 savings  portfolio provides examples of this.    More information about our  TCFD reporting is available on our website. To explore the potential impacts of climate change, one of the sources  we use is data from transition scenarios developed by the    International  Energy Agency (IEA) and from climate scenarios conducted by the     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The scenarios  are based on different assumptions of potential climate warming. We  have considered the following risks: The main transition risks for Henkel include the potential financial  impact of a significant increase in the price of CO2. By analyzing the CO2  price developments based on different climate scenarios, we have  identified potential risks both for production and along the value chain.  We have assessed the potential direct and indirect effects on the costs of  energy, products and services purchased by Henkel if the widely intro- duced price of CO2 rises. We did this in the context of other price factors  and possible feedback effects. We expect to help reduce potential long- term risks by implementing our medium and long-term climate change  mitigation targets. We have also examined the physical risks for Henkel. Our focus was on  the risks associated with our raw material sourcing and on direct risks to  our production from potential climate-related changes in the frequency  and intensity of weather events such as heavy rain, droughts or floods. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  62 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  conditions in the countries in question. Accordingly, we are continuously  reviewing our timetable and strategy for decarbonizing our production  sites. Our considerations also take into account the results of the  negotiations at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in 2021.  Driving the conversion to renewable energy We are focusing on a combination of the following three models to   transition to 100 percent renewables by 2030: on-site production, direct  purchases and virtual coverage. By 2030, we aim to replace the last  remaining fossil fuels that we use in our production to generate process  energy by switching to carbon-neutral alternatives such as biogas or bio- mass. We also aim to supply surplus carbon- neutral energy that Henkel  does not need for its own purposes to third parties – thus becoming a  climate-positive company in our production. In doing so, we will avoid  emissions from our own activities, and also enable third parties to use  carbon-neutral energy. Since August 2021, the    Henkel Fragrance Center in Krefeld in the  Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit in Germany has been operating on a  CO2-neutral basis, making it the first Henkel site to switch its production  completely to CO2-neutral energy. We have been operating a 17,000 square  meter solar plant at our largest Beauty Care site in Wassertrüdingen,   Germany, since the beginning of 2021, generating 1,675 megawatt hours  (MWh) of green electricity per year. Combined with the conversion to  biogas, the  production facilities have been operated with 100 percent  renewable energy since August 2021. Significantly reducing the carbon footprint   in production Becoming climate-positive by 2030 In light of the need to reduce emissions and decarbonize the economy,  we pursue the ambition of converting our production sites to a    climate-  positive CO2 balance by 2030, which will make an active contribution  toward    climate protection.  The net carbon footprint of our production is around 475,000 metric  tons of CO2 and is attributable to the fuels we use ourselves (Scope 1) and  the energy purchased (Scope 2), in particular electricity. To date, we have  been able to achieve a reduction of 50 percent CO2 emissions per ton of  product (2021 vs. 2010). Our target is an overall reduction of 65 percent by  2025 (vs. 2010). We are continuously developing our climate strategy in the area of pro- duction, drawing on internal experts and our partner network. In 2021,  we hosted a number of strategic workshops in collaboration with external  partners to critically examine our ambitions, and to identify opportunities  and risks. The main factors to be taken into account in this context are the  continuously evolving energy markets, potential changes to the  legislative  framework, and technical innovations. For example, determining the  optimal supply strategy for each site requires intensive analysis of the  changing emissions trading systems and carbon markets. The  reason for  this is that we purchase electricity as well as thermal energy, and we  use energy sources that can be subject to rapidly changing framework  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  63 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Our production facility for detergents and cleaning products in Düssel- dorf, Germany, is aiming to meet the important milestone of becoming  carbon neutral by the beginning of 2022. To achieve this goal, the site is  accelerating its shift to renewable energy sources, including the use of  biogas for various processes. While we have already been using 100 percent  renewable electricity for our laundry detergent production in Düsseldorf-  Holthausen since 2020, we have now also been sourcing the thermal  energy required for liquid laundry detergent and dishwasher tab production  from renewable sources since July 2021. In our role as site operator at our  headquarters in Düsseldorf-Holthausen, we provide electricity and heat  to third parties. Our power station uses fossil energies (such as natural  gas) and renewable energies (such as biogas). We separate the CO2  emissions caused by generating energy for external third parties from  the energy that we use for our own production activities at this site. We  use the term “net emissions” when describing this situation. By the end of 2021, we had fully converted 21 countries to 100 percent  renewable electricity, and we managed to increase the proportion of our  electricity purchase that comes from renewable sources to 68 percent  during the entire year. We also have concrete plans to accelerate our  respective sourcing and continue to fully convert further countries to  green power in order to reduce the current use of fossil fuels.   Through a gradual conversion of the sites to renewable energy through  the use of the three models shown in the box on the right, we will be able  to meet the individual circumstances and the energy needs. 21 countries entirely transitioned   to 100 % renewable electricity Three models of conversion to renewable energy On-site production:   This model involves generating  green power at our sites through  wind turbines, solar cells or other  technologies. The infrastructure  is either funded by Henkel itself  or paid for by collaboration with  external partners.  Direct purchase: For this model, we purchase  green power straight from  the grid of a local energy   utility company, or as part of  a long-term Power Purchase  Agreement (PPA). Virtual coverage:   If the two options above cannot be  implemented at one of our sites,  green power requirements can be  covered virtually. For example, by  entering into long-term PPAs that  feed green power from sites into  the supply grid in an amount that   is equal to the amount consumed. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  64 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Climate change mitigation initiatives of the business units Digitalization is the key to making our production sites climate-positive,  because it serves as a driver for sustainability. We were once again   recognized as an “Advanced 4th Industrial Revolution Lighthouse” by the  World Economic Forum and McKinsey &amp; Company for our achievements  in this area. An independent panel of experts recognized Henkel’s     Laundry &amp; Home Care production facility in Toluca, Mexico, in Sep- tember 2021 and    Montornès del Vallès, Spain, in March 2020, as a  global “Lighthouse” project and pioneer for    Industry 4.0. The Mexican  plant is one of our five largest Laundry &amp; Home Care sites in the world.  This is our third such award. The other two were in 2020 for    Laundry &amp;  Home Care’s two Lighthouse factories in Düsseldorf, Germany, and –  as mentioned above – Montornès del Vallès, Spain. In addition, the Forum  named the Holthausen plant in Düsseldorf a    “Sustainability Lighthouse”  in 2021. We now operate one of the three most sustainable production  sites in the Global Lighthouse Network and three Industry 4.0 best  practice factories. This showcases our potential in using Fourth Industrial  Revolution (4IR) technologies in manufacturing for environmental  responsibility and sustainable business. This positions us as part of  a community of production sites that are leading the world in the   introduction and integration of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies  at the cutting edge.  One example of our achievements in this area is the decarbonization of  the energy-intensive spray drying of powder detergents. To this end, we  use our measured values to set up a “digital twin” – a cloud-based 3D  replica of the plant, where we simulated operations to arrive at optimal  process parameters for the facility. We are planning to scale up these  Industry 4.0 applications to further improve the sustainability perfor- mance of all of our spray tower sites.  Henkel uses smart factory tools to make greater use of methods for  improved planning, sourcing, manufacturing and logistics. Data-driven,  intelligent systems are used to control machines and optimize production  processes in real time – including energy consumption. Our    factory  in Kurkumbh, India, was designed as a smart factory of this kind and  engineered using lean manufacturing concepts. This helps to optimize  the organization of material flows to increase productivity, minimize  waste and reduce emissions. Highly efficient equipment and digital  technology are used to optimize processes, and the plant has smart  systems for  ventilation, air conditioning and lighting. Solar panels,  covering an area of 7,000 square meters of the roof, generate more than  1,000,000 kilowatt hours of energy and save about 800 metric tons of  CO2 annually.  Increased energy efficiency Our business units continuously strive to increase energy efficiency in  our existing sites and are stepping up the use of renewable energy   systems. This effort entails regular upgrades, such as converting to LEDs  and expanding solar installations. In Bogotá, Colombia, we installed a  closed-loop plumbing system to transport heated water for the production  of hair and body care products, reducing CO2 emissions by 33 metric tons  per year. Henkel Adhesive Technologies has also launched a multi-year  solar energy program. In China, for example, solar modules have been  installed at four production sites. The combined installed capacity totals  1.64 megawatts (MW). Together, the sites produce more than 1,700 MWh  of solar power.

Our approach to reducing our logistics footprint starts in the product  development stage. This is why we are optimizing our products and the  related packaging in terms of weight and volume, whenever it is  possible  to do so without compromising performance, convenience or stability.  More concentrated products and → lighter packaging reduce transport  weight, which decreases the amount of fuel required during transport  and reduces the related emissions. Improving our logistics structures  also helps to reduce transport emissions. Our approach takes the location  of our production sites into account. For bulkier products, we reduce  transport distances and environmental impact by operating regional  production sites. For compact products, we leverage efficiencies  in production by manufacturing these products centrally whenever   possible. For transportation and logistics for finished goods, we focus  our efforts on three major drivers:  Sustainability from the very beginning We plan to integrate innovative and environmentally compatible tech- nologies into our new production facilities, starting from the initial  design. Our new    production facility in Songdo, South Korea, has  paved the way for energy-efficient production. This site uses solar panels  and energy- efficient equipment, as well as rainwater for water supply.  Biodiversity is also ensured by maintaining grassland around the site (start  of construction 08/2019). This site will be the future global production  center for the electronics business of Henkel Adhesive Technologies. The  facility received LEED Gold certification from the    US Green Building  Council in 2021 in recognition of its energy-efficient design. Innovative approaches for the purchase of sustainable electricity We continue to assess    virtual power purchase agreements (“VPPAs”)  for sites at which the electricity needs cannot be met through on-site  generation or direct procurement from renewables. We achieved this in  the US in 2021, with a new wind power project in Texas that is being  developed by a utility company.  Low-emission logistics and mobility Optimizing transport and logistics processes Our responsibility along the entire value chain also includes optimizing  our    transport and logistics processes in terms of environmental  compatibility and resource efficiency. We set ourselves the overall aim to  reduce the emissions from transporting our products by around 15 percent  between 2015 and 2025. We also aim to use renewable electricity at  Product transports per transport mode in 2021 Airplane  1 % Truck  63 % Rail  10 % Ship  26 % HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  66 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  individual factories and warehouses. We also make use of the “mega  warehouse” concept, where a small group of main distribution centers  store products until the required quantities are due for on-time delivery  to regional warehouses and retailers.   • Optimizing transport: We continuously increase the capacity utili- zation of our cargo containers by expanding our pooling activities.  This includes the targeted consolidation of transport and storage of  similar product categories within Henkel, as well as combining  transport with other manufacturers. In addition, closely collaborating  with our customers further helps to optimize our processes. The  resulting  synergies in storage, consignment and transportation ensure  that more fully loaded trucks travel to our customers’ central warehouses.  We also rent pallets instead of buying them. This makes it more efficient  to collect them and improves the management of damaged pallets.  Where possible, we utilize reusable cardboard pallets instead of wooden  pallets. Due to their lighter weight, they are easier to handle and reduce  fuel consumption. We have recently continued to streamline our pallet  use, and we have implemented various solutions to reduce the overall  use of pallets and increase their reuse rate.  We leverage these three drivers through close collaboration with our   suppliers and customers to implement joint logistics projects. We also  use advanced digital solutions and alternative propulsion systems for  transport. When choosing our transport partners, we consider efficiency,  environmental compatibility and safety performance. Relevant criteria  are included in our tendering and decision-making processes for the  purchase of logistics services.  • Expanding intermodal transport: Intermodal transport involves  using more than one mode of transportation. At Henkel, this means  more of our transports are being switched from road to rail. This process  begins with a truck carrying the goods to the nearest rail loading  ter minal. From there, the goods cover longer distances by train, before  a second truck collects the goods at the destination terminal and delivers  them to the customer. This allows us to make use of the lower CO2  footprint of rail transport compared to road transport, since a train  emits about one-third of the CO2 of a truck when transporting the same  weight of goods. For this reason, intermodal transport has become a key  driver for CO2 reduction in logistics at Henkel. Through our dedicated  tendering processes, we are adding further train routes in Europe to  support our shift toward intermodal transport. We stepped up these  efforts further in 2021. Since May 2021, detergents and cleaning  products produced at our site in Kruševac, Serbia, have been trans- ported to Vienna by truck and from there to Düsseldorf by rail. This  approach saved about 280 tons of CO2 in 2021. This project is an  important step for Henkel in expanding intermodal transport, because  the route was previously served exclusively by trucks. We have also  increased the share of intermodal transports on the Hungary–  Düsseldorf route by 360 more transports per year.  • Improving our warehouse network: We select the location of our  warehouses and distribution centers to optimize the routes between  our production sites and our customers. A “wall-to-wall production”  approach, where the warehouse is directly connected to the production  facility, minimizes transport from production to storage. Where this is  not in place, we achieve synergies by consolidating transport between  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  67 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Future mobility  Beyond the use of advanced digital tools, alternative propulsion types  also form part of our approach to optimizing transport and logistics. We  are testing the operational capability of vehicles powered by alternative  propulsion systems at our sites. At our headquarters in Düsseldorf, we  have, for example, incorporated around 43 electric vehicles into the  internal fleet since 2012 to replace conventional vehicles with internal  combustion engines. In 2021, we also converted the first in-house vans  to purely electric vehicles. We have built a corresponding infrastructure  with over 120 charging stations in and around the industrial park, ten of  them in cooperation with the utility company Stadtwerke Düsseldorf.  Our vehicle policy for electric and hybrid cars also gives our employees  in Germany the option of driving an electric or hybrid vehicle as a  company car.  In 2019, the first hydrogen-powered vehicle was added to the internal  fleet at our Düsseldorf plant, and a hydrogen filling station was installed.  To promote hydrogen mobility, Henkel has been actively engaged over  the past few years in various initiatives and research projects, such as  “Modellregion Wasserstoffmobilität NRW Düssel.Rhein.Wupper.” How- ever, hydrogen mobility solutions suitable for our logistics operations  are not currently available for mass production. For this reason, we are  exploring several alternatives for sustainable logistics that are ready to  contribute today. The deployment of conventional combustion engines that run on   Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), which is mainly composed of methane,  is one of the technologies that we are implementing into our business  operations as part of our journey toward more sustainable mobility.  Digital tools for improved logistics  Our transport management system systematically captures the CO2   emissions of our logistics operations and makes our transport planning  and implementation even more efficient across all business units and  countries. Higher truck capacity utilization and optimized routes play a   particularly important role in reducing transport kilometers, cutting fuel  consumption and saving CO2.  Our progress is presented using a digital tool that calculates the environ- mental impact of transportation for all modes of transport based on  the DIN EN 16258 standard. Inputs include actual distances based on GPS  data, country-specific emission factors, and data from the respective  modes of transportation. The combined application of both IT solutions enables us to foster trans- parency and data comparability across the entire industry, and helps us  to track progress toward our emissions reduction target. By the end of  2021, Henkel had achieved a reduction in transport-related emissions  of about 14 percent compared to 2015. Our logistics emissions have been  calculated using a new methodology developed by our service  provider  ETW since 2021. By recalculating the values for the previous year, we  intend to have in place a method for reliably tracking progress made  towards the target. Progress in the previous target period from 2015 to  2020 is not affected. – 14 % lower transport-related CO2   emissions per ton of product* * Base year 2015 HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  68 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  CNG produces the least amount of CO2 of all types of fossil fuel combustion.  As a test, we have continuously operated CNG-powered trucks for delivery  runs on the route between Serbia and Austria since 2021. The use of a  CNG powered truck saves about 14 percent of CO2 emissions on this  route compared to a conventional diesel truck. Trucks powered by   liquefied natural gas (LNG) are another alternative mobility solution for  Henkel. Since 2020, two LNG-powered trucks have been traveling on our  supply routes from Düsseldorf to Bönen, Germany, and Barcelona, Spain.  The technology saves 20 percent of CO2 compared to conventional diesel  trucks. In 2021, the Düsseldorf site logistics operations commissioned  another LNG truck, which will also be used on the Düsseldorf–Bönen  supply route. Alongside transport to locations outside of our company’s premises, we  also make use of alternative transport modes for internal deliveries at  our sites. In the context of future mobility, we also seek to reduce trans- port-related emissions by generating a holistic, modern and sustainable  concept to foster our staff’s mobility. The contribution of our products and technologies  to climate change mitigation  Leverage along the value chain Together with our customers, consumers and suppliers, we aim to  achieve reductions in CO2 emissions. This includes emissions from the  raw materials we use. We also want to help customers and consumers  reduce CO2 emissions that are generated when they use our products  (called Scope 3 emissions). In addition, we want our products and  technologies to help to avoid CO2 emissions from being generated (called  Scope 4 emissions).  Through our brands and technologies, we make products that are used  and applied in ways that are directly linked to the use of energy, such as  detergents, shower gels, or hotmelt adhesives. We want to enable the  efficient use of energy with innovations that cut energy consumption and  the related CO2 footprint. On top of this, we use targeted communications  activities to encourage responsible-minded behavior when our products  are being used. The importance of the use phase is also shown in the     Henkel footprint calculator. It shows that not only companies, but  also each individual can make a contribution to greater sustainability  through their behavior. The calculator enables users to calculate their  personal carbon footprint in just a few minutes. By answering simple  questions, they can quickly estimate how much CO2 they generate  through their own lifestyle in the areas of housing, food, mobility or  vacations and leisure activities.  The initiative    “Be smarter. Save water.” from Beauty Care is one example.  Launched in 2016, this initiative involves our Schauma, Fa and Theramed  brands, and it aims to raise consumer awareness about the responsible  use of water as an important resource. Using less hot water also results  in less CO2 emissions. More than 190,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions  could be saved each year if consumers of our products shortened their  shower times by an average of 15 percent. The initiative includes  information provided on the product packaging and a related website.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  69 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Lower water temperatures when washing clothes also help to reduce  energy use and CO2 emissions. Through continuous research and develop- ment partnerships, as well as significant investments in new formulations,  we enable our consumers to achieve excellent washing results when  using increasingly concentrated dosages at lower temperatures – or even  when washing laundry in cold water. We raise awareness of the need to  save energy by placing the “be sustainable – wash cold” logo on our laundry  detergent packaging to draw consumers’ attention to this topic. The  potential for savings is enormous: if no water had to be heated for any  of the loads of laundry washed with our heavy-duty detergents, it would  be possible to avoid around 6.4 million metric tons of CO2 emissions  each year. Henkel’s CO2 savings portfolio In relation to the leverage points we have identified along our value  chain, we have set a target of saving 100 million metric tons of CO2  together with our customers, consumers and suppliers over the ten-year  period from 2016 to 2025. We have developed a CO2-savings portfolio 1 for  this purpose. The evaluation of the contributions in this portfolio is  based on a company-wide, standardized process that sets out the criteria  for the selection of the products and the calculation of CO2 emissions.  In the following pages, we have summarized some examples of our  products and technologies in the following six groups, which contribute  to → energy and material efficiency. With regard to the products sold  between 2016 and 2021, we enabled our customers and consumers to  reduce CO2 emissions by more than 68 million metric tons. In the future,  we plan to evaluate additional applications and further expand the  portfolio of products that contribute to CO2 savings in the use phase. New product developments One aspect of product optimization in our Adhesive Technologies business  unit is the switch from solvent-based adhesives to water-based solutions.  Water-based adhesives generate lower emissions of volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs) and also help to save CO2 emissions. We have developed  an innovative water-based adhesive technology for sports shoes that  enables to reduce CO2 emissions significantly during the bonding process. The    N.A.E. brand of solid shower care products gently cleanses and   supports the skin’s natural moisture balance. Due to its concentrated   formula, the solid shower care product is as economical as three liquid  shower gels (200 ml each), with lower weight and volume. This results in  lower CO2 emissions during transport. The packaging is also made from  FSC-certified paper and is fully recyclable.  Another innovation in the consumer goods business is the Love Nature  brand. This is the first brand of the recently established company, Love  Nature GmbH. It is a wholly-owned Henkel subsidiary and belongs to the  Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit. The new Love Nature detergents,  Universal Cactus Leaves and Color Cherry Blossom, are plant-based.  They have cleaning power at washing temperatures as low as 20 degrees  Celsius, which helps to save resources. As another product example, the  Love Nature bath cleaner can be applied either directly with a sponge or  with a spray attachment that is sold separately and can be reused. “Mein  Spülmittel” and “Mein Waschmittel” are also available for refilling at  Love Nature refill stations. 1 Further information can be found in the    methodology document for Scope 4. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  70 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Energy-saving building facades  Our thermal insulation composite systems for building facades help to cut  energy consumption by reducing the loss of heat. In addition, our “cool  roof” coatings, which reflect 87 percent more sunlight than conventional  roof coatings, reduce the consumption of energy because fewer air condi- tioning units are needed. The products sold in 2021 enabled our customers  to save around 6 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.  Repair and renovation  Our industrial coating products enable our customers to protect machinery  like pumps against wear and tear, and extend their lifetime. Machinery of  this kind is often operated continuously, which can cause abrasion and  corrosion – leading to production downtime. With our coatings, customers  are able to increase operational efficiency by reducing energy consumption  or making it possible to use the machine for longer. The products sold in  2021 enabled our customers to save around 400,000 metric tons of CO2  emissions. Lightweight vehicle designs We support our industrial customers with solutions for lightweight auto- motive designs. This includes pretreatments for metal surfaces that make  it possible to combine steel and aluminum, as well as liquid soundproofing  and 3D reinforcement technologies. These solutions all contribute to  weight reduction in the chassis and increase fuel efficiency. The solutions  sold in 2021 saved around 3.4 million metric tons of CO2 emissions for our  customers. Intelligent material replacement  Our adhesive solutions make it easy to sustainably replace emission-  intensive materials. An example of this is our Loctite Threadlocker. Even a  small quantity of this product matches the performance of conventional  steel washers for securing screws. This saves a significant amount of steel,  which is an emission-intensive material. Another example is our Liofol  Purbond HB adhesives, which are used to manufacture wood composites  and replace CO2-intensive concrete construction. The products sold in  2021 enabled our customers to save around 620,000 metric tons of CO2  emissions.  More efficient renewable energy  Our electro-conductive adhesives enable manufacturers of photovoltaic  modules to increase the efficiency of solar panels. More solar cells can be  installed in each module, and the loss of conductivity within the module  can be reduced. This enables the modules to generate more renewable  energy. The products that we sold in 2021 helped our customers to save  around 1.7 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.  Consuming less hot water  We help consumers by providing products that can reduce energy con- sumption for warming up water, as well as the related CO2 emissions. With  our Laundry &amp; Home Care products Colour Catcher laundry sheets and  Somat dishwasher cleaner, customers can reduce the number of washing  cycles. In addition, leave-in conditioners and dry shampoos from Beauty  Care do not require warm water for rinsing. The products sold in 2021  enabled consumers to save around 200,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions. Contributions to energy efficiency Contributions to material efficiency HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  71 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  “ To continue promoting the  circular economy in our  business operations, we are  focusing on reducing pro­ duction waste and increasing  recycling at our sites, as well  as on innovative, intelligent  and sustainable packaging  concepts.” BRUNO PIACENZA Executive Vice President   Laundry &amp; Home Care CIRCULAR ECONOMY Closing material cycles and increasing resource  efficiency Decoupling  economic growth from the consumption of finite natural  resources and developing a    circular economy are key approaches to  sustainable value creation.  Reducing or completely eliminating packaging material, especially for  our consumer goods, is the best way to minimize waste and the related  negative environmental effects. Our goal is to reduce the amount of  packaging material we use to a minimum – without compromising the   quality, performance or safety of our products. All of our    packaging is  designed to provide the level of performance consumers expect while  using the minimum amount of packaging and the most sustainable  materials possible.  At the same time, resource consumption can be reduced if materials are  kept within the cycles of the economy for as long as possible. As a result,  our mission is to include materials from sustainable sources into smart  designs to close the loop. To achieve this goal, our packaging engineers  work closely with partners along the entire value chain in the areas of  design methods, modern production technologies and sustainable  materials. In our Adhesive Technologies business unit, we also pursue the approach  of using our high-quality, innovative packaging adhesives to support  other companies in their implementation of a circular economy, for  example, by facilitating recyclability. We have also set the goal of helping  our industrial customers to make their products even more suitable for a   circular economy. To accomplish this, we are focusing on innovative  solutions that facilitate recycling and on the separation of materials to  make it possible to repair, reuse and refurbish products and product parts.  Henkel is also pursuing a variety of approaches to implement closed-loop  recycling in its own production processes. In this area, we emphasize  efficient waste management at our sites.

The packaging  quantity shown does not include the packaging of products from contract manufacturers and trade  products. What we want to achieve with packaging Our goals for packaging by 2025 are:  • 100 percent of Henkel’s packaging will be designed for recyclability or  reusability. 1  • We aim to reduce the amount of virgin plastics from fossil sources in  our consumer products by 50 percent. We will achieve this by increasing  the proportion of recycled plastic to more than 30 percent, by reducing  the plastic volume, and by increasingly using bio-based plastics.  • We want to help prevent waste from entering the environment. In  order to achieve this, we are supporting waste collection and recycling  initiatives. We invest in innovative solutions and technologies to pro- mote closed-loop recycling, and we aim to enable contact 2 with more  than 2 billion consumers per year by providing targeted information  about recycling. Alongside this, we aim for 100 percent of the paper and cardboard we use  for packaging to be made of recycled material or, where virgin fiber is  required, to come from fresh fiber originating from sustainable forestry.  We also want to remove and avoid polyvinyl chlorides (PVC) and other  substances of potential concern.  Promoting the circular economy  Our strategy to promote the    circular economy for packaging is centered  around three pillars: 1. Intelligent packaging design and reduction of packaging  material Reducing packaging material by using smart solutions is the best way  to minimize waste and the related negative environmental effects. Inno- vative design is essential in replacing virgin materials with recycled or  renewable alternatives wherever possible, which makes it possible to use  more sustainable material in smaller quantities. We also continuously  test new product solutions that have an impact on packaging. This effort  involves, for example, offering concentrates or switching from a liquid  product to a compact powder format.  Our experts rethink packaging concepts and assess further ways of  developing reusable and refillable solutions that place a stronger focus  on durability. They are also optimizing transport packaging and related  logistics. Our aim is that 100 percent of Henkel’s packaging will be  recyclable or reusable by 2025. At the end of 2021, this share was around  86 percent.1 We base our understanding of the concept of recyclable or  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  73 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Our packaging targets for 2025 Our Strategy Our Ambition Our Objectives * Excluding products where ingredients or residue may affect recyclability or pollute recycling streams.

By consistently applying these types of design principles to support recy- cling, we aim to overcome the barriers to recycling that are specific to  each category of packaging – such as flexible packaging, shrink-wrapping  and black packaging. At the same time, it is important that appropriate  systems for recycling packaging materials are in place. In order to quickly and reliably determine the recyclability of new packag- ing, starting from the product development phase, Henkel has developed  the software tool EasyD4R®. This is based on public and recognized sets  of criteria, such as those from Plastics Recyclers Europe. It is used by  Henkel throughout the company. The tool’s effectiveness was confirmed  in an independent test conducted by the Fraunhofer Institute for Environ- mental, Safety and Energy Technology (UMSICHT). Henkel developed its  software tool    EasyD4R® further in 2020. Alongside quickly and reliably  1  The reported recyclability value reflects the properties of the packaging, but not the recyclability in specific markets with differing waste collection and recovery systems. Plastic recyclability is based on a detailed  assessment, while the assessment for glass, paper and metal is based on an expert evaluation. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  74 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  checking the recyclability of plastic packaging, it is now also possible to  check packaging made of paper, cardboard, glass, aluminum, or tinplate.  This involved integrating design guidelines created by the University of  Applied Sciences, FH Campus Vienna, along with the German minimum  standard for packaging.   2. Use of material from sustainable sources Henkel constantly works on increasing the share of recycled content in  its packaging. We set the ambitious goal of expanding the share of recycled  plastic to more than 30 percent for all plastic packaging materials used  for our consumer goods products worldwide by 2025. At the end of 2021,  this share was around 18 percent. In addition, we will increasingly use bio-based plastic because it enables  more sustainable solutions. Provided they can deliver the same technical  performance as conventional polymers, they could offer a good alternative  and provide long-term benefits. We explicitly exclude sources of raw  materials that might be in competition with food. For this reason, we are  testing the use of second-generation bio-based feedstock material.  The most widely used packaging materials made from renewable raw  materials are paper and cardboard. It is our goal to obtain 100 percent  of the paper and cardboard that we use in our packaging from recycled  material or, where virgin fiber is required, from sustainable forestry  sources. A 2020 survey showed that our suppliers used 69 percent recycled  material in 2020. 86 % recyclable or reusable  material 18 % share of recyclate for  packaging Today, we only use PVC in a few exceptional cases for which we have  not yet found a workable alternative. Overall, materials containing PVC  currently make up less than 0.1 percent of our total global expenditure  on packaging. We continue to work toward our goal of fully removing  PVC from our packaging materials. 3. Closing the loop together We partner with organizations from along the packaging value chain to  drive progress in the infrastructure for recycling. Working in cooperation  with our retail partners, our aim is to help consumers use and dispose of  our products correctly, for example by placing special recycling symbols  on packaging. This targeted information about recycling will enable   contact with more than two billion consumers per year. Another option  to close the loop is to reuse packaging. We also want to maximize the  reusability of secondary and tertiary packaging that is typically used for  shelf displays or for logistical purposes. Refill packaging and reusable systems are also gaining importance  alongside recycling. In addition to new product forms and the use of  recyclable and recycled plastics in our packaging, we also use refillable  packaging and refill stations where consumers can fill laundry and   dishwashing detergents or shampoo into special bottles. When the  contents are used up, the packaging can be refilled again. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  75 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  One example of refill stations is the laundry and dishwashing detergents  from the Laundry &amp; Home Care brand Love Nature. In stores of several  drugstore and supermarket chains, “Mein Spülmittel” and “Mein Wasch- mittel” can be filled and easily refilled again and again. In 2020, this made  Love Nature the first detergent and cleaning brand to offer this  service  across all retailers in Germany. In 2021, there were a total of 48 refill  stations all over Germany. In addition, the bottle bodies are made of  100 percent recycled plastic and can be fully recycled.  The Beauty Care business unit also uses refill stations. The Beauty Care  Professional brand    Authentic Beauty Concept offers refill stations in  49 selected hair salons in Europe, including Germany and Austria, as  well as in Central Asia. Consumers can also use these refill stations to  refill their favorite products again and again in a suitable bottle.  Henkel is developing and testing new logos for product packaging to  promote sustainable purchasing habits and communicate how to recycle  properly. The logos indicate the percentage of recycled material or the  recyclability of the packaging, and some also help to ensure that the  product is recycled properly. Henkel also states the proportion of  → Social Plastic® in its product packaging. In addition, Henkel is a part- ner of the    How2Recycle program in the United States to strengthen  consumer awareness about how packaging cycles can be closed. As part  of the  program, we create more transparency about different recycling  options using an explanatory logo on the product packaging. The program  is a project within the scope of the    Sustainable Packaging Coalition,  an association of industrial companies, research institutes and public  authorities that aims to increase the general understanding of sustain- ability related to packaging and smarter packaging solutions. Using the slogan    “Be smarter. Recycle.,” the Beauty Care business unit  provides information about the correct handling of waste and the   recyclability of various types of packaging. In this way, we want to raise  consumer awareness of the concept of a    circular economy. Our contribution to the circularity of industrial products  Our Adhesive Technologies business unit makes it possible to keep  high-quality materials in circulation and turn waste into valuable  resources. By combining our expertise in materials with our innovative  technologies, we provide solutions that play an important role in the  transition to a circular economy and are driving a rethink in industrial  design and production. Our approach to promoting a circular economy  is centered around the following factors.  • Recyclability: Our easily recyclable or reusable packaging design  solutions deliver recyclability at the end of the value chain. We are  developing adhesives for this purpose, for example, which are optimized  for recycling PET bottles and substantially improve the recycling rate  and quality by ensuring that the bottle label can be removed cleanly.  We also offer our customers solutions for the innovative redesign  of products and packaging. One example of this is our novel    EPIX  coatings for the development of sustainable and safe food packaging  based on paper. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  76 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS   • Debonding: A circular value chain depends on recognizing and con- serving the value of materials. Debonding makes it possible to repair,  reuse and recycle products and product parts, and to separate materials  that are not suitable for collective recycling. As such, this is an import- ant lever for extending the useful life of products and recovering the  value of materials at the end of a product’s life cycle. Our adhesive  solutions contribute to these efforts by facilitating product repair. Our     Teroson hotmelt solutions are one example. Using these solutions,  headlights can be opened up for lens component repair, such as for  replacing an LED module, without damaging the lens or housing.   At the end of the value chain, our technologies, such as adhesives that  enable material separation in multilayer flexible packaging, support  the separation of materials that cannot be recycled collectively.  • Renewable carbon: Henkel has been a founding member of the     Renewable Carbon Initiative since 2020. This aims to promote  acceleration of the transition from fossil-based to renewable carbon for  all organic chemicals and materials. Henkel Adhesive Technologies is  also carrying out pioneering work with new solutions for adhesives,  sealants and functional coatings that replace fossil carbon-based raw  materials with renewable materials. This reduces the carbon footprint  of our products and supports our customers in reducing their emissions  along the value chain. In addition, we contribute to a circular economy  by reducing the consumption of resources.  We are committed to using recycled materials as a renewable carbon  source, both for our product packaging and as part of our product   formulas. For example, the packaging material of one of our    Pattex  insulating foams is made from 25 percent recycled steel, and 98 percent  post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic in the cap. Additionally, 16 percent  of the ingredients are derived from recycled material.  • Bio-based adhesives: We have also developed a range of bio-based  adhesives. To this end, we are working with our suppliers to advance  the concept of mass balance. This is a transparent model for tracking  the amount of certified and non-certified material along the entire  production process. Because the principle of mass balance enables the  drop-in of renewable carbon-based raw materials into existing processes,  it is an important step for a gradual transition to the use of renewable  resources. In 2021, three production sites of our Adhesive Technologies  business unit were fully certified under    ISCC PLUS, a globally recog- nized certification system for mass balance.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  77 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Partnerships along the value chain A key partner on the journey toward better recycling of waste and estab- lishing a circular economy is the social enterprise    Plastic Bank, which  works to reduce plastic waste in nature, including in the world’s oceans,  while at the same time offering new opportunities to people who live in  poverty – especially in countries where recycling infrastructure for waste  disposal is non-existent or inadequate. In 2017, Henkel became the first  major global consumer goods company to partner with Plastic Bank. In  2021, Henkel and Plastic Bank started to expand the recycling infrastructure  in Egypt, opening ten collection centers in the Cairo area. This commitment  will be steadily expanded over the next few years. By 2023, the goal is for  the partners to achieve an annual capacity for 5,000 metric tons of plastic.  Plastic Bank is building recycling ecosystems in countries that lack   adequate waste management infrastructure. Collectors receive compen- sation for the materials they collect, which helps them meet the basic  needs of their families – including food, cooking fuel such as charcoal  for preparing daily meals, and paying for schooling or health insurance.  The plastic collected is reprocessed as Social Plastic®, which can be used  again in products and packaging as part of a closed-loop supply chain.  Henkel and Plastic Bank aim to create around 1,000 jobs in Egypt over a  period of two years by building a long-term recycling infrastructure. This  will have a direct positive impact on more than 4,000 Egyptian citizens. Henkel already uses Social Plastic® in a number of its packaging products.  Hair and body care brand Nature Box was the first cosmetics brand to use  Social Plastic® as a packaging material for its entire bottle portfolio. All  shampoo bottle bodies are made of 100 percent Social Plastic®. In our  Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit, the    Pro Nature product range has  switched to PET bottles made from 100 percent recycled plastic, up to  50 percent of which is Social Plastic®. The bottle body of limited edition  Pril dishwashing liquid, launched in 2021, is made from 100 percent  Social Plastic® and the bottle cap is now made from 84 percent recycled  material. In 2021, 723 metric tons of Social Plastic® were processed at  Henkel, making a total of more than 1,480 metric tons processed since the  partnership began in 2017. Henkel’s experts are engaged in several cross-industry initiatives to drive  innovation in packaging development and to find effective solutions that  can be developed on a large scale. Our membership in the    New Plastics  Economy (NPEC), an initiative of the    Ellen MacArthur Foundation  that brings together different stakeholders to shape the future of plastics  and create momentum for a circular economy, is an important example  of our engagement in this area. Other initiatives include the    Alliance  to End Plastic Waste (AEPW),    European Plastics Pact and    U.S. Plastics  Pact,    CEFLEX and the    Circular Economy Initiative Deutschland.  The    Plastic Waste Coalition of Action was formed from the    Consumer  Goods Forum (CGF) in 2020. In this coalition, Henkel is working with  35 other companies on the basis of Golden Design Rules to develop a  more circular approach to the design and processing of plastic packaging  in the consumer goods industry. In 2020, Henkel was also a founding  723 metric tons of Social Plastic®  processed at Henkel 10 collection centers  in Egypt HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  78 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  member of the    UN Treaty on plastic pollution. Together with 28 other  major global companies, Henkel will endorse a business manifesto  against plastic pollution. We have also teamed up with different organizations that are working  on improving recycling infrastructure to enable a circular economy.  Appropriate systems for recycling packaging materials are not in place in  many areas, especially in developing countries. For example, Henkel has  been working with    TerraCycle in a number of countries since 2016.  This organization offers recycling solutions for materials that are difficult  to recycle. It is also important to work hand-in-hand with our retail   partners to promote a functioning circular economy. This includes  member ship in the Recyclate Forum.  In 2021, the new    Cospatox Consortium evolved from the Recyclate  Forum. It includes distributors, manufacturers, recyclers, packaging   producers, and other members. The abbreviation is short for Cosmetic  Packaging Toxicology. In this project, industrial companies are working  together to develop a standard for high-quality plastic recyclates for   cosmetics packaging, and detergents and cleaning products.  Innovations for the future  • In 2019, Henkel and the packaging manufacturer Alpla jointly produced  bottle bodies based on chemically recycled plastic for the first time.  Plastic waste that is not recycled by mechanical recycling can be  returned to the cycle through chemical recycling. Chemical recycling  can complement mechanical recycling. By using chemical recycling,  material made from fossil resources can be replaced by recycled material  made from plastic waste. The pilot project using Perwoll bottles is part  of    BASF’s ChemCycling project.  • For many years, black plastic packaging posed a challenge to the   recycling value chain due to the colorant that was previously used to  make it black. Together with its supplier Ampacet, a global masterbatch   producer, Henkel began working on an innovative solution for black  plastic packaging that is fully recyclable in 2019. The new packaging  material uses an alternative black colorant that is carbon-free, so that  bottles can be returned to the value chain after use. The    Cyclos-HTP  Institute, which specializes in classifying, assessing and certifying the  recyclability of packaging and products, has confirmed that Henkel’s  bottles, in black color and carbon-free, are fully detectable and sortable.

The  KeelClip™ replaces the outer packaging for beverage cans made from   single-use plastic with solutions made from recycled cardboard. Persil Eco Power Bars These compact detergent bars help to reduce packaging waste. The product  contains 97 percent less plastic packaging per wash load than for conven- tional liquid detergents. In addition, the packaging is made of recycled and  recyclable cardboard. The film used for the tabs is biodegradable and  100 percent water-soluble.  Nature Box as recyclable refills Selected shampoos and shower gels from our natural cosmetics brand  Nature Box (like the nourishing repair shampoo Avocado or the revitalizing  shower gel Pomegranate) have been available in refill packs in stores since  2021. The refill packaging can be recycled. Manufacturing these packages  requires around 74 percent less plastic than bottles of the same capacity.  • One of the most pressing challenges on the journey to a circular economy  for packaging is the need to improve the sorting of consumer waste  through accurate identification. One particularly promising approach  here is to capture and decode digital watermarks using a high-resolution  camera mounted on the waste sorting system. Depending on the marking  that is picked up, the system can then sort the packaging waste into the  appropriate categories of material. This would lead to better and more  precisely sorted flows of waste, as well as higher quality recycled  material. Since September 2020, Henkel has been one of more than  85 companies and organizations in the new    HolyGrail 2.0 initiative,  which is a pioneering initiative for digital watermarks for better  recycling of packaging. Following the first HolyGrail project, which was  led by the    Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the next phase, HolyGrail  2.0, was implemented on a much larger scale and scope. This included  commissioning an industrial test facility to determine how effective  watermarking technology is in delivering more accurate  sorting of  packaging waste and higher quality recycling. It also involved conduct- ing a large-scale assessment of the business viability of this technology.  Henkel is cooperating in the tests with packaging for its Vernel and  Pattex products. The aim is to gain more insight into how digital  watermarking technology could improve the sorting of PET bottles  with perforated sleeves and PE cartridges for silicone sealant. Over  100,000 packaging samples and a total of 250 different packages were  successfully tested in 2021. The recognition rate was more than 97 per- cent. Henkel is using digital watermarking technology in a product  line for its fabric softener brand Vernel.

In January 2019, Henkel invested in  the    Circularity European Growth Fund I LP, an impact fund managed  by Circularity Capital. This investment of 5 million pounds sterling enables  Henkel to drive its venturing activities forward while also supporting the  development of a circular economy.  Henkel invested in the recycling start-up    Saperatec in 2019. The recycling  specialist has developed a new type of patented technology that can be  used, for example, to separate and recycle aluminum-containing flexible  composite packaging. In July 2020, Henkel became the first company in the world to issue a     “Plastic Waste Reduction Bond”. The bond is a private placement with  the Japanese insurance companies Dai-ichi Life and Dai-ichi Frontier Life  as anchor investors. The proceeds will be invested in projects participating  in Henkel’s activities to reduce plastic waste.  Reducing production waste We aim to reduce production waste and promote a circular economy in  our operations. We drive this process by systematically identifying  waste streams and creating closed-loop systems where possible. We are  focusing on increasing recycling at our sites and working closely with  our partners in the value chain – suppliers, customers, and recycling and  disposal companies. Our initiatives are centered around three key areas:   • Reducing material consumption and waste generation.  • Reusing materials.  • Recycling materials.  In line with our goal of reducing our environmental footprint, we intend  to reduce the total volume of waste* by 50 percent per metric ton of   product by 2025 compared to a 2010 baseline. We achieved a reduction  of 42 percent in 2021. We are also reaffirming our ambition to achieve  closed-loop management of waste materials in our production by 2030. A further goal is to stop disposing of production waste* in landfills at all  production sites, including for our industrial business, by 2030. Overall,  78 percent of our production sites had already achieved this target by  the end of 2021. These include the adhesives plants in Épernon, France;  North Kansas City, USA; Bangpoo, Thailand; Zuhai, China; Quilicura,  Chile; Elgin, Scotland, and Montornès del Vallès, Spain. This success is  based primarily on partnerships with local waste management service  providers.  78 % of sites with no   landfill waste – 42 % waste* HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  81 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Make waste streams transparent and share best practices We have been successfully implementing global waste mapping initiatives  for many years. A digital tool is used to document waste flows, types of  waste and disposal/recycling paths, which is also the basis for our other  measures. We record more than 600 waste streams worldwide in the  Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit alone, and we present this information  transparently to all relevant stakeholders. We integrate this data into our  “digital backbone” so that company managers can analyze and compare  data on locations and development over time.  We see this as an essential mechanism for facilitating the exchange of  best practices and as a milestone in creating transparency worldwide. This  transparency also includes a detailed overview of the entire waste life  cycle – from generation to disposal. The Adhesive Technologies business  unit also uses a system for the classification, compliance  testing,  reporting and control of waste streams for its production plants and  research centers. This makes it possible to identify differences between  sites that generate similar types of waste. We then develop  specific  improvement actions and share best practices throughout the company.  Raw material packaging accounts for a significant share of the total  amount of waste generated at our sites. For this reason, our Adhesive  Technologies business unit has launched an initiative to reuse materials.  In this way, we are striving to implement circular thinking and reduce  packaging waste in cooperation with our suppliers. In 2021, projects  under this initiative led to a reduction of – 4 percent compared to 2020.  The initiative will continue in 2022 and will be extended to all regions.  Raw material packaging frequently consists of drums and pallets, big  bags and other containers used to transport goods. We aim to actively  manage use cycles and reuse these materials. At our adhesives site in  Bogotá, Colombia, we implemented a reverse logistics program with our  raw material suppliers. This program reuses the metal drums that are  used for transporting chemicals, and avoids sending empty drums to be  disposed of as hazardous waste. In Chile and Brazil, we recycled more  than 7,000 additional pallets through an initiative in 2021.  The Beauty Care site in Geneva, New York, has undertaken another   collaborative project with a waste management company to reuse  wastewater as cooling water. This initiative reduced the amount of  wastewater disposal by 2,000 metric tons from January to September  2021, and our partner avoided the use of fresh water. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  82 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  NATURAL RESOURCES Biodiversity and responsible resource management Growing consumption and resource scarcity due to an increasing global  population and accelerated economic activity are putting more and  more pressure on ecosystems. The negative effects are already being felt:  according to a report published by    IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-  Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services), human activities  are threatening nearly 1 million species with extinction. Conserving species  diversity and biodiversity is important to Henkel, as intact ecosystems  and soil biodiversity are essential as a basis for sustainable agriculture and  the use of raw materials in production. Our 2021 stakeholder survey  results showed that biodiversity is also becoming an increasingly  important issue for our partners and other stakeholders.  We follow current efforts to protect biodiversity and deforestation very  closely, such as the EU’s Deforestation Regulation. We continue to  develop our approach in line with the resulting expectations. This also  includes dialog and collaboration with external stakeholders, as well as  industry initiatives such as the European brand association    AIM. In  September 2020, we signed up to the    Business for Nature’s Call to Action  to urge governments to incorporate nature in their policymaking. We  also participated in the    Consumer Goods Forum initiative against  worldwide deforestation and for the protection of biodiversity. And we  are working with the development organization    Solidaridad to   support smallholders in the palm oil and palm kernel oil sector in projects  that promote climate-smart agricultural practices.  Our → sustainability strategy aims to protect and restore biodiversity –  with a particular focus on forests, land and water. In addition to applying  these principles to the activities at our own sites, we also promote the  responsible management of raw materials and the use of renewable inputs.  In 2021, we started to identify the potential impacts on biodiversity of our  production sites by identifying and mapping their geographical location  and assessing their proximity to important biodiversity areas. This  will enable us to develop comprehensive measures and programs. We  are also participating in a research project by the international consultancy     Globe Scan, which is designed to better understand challenges in the  context of nature and biodiversity, and to identify solutions to protect and  restore nature. “ Protecting natural   resources and biodiversity  is important to us – as it  is to our customers and   consumers. Our sustainability  strategy picks up on this  ambition and is supported  by the contributions of our  brands, products and  services.” WOLFGANG KÖNIG Executive Vice President Beauty Care HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  83 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  aloe vera. We are also working to further increase the proportion of  ingredients based on renewable raw materials in our cosmetic products  and to use fewer fossil resources, wherever this is possible and appropriate.  As an example, we have been using potato starch in our new Taft mousse  since 2021. Another example of our responsible use of raw materials is  the use of guar and guar derivatives as a key source of plant-based raw  materials. Guar is a nourishing ingredient that is used, for example, in  hair care products from our natural cosmetics brand    Nature Box.  Henkel’s Nature Box brand supports guar farmers in the desert region  of Bikaner in Rajasthan, India. They learn sustainable guar farming  methods and receive assistance in planting their own vegetable gardens.  Nature Box also supports sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil   production together with Solidaridad. Renewable raw materials are historically one of the major sources of raw  materials for laundry detergents and household cleaners. For example,  soap – which has traditionally been used to wash laundry as well as for  personal hygiene – has been made from vegetable or animal oils and fats.  Today, most laundry detergents and household cleaners consist of a large  number of ingredients, each with its own special function. Most bulk  ingredients of detergents and household cleaners are inorganic and  therefore cannot be replaced by ingredients based on renewable raw  materials. Surfactants are an important exception. They consist of a lipo- philic (fat-loving) part, which is obtained from vegetable or mineral oils,  and a hydrophilic (water-loving) part, which is usually based on mineral  oil or is inorganic. Surfactants like alkyl polyglycosides that are produced  only from renewable raw materials are the exception. To achieve the best  washing performance, we use a mixture of different surfactants. In more  than half of them, the lipophilic part is based on renewable raw materials.  A responsible approach to raw materials Use of nature-based raw materials  Henkel is committed to responsible management of raw materials, and  especially the conservation of natural resources and biodiversity. We  use ingredients based on renewable raw materials to optimize the overall  characteristics of our products, wherever this is compatible with environ- mental, economic and social considerations. Renewable raw materials  are already key ingredients in many of our products, such as detergents,  soaps, shampoos, glue sticks and wallpaper adhesives. We are also   committed to environmental and social considerations when purchasing  renewable raw materials.  Many of our consumer and industrial adhesives are based on nature-based  raw materials, such as plant-based oils and their derivatives, as well as  tree resin and carbohydrates like starch, sugar and cellulose. Our    Pritt  glue stick, which was relaunched in 2021, is formulated with 97 percent  natural ingredients (including water). We also pioneer new solutions  for adhesives, sealants and coatings that replace fossil raw materials  with materials made from biomass. For example, we have developed a  high-performance hotmelt adhesive made of over 80 percent 1 bio-based  materials and with a significantly reduced carbon footprint. We work  with our suppliers to ensure sustainable sourcing of natural resources. Nature-based raw materials are used in all product groups in cosmetics –  not only in our soaps, shampoos and shower gels, but also in styling  products. We refer to the use of individual nature-based active ingredients  or fragrances if these are associated with specific properties – for example,  the care properties of shea butter and yogurt or the soothing effect of  1  Combination of direct bio-based and certified mass balance transfer raw materials based on internal analyses HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  84 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Responsible use of palm oil and palm kernel oil Palm oil, palm kernel oil and their derivatives are two of the most  important renewable raw materials we use to manufacture ingredients  for our laundry detergents, household cleaners and cosmetic products.  We use less than 0.2 percent of the palm oil and palm  kernel oil produced  worldwide. In particular, we use palm kernel oil as the basis for surfactants.  Palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the world and comes  from a highly efficient crop: for the same yield, oil palm requires about  three times less land than rapeseed and as much as six times less than  soybeans. Unfortunately, palm oil cultivation, when done unsustainably,  is often associated with large-scale deforestation of rainforests.  For this reason, our goal is to ensure that the ingredients for our products  are made from    sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil. With this in  mind, we work with the companies from which we source our raw  materials and with other partners to exert influence on the palm oil supply  chain, from smallholders to consumers. With this approach, we seek to  further develop our supply chains to ensure full NDPE (No Deforestation,  No Peat, No Exploitation) compliance, and to ensure that the palm oils  and palm kernel oils that go into our products are not associated with  the deforestation of primary or secondary rainforests. Our palm oil  strategy through 2025 comprises three areas:  This is the result of Henkel’s many years of experience with ingredients  based on plant-based oils. 43 percent 1 of the surfactants for Henkel’s  laundry detergents and household cleaners are now based on renewable  raw materials. The remaining share is accounted for by inorganic and  mineral-oil-based ingredients. Zero net deforestation as a goal Forests function as carbon sinks and are key to protecting biodiversity.  They also provide us with wood and other raw materials. We are committed  to sourcing our raw materials sustainably and not through deforestation.  Our goal is to prevent the deforestation of primary and secondary forests  with significant ecological value. These include peat lands and other  high-carbon stock areas. This is why under our    Responsible Sourcing  Policy we are committed to zero net deforestation, and expect our  suppliers to support this aim.  We have been partnering with the international, non-profit organization     Rainforest Alliance since 2021 to minimize nature-related risks in  our value chain. The goal is to continue to develop our due diligence  approach to preventing deforestation, as well as to draft a comprehensive  policy in this area. We are also partners of the    Tropical Forest Alliance,  a multi-stakeholder partnership platform hosted by the    World Economic  Forum (WEF). Their primary goal is to promote deforestation- free supply  chains for the production of palm oil and palm kernel oil, beef, soy,  paper and pulp.  1 Calculation based on data of 2019.

Establish full traceability and transparency of the palm oil and  palm kernel oil used in our products: From our activities, we have  learned that there is a need for further optimization with regard to  transparency and traceability, especially for palm-kernel-oil-based  derivatives, and that cross-industry initiatives are necessary to make  the achievement of the “zero net deforestation” target verifiable. In  2021, we increased the traceability rate to the mill to 84 percent and  the traceability rate to the plantation to 42 percent by engaging with  our suppliers to map our joint palm-based supply chain.1 We did this  with the support of an external sustainability consultancy. As part of  our supplier management activities, we  collaborate intensively  with our strategic suppliers to ensure the procurement of sustain- able raw materials. We use the Sustainable Palm Index (SPI) to assess  the progress of our suppliers with respect to their level of supply chain  knowledge, sustainable sourcing practices and compliance with the  NDPE Principles. We once again used the SPI to create a compliance  profile of our major suppliers of palm-oil-based raw materials in 2021.  This tool helps us to identify potential improvements and define  action plans together with our suppliers.  42 % traceability of palm (kernel)  oil back to the plantation 84 % traceability of palm   (kernel) oil back to the mill 1.  Cover 100 percent of our demand with oils that are certified or  externally confirmed as responsibly sourced: We plan to continue  to expand the certification of our raw materials in accordance with     RSPO’s Mass Balance model. We are also aiming at certification  according to the RSPO’s Segregation model for the portion of palm oil  and palm kernel oil that is directly sourced. We have achieved con- siderable progress in this area in recent years with a wide range of  measures. In fiscal year 2021, we were able to source 93 percent of our  total demand for palm oil, palm kernel oil and its derivatives as certified  raw materials in line with the    RSPO’s Mass Balance supply chain  model. Derivatives account for the majority of the palm-based materials  used by Henkel. Despite this strong achievement, we still encounter a  lack of availability of RSPO-certified materials in some of the markets  where we operate and for a number of selected derivatives of palm-  kernel-oil-based raw materials used in small quantities. In these   circumstances, we maintain an intensive dialog with our suppliers to  look for solutions or we rely on the import of raw materials. These  challenges continued to be compounded in 2021 by shortages in RSPO  certification as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are   confident that we will make further progress in the years ahead, yet we  must acknowledge that full transition of our global supply chains to  sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil remains challenging. 1 The survey was conducted in 2021 based on the supplier data for 2020. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  86 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  friendly agriculture, along with exerting an influence on policy and  involving stakeholders. Many of our projects were successfully completed  in 2020 and 2021. Last year, we were engaged in projects in Colombia,  Nicaragua and Nigeria. Building on the very good collaboration with  Solidaridad, we have developed specific plans for the next few years to  expand the commitment further.  Our project in Nicaragua, which was successfully completed in 2021,  focused on creating a 100-percent-RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil  sector involving smallholders. The project has accompanied 173 farmers  on their journey to certification and led to the creation of the first associ- ation of palm oil producers in Nicaragua. This enables smallholder farm- ers to cooperate in the transition to the RSPO standard and generate RSPO  credits. There was also an average yield increase of at least 13 percent.     Solidaridad’s National Initiatives for Sustainable and Climate-Smart  Oil Palm Smallholders (NISCOPS) and the    IDH Sustainable Trade   Initiative contribute to the attainment of self-sufficiency in palm oil  production in Nigeria. This includes teaching climate-smart agricultural  practices as well as the sustainable intensification of farms. This improves  the productivity and livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Henkel’s com- mitment helped to increase the capacity of farmers in Akwa Ibom and  Cross River states. The initiative involves the technical upgrading of  two mills and the construction of tree nurseries to grow improved  varieties that will increase crop yields and prevent deforestation through  the planting of new trees. The nurseries will be accompanied by training  courses that teach sustainable land use practices and topics related to  forest conservation.  3.  Improve the livelihoods of smallholders and protection of nature:  We are building on the success of our collaborative projects with  smallholders and will continue strengthening our commitment to  integrate raw materials delivered by these smallholders into our  supply chain. Greater consideration is also given to ecological aspects  while supporting climate-friendly agriculture and a positive impact on  biodiversity. To date, around 36,400 smallholders have been reached  on some 340,000 hectares under cultivation.   Support for smallholder farmers Smallholders produce about 40 percent of the world’s palm oil, yet  their productivity and the quality of their products are much lower com- pared to large plantations. They often lack access to technical knowledge  and financial services that are crucial to improving their production.  Some farmers are also concerned that access to the palm oil market will  be limited if their harvests do not meet the criteria set out by the RSPO.  This is because many major buyers of palm oil have committed to buying  only oil products that are certified as sustainable. In collaboration with  the development organization    Solidaridad, Henkel is addressing these  challenges. We have partnered with Solidaridad on initiatives in Colombia, Ghana,  Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua and Nigeria since 2013. The  focus was on training in best practice approaches, including climate-  ~36,400 smallholders reached HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  87 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Reducing paper consumption, ending deforestation Demand for paper products is increasing worldwide. According to the     World Wildlife Fund (WWF), 13 to 15 percent of all wood consump- tion is used in the production of pulp, paper and packaging products. If  wood is sourced and produced in an unsustainable manner, it can lead  to deforestation in areas of high ecological value. We aim to source  100 percent of the paper and board material used in our packaging as  recycled material or – where the use of virgin fiber is required – from  sustainably managed forestries. All suppliers of paper-based packaging materials must confirm that  they are compliant with our procurement guidelines as part of our  onboarding process. We expect them to support our goal of net zero  deforestation. Creating more transparency in the supply chain is focus of  our cooperation with our suppliers of paper-based packaging. This  involves the traceability of the materials we buy, especially in the case  of suppliers that source virgin fibers from high-risk countries. In these  circumstances, we work together on measures to minimize risk.  We conducted a comprehensive survey of our main suppliers in the   corrugated board and printed paper sector in 2020. This approach pro- vided transparency on the business conduct of those tier one suppliers  which represent 93 percent of our spend in this area. The results showed  that 69 percent of our suppliers were using recycled material in 2020.  Around 86 percent of suppliers use at least one or more certification   systems.    FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certification was most  commonly cited, followed by    PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement  of Forest Certification) and    SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative). Other initiatives for sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil  We support the physical transformation toward the use of certified  products in the industry and the shift in the market toward certified  sustainable palm oil products. A multi-stakeholder approach is at the  core of our initiative for sustainable management of palm oil and palm  kernel oil. Through partnerships, projects and dialog, we engage with  key players and are expanding our contribution to sustainable practices  in the palm oil industry.  Henkel is a committed founding member of the    Forum for Sustainable  Palm Oil (FONAP) in Germany and is a member of several of its working  groups. This collaboration between companies, NGOs, associations and  political bodies is pursuing the goal of significantly increasing the pro- portion of  sustainably produced palm oil, while also improving existing  standards and certifications. We are also actively involved in the Round- table on Sustainable Palm Oil (   RSPO). The RSPO standard increasingly  includes compliance with human rights along the entire supply chain, in  addition to environmental aspects. In April 2021, our Global Supply  Chain organization was again successfully certified in line with the  RSPO’s supply chain standard. Henkel, along with other leading consumer goods manufacturers and  companies in the oleochemical industry, is a member of the cross-industry     Action for Sustainable Derivatives (ASD) initiative. The primary  objective of the initiative is to generate more transparency in the complex  value chain for palm derivatives.

We  recognize the importance of using this resource responsibly, particularly  as healthy water ecosystems are key to protecting biodiversity. Water  plays an important role along our value chain. We use water for our  production processes and as an ingredient for our products, and many  of our products also require water in the use phase.  For this reason, reducing water usage during the production and use of  our products is an important aim for us. In order to identify suitable  approaches for improvements in this area, we have worked with various  stakeholders in recent years. In 2021, for example, we reassessed our  impact on water along the value chain with the support of external part- ners as part of our sustainability strategy development. This included  examining the water footprint of raw materials, our production processes  and the consumption of water during the use of our products, as well as  the treatment of wastewater. Water risk analysis The global availability of water is affected by regional and seasonal  scarcities. There are also differences in the availability and performance  of wastewater treatment facilities, as well as differences in the specific  environmental characteristics of individual water bodies. To identify  production sites that are located in water-stressed regions, in 2021 we  conducted water scarcity research on a global scale using the    World  Resource Institute’s (WRI)    Aqueduct™ tool. We took into account  qualitative, quantitative and regulatory risks for all sites, as well as water  risk forecasts for the year 2030. Each production site was assessed, taking  into account its precise geo-coordinates and nearby water basins and  watersheds.  We have been reporting our water consumption in hydrologically  stressed areas since 2020 and have reaffirmed our ambition to focus on  saving water in regions where water is in short supply. We conducted  workshops with partners on the topic of water in 2021 to reflect this  ambition. For example, at the    Forum for the Future, we reflected on  risks, opportunities and future scenarios to help us further develop our  global strategy. One of the main results is that we aim to achieve circular  water use at key manufacturing sites by 2030. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  89 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Saving water during production We set the goal of using 35 percent less water per ton of product by 2025.  By the end of 2021, Henkel had saved 28 percent.   To achieve our goal, each production site carefully examines all options  for reducing water consumption and avoiding wastewater. Wastewater  from industrial applications is disposed of properly in accordance with  legal requirements. Where applicable, Henkel provides pretreatment with  state-of-the-art technologies for removing contaminants.  We source a significant proportion of our water from local supply  networks. We also use water from other sources, such as rainwater or  groundwater, to reflect local conditions. For example, to save water, our  Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit uses online metering systems and  our Digital Backbone to identify optimization potential and increased  water consumption. Additionally, we continuously review and optimize  the amount of water needed to clean production lines when changing  the product that is being manufactured on the line. In doing this, we take  into account specific characteristics of the product that is being manu- factured before and after the changeover.  – 28 % water use* At our site in Vienna, Austria, we began replacing the well water used  for cooling with a central, closed-loop cooling system, which saves us  up to 5,000 cubic meter of fresh water per month. This site is our show- case project for the use of recycled water in production plants. At the     Humen site in China, an additional filter system was installed for the  discharge of wastewater in 2021. This system allows the treated water to  be reused in cooling towers, saving around 4,000 cubic meter of fresh  water each year. Water treatment is an important process for us because we need a certain  quality of water for our production. At our sites in Ferentino, Italy, and in  6th of October, Egypt, we have invested in our existing water treatment  plants so that we can treat wastewater directly on site. This is the first  step to being able to use the purified water again in future phases of the  project. We also commissioned a new water treatment facility at our site  in Jundiaí, Brazil, which processes rainwater for reuse in applications such  as irrigation or for flushing toilets. This will reduce water consumption  and the amount of wastewater produced by 1,000 cubic meter annually.  At our site in Ankara, Turkey, we have similarly launched a pilot project  to collect rainwater with the aim of saving up to 1,700 cubic meter of  water per year.  * Base year 2010 HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  90 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Conserving resources together with our consumers We want to encourage the responsible use of our products to reduce water  consumption. Life cycle analyses have shown that more than 90 percent  of the water and energy consumption of our rinse-off products occurs  during use. That is why our Beauty Care business unit leverages its brands  to raise awareness among customers about sustainable product use. We  do this by providing information on the products and on a comprehen- sive website, and through supporting measures in sales outlets as part of  our    “Be smarter.” initiative to explain how consumers can help conserve  resources. The focus here is on the area of water and, in particular, the  energy- intensive provision of hot water. The “Be smarter.” initiative now  includes 28 brands and more than 100 countries. We are also developing  products that do not require the use of water. Our leave-in conditioners  and dry shampoos do not require water for rinsing, for example. Preventing water pollution from microplastics  We are committed to ensuring that our consumer products do not cause  any    microplastics to enter the environment. We understand micro- plastics to refer to solid, insoluble plastic particles that are five millimeters  or smaller and are not biodegradable. These can enter rivers and oceans  via wastewater and accumulate there permanently. Several years ago, we stopped using microbeads in cosmetics, detergents  and cleaning products, which were used as exfoliating or abrasive   particles in certain products. In addition, we have been dealing more  closely with solid synthetic plastics. These solid synthetic plastics are  used as opacifiers in consumer products to give them a creamy white  appearance. In our cosmetic products, the switch to opacifiers that have a natural  origin or are biodegradable was nearly completed in spring 2021. The  last remaining  cosmetic products will be switched by the end of the  first quarter of 2022. For our other consumer products we replaced  opacifiers with poor biodegradability with a newly developed opacifier  with improved biodegradability in the second quarter of 2021. We   continue to pursue the technical challenge of using only natural or   biodegradable opacifiers and eliminating solid synthetic plastics as  soon as a suitable alternative is available for this purpose. Certain types of perfume encapsulation are also under discussion because  they are considered as microplastics. These encapsulated perfume oils  are used in fabric softeners and certain detergents to create long-lasting  fragrances with significantly less perfume than would otherwise be  required. We are already working together with our technology partners  to replace all synthetic perfume encapsulations with biodegradable  materials by the end of 2022 at the latest. We have already achieved success in using soluble, biodegradable  materials for encapsulation in other areas; for example, in the shells of  our pre-dosed liquid detergent capsules and dishwasher detergent tabs,  which consist of soluble polyvinyl alcohol foil.  To prevent improper disposal of our plastic product packaging from  contributing to ocean pollution, we are striving for a    circular economy  for plastics that is similar to existing systems. We will continue to  increase the recyclability of our packaging, while also increasing the  percentage of recycled material in our packaging.

We also seek to engage and empower them to become  actively involved in sustainability in their work environment and in their  private lives.  This initiative builds on our Sustainability Ambassador Program, which  has trained more than 50,000 motivated employees at our sites around  the world since 2012. Alongside an eLearning program on our core global  learning platform, this approach was specifically implemented through  team training sessions, which were conducted worldwide in more than  30 different languages using standardized training materials. In addition  to discussing the fundamental principles of sustainability – from concept  to key global challenges – the training material also explains how Henkel  is responding to these challenges and implementing  sustainability.  “ The success of our sus­ tainability transformation  greatly depends on our  employees. They contribute  to the sustainable develop­ ment of our business every  day, driving the fundamental  change toward a future  worth living.” SYLVIE NICOL Member of the Management Board HR/Infrastructure Services Modern and attractive employer Henkel aims to create sustainable value with its business activities.  This purpose unites all of our employees. In order to continue to be inter- nationally successful, we want to acquire, develop and retain the best   talents for Henkel. We offer an inspiring and challenging working envi- ronment with flexible, digital work and a value-oriented leadership  style. Our corporate culture is based on continuous open feedback and  on appreciation for outstanding performance – both through attractive  compensation and through individual and long-term development  opportunities. We strengthen our global team by valuing diversity and  cultural backgrounds, interacting openly and constructively with each  other, and looking after the health and safety of our people. The role of  our employees is anchored in a central position in our newly launched  → 2030+ Sustainability Ambition Framework and is closely linked to  the pillar “Thriving Communities”.   Commitment to sustainable development  Sustainability is one of our five    corporate values. It means that we strive  to create a balance between people, planet and profit. When it comes to  implementing our → sustainability strategy, it is our people who make  the difference – through their dedication, skills and knowledge. Because  of this, we want to foster our people’s commitment to sustainability.  And we have expanded our existing training offers to include a holistic  engagement program, which will be rolled out at the beginning of 2022.  52,450 employees HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  94 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  In addition, we want to enable our employees to engage in volunteer  projects and make their own contribution to the communities in which  we operate. For example, our → “MIT Volunteering” (Make an Impact on  Tomorrow) initiative is designed to support our employees and pensioners  around the world in their volunteer work for charitable organizations. Employee development We promote the skills and knowledge of our employees to help them  achieve their full potential. Regular and open feedback about performance  and potential serves as a foundation for their development. This makes  it easier to define individual development measures that address both  the company’s needs and each employee’s potential. We focus on  → digital learning opportunities and the development of digital skills  so that we can take full advantage of the opportunities offered by these  technologies.  Individual development planning through regular feedback To foster the targeted development of our employees, we make use  of regular development meetings and individual development plans.  This helps us to systematically identify and develop talents within the  company, and to plan internal succession.  With this knowledge, our employees can make an important contribution  to sustainability at our sites, and by engaging with our customers and  other partners within our business environment. Our “Say yes! to the future” initiative, for example, provides Henkel sales  representatives from all business units around the world with training in  sustainability topics that apply to sales, going beyond the content of the  Sustainability Ambassador program. They then apply this knowledge  in joint projects with our trade partners – in logistics, for example, or by  promoting sustainable purchasing decisions. The “(Y)our move toward sustainability” initiative at Henkel, by compar- ison, focuses on water and energy consumption and the amount of waste  generated at our sites. It encourages employees to make a contribution  to sustainability in these areas, for example by avoiding unnecessary  printing, switching off lights or eating healthily. As part of another project, we offer employees the opportunity to visit  schools and teach children about sustainable action in their everyday  lives. This helps the next generation to understand how to use resources  efficiently from an early age. At the same time, the children multiply the  impact by imparting their knowledge and enthusiasm to others around  them. School visits are an important element of our commitment to  reaching schoolchildren through educational initiatives.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  95 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS   • For our non-managerial employees, we use locally customized   evaluation and development systems. In many countries, supervisors  assess their employees on the basis of their achievements and hold  confidential feedback conversations with them. The meetings are  followed by specific development measures. These can include   training in the workplace, such as seminars and workshops, as well  as job enlargement, for example by taking on management tasks.   • Our managers and selected non-managerial employees are assessed  every year in the globally standardized Talent Management Cycle. This  includes a performance evaluation and potential assessment as two  separate steps. To evaluate performance, managers and employees  agree on an individual role ambition at the beginning of a year, which  contributes to the fulfillment of the company’s strategic objectives.  This is re-validated in the middle of the year and then evaluated at the  end of the year.  The potential assessment is based on a self-assessment by the employees  and an evaluation conducted by their supervisors. The evaluation is  made on the basis of uniform principles and clearly defined criteria such  as expected leadership behavior. Supervisors then discuss the assessment  results with their employees in personal feedback meetings and, together,  they agree on individual development measures. In 2021, more than  1,500 managers were promoted. Henkel has been using a    digital feedback tool to complement the  assessment interviews since 2021. Employees can use this tool to receive  recognition and direct feedback from colleagues and superiors alike –  at any time. The objective is to promote a day-to-day culture of dynamic  and open feedback at Henkel. Career launch and lifelong learning programs Henkel helps many young people embark on a successful career. The  company offers 25 vocational training and five dual-study programs in  Germany. In the 2021 training year, 138 new trainees and students started  pursuing a professional qualification at Henkel. A total of 498 people  are participating in our vocational training programs at nine German  locations.  Lifelong learning is a core element of continuous development at our  company. Learning as part of everyday work, as well as through handling  a varied range of tasks, is particularly important for us. Henkel encourages  this by offering opportunities to take advantage of new roles both locally  and in other countries. We learn from supervisors, team members, and  other colleagues on a daily basis. For some years now, Henkel has been  using virtual services to train its employees worldwide, in addition  to conventional attendance-based formats. To do this, we use a global  learning platform that includes virtual sharing formats along with  eLearning, podcasts and videos. As all services on the Henkel Learning  Hub are cloud-based, they can be accessed at any time – not only in the  office environment, but also on the road or at home.  In 2021, we continued to expand our training formats in line with our  Purposeful Growth agenda. We developed and digitalized new global and  regional learning programs. There was a particular focus on programs  relating to health and wellbeing. For the first time, we organized a global  25 vocational training and  five dual-study programs HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  96 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  developing our digital skills training portfolio and advancing the  training of our employees in skills that will be relevant in the future.   • Digital learning formats also play an important role for us in making  training opportunities available flexibly worldwide. Where possible,  general in-person training courses are complemented by digital and  virtual services. As part of a partnership between Henkel and LinkedIn  Learning, all employees with PC access are able to choose from more  than 15,000 online courses in seven languages.  • The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the digital trans- formation in the world of work, and has greatly expanded and rein- forced virtual collaboration. In this context, IT security has become  more important than ever. Therefore, Henkel has further expanded  its Group-wide cyber-awareness campaigns. To increase employee  awareness of cyber attacks, the company organized numerous events  virtual learning week in 2021 to further expand the learning culture at  Henkel and to offer employees a range of business insights in the areas  of sustainability, innovation, digitalization and culture. This event drew  more than 6,200 participants from all over the world together for four  days of learning. Through these and other digital formats, our employees  were able to learn together even during the time when attendance-based  training was limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the average  training time of our employees was around 2.3 days.  Expansion of digital training opportunities  • We structure the learning content in a way that allows us to react more  quickly and individually to new requirements for knowledge within  the organization. The Henkel Learning Hub hosts all formal training  courses in one place. These include basic knowledge – such as man- agement, process, and software training – as well as content specific  to our business units and material related to improving soft skills.  Leadership skills represent a key element of the learning content.  The main aim is to train new competencies and skills that will provide  our managers with the best possible preparation for future challenges.  Based on our Leadership Commitments, we want to foster a global,  → value-oriented leadership standard that takes account of different  regional and cultural considerations.   In addition, digital transformation represents a key element of the  learning content. Our    “Digital Upskilling” initiative is designed to  provide targeted support for employees in expanding their digital  skills. It is based on two pillars and an in-depth analysis of the status  quo: Anonymous online surveys are used to assess employees’ digital  skills. This includes both a playful quiz about digital general knowledge  ( Digital BaseFit) and an analysis of experts’ professional and specialist  skills (Digital ExpertFit). Based on these efforts, we are continuously  1,178 (9.6 %) Digital Skills 1,837 (15.0 %) Personal Skills 480 (3.9 %) Other 479 (3.9 %) Corporate Compliance   and Sustainability 3,926 (32.1 %) Business unit specific 347 (2.8 %) Management 3,459 (28.3 %) Professional Skills Training categories in 2021 528 (4.3 %) Leadership HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  97 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Attractive compensation and benefits  The appreciation of the work of our global team is an important element  of our → corporate culture, and enables us to ensure our long-term and  sustainable business success. For this reason, it is important to recognize  our people’s performance through appropriate, competitive remuneration  in line with the market. We use performance-based components of  compensation in order to reward individual contributions. In contrast  to the globally standardized remuneration system for our managers, the  compensation systems for our non-managerial employees are based  on local requirements and existing collective agreements. There is no   systematic difference between the compensation received by male  and female employees. In addition to fixed and performance-based  components of pay, our remuneration system also includes benefits in  kind and social security components.  Individual performance as a compensation criterion Our remuneration system has as its foundation an appropriate and  competitive level of basic pay, which all employees receive, respectively, in  accordance with local market conditions and the collective agreements  in place. It takes into account the demands of the job and the employee’s  individual performance and development potential. In addition to the  basic pay, we strive to reward the individual performance of our employees  with attractive incentives:   • For our non-managerial employees, we use locally adapted compen- sation components to reward their performance and their contribution  to the company’s success. Depending on the nature of the job and  region, there are various bonus systems for employees, for example  in sales and production. These systems cover almost all of our non-  managerial employees worldwide.  and presentations on the subject of cyber security, specifically as part  of the worldwide Cyber Awareness Month in October 2021. Flexible working prioritized  At Henkel, we measure performance by results and not by presence.  This is why we have been promoting flexible working models for many  years. Based on a culture of trust, part-time work, flexible working hours,  new workplace concepts and mobile working are a natural part of our  work – and not just since the COVID-19 pandemic. By signing our global     Work-Life Flexibility Charter in 2012, the Management Board has  been emphasizing the importance of this topic at Henkel for many years.  Our managers are instructed to put opportunities for flexible working  into practice and to support them actively.  The pandemic has hastened a number of developments at Henkel. This  situation has again highlighted how well virtual collaboration and  mobile working work, as well as how important it is to pull together as  a team. We leverage these experiences and insights to actively shape  and develop our corporate culture and working environment. We want  to create the    workplace of the future for our company and our  employees. Our sites and offices will at all times serve as places to work  together and exchange ideas with colleagues. At the same time, a future-  oriented working environment also offers employees more flexibility  and freedom to find an optimal balance between their professional lives  and their private lives. Henkel developed its “Smart Work” program in  2021 to address this issue. This comprehensive concept provides a global  framework for mobile working and highlights the potential for improving  how our office landscapes support collabo ration among our employees,  the improvements that can be made through our health program, the  additional opportunities offered by digitalization, and how we at Henkel  can become even more sustainable.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  98 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  We always assess the performance of our employees in the context  of our vision and corporate values. We are committed to leadership in   sustainability – this is one of our five corporate values. Accordingly,   contributions to Henkel’s sustainability strategy and to its targets form  part of the annual → performance assessment, which influences variable  compensation. Where specific aspects of our sustainability performance,  such as the reduction of energy use and waste volumes, fall within the  sphere of influence of the employee concerned and have a clear bearing  on business performance (as in the case of site managers), these are  included in the individual performance assessment. In addition, almost  every manager has to confirm compliance with the    Henkel standards  in writing during their annual review. These include our Code of Corporate  Sustainability, the SHE Standards, and Social Standards. Our employee share plan We believe it is important for our employees to share in the success of  our business. This improves motivation, as well as the strength of   identification with the organization. Since 2001, Henkel has offered a  voluntary employee share plan. For each euro invested in 2021 by an  employee (limited to 4 percent of salary up to a maximum of 4,992 euros  per year), Henkel added 33 eurocents. Around 12,700 employees in  58 countries purchased Henkel preferred shares under this program in  2021. At year-end, around 18,400 employees held a total of around  2.8 million shares in the program’s securities accounts, representing  1.6 percent of total preferred shares outstanding. The lock-up period for  newly acquired shares is three years.  • For our managers, we use short-term variable remuneration compo- nents to reward individual contributions to the company’s success. The  Short Term Incentive (STI), which is paid out annually, takes into account  both our short-term financial targets and each person’s individual  performance. Some of our managers with direct responsibility for sales  are compensated through separate bonus arrangements that focus on  sales-related targets, instead of through the STI.   • For top management, the annual STI is complemented by a Long Term  Incentive (LTI) plan covering a period of four years. The objective of the  LTI plan is to motivate and retain our top managers, and to help them  view their tasks from the perspective of their shareholders.  • For Management Board members, we also use an annual bonus, as  well as a bonus related to the company’s long-term success as variable  compensation elements. For details, please refer to the description of  the compensation system and the 2021 remuneration report. Both  documents are available on our website at    www.henkel.com/ir.  The performance parameters of the annual variable remuneration  (STI) are the financial targets achieved in the relevant fiscal year, the  bonus, and the individual performance and targets of the Management  Board members, including individually agreed sustainability targets. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  99 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Corporate culture of open communication and  trust-based collaboration We are building an environment of trust in our company that is open to  ideas and innovations, and that enables decisions to be made. This is  only possible with a successful management culture. We are committed  to communicating openly with our employees and their representatives,  and to pursuing constructive dialog. Our goal is to inform them about  important issues early and to involve them in the process. As a result, we  are in a position to successfully face challenges and changes in society,  the economy and politics in a way that enables us to remain competitive  for the future. With our    Leadership Commitments we want to establish a    corporate  culture in which employees show entrepreneurial spirit and initiative,  think proactively, put team spirit into practice and take responsibility –  no matter whether they lead a team or not. Henkel’s dedicated Leadership  Commitments communication platform offers a range of workshop,  learning and reflection elements to promote sustainable cultural change  at Henkel and to help make the Leadership Commitments our cultural  norm.  To obtain a clear picture of the status quo of our corporate culture, and to  identify strengths and potential improvements, in 2020 we conducted a  comprehensive employee survey, the Organizational Health Index (OHI).  Around 10,000 employees worldwide were invited to take part in this  anonymous survey with the aim of providing open and honest feedback.  Based on the results, which indicate a good overall score for Henkel’s   corporate health, we have defined clear fields of action. A wide range of  Social security services and benefits  Our employees worldwide benefit from a high level of social insurance  provisions. In countries where no state social insurance system exists or  such a system covers only basic needs, we organize our own measures and  initiatives to supplement state health and pension insurance provisions.  In the USA, for example, we cover our employees almost completely with  private health insurance plans. In addition, in many countries where this  is usual market practice, Henkel provides company pension provision plans.  In cooperation with the Allianz Insurance Group, we have been offering  all of our employees in Germany the opportunity to have selected   preventive health check-ups as private patients, with a free choice of  doctor and without any contribution to the costs. We also offer “Henkel  CareFlex,” a supplementary company nursing care insurance policy  developed jointly with the Industrial Union for Mining, Chemicals and  Energy. In this way, approximately 9,000 employees and trainees in   Germany have a basic insurance for outpatient, inpatient and semi-  inpatient care. The insurance is available without a medical examination  and waiting period. In addition to the basic insurance, employees can  add the supplementary long-term care insurance and can also add family  members, such as partners, children, parents or parents-in-law. Where appropriate, we would like to give our employees the opportunity  to individually structure their fringe benefits to suit their personal life  situation. In some countries, for example, we offer flexible solutions that  allow employees to pick and choose their own fringe benefits and top them  up. Over the past year, our employees in China, for example, have received  a credit balance that they can spend flexibly on more than 30 different  benefits, including health, risk management and lifestyle options.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  100 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  In Germany, Henkel also involves employee representatives in many  decision-making processes beyond those for which worker participation  is a statutory requirement. The results of this decades-long, open and  constructive cooperation between employers and employee representa- tives include, for example, an improved → work-life balance, flexible  working hours, → accident prevention and health protection in the  workplace, → company pension plans and retirement schemes, and  preventive healthcare.  Dealing with structural changes  Preserving jobs and dealing with necessary structural changes responsibly  are important to us. In order to secure the company’s competitiveness,  we continually adapt our structures to market conditions. If jobs are  affected by this, we enter into a solution-oriented dialog with employee  representatives before actions are taken. In doing so, we follow all  applicable codetermination legislation and apply the required procedures  for each action. To date, we have been able to manage necessary restruc- turing measures through socially compatible solutions while reconciling  interests. The actions involved range from special semi-retirement  models and early retirement, through to support with professional  reskilling and refocus. measures were developed in 2021, some of which have already been  implemented, to further drive cultural change at Henkel. These include a  360° feedback tool, the simplification of internal processes to facilitate  faster decision-making and to increase the scope for creativity and  innovation, and the introduction of our “Smart Work” concept.  The important role of our employee representatives Our various employee representative bodies play a key role. An in-depth  exchange of views and consultations with our management takes place  at the operational level, for example with the local works councils, as  well as across companies with the trade union. We provide our employee  representatives with information regularly and on a timely basis, and  give them as much detail as possible about topics such as the corporate  strategy, for example. In countries where no employee representation is  planned or established, social dialog with the respective management  serves as a voluntary and informal instrument for close exchange. This  enables us to improve communication with our employees, include their  perspectives early on, and jointly shape future-oriented issues. It also  helps Henkel to avoid conflicts of interest and strengthens employee  identification with the company. Employee representation plays a partic- ularly important role in Europe. In 1995, Henkel was one of the first  German companies to voluntarily set up a European Works Council  (EWC) to continue the successful cooperation between management  and employee representatives at the European level. Through the EWC,  Henkel informs the representatives of its European companies about  matters such as the economic situation, transnational initiatives of the  company such as restructuring or reorganization programs, safety,  health and the environment, and training and development programs.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  101 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  As part of the    ERT initiative (European Round Table for Industry),  we signed a pledge to promote diversity and inclusion together with  53 business leaders. We also support the initiative    “Business for  Inclusive Growth” (B4IG), a global business coalition for inclusive  growth that is supported by the OECD and aims to pool and strengthen  the commitment of private companies to reduce inequality related to  opportunity, gender and region. Our commitment to diversity and  inclusion has been recognized several times in recent years, including  Henkel’s recognition as a    “Diversity Leader 2021” by Statista and the  Financial Times. As in previous years, global and regional campaigns related to diversity  and inclusion topics were held at our sites in various regions throughout  the year. Examples of this include the   #ChooseToChallenge initiative  for the International Women’s Day and the Diversity Talk Series in the  Asia-Pacific region. To foster our values-based culture, we also offered  interactive videos on the topic of Unconscious Bias, and eLearning  modules that were accessed more than 7,500 times in total. A new  anti-harassment compliance training was also introduced in 2021. Diversity &amp; Inclusion as factors for success   and innovation At Henkel,    diversity and inclusion are a business imperative and  form an integral part of our corporate culture. We are convinced that a  diversified workforce, as well as an open and appreciative corporate   culture, are important success factors in a globalized world. Different  perspectives, cultures and ways of thinking enable us to meet the needs  of our increasingly diverse markets and stakeholders with creative and  innovative products, services and solutions. Through a number of   programs and training courses, we strengthen the understanding and  appreciation of diversity while promoting an inclusive corporate culture.  Diversity at Henkel represents the variety of talents, attitudes, per- spectives, strengths, abilities and characteristics of our employees and  business partners that make us unique and contribute to creativity,  innovation and business success. It is the differences of individuals in  our company, such as experience, values, education, gender, sexual  orientation, origin or religious background, that make us strong and  successful. We want to create an inclusive working environment in  which every employee is valued and individual performance is recognized.  On principle, we also fill our job vacancies exclusively according to  ability, potential and performance. We do not tolerate discriminatory  behavior either when we hire new employees or in our daily interaction  with each other. With our Global Diversity &amp; Inclusion policy, we have  promised to further strengthen diversity and the related appreciative  behavior at Henkel.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  102 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  We also have a number of support programs for women in our business  units and functions around the world. In the Beauty Care business  unit, for example, a global, internal network called RISE was created  to promote gender balance in management positions, for example,  through the participation of women in a mentoring program. The aim  of the    Women into Science and Engineering program, run by the  Adhesive Technologies business unit, is to connect women at various  management levels with managers in the technology and engineering  sector worldwide to enable the sharing of skills and knowledge. Even  outside our own company, we are seeking to counteract the under- representation of women in technical professions and driving forward  gender diversity in the start-up and technology sector. Our digital unit  and platform for open innovation and collaboration, Henkel dx Ventures,  hosted the    Xathon for the third time in 2021, an ideation hackathon  for 100 female founders.   • Internationality and origin: With employees from a total of 124 coun- tries, cultural diversity is a part of everyday working life at our company.  An international workforce composed of people with  different cultural  backgrounds is important in a global company like Henkel, as it enables  us to develop an understanding of our markets. To address the challenges  of mixed teams, we offer intercultural training and workshops to raise  awareness of different value systems and their influence on daily actions.  Henkel also encourages international transfers within employees’  career paths. 38.1 % ratio of women in   management positions 124 nationalities Our diversity dimensions  At Henkel, we pursue a holistic Diversity &amp; Inclusion approach. The many  dimensions that define us as individuals include our education, family  and relationships, strengths and abilities, and personal experiences.  And while we recognize that all of these individual attributes contribute  to our diversity, our strategic initiatives focus on the following core  dimensions of diversity:  • Gender: Our goal is to continuously increase the ratio of women in  the company at all levels, and we have the ambition to achieve gender  parity across all management levels by 2025. The percentage of women  in management positions was around 38 percent in 2021, representing  a further increase on the previous year. To achieve these ambitious   targets, we strive to make it even easier for women to combine their  careers with their personal life plans. We support our employees by  offering them flexible working models. These models include mobile  working, part-time and → flexible working hours, job sharing and   tandem models, or sabbaticals. Another way we help families balance  work and family life is by offering childcare and → social services. At  the Düsseldorf site, there are 240 childcare places in three company  daycare centers. Henkel also offers care places for 75 children at the  company daycare center in Bratislava, Slovakia. In Germany, Henkel  is a partner in the initiative “Success Factor Family”. Through this  program, the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, together with the  central associations of German business and the German Trade Union  Federation (DGB), are committed to more family-friendliness in the  German economy.

This enables our employees at all sites  in Germany to leave work up to six years early, depending on the semi-  retirement model. This provides particularly important support for  employees in demanding shift work. At the same time, we encourage the  targeted training of qualified young people by having their experienced  colleagues in semi-retirement coach them in direct preparation for  the tasks in a specific role.   • People with disabilities: At Henkel, we foster a culture of inclusion  that focuses on the skills and individual talents of people with   disabilities. In 2021, we marked the International Day of Persons with  Disabilities as an opportunity to raise awareness of the topic among  all employees. A specially developed toolkit provides important infor- mation on the topic of inclusion. Through targeted programs,  including in our emerging markets, we strive to offer everybody the  same opportunities while always focusing on a personʼs individual  strengths rather than their limitations. One representative example of  this approach is an integration program at our Global Business Solu- tions Center in Manila, Philippines, which takes a holistic approach to  integrating people with disabilities into the world of work.  • Sexual orientation: Henkel strives to create a working environment  that is open to all people regardless of their sexual orientation or identity.  We have LGBTQ+ networks in several countries and raise awareness of  the topic through a range of events and activities. During Pride Month  2021, we displayed the rainbow flag behind our corporate logo on our  global social media channels to express our solidarity with the LGBTQ+  community, as well as our support for the LGBTQ+ community through  internal and external outreach on Coming Out Day. Since 2021, Henkel  has also been a member of    Out Leadership, a global LGBTQ+ business  network that offers insights and information on LGBTQ+ topic and key  tools for companies and employees to promote equality.  • Generations: At Henkel, four generations – Baby Boomers, Gen X, Y  and Z – work together under the same roof. We encourage → life-long  learning across all generations through appropriate training measures.  Specifically, we use mentoring and employee networks in different  business units and countries to promote knowledge transfer and an  exchange of perspectives between experienced and less experienced  employees. We also offer employees of all generations a wide range of  programs for → maintaining physical and mental health. Our social  services also help to provide support to employees facing challenges at  different stages of their lives such as when they take on responsibility  for relatives in need of care.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  104 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Our approach to global health management In order to ensure holistic health care at all sites, we work continuously  to establish uniform principles. These now include the availability of  first responders, the offer of flu shots and participation in the global  health campaign, as well as conducting emergency medical drills and  occupational health screenings. To monitor these health protection  measures, we collect metrics worldwide, which are reported annually  by all Henkel sites. In addition, the sites report occupational diseases as  soon as they have been officially confirmed by the authorities.  The Henkel Health Procedure describes the minimum global standards  for protecting and promoting health. In the implementation of internal  guidelines, programs and legal requirements, regional managers for  health, workplace safety and security provide support for management  and employees. In several regions, locally employed physicians also  act as health managers to oversee the local implementation of health  programs in the local language, taking local requirements into account.  Each year, company physicians from all Henkel sites in Germany join  together to share experiences and exchange best practice. Several annual  exchange activities for our global occupational safety officers and our  regional health and safety managers also take place. The global Head  of Health Management in Düsseldorf maintains weekly contact with  colleagues in the different regions and makes important findings available  to all sites worldwide. An annual survey of all Henkel sites on local health  programs and fulfilling requirements provides us with an overview of our  global health management. This is the foundation for global and regional  coordination activities for the further expansion of our programs. Maintain and improve health  We promote the health and vitality of our employees to help create an  agile, high-performance organization. To do so, we rely on globally uni- form health and safety standards, and provide health and preventive  care programs to guard against workplace risks and general health risks  that could lead to illness. The broad range of health services offered at  our sites has two aims: promoting our employees’ physical health (via  seminars for giving up smoking, health check-ups, AIDS prevention,  etc.), and maintaining their mental vitality (through stress management  and similar measures). We pick up on important social trends, such as  the demographic change, with our program for maintaining working  capacity. In addition to a number of regional and local programs, we  have been carrying out a major joint health campaign with all sites every  year. The aim here is to reach more than 90 percent of employees globally,  which is a key target of our sustainability strategy. “Back-Up Your Life” is the most recent of five global health campaigns to  date. In 2021, the activities targeted the physical and mental strengthening  of employees through a number of initiatives. The focus was on ergo- nomics and fitness in the workplace. More than 800 employees worldwide  have been trained as ErgoScouts, who act as ambassadors for this topic  within the company. A fitness week themed “Smart Work – Smart Fitness”  rounded off the campaign with a diverse program for physical and mental  fitness and nutrition. Information about the campaign was shared on a  globally accessible platform and actively communicated to all channels.  With this approach, “Back-Up Your Life” was able to reach more than  90 percent of our employees. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  105 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Boosting the mental health of our employees  Henkel supports its employees in maintaining their mental resilience by  offering consulting on the subjects of time, stress, and conflict manage- ment, as well as coaching as a preventive, development and coping ser- vice. In addition, there are tailored care packages for the early medical  treatment of health disorders. Our learning platform offers learning  paths on physical and mental health with short learning units. Also on  offer are online training courses, available globally, for managers to learn  how they can contribute to greater motivation and a better working  atmosphere combined with higher performance, while at the same time  reducing absences due to illness. We continued to expand our digital  formats for boosting mental health in 2021. Our initiatives to create  → flexible working hours also aim to improve work-life balance and  reduce stress factors. In addition to providing individual psychological and social counseling,  our social services at all our German sites also offer assistance with  workplace integration management and the → work-life balance, for  example in the search for childcare or in the case of relatives in need of  care. At all locations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, we also offer  preventive health training aimed at strengthening the individual’s own  personality, identifying existing resources and teaching helpful coping  strategies for dealing with daily challenges at work and in everyday life.  Continuous expansion of health programs New measures to address overall wellbeing and mental and physical  health were also identified in all regions in 2021. Our new digital MyCare  Hub, for example, raises awareness and increases uptake of all local and  global health and prevention services as a central platform for health  campaigns, ranging from vaccinations to our collaborations with sports  and fitness providers, which we have also expanded globally. We have  also further improved and expanded our Employee Assistance Program.  These services provide our employees with support in coping with pro- fessional and family problems, as well as help in the event of physical or  mental illness. Demography and Work 4.0 We launched a demography program at our headquarters in Düsseldorf  in 2013 to promote long-term employability against the backdrop of  demographic change. This holistic concept includes a combination of  preventive occupational healthcare with a general medical check-up,  workability index, and employee surveys. This program is complemented  by the “TOP Check 4 Health” assessment for mental stress. In this process,  supervisors and employees systematically analyze work flows, work  organization and environment, and teamwork and leadership. Where  improvement is needed, they also initiate measures to address the  problem. This also includes specific suggestions and offers for improving  and maintaining the health and performance capabilities of participating  employees. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  106 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Increased occupational safety The COVID-19 pandemic: Prevention and crisis management  We do everything we can to ensure the safety of our employees, whether  they are on site or working from home. We have implemented compre- hensive measures to protect our employees and prevent the further spread  of COVID-19. These included the possibility of mobile working, modified  workflows, social distancing regulations, personal protective equipment,  and the provision of tests and hand disinfectants. Full-coverage COVID- 19 vaccinations were also a key contributor to protecting our employees  in 2021. The Henkel Crisis Management Committee (CSC) was tasked with global  responsibility for crisis management within the company. With the aid  of a clearly defined process, decisions made at global level to protect our  employees are cascaded down and implemented at country and regional  level, while local crisis teams take additional measures in line with local  COVID-19 requirements. In addition to regular newsletters about new  requirements, our employees can find information about all issues related  to COVID-19 on an internal company website. This includes a wide range  of tips for how to ensure safety in the workplace and while on the road,  as well as contact partners who are available to provide assistance, best  practice examples from around the world, and responses to frequently  asked questions.  In 2021, we conducted a global employee survey on the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic on the general and health needs of employees.  90 percent of the participants were satisfied to very satisfied with our  crisis management, including the safety and health measures on site.  “Zero accidents” as a long-term goal Occupational safety within the company and along the value chain was a  top priority for us even before the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain focused  on our long-term objective of zero accidents and want to improve our  occupational safety by 60 percent by the end of 2025 compared to 2010.  We have anchored this overarching goal as a key performance indicator  in our new sustainability strategy. In 2021, we recorded 0.7 occupational  incidents per million hours worked by our employees. This is an improve- ment of 42 percent over the base year 2010. In 2021, there were no fatal  occupational accidents involving an employee of Henkel or an external  company working on behalf of a Henkel company at a Henkel site.  To achieve our goal, we invest in training to raise awareness and increase  technical safety standards. We regularly review whether our    Safety,  Health and Environment (SHE) standards are being strictly adhered to.  We are also committed to improving occupational safety at our subcon- tractors and that of other companies’ employees working at our sites.  Regular training courses are held at all sites to ensure that our employees  are able to identify and eliminate accident risks. We are increasingly  extending the programs already in place in certain areas to cover the entire  company. We also conduct global safety campaigns aimed at creating  even greater awareness of the most important safety issues among our  employees. 42 % safer per million hours worked* * Base year 2010 HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  107 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Measures for improved workplace protection and safety  In 2021, all three business units (Adhesive Technologies, Beauty Care and  Laundry &amp; Home Care) continued their efforts to increase the engagement  and participation of our employees in safety programs. One of the   measures implemented for this purpose was a Safety Day held across  the business units, during which the employees at each site were briefed  on the common goal of zero accidents. Despite the limitations imposed  by COVID-19, the program was scheduled to run over the course of an  entire week, with the option of virtual participation. This allowed us to  reach as many participants as possible. The activities focused on raising  awareness of health and safety topics in a fun way. We also expanded  our Cultural and Behavior-Based Safety programs, the core elements of  which are open dialog about safe and risky practices in the workplace.  More than 350,000 such dialogs were conducted at our production facilities  in 2021. In our Laundry &amp; Home Care business unit, we used a specially  developed app that enables employees to directly and easily report safety  concerns and analyze safety indicators. We also held a wide range of  training courses on health and occupational safety topics at our sites  over the course of the year. In addition to measures to foster a safety-oriented corporate culture, we  also rolled out a range of technical improvements at our sites in 2021. For  several years, Henkel has invested in technology pilot projects to increase  occupational safety related to the use of forklifts. Launched in 2021, the  Safety4DRIVE campaign focuses on reviewing traffic patterns and safety  equipment at both the Laundry &amp; Home Care and Beauty Care business  unit sites. We also modernized our forklift fleet and trained local teams  on implementing the forklift safety standard in the next few years. The  campaign will also be continued in our Adhesive Technologies business  unit in 2022. Another focus was on the prevention of trip, slip and fall accidents, which  are among the most frequent causes of accidents at Henkel. Beauty Care  worked out a systematic approach to root cause analysis for this purpose.  Laundry &amp; Home Care held training sessions on identifying trip hazards  at all of its manufacturing facilities. Adhesive Technologies conducted a  trip, slip and fall campaign in Europe, challenging its sites to conduct a  critical self-assessment of all areas on their premises. This also involved  a risk assessment of any shortcomings identified as well as the preparation  of an appropriate action plan to correct these deficiencies and prevent this  type of accident. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  108 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS In addition to auditing and compliance processes designed to ensure  compliance with our codes and standards, we also recognize our respon- sibility for respecting human rights along the value chain through our  supplier management system. This approach supports our commitment  to the Forced Labor Resolution of the    Consumer Goods Forum (CGF).  Our  membership of → Together for Sustainability – Chemical Supply  Chains for a Better World (TfS) is a strong example of this approach in  action.  We follow ongoing human-rights-related developments very closely at  both international and national level, including the National Action Plans  for Business and Human Rights, as well as the    UK’s Modern Slavery Act.  We continue to develop our approach in line with the resulting expec- tations. This includes the creation of an internal cross-functional task  force on human rights due diligence in 2021. In addition, we are in con- tinuous dialog with stakeholders outside the company and are actively  involved in industry initiatives. For example, in 2020 we participated in  a webinar as part of the German chemical and pharmaceutical industry’s  sustainability initiative Chemie³. This dealt with current developments  concerning human rights in the supply chain, as well as management  approaches for companies. Internally, we promote awareness of our  obligation to respect human rights by integrating relevant content into  eLearning courses and training sessions attended by our employees. In  2021, we placed a special focus on human rights due diligence training  in our purchasing activities. Applying due diligence at all levels  The way that companies act on their responsibility to    respect human  rights and exercise due diligence is the focus of increasing public dis- cussion and political debate.  Our commitment to respecting human rights  Henkel has a clear policy of doing business in an ethical and legal man- ner. This is inseparably linked with our commitment to respecting inter- nationally acknowledged human rights. As early as 1994, Henkel’s Mission  and Principles document emphasized that respecting social values and  standards is an integral part of our company policy. Since then, we have  developed and adapted a comprehensive set of    codes, standards and  processes to provide our employees, customers, suppliers, investors and  the communities we operate in with a clear definition of the ethical and  social values we uphold – including human rights expectations.  In 2000, we also introduced our Code of Conduct, including a clear and  proactive commitment to support human rights: We expect our employees  to respect local customs, traditions and social values, and to respect  human rights for a free and fulfilling life. In 2003, we underscored our  commitment to supporting and respecting human rights by joining the     United Nations Global Compact. We still refer to this commitment  today as a fundamental element in our Code of Conduct and provide  details of it in our Code of Corporate Sustainability, as well as in our Social  Standards and SHE Standards.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  109 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Principles and policies  Our codes and standards cover a wide range of topics including working  hours, occupational health and safety, data protection, non-discrimination,  fair remuneration, freedom of association and collective bargaining,  and zero tolerance of child and forced labor. We have formulated the     codes and standards in line with expectations that are relevant to our  specific business operations. We revise the documents on a regular  basis to ensure that we conduct our business in a way that reflects our  commitment to support and respect internationally proclaimed human  rights. Our most important documents include: Code of Conduct; Code  of Corporate Sustainability; Social Standards; Safety, Health and Environ- ment (SHE) Standards and the Responsible Sourcing Policy. An    over- view of human rights in the context of responsible business practices at  Henkel is available on our website.  Risk analysis  We have clear due diligence and compliance processes in place to iden- tify and assess social and human rights impacts, and ensure that – if   necessary – access to remedy is in place and available. These processes  include our Group-wide audit program, which assesses and improves  governance, processes and controls independently and objectively. It  also includes audits that form part of our supplier management system. Our approach to respecting human rights  Alongside legal requirements, our codes and standards provide a basis  for decision-making and engagement within our sphere of influence  worldwide. In this context, we adhere to international labor standards as  a minimum, and local statutes where these are more exacting. Our codes  and standards also reflect our commitment to the Universal Declaration  of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on  Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Global Compact,  as well as the expectations set out in the UN Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights.  The Guiding Principles were adopted in 2011 and, through their “Protect,  Respect, Remedy” framework, contribute to clarity regarding the different  roles that states and companies play in relation to human rights. Within  their own sovereign territory, states are responsible for protecting  against human rights violations and ensuring access to the full range of  human rights. Companies are expected to respect human rights, comply  with national legislation, and establish reporting channels and provide  access to remedy in the event of human rights violations. These guiding  principles include key elements such as principles and policies, risk  analysis, effective measures, and reporting and complaints mechanisms,  which we have incorporated into our approach to respecting human rights. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  110 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Effective measures  Based on our risk analysis, we have identified two significant human  rights risks in our supply chain at present: raw materials based on palm  oil and palm kernel oil, and raw materials from regions associated with  military conflicts. We are closely monitoring these two areas with regard  to their potential impact on human rights.  In order to reduce risks in the palm oil industry, we have made a com- mitment to procure our palm-oil-based raw materials in line with the  principles and criteria of the    Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil  (RSPO). We also work closely with stakeholders along the value chain,  from our suppliers to the RSPO, NGOs and smallholder farmers, to pro- mote sustainable practices and respect for human rights.  To mitigate the risk associated with raw materials from regions associated  with military conflicts, we require our direct metal suppliers to provide  recognized documentation each year to prove that they do not source or  process metals from these types of critical sources. As a matter of principle, we maintain intensive dialog with our suppliers  to promote sustainable practices and respect for human rights along the  value chain. For example, we also work with partners from the entire  chemical industry as part of the TfS initiative. More extensive information  about this is available on our    website.  Within the scope of the risk analysis, we identify relevant human rights  risks by assessing individual cases according to the following four criteria:   • Potentially significant negative impact on humans.   • Systemic lack of protection by the government.   • Conditions that potentially encourage repeated or systemic   non- compliance.   • And influence or potential influence by Henkel (positive or negative).  Henkel considers that a relevant human rights risk exists if all four are  met. This allows us to make a clear distinction between an individual  case of non-compliance due to a single incident, and a human rights risk  that is relevant to our business activities. To do so, we analyze human- rights-related risks in our company and along our value chains. In our  global supply chains, for example, we use an early-warning system for  sustainability risks. This includes defining the risk potential in our pro- curement markets and evaluating value chains on a cross-industry basis.  In doing so, we focus on countries that international institutions have  classified as risk countries. Based on this, we define the riskiest markets  by combining this analysis of risk countries with issues of particular rel- evance to our supply chains at that time, and take appropriate measures.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  111 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Reporting  We carry out regular audits at our production and administration sites,  and at our subcontractors and logistics centers, to verify compliance with  our codes and standards. This also includes relevant human rights issues.  All audit results, including the review of our SHE and Social Standards,  are reported directly to Henkel’s Management Board in the annual report  compiled by the Internal Audit team. In line with the criteria of our risk  analysis process, our comprehensive Group-wide audit program in 2021  did not reveal any indications of human rights violations related to  Henkel’s business operations. The identified risks related to raw materials  are addressed as part of our supply chain management approach.  Grievance mechanisms  Henkel employees, as well as workers at our suppliers or other people  affected, can report breaches of our codes and standards directly to the  responsible contact person within our company. Our compliance hotline  is operated by an independent external provider and is available globally.  In addition, an email can be sent anonymously to the Henkel Compliance  Office using a contact form. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  112 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Corporate citizenship firmly anchored in our  corporate culture    Corporate citizenship has been an integral part of our    corporate  culture ever since the company was established by Fritz Henkel in 1876  and is also clearly reflected in our corporate Purpose. Together with  our employees, pensioners, customers, consumers and charitable  organizations, we are committed to making a lasting contribution to  society worldwide, above and beyond our business activities.  Henkel’s commitment is based on three pillars: volunteer engagement by  our employees, partnerships with charitable organizations, and emergency  aid in the event of natural disasters. Our overarching goal was to reach  20 million people through our social engagement activities by 2025. We  exceeded this target in 2021, ahead of schedule. From 2010 through the  end of 2021, we reached more than 26 million people. This is particularly  attributable to our contribution to the fight against the global COVID-19  pandemic. In the past year, we supported a total of about 2,050 projects  and reached around 7.03 million people. Donations (of cash and products,  excluding additional time off work for employees) amounted to about  23.8 million euros during the reporting year.   7.03 m people reached 2,050 projects promoted We are committed to further expanding our community education pro- grams and volunteering. For 2030, we have set ourselves the new goal to  contribute to improving the lives of 30 million people (base year 2010)  worldwide.  Henkel’s social engagement is primarily intended to contribute to  securing the future viability of our society. We are facing enormous  challenges, but they are also creating a wide range of opportunities, for  example in the areas of sustainability, innovation and digitalization.  This is why the focus of our support is on education. This is reflected in  our own initiatives such as    Forscherwelt (Researchers’ World) and  our → Sustainability Ambassador Program, and also applies to our   partnerships with non-profit organizations and our offers of voluntary  work. For example, we are committed to the further education of  → smallholders as part of our commitment to sustainable palm oil, and to  maintaining long-standing cooperations with educational institutions.  Our Corporate Standard “Donations, Memberships and Sponsorships”  outlines how projects are selected. Corporate citizenship contributes  significantly to the “Education” component in the “Thriving Communities”  dimension of our new sustainability framework. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  113 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Example: Corporate volunteering In 2021, Henkel continued its commitment to achieving a viable circular  economy and preventing plastic waste from entering the environment.  As part of “Trashfighter,” our global employee initiative, we partnered  with the non-profit international environmental protection organization  “RhineCleanUp”. This organization conducts waste cleanup events,  especially on riverbanks, but also in other public areas. The aim is to  raise awareness of waste in the environment and of the value of recycling.  Example: Social partnerships  Since 2019, Henkel, in collaboration with the    Fritz Henkel Stiftung  foundation, has sponsored the non-profit programming school    “ReDI  School of Digital Integration”. Local people interested in technology and  immigrants who do not have access to digital education or a professional  network are taught digital skills in professional training courses. The  organization also offers participants the chance to work with a start-up  and with the digital industry more broadly. The objective is to help them  gain a position in German society and in the labor market. We have also  been cooperating with the charity organizations    IntoUniversity since  2021. We offer young people the support they need to realize their potential  for the future. This includes a “future internship” in partnership with  Our three pillars     Voluntary commitment of employees    Since the foundation of the initiative “MIT Volunteering”  (Make an Impact on Tomorrow) in 1998, we have supported the     voluntary activities of Henkel employees and pensioners in  over 16,800 projects and more than 100 countries around the  world. At the same time, more and more employees and pen- sioners are joining forces to implement larger social projects.    Social partnerships     As part of our corporate engagement, we enter into social   partnerships in the communities where Henkel operates, in an  effort to support social initiatives and public institutions. The  main goal is to promote education in the areas of digitalization,  sustainability and innovation.   Emergency aid     Henkel takes a fast and unbureaucratic approach to providing  emergency aid after natural disasters around the world through  the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation.

The non-profit educa- tional initiative Teach First Deutschland encourages and supports  young people to achieve more at school. At Teach First Deutschland,  university graduates help schools in disadvantaged communities. As  additional teachers, they help students to find their own path. Beyond  Germany, Henkel also supported the    Teach for All organization in  Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Kenya, Latvia, Ukraine and the  USA in 2021. In addition, our brands, together with the Fritz Henkel Stiftung founda- tion, are also involved in partnerships with social initiatives and public  institutions around the world in line with our sustainability strategy: Schwarzkopf Million Chances initiative Since 2016, the Schwarzkopf Million Chances initiative has been sup- porting girls and women in becoming more self-confident and building  a successful future for themselves. The initiative supports aid projects  worldwide, often in cooperation with independent organizations such as  Plan International Deutschland e.V. in Colombia, Egypt and China. In  2021, a total of 30 projects reached around 5,600 girls and women world- wide. Since the initiative was launched, we have been able to provide  assistance to a total of around 136,000 people. The fourth Schwarzkopf  Million Chances Award was also presented in 2021, sponsored by the  Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation. Four non-profit projects were awarded  prize money of 10,000 euros for their outstanding commitment. The umbrella of our Million Chances initiative also covers our long-term  initiative    Shaping Futures. Since 2010, Schwarzkopf Professional has  been working with non-profit organizations to offer young people the  opportunity to obtain training in basic hairdressing techniques and  establish livelihoods. The volunteer efforts of hairstylists and employees  have made it possible to train over 2,600 young people in more than  30 countries, including Cambodia, Colombia, India, Lebanon and South  Africa. #RethinkFashion initiative at Perwoll  #RethinkFashion is an initiative from our Perwoll brand. Since 2018, it  has encouraged a more conscious approach to clothing. This includes  proper care to prolong the life of textiles, as well as the upcycling of  clothing. Perwoll presented its own fashion collection at the Berlin  Fashion Week in 2021. All of the 20 or so exclusive fashion outfits were  designed and created in collaboration with students from the AMD  Academy of Fashion &amp; Design in Germany. The “NOT NEW” collection  was created exclusively from second-hand clothing. Perwoll is using  this as a way of making a clear statement: It doesn’t always have to be  new. The goal is to encourage consumers to rethink their attitudes and  to highlight the problem of disposable fashion.

With its global    “We Craft for Children” initiative, Henkel has  been involved for many years in a wide range of educational projects  worldwide in partnership with different non-profit organizations. In  2021, Pritt partnered with    Visions for Children e.V., a non-profit  organization that focuses on improving learning conditions and   educational quality in schools in crisis areas and war zones. A total  of 50,000 euros was donated to Visions for Children e.V. as part of a  fundraising craft campaign. Example: Emergency aid In 2021, forest fires destroyed entire towns in the USA. Hundreds of people  fled and were relocated as a result. We provided support through financial  donations to the American and Canadian Red Cross. To demonstrate  our solidarity and provide support for those affected by the catastrophic  flooding in Germany and Belgium in 2021, Henkel donated 1 million euros  in cash and product donations (hygiene, cleaning and personal care  products). Most of the funds were donated to Aktion Deutschland Hilft e.V.,  an alliance of respected German aid organizations that provides joint,  rapid and coordinated emergency aid to people affected by disasters.  The comprehensive    emergency aid package also included financial  assistance and paid time off for affected employees.

The indicators we record throughout the company provide transparency  while helping us to identify potential improvements, manage  activities  and monitor achievements. We show the progress of each of our  indicators  over a five-year period. In this Sustainability Report, we focus on the  publication of our globally relevant core indicators. The figures in the  tables within this chapter have been rounded up or down. As a result,  the rounded figures in some of the rows in the tables may not add up to  the totals as indicated. Environmental indicators for our production operations  The production-related data for 2021 were determined at all 174 Henkel  sites in 56 countries. This means the data represent 100 percent of our   production volume. The data were validated centrally for year-end  reporting and verified at the sites within the framework of our internal  audit program. Any differences discovered or reported at a later date are  corrected retroactively in our reporting system. Since our production  structures are constantly changing – due to the start- up of new sites or  closure of  existing sites, for example – the number of sites contributing  data changes accordingly. To ensure the comparability of the annual  data, we also show their progress as an index relative to the volume  of production. Adjustment of reported indicators Acquisitions and divestments: Initial and historical data are only adjusted  in exceptional cases in which disruptive acquisitions or divestments do not  permit a meaningful comparison of timelines. Updates in methodology: Initial and historical data are corrected where  possible. The resulting changes are highlighted and commented on. Updates in data: Where target-relevant or necessary for clarity, changes  are highlighted and explained. Updates of individual or cumulative values  are made when greater than one percent of the value of the superordinate  indicator (for example, total energy consumption), including the subordinate  indicators (for example, bought-in energy consumption).

HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  127 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Operational incidents and environmental violations Henkel openly reports operational incidents when the consequences include at least one of the following:  • Endangerment of the neighborhood or the environment.  • Tangible losses of more than 500,000 euros.  • A high level of public reaction. Furthermore, Henkel transparently reports on environmental violations where the resulting fine exceeds 10,000 euros. The measures and corrective actions initiated as a result are also disclosed. Year Operational incidents Environmental violations 2021 There were no operational incidents in 2021. There were no environmental violations in 2021. 2020 A fire broke out in the shredder plant at the waste disposal center on the Düsseldorf, Germany, site in  May 2020. It occurred during the shredding of plastic containers that had been emptied of residual   material. The site fire service was alerted by the automatic fire alarm system and by an employee.  Together with Düsseldorf’s professional fire department, which was also alerted, it extinguished the  fire in a short period of time. No personal injuries were sustained. The firefighting water was properly  disposed of in consultation with the relevant authorities.  Measures initiated: The waste disposal process was examined and employees working in waste-generating  operations at the Düsseldorf site were trained in proper waste disposal. In addition, the shredding   process was assessed to see how safety could be improved. The resulting recommendation is that any  new shredder should be designed with an extinguishing system in mind and implemented as such. In July 2020, a fatal accident involving a temporary employee occurred at our detergent factory in  Ibadan, Nigeria. The employee was fatally injured inside a soap mixing machine when he attempted to  access it during normal operation. The machine was immediately stopped with the emergency shut-off  switch. Family and authorities were notified promptly. The causal analysis revealed a failure of the  machine  safeguard. Measures initiated: Henkel was in close contact with the family of the victim and cooperated with the  Nigerian government in the accident investigation. All machinery at the Nigerian site was checked for   safety before operations were resumed. A safety inspection was also conducted on all machines at our  sites with similar production areas. There were no environmental violations in 2020. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  128 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Year Operational incidents Environmental violations Air contamination occurred due to an overpressure incident at our Laundry &amp; Home Care production site  in St. Louis, USA, in May 2020. A raw material caused overpressure in the facility’s air duct system while  a truck was being unloaded. All the processes were shut down and repair work was started promptly. No  personal injuries occurred. Measures initiated: After the factory’s air ducts had been decontaminated and before operations were  resumed, all the containers at the sulfonation facility were inspected for possible damage. In addition,  Henkel took preventive measures at all sites worldwide with similar production processes, with the aim  of preventing similar incidents in the future. A fire occurred in March 2020 at our adhesives plant in Bopfingen, Germany, during production of a   hotmelt adhesive, causing extensive property damage. The building was evacuated once the fire alarm  had been set off and the facility had been shut down as an emergency measure. The fire service was able  to bring the fire under control after a short period of time. Further damage was prevented by the safety   equipment installed. The resulting extinguishing water was properly disposed of in coordination with the  responsible authorities. Measures initiated: An investigation team and a crisis management team were formed to establish the  cause of the fire, while coordinating the smooth resumption of production at a different site. The damaged  building is currently being rebuilt for another use. 2019 During the production of powder laundry detergent, a fire broke out inside the filtering system in the  spray-drying area in our laundry detergent factory in Ibadan, Nigeria, in August 2019. The installed  detectors instantly recognized the fire. Respective measures were immediately taken with internal and  external support, in accordance with the provisions of the local intervention plan. The fire was brought  under control within a short period of time. There was no damage to people or the environment. The  fire caused a brief interruption to operations. Measures initiated: After a comprehensive check of all safety-relevant systems at the entire site,   additional training and emergency exercises that involved the entire workforce at the plant were  carried  out. These will also be repeated regularly in the future. The comprehensiveness and suitability of the  safety concept was confirmed after an on-site audit by TÜV Nord. A deflagration occurred in our adhesives plant in Kurkumbh, India, in April 2019. Unfortunately, two  employees suffered burns as a result of the deflagration. They immediately received emergency medical  aid and were then transferred to a hospital where one employee died of his injuries during treatment. Measures initiated: Henkel started assisting the families and relations during the treatment of the  employees and continues to support the families. Immediately after the incident, safety reviews were  completed at each of our sites with similar production to ensure that operations could continue safely. There were no environmental violations in 2019. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  129 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Year Operational incidents Environmental violations 2018 There were no operational incidents in 2018. There were no environmental violations in 2018. 2017 In January 2017, there was a product spillage on the site of our adhesives plant in Düsseldorf, Germany.  During the production of an adhesive, an aqueous solvent was unintentionally added, triggering the   curing process of the adhesive. The resulting adhesive foam activated the pressure relief system, overflowed  out of the containment chamber and spilled onto a street within the site. The hardened foam was  mechanically removed from the street surface. The incident did not cause any significant interruption  to operations and there were no personal injuries or damage to the environment. Measures initiated: The design of the pressure relief system was examined and the alarm function was  tested. A measuring device was installed that continuously monitors the solvent to make sure it is free  of water. There were no environmental violations in 2017. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  130 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  INDICES We prepared our Sustainability Report in alignment with the Global  Reporting Initiative’s (GRI)    “GRI Standards”*. The  following GRI index  indicates how our reporting meets GRI standards. The required information  is available on the indicated pages of the Sustainability Report and in the  audited parts of the Annual Report. Where a disclosure is not  completely  covered by the disclosures, we have included the relevant data directly in  the index or have labeled the gaps as “omissions”. Henkel transparently  reports all information and data that are ascertainable and relevant for the  Group from a management perspective.  At the same time, we present our progress regarding the principles  defined by the    United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) as part of our  annual Sustainability Report. Henkel has been a signatory to the Global  Compact since 2003. The UNGC is a strategic initiative for companies that  have aligned their strategies and operations with ten universally  recognized   principles related to human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption.  The UNGC index shows where to find information relating to the imple- mentation of the respective principles within the Henkel Sustainability  Report 2021. The GRI index and UNGC index are presented together below. The over- view lists information relating to the GRI standards and to topics that  are relevant for the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact  (UNGC Principles). The 2021 Sustainability Report is also the separate combined non-financial  report for the Henkel Group and Henkel AG &amp; Co. KGaA for fiscal year  2021 within the meaning of Sections 315b and 315c, in conjunction with  289b to 289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the Regulation  (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament, and of the Council of June 18,  2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable  investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (in the following  EU taxonomy regulation). Reporting that goes beyond GRI to meet  requirements of the HGB and of the EU taxonomy regulation is presented  in the index with the title “Information on the non-financial report (NFR).”  For the disclosures marked with a “ ,” PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH  WPG performed a limited assurance engagement.

The gross volume includes  electricity additionally generated and  sold to third parties. For site-specific reasons, this occurs primarily at our site in Düsseldorf-Holthausen (Germany); gross  emissions at Henkel level total 597 thousand metric tons, and biogenic gross emissions at Henkel level total 25 thousand  metric tons. The published Scope 1 emissions include CO2 emissions from vehicles used at our production sites (e.g. forklifts) to a large  degree. CO2 emissions from vehicle fleets operated outside our sites are excluded. Direct GHG emissions resulting from   processes are currently not considered to be significant based on an analysis carried out in Germany.

We previously used the location-based method  (Scope 2).  Information on gross volume and CO2 equivalents has not yet been provided in  itemized form, as the data basis required for  the calculation still has to be expanded. The CO2 emissions relate to our production sites that are under our direct operational control. These sites represent our core  activities. In the location-based method, country-specific emission factors were used for  calculating  carbon dioxide emissions;  based on this method, a Scope 2 emissions value of 305 thousand metric tons would have been determined for 2021.  For the market-based method (Scope 2), we do not calculate emissions for the  purchase of electricity from renewable  sources that meets internal quality criteria. For the remaining electricity, we calculate contract, provider or region-specific   emission factors, depending on the sites for which we have access to the figures.  They are updated each year. In the remaining cases, we use country-specific factors. For European countries, we use residual  factors if available. For all other countries, we use the factors that are most recently published by the  International Energy  Agency (IEA). 72 percent of the entire electricity purchase comes from renewable sources or falls under  supplier- specific  emission factors.

Using representative life cycle assessments, we regularly evaluate the raw materials we use across all product categories. In  selecting and using ingredients, we also follow  controversial discussions in the general public about the safety of chemical  ingredients in consumer products. These provide us with opportunities to continually conduct a critical review of the scientific  basis of our assessments. Henkel has been carrying out successful research since the 1980s to develop new  methods for testing the safety and   compatibility of raw materials and products.

The following text is a translation of the independent practitioner’s report. To Henkel AG &amp; Co. KGaA, Düsseldorf We have performed a limited assurance engagement on   • the chapters on sustainability reporting denoted with “ ” in the  subsections “General Standard Disclosures” and “Topic-specific   Standards” of the section “Indices” in the sustainability report   (hereinafter the “Sustainability Disclosures”)   and  • the chapters of the non-financial report denoted with “ ” in the  subsections “General Standard Disclosures,” “Topic-specific Standards”  and “Information on the non-financial report (NFR)” of the section  “Indices” in the sustainability report (hereinafter the “Disclosures on  Non-financial Reporting”)  of the “Sustainability Report 2021,” which is also the combined separate  non-financial report pursuant to §§ 289b Abs. 3 and 315b Abs. 3 HGB, of  Henkel AG &amp; Co. KGaA, Düsseldorf, (hereinafter the “Company”) for the  period from 1 January to 31 December 2021 (hereinafter the “Sustainability  Report”). Our engagement in this context relates solely to the disclosures  denoted with the symbol “ ”. Not subject to our assurance engagement are the external sources of doc- umentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Sustainability Report. Responsibilities of the Executive Directors  The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the selection  of the Sustainability Disclosures and Disclosures on Non-financial Report- ing to be evaluated as well as for the preparation of the Sustainability  Disclosures in accordance with the principles stated in the Sustainability  Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (hereinafter the  “GRI-Criteria”) and the Non-financial Report in accordance with §§ 315c  in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB (“Handelsgesetzbuch”: “German  Commercial Code”) and Article 8 of REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18 June 2020  on establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and  amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the “EU Taxonomy  Regulation”) and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for  making their own interpretation of the wording and terms contained in  the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder,  as set out in section “Sustainable Finance,” subsection “EU taxonomy”  of the Sustainability Report. This responsibility of Company’s executive directors includes the selection  and application of appropriate methods of non-financial reporting and  sustainability reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates  related to individual sustainability disclosures and non-financial  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  154 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  disclosures of the Group that are reasonable in the circumstances. Fur- thermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control  as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a Sustain- ability Report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud  or error. The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder  contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable inter- pretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been  published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed  their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated  Acts adopted thereunder in section “Sustainable Finance,” subsection  “EU taxonomy” of the Sustainability Report. Company’s executive directors  have also stated in the section “Sustainable Finance,” subsection  “EU Taxonomy” of the Sustainability Report that the interpretations of  the EU Commission, which were published on February 2, 2022 as “Draft  Commission notice on the interpretation of certain legal provisions of  the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of EU Taxonomy Regulation  on the reporting of eligible economic activities and assets” and which  are not yet legally binding, were not taken into account due to their  publication shortly before the finalization of the Non-financial Report.  They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to  the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted  differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to  uncertainties. Independence and Quality Control of the Audit Firm We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding  independence as well as other ethical requirements. Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional  standards – in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors  and German Chartered Auditors (“Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer  und vereidigte Buchprüfer”: “BS WP/vBP”) as well as the Standard on  Quality Control 1 published by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute  of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements to quality control  for audit firms (IDW Qualitätssicherungsstandard 1: Anforderungen an  die Qualitätssicherung in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis – IDW QS 1) –  and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control  including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance  with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal  and regulatory requirements.

This Standard requires that we plan and  perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about  whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe  that   • the Sustainability Disclosures denoted with “ ” in the subsections  “General Standard Disclosures” and “Topic-specific Standards” of  the section “Indices” in the Company’s Sustainability Report for the  period from 1 January to 31 December 2021 have are not prepared, in  all material respects, in accordance with the relevant GRI-Criteria,   or   • the Disclosures on Non-financial Reporting denoted with “ ” in the  subsections “General Standard Disclosures,” “Topic-specific Standards”  and “Information on the non-financial report (NFR)” of the section  “Indices” in the Company’s Sustainability Report for the period from  1 January to 31 December 2021 have are not prepared, in all material  respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e  HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued  thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors  disclosed in section “Sustainable Finance,” subsection “EU taxonomy”  of the Sustainability Report.  In a limited assurance engagement the assurance procedures are less  extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly  a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of  the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the  assurance practitioner. In the course of our assurance engagement, we have, amongst other things,  performed the following assurance procedures and further activities:  • Gain an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization  and of the stakeholder engagement  • Inquiries of executive directors and relevant employees involved in  the preparation of the Sustainability Report regarding the preparation  process, the internal control system relating to this process and  selected disclosures in the Sustainability Report  • Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement of the   Sustainability Report  • Analytical procedures on selected disclosures in the Sustainability  Report  • Reconciliation of selected disclosures with corresponding data in the  consolidated financial statements and in the combined management  report  • Evaluation of the presentation of the disclosures  • Evaluation of the process to identify taxonomy-eligible economic  activities and the corresponding disclosures in the Sustainability  Report  • Inquiries on the relevance of climate-risks In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the  EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret  undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal  terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their inter- pretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are  subject to uncertainties. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  156 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Assurance Opinion Based on the assurance procedures performed and assurance evidence  obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe  that   • the Sustainability Disclosures denoted with “ ” in the subsections  “General Standard Disclosures” and “Topic-specific Standards” of the  section “Indices” in the Company’s Sustainability Report for the period  from 1 January to 31 December 2021 are not prepared, in all material  respects, in accordance with the relevant GRI-Criteria,   or   • the Disclosures on Non-financial Reporting denoted with “ ” in the  subsections “General Standard Disclosures,” “Topic-specific Standards”  and “Information on the non-financial report (NFR)” of the section  “Indices” in the Company’s Sustainability Report for the period from  1 January to 31 December 2021 are not prepared, in all material respects,  in accordance with the §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB  and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued there- under as well as the interpretation by the executive directors disclosed  in section “Sustainable Finance,” subsection “EU taxonomy” of the  Sustainability Report.  We do not express an assurance opinion on the external sources of  information or expert opinions, mentioned in the Sustainability Report.  Restriction of Use We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted  for the Company’s purposes and that the report is intended solely to  inform the Company about the result of the assurance engagement.  Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the  aforementioned. Accordingly, the report is not intended to be used by  third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it. Our responsibility  is to the Company. We do not accept any responsibility to third parties.  Our assurance opinion is not modified in this respect.

I am also grateful for being able to present our 6th Sustainability Report that details our sustainable management activities and performance. Even in the midst of the global economic crisis, we were able  to establish a Green Growth platform. Ever since K-water constructed the first Korean multipurpose dam,the Soyang River Dam, in 1967, we have taken a leading role in national development and public happiness for the past 40 years by supplying abundant and clean water. In addition, to sincerely fulfilling our Social Responsibilities, we joined the UN Global Compact on February 2007. As such, we are committed to supporting and abiding by the 10 UN Global Compact principles. In 2009, even in the midst of the global financial crisis, we were able to establish a strong platform for global and continuous growth through various activities such as large scale national projects, low carbon new growth green business activities, and mutual cooperative & social contribution activities.  We have been improving management efficiencies by being the first public corporation in Korea to adopt an advanced annual payment system for all employees. We have also firmly established our mid-to-long-term strategy management plan to create a \\u201cWater Strong Country\\u201d by strategically implementing a new water management paradigm based on advances in technology and concepts. By declaring \\u201cPurity, Passion, Creativity\\u201d as our core values, we have established milestones to achieve \\u201cOur Mission is to  Create a Happier World with Water.\\u201d  K-water is leading the way with the low carbon,  green growth a new national development paradigm.    By successfully initiating and executing the \\u201c4-River Restoration \\u201d Project, the government\\u2019s \\u201cGreen Deal Project,\\u201d and the \\u201cGyeong-in Ara Waterway\\u201d Business, K-water has been playing a key role in the low carbon green growth which has developed into a new national paradigm strategic initiative. Going forward, by aggressively dealing with the climate change crisis through the future-oriented low carbon green growth paradigm, we are creating new growth opportunities. A good example of our commitment towards new & renewable energy development is the expansion of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) activities through the sales of carbon credits amongst corporates, the first of its kind in Korea. K-water has continuously achieved excellent performances results through global human resources Having being acknowledged having world class operational competencies for its water purification our plants received the \\u201c5 Star\\u201d Certification from the American Waterworks Association, the first company to ever receive it outside North America,  K-water has been able to solidify its overseas business platform. K-water also received the highest Knowledge Management Corporate Award in Asia and the Sustainable Management Excellence Award for two consecutive years. In addition to receiving the grand prize for Low Carbon Growth and New & Renewable Energy, K-water was acknowledged for its leadership role in Environment-friendly sustainable management.This acknowledgement was based on K-water\\u2019s global human resource pool in diverse sectors. K-water is committed to strengthening future competitiveness K-water will continue its effort to enhance water management capabilities under the belief that cultivating global human resources and developing core technologies are two essential components for establishing a competitive future. We will further strengthen our global competitiveness by further strengthening our corporate structure through sustainable management efficiency enhancements. Finally, we would like to request that you continue to support and encourage K-water\\u2019s pure, passionate and creative efforts and challenges in order to create a new future. Thank You August 2010 President of K-water   Kun-Ho Kim K-water is creating new hope wherever water flows connect the hopes of future generations into one.  04 Strategy 06_ Forecast & Outlook 08_ Vision & Sustainable Management 12_ Business Strategy and Structure 14_ Sustainable Creative Innovation 16_ Sustainable R&D Investments  Approach Performances Challenges Strategy 05 K-water 2010 Sustainability Report Receiving clean air from beautiful nature as it embraces the world. K-water is leaping forward as the world\\u2019s best integrated water services corporation by achieving its \\u201cGlobal Best on 3Water+\\u201d vision in order to embrace the values for today and tomorrow. Strategy  Diverse Stakeholders Forecast & Outlook As a corporation that has turned crises into opportunities, K-water will emerge as an integrated globally specialized water service provider by actively countering climate change and expanding new business opportunities in the midst of a fast-changing management environment. Strategy Changes in the Water Resources Management Paradigm The trend in global water resource management is towards strengthening the public role of corporations to meet the challenges of climate change from a water resource management and national security perspective. In addition, having acknowledged that water is not an abundant resource anymore, an integrated water resource management paradigm that takes into consideration water intake and supply is proliferating amongst advanced nations. Since the 1960s, advanced countries in Europe have enacted a \\u201cBasic Water Laws\\u201d and have been carrying-out integrated water resource management. While water demand is expected to increase and will continue to rise, the supply is limited, and in order to effectively manage water resources and counter-manage the effects of climate change, the role and importance of specialized public water resource management corporations are growing. As the domestic water resource management industry is evolving from simply solving water related problems to a new water management paradigm that integrates water utilization, regulation and the environment based on the government\\u2019s low carbon green growth policy, the role of water resource management by the public sector is growing in importance. Outlook of the Global Water Industry The global population in 2050 is projected to increase to 9.4 billion, while the population in urban areas is expected to increase to 69.6% (6.5 billion) of the total global population. As the population continues to grow, water shortages due to climate change increases, and the demand to replace worn-out facilities in advanced countries in North America and Europe increases, the annual water industry is projected to expand to over KRW 1,000 trillion. The total population affected by water shortages due to global warming, such as climate change, is estimated to be approximately 1 billion. This figure is expected to increase to 3 billion in 2025 and 4 billion by 2050. Considering that 2 billion of the total global population did not have access to clean water, and that 2.6 billion suffered from lack of basic sanitation facilities in 2004, water supply facility investments are projected to increase continuously. Trends of the Global Water Industry To alleviate operational structural inefficiencies in the water industry stemming from small local self-governing bodies managing the water industry, major advanced countries, such as in Europe, are moving towards a strategy which focuses on managing the water industry on a larger scale. After the 1990s, 73% of all water & sewage treatment management consignment contracts are being implemented through an integrated operational structure, helping enhance efficiencies. As such, more and more integrated operations & management strategies are being initiated. Looking at world-class water-related corporations globally, the trend is to create vertical integration of the value chain to cover the entire water life cycle. Through vertical integration, corporations are achieving competitive superiority by securing \\u2018economies of scale and scope.\\u2019 In addition, the population served by multi-national corporations is decreasing (Top 5 corporations\\u2019 market share: 73% in 2001 \\u2192 39% in 2008), while the population served by local corporations in developing countries is sharply increasing.  As there is a paradigm shift from a focus towards an abundant supply of water to improving water quality and efficiently managing the supply of water, the need for technological differentiation, such as the demand for more advanced technology standards, are continuously on the rise. As such, world-class global water-related corporations are concentrated on providing Total Solutions to the entire water treatment process, such as system planning, installation, operations, and management. | Worsening Water Shortage Situation | \\u2592 Population Affected by Water Shortage \\u2592 Total Global Population 2000 6.4 2025 7.8 2050 9.4 8% 38% 42% | Integrated Water Resource Management Structure | 06 Pluralistic Laws/ Regulations Expertise Required Water Related Disputes, Climate Change Water Management Duties, Decentralization of Organizational Structure Water Quality River Ecological Environment Dam/Lake (Unit: Billion Persons) Integrated  Water Resource Management Scientific Decision Making Professional Personnel & Organization Integrated Management Governance Integrated Management Policies, Legal Regulations River Sized Management Activities Quantity (Utilization/ Regulation)  Approach Performances Challenges Strategy K-water 2010 Sustainability Report Policies of the Global Water Industry  European countries, such as France, that have been developing their water industry over long periods of time, are more focused on providing support to domestic corporations that are expanding overseas rather than developing their own water industry. However, to overcome their own water shortage situation, Singapore is more concentrated on developing its own water industry over a short-period of time by getting their national corporations to participate in large scale projects led by the government. In the case of Israel, to overcome their water resource shortage situation, they have solely designated Mekorot as the sole comprehensive water management institution, while implementing a government-wide water industry development program through the NEWTech program. Japan announced its \\u201cMulti-directional Future Water Industry Development Plan\\u201d to develop its water industry. Recently, Japan established a Master Plan to develop its water industry so as to enter the waterworks & sewage treatment operations business. To achieve this, Japan is actively developing its government led water industry and establishing national strategies to expand overseas. One example is its effort to strengthen cooperation between private and public institutions.  Projected Domestic Water Demand In 2006, according to the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs\\u2019 \\u201cWater Resource Long-term Comprehensive Plan,\\u201d the domestic population is projected to increase to 57 million and the total water demand is expected to be 35.6 billion /\\u33a5 annually by 2020. From the total expected demand, water for agriculture is expected to comprise 44% of the total, followed by river maintenance water and household water requirements at 8.4 billion /\\u33a5 annually and 8.2 billion /\\u33a5 annually, respectively. Looking at the supply and demand status of water in the future, by 2020, a 930 million /\\u33a5 shortage is projected. Status of the Domestic Water Industry The domestic water industry is valued at approximately KRW11.2 trillion in size, with the waterworks & sewage treatment market taking up the largest portion at 91% of the total. Since the domestic penetration level of Waterworks & Sewage Treatment is at advanced country levels, the domestic water industry is at a stage of diverting its effort to construction and management. By 2011, construction of all domestic infrastructures will have been completed. With this, operations, management and facility replacement are steadily taking a larger portion of the market. The domestic water supply business is divided into the Multi-regional waterworks, Local Waterworks and sewerage business. The water business is 100% operated by K-water and local governing bodies, without the participation of private sector corporations. However, 64% of the total sewage treatment business is carried-out on consignment with the participation of private sector corporations. Government\\u2019s Development Policy towards the Water Industry Based on the government\\u2019s \\u201cWater Industry Development Plan,\\u201d the size of the domestic water industry is projected to expand to KRW 20 trillion. The plan is to develop the domestic water industry into a global water industry. According to the government\\u2019s 2007 \\u201cWater Industry Development 5-year Detailed Implementation Plan,\\u201d 31 detailed tasks in 6 sectors, including implementation plans and investment size, have been outlined. However, since most of the government\\u2019s water industry development plans have either been changed or delayed, the only current visible project underway is the waterworks & sewage treament facility upgrade business.  Trends in Overseas Expansion of the Domestic Water Industry Korean water industry\\u2019s expansion overseas is mostly concentrated on the facilities & construction sector, while operations & management overseas still take up a small portion. From 2007 up until July 2009, the facilities & construction sector comprised of 88.5% of the total contracted amount overseas. As the operations & management sector takes up the largest portion in the water industry, there is a need to concentrate our effort to developing and entering the operations & management sector. | Domestic Water Demand Projection | Comparative Changes in Annual Emissions between  the Periods 1980~1999 & 2090~2099 07 * Korea: Water 5.1 Trillion, Sewage Water 5.1 Trillion, Industrial Water 1 Trillion \\u203b Source: Global Water Market, 2008 \\u203b Source: Climate Change & Water (IPCC Technology Report-IV; 2008) 2011 355 2016 358 2020 356 1st USA 2nd Japan 3rd China 4th Germany 5th UK 6th France 7th Brazil 8th *Korea 9th Canada 10th Italy 100.0 65.1 39.2 28.7 20.9 19.7 12.8 11.2 10.9 6.9 (Unit: 100 Million \\u33a5/Annual) | Comparative Size of the Domestic Water Industry | (Unit: KRW Trillion)  08 Strategy Vision & Sustainable Management By 2017, K-water will have been in existence for half a century, establishing itself as a global comprehensive water service leader by harmoniously balancing public, growth and efficiency factors. K-water's Vision K-water has further supplemented the mid-to-long-term strategic management plans, enabling it to lead the paradigm of change in the water industry as climate change, has forced the industry to adapt, and to establish a new growth engine through the successful completion of the Green New Deal which includes the 4-River Restoration Business and the Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business. Since the vision that was established in 2006 and the strategic direction that was established in 2008 coincides with K-water\\u2019s current management status and has a wide spread consensus, the vision and strategic direction will remain as part of K- water\\u2019s management strategy. At the same time, the strategic structure, including the nine Implementation Strategies and Strategic Tasks, was further complemented, while the Action Plan was outlined in more concrete terms. K-water\\u2019s core values, which form the Corporation\\u2019s mental and cultural foundation, were recently established to help achieve its visions and strategies. Based on a unified belief and core values that forms the basis for action, K-water will strengthen its leadership and consolidate its competencies company-wide. | K-water Vision  | | Core Value  | 3 Strategic Directions The 3 major sustainable management strategic directions enable K-water to achieve a strategic focus and act as a directional beacon for aligning organizational activities, allowing K-water to achieve effectively its vision. This will require expanding public services, achieving continued growth and securing global competitiveness. Strategic Direction Public Service (Green Water) K-water will create a corporation that is loved and trusted by citizens by strengthening water management functions and creating environmental & customer value.

Risk Management Structure K-water\\u2019s enterprise risk management can be segmented into pre- and post-risk management, while risk are managed in 4 areas which include management, conflicts, disasters and PR. Risk management is a process of preventive measures to make sure risks don\\u2019t develop into a real risk. The measures include managing counter-measures and continuously monitoring department risk indices. On the other hand, risk management is a post-management process of case risks that developed  into real risk.  In the case of a risk situations, recovery steps are to be taken, which includes deciding on the level of warning and setting up an emergency action headquarters based on the Counter-measure Manual by risk type.Risks are evaluated and segmented into a company-wide management (core, importance) risk or department management risk based on the frequency and impact level to K-water\\u2019s management activities. The focus is on the pre-management of risks. Risk Management Structure K-water has established risk expansion prevention procedures by incorporating public corporation risk management principle into its risk management. As a result, 27 counter-measure working manuals for risk were published and cover the 4risk areas (management, conflicts, disasters, PR) making it possible for employees to easily utilize the manuals on-site.  Headed by the Senior Executive Vice President takes on the role as the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), and heads the Risk Management Committee which oversees the overall risk management of K-water. Establishing risk management strategies are the Business Planning & Coordinating Department\\u2019s responsibility, while separate departments are designated to manage specific risk situations depending on the type of risk in order to effectively initiate counter measures.  |  Risk Concept Outline  | |  Risk Segmentation  | Risk Danger Potential of Occurrence 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 Affect Level Company- wide Manage- ment Risk Major Risk Core Risk Depart- ment Manage- ment Risk Risk:  As a Concept that Includes Risk & Crisis, crisis is when risks become a reality. } } Establish & Operate a Clean Water Management System (Dr. SafeWater) As the potential for water pollution has increased due to increased risk of water pollution disasters occurring such as the case in 2008 when phenol leaked into the water source and in 2009 when 1.4-dioxine was detected in the Nakdong River, K-water established and operates professional counter-measures, better known as Dr. SafeWater. Dr. SafeWater utilizes advanced technologies such as a Geographic Information System (GIS), enabling K-water to make decisive decisions using real-time information which is essential during a water quality disaster. Through the use of this system, K-water has advanced its disaster management platform, enabling it to manage risks more systematically and solve disasters professionally. \\u203b (Example) ) In the case of the Nakdong River water system, 1.4-Dioxine was detected. K-water was able to provide safe drinking water by strengthening water source & filtration quality surveys, while temporarily securing substitute sources. \\u25cf\\u25cf\\u25cfBEST PRACTICE Dr. SafeWater System  K-water 2010 Sustainability Report 29 As Part of the ERM System, K-water is Leading  the New Green Deal Project by Expediting the Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business The Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business, which was originally initiated in 1995 as a BTO (Build-Transfer- Operate) project, was delayed for a long period  of  time, making it inevitable for K-water to take-over the project after close discussions with the government to smoothly implement this national project. To solve the issue of expediting the project, the President directly headed a special task force team, which directly led the project. As a result, a new project implementation model was presented through a close cooperation structure headed by K-water. As a result of these efforts, the project timetable was drastically reduced from the normal 2 year period to 5 months. This will substantially contribute to the national economy by creating an innovative green distribution system through the construction of a distinct water way, and by providing dynamism to culture, tourism and leisure.  Continued Water Supply through  Systematic Drought Counter-measures Many areas around the world are suffering from severe drought. In the case of Korea, the drought that hit the southern area of Gangwon Province in 2008-2009 left the Gwangdong Dam reservoir area with 42% lower than average rain falls (473.1 mm). This was the worst drought recorded in weather observation history for this area. It exceeded Gwangdong Dam\\u2019s design frequency (10 years). K-water established a system to actively counter drought situations by systematically dividing the roles of the head office, divisions and management office. K-water established plans to counter drought situations by setting up a step-by- step process to supply emergency water to minimize the impact of the drought in areas supplied by the Gwangdong Dam. As a result of these efforts, K-water was able to supply a minimum of 50% of the required drinking water in worse case scenarios. To avoid these disasters from re-occurring, K-water has established and is implementing various plans such as reestablishing its dam operational plans in cases of floods, enhancing the safety level for water utilization, and constructing support dams. |  Company-wide Overall Risk Index (Examples)  | |  K-water\\u2019s Crisis Management System  | \\u2592 Metropo- litan 0.0 \\u2592 Gang won 8.8 \\u2592 Chung cheong 0.7 \\u2592 Jeon buk 0.0 \\u2592 Jeon nam 6.4 \\u2592 Gyeong buk 5.1 \\u2592 Gyeong nam 4.3 \\u2592 Sihwa 0.0 \\u2592 Normal(0~33%) \\u2592 Caution(34~66%)  \\u2592 Danger(67~100%) Disaster Occurrence (Indication Identification) Countering  the Crisis After Management (Wire Reporting System) (Counter Measures Based on Crisis Level) (Concern, Notice)  (Caution, Serious) (Convocation: Department Head) (Composition: Department Head) Departmental Measures Concern / Notice Company-wide Counter Measurements Caution / Serious \\u2592 Administrative Services Division 6.2 \\u2592 Direct Control Division 15.0 \\u2592 Company-wide 5.7 \\u2592 Water Resources Business Division 1.3 \\u2592 4-River Restoration Business Division 0.0 \\u2592 Water Supply Business Division 4.5 \\u2592 Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business Division 0.0 \\u2592 Land, Energy & Overseas Services Division 1.0 Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business Supplying Water to Drought Regions (Unit: %) Approach Performances Challenges Strategy On-site Depart- ment Head Crisis Level Decision (Regional Headquarters) Related Execu- tive Director Senior Executive Vice Presi- dent, Public Relations Director, Audit & Inspection Director Department Head Manager Risk Manage- ment Committee Auditor General President Emergency Measure Division Regional Executive Director(Depending on Whether it is Management or Not) On-site Regional Headquarters  30 Challenges \\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd GREEN Economy 32_ Low Carbon New Growth Green Business 34_ Successful Operations of Local Waterworks 36_ Integrated Operations of Waterworks Facilities 37_ Water Friendly Green City & High Tech Green Complex 38_ Global K-water 40_ Promoting the Industrial Water Business  Approach Performances Challenges Strategy 31 K-water 2010 Sustainability Report K-water is moving towards a sustainable future by creating a new wind globally.

A total of KRW 2,245.8 billion was invested in developing the facilities and the 18km waterway that links the Western sea (Kyungseo-dong, Seoku, Incheon) to the Han River (Kyehwa-dong, Gangseo-ku, Seoul). Environmental impacts were minimized through environmental reviews & environmental performance evaluations at the start of the project. Through a public contest in October of 2009, K-water finalized its water culture friendly plans, which include 8 water views, parkways and bicycle lanes. The Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Project is a model for Korea's national green growth project, initiative helping reduce 4,200 tons of CO2 annually, creating 25 thousand jobs, and inducing production worth KRW 3 trillion.  Challenges 34 Successful Operations of Local Waterworks Utilizing the best management techniques & technological capabilities, K-water is contributing to enhancing to the enhancement of competitiveness of the domestic waterworks industry by improving customer satisfaction and water quality through advanced local waterworks.  Local Waterworks Efficiency Enhancement Project The operation of domestic waterworks is divided into the multi-regional waterworks (K-water) and local waterworks (164 local governments). The lack of confidence in water (rust water, leakage, lack of services) by the public mostly stems from services provided by the local waterworks. Most of the local waterworks are small in size, lack the manpower and technology, and are financially weak, making it difficult to investment in facility improvements. This causes a vicious cycle of low quality and poor service.  Utilizing the experience and expertise gained from operating multi- regional waterworks, K-water is taking measures to enhance the efficiency of the domestic local waterworks business through consignment management of the local waterworks. By integrating the operations of multi-regional and local waterworks, and local waterworks, water resource utilization can be maximized, while redundant and excessive investments can be prevented. Project Implementation Status The opening of the Nonsan Water Supply Service Center was in April of 2004, as of May 2010 K-water has taken charge over all operations including water supply and management of 18 local waterworks from self- governing bodies. Some local waterworks are still in the process of transferring control over to K-water. The local governments that have transferred or that are in the process of transferring operations to K-water are Nonsan, Jeongup, Yecheon, Seosan, Chonan (industrial), Goryong, Geumsan, Dongducheon, Keojae, Yangju, Naju, Danyang, Paju, Hampyong, Gwangju, Gosung and Tongyong. In the next 20 to 30 years, K-water will invest a total of 835.KRW 3 billion in the 18 local waterworks, including the Nonsan waterworks which is currently under operations. The investment will help replace worn out pipes, establish IT-based integrated operating systems, and enable scientific pipe network management. This will increase water revenue and reduce costs, helping maximize management efficiencies. Local Waterworks Operational Performance From the 12 local waterworks (Nonsan, Jeongup, Sacheon, Yecheon, Seosan, Goryong, Geumsan, Dongducheon, Kojae, Yangju, Naju and Danyang) that K-water has taken over and has been operating for over a year from the local governments, approximately 7,000 cases of leakage restoration construction works were carried-out to reduce and improve leakage from worn out pipes. By systematically and strategically implementingwater revenue enhancement measures based on mid-to-long-term plans such as replacing 593\\u339e of worn out water pipelines and approximately 70,000 water meters, K-water was able to increase the average revenue water revenue rate from 57.7% to 76.3% for the 8 existing local waterworks and the 4 local waterworks that K-water took charge of in 2009. As a result, a substantial amount, KRW 8 billion in production costs was reduced.  | Status of Consignment Management on Local Waterworks | 2007 750 2008 1,250 2009 1,530 2006 560 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Geojae City Yangju City Naju City Danyang Gun Paju City Hampyong Gun Gwangju City Tongyong City Goseong Gun Geumsan Gun Dongduchun City Seosan City Cheonan (Industrial) Goryong Gun Jeongup City Sacheon City Yecheon City Nonsan City 11.1 Point Increase Expansion of Local Waterworks  Service Population (Accumulated) (Unit: People/Thousand) \\u2022Yearly Revenue Water  Rate Status (Unit: %) 57.7 72.6 76.3 Under Management 2008 2009 64.7 2008 2009 \\u2022Enhanced Customer Satisfaction (Unit: Points) KRW8 Billion/Annual, Cost Reduction through Decrease in Local Waterworks Leakage 75.8 75.4 Before Consignment  \\u25cf\\u25cf\\u25cfBEST PRACTICE K-water 2010 Sustainability Report 35 | Future Plans  | In addition, by providing differentiated services such as creating an exclusive leakage restoration team, operating a 24 hour call center, offering free indoor leakage inspections, and adopting water quality certification policies, and by making great efforts to improve water quality, the customer satisfaction level increased from 75.4 points in 2008 to 75.8 points in 2009.

If the packs were to be installed at all of K-water's consigned local waterworks areas across the country, an annual budget reduction of KRW 1.2 billion would be expected.  36 Challenges Integrated Operations of Waterworks Facilities K-water is establishing the world\\u2019s best waterworks integrated system to enable the efficient usage of water resources, to alleviate imbalances in the regional water supplies, and to secure stable supply of water through usage integration. Status of the Integrated Operations of Waterworks Facilities Automatic operations of an entire waterworks facility processes, including the water intake plant, pumping plant and water purification plant, has been made possible by establishing the waterworks integrated operations system. By operating an entire waterworks facility from the regional integrated operations center, and by remotely monitoring and controlling the water production and supply process 24 hours a day, facilities are not only efficiently operated and managed, but it also enables K-water to secure a leading role in water management technology. In addition, by integrating the operations of 4 sectors, K-water was able to achieve personnel reduction and technological competitiveness improvements. As a result, in 2009, K-water was able realize KRW 24.4 billion in tangible / intangible savings. Once the operational integration of 7 additional sectors is completed, based on analyses, K-water can expect savings of approximately KRW 39.5 billion annually. At the same time, with the establishment of the world\\u2019s largest operations center, integrating 23 metropolitan waterworks, K-water has created a base from where it can leap forward and be recognized as one of the top general water service corporations in the world. IT Based Hi-tech Waterworks Facility Integrated  Operations System K-water divided its operations into 7 sectors centered-around the regional headquarters across the country to optimize water resources. To enable the integrated operations of the waterworks facilities in each sector, K-water is establishing an IT & automation technology-based waterworks integrated operations system. In addition to the current establishment of integrated operations for 4 sectors that includes the Seoul Metropolitan, Choongchung, North Cholla and South Cholla sectors, once the operational integration of the remaining 3 sectors, Gangwon, Gyeongbuk and Gyeongnam is successfully completed in 2010, K-water will have integrated the operations of the entire multi- regional waterworks by sector. Once completed, K-water is expected to be the world's first to achieve a multi-regional integration operational system on a national level. Future Plans K-water is currently in the process of linking and integrating the operations of the multi-regional waterworks with the continuously expanding local waterworks. Once the establishment of the waterworks integration operational system by sector is complete, K-water will have established upgraded plans for changes to the water operations environment and will reflect them in future plans.

By establishing the \\u201cClimate Change Counter Strategy Master Plan\\u201d in December of 2009, K-water instituted its 5 major strategies and 26 action plans to reduce green house gases by 46% compared to that of 2005. Through these efforts, K-water is taking the lead in implementing the government\\u2019s low carbon green growth policies.  Green House Gas Reduction Efforts To create a low carbon green management platform to counter climate change, K-water acquired verification from a global verification institution, Det Norsek Veritas, located in Norway (DNV). This was accomplished by researching and analyzing green house gas types and emission quantity that is produced during a project\\u2019s entire life-cycle. Reduction technology and potential emissions quantity was also researched and analyzed. K-water also prepared and managed a statistical table. An \\u201cEnergy Utilization Efficiency Plan\\u201d was established and implemented in May of 2009 to take measures to counter the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the rising price of oil. To prepare for the obligatory adoption of the Energy Management System in 2010, K- water enacted and implemented (UNIDO: United Nations Industrial Development Organization) ISO 50001 (2010). K-water also replaced its main computer server with a highly efficient and low powered server. By recycling the replaced server as an information resource, K-water was able to achieve a Green Data Center (GDC). K-water is creating a green waterworks business establishment by being the first domestic waterworks business and public enterprise to implement Carbon Labeling as a trial project. All K-water events are carbon neutral, making them Green Events. However, in the case that a major event is larger than a set size limit, K-water is required to obtain a Carbon Neutral Certification from the Korea Energy Management Corporation (KEMCO) before the event can be held. In addition to directly reducing green house gas emissions, K-water is managing the Carbon Cleanness Level (Total Green House Gas Emissions / Energy Utilization Amount) and Carbon Efficiency Level through Carbon Intensity Index management within energy efficiency and carbon efficiency improvement levels. The carbon Cleanness Level in 2009 was similar to that of previous year at 2.08 CO2, but lower than the domestic average. This refers to 2.08 CO2 tons of green house gases being emitted whenever energy ITOE is consumed. The carbon Cleanness Level is an index that shows the amount of carbon that is emitted when energy is consumed. A low carbon Cleanness Level means a low carbon emission and translates to the slowing of global warming. The 2009 carbon efficiency level increased by 5% compared to that of the previous year, to 24.23 tons. This means that to achieve KRW 100 million in revenues, 24.23 tons of green house gases were emitted. The major reason for the increase in the carbon efficiency level was the reduction in power generation, which led to a decrease in revenues. The total green house gas emission amount increased by 2.9% in 2009 compared to the previous year (485,877 tons CO2. This was due to the GHG Inventory Certification Action Plan:  5 Major Strategies,  12 Major Targets,  26 Major Action Plans 1.

Direct green house gas emissions due to the use of diesel fuel and gas was 4,459 tons CO2, whereas indirect green house gas emissions from the use of electricity was 481,418 tons CO2. The main source of K-water\\u2019s green house gas emission is the energy used to operate the waterworks. That is why K-water utilizes two systems to regularly monitor green house gas emissions. The two systems are the Environmental Performance Evaluation (EPE) System and the recently setup Inventory System. At the same time, by operating energy savings implementation programs for each sector, K-water is reducing green house gases, improving the atmospheric environment and reducing water production costs. These efforts greatly contribute to enhancing corporate competitiveness. To convert to a high efficient consumption structure, K-water is carefully researching various equipments and evaluating the energy efficiency of equipment from the design stage. For existing facilities, energy unit costs are more carefully managed. To reduce green house gas emissions from the waterworks business sector, which is a major carbon emission source, the power unit cost is strictly managed.  Development of Green Technology &  Future Implementation Plans K-water is placing its effort to secure necessary core technologies to optimize the usage of operating equipment and water resource facilities in order to reduce green house gases and achieve green growth. To achieve this, K-water plans to invest a total of KRW 16 billion until by 2013. By adding supplementary functions to the current functions of the existing business, new energy will be developed, helping to maximize utilization value. K-water is also securing energy saving products & supply systems by optimizing the operational management of dams & waterworks equipment, and improving the performance of high energy consumption equipment. Currently 12 core technology projects are being carried, out including the commercialization of the strong current turbine power generator. Going forward, by acquiring a corporate-wide carbon labeling certification and low carbon certification, K-water will establish a low carbon water production system. Methods to link the Inventory System and EPE System, which is used for effective management of green house gas emissions, will be established. Through this, a detailed reduction potential assessment project will be initiated for each sector of K-water's business. By implementing carbon reduction programs that are appropriate and effective for K-water, like voluntarily establishing and implementing green house gas reduction targets, K-water will place a corporate-wide effort to countering climate change.

By preventing pollutants from flowing into the Hantan River and purifying with the vegetation, hazardous factors have been eliminated in the Hantan River\\u2019s ecosystem with an environment-friendly manner. These measures were initiated through a social consensus with related experts and organizations such as the army, Ministry of Environment, academia and K-water.  \\u25cf\\u25cf\\u25cfBEST PRACTICE | Sustainable Water Resource Development  | 48  Creating a Clear Clean Air Environment A dust protection cover was installed to reduce scattered dust and gas emissions as a result of K-water\\u2019s project activities, while water is regularly sprayed to reduce dust and vehicle speed have been limited. At the same time, environmental training is held for K-water\\u2019s employees.  Creating a Healthy Natural Ecosystem Major conservation of animals and plants in the area was researched. As a result, any trees that were  damaged due to K-water\\u2019s projects are utilized in the landscape architecture. Eco-corridors are being built to prevent the discontinuation of the ecological network. Measures are also being taken to protect and conserve  various conservation animals such as otters and cranes. Through these efforts, K-water is creating sound ecological areas. Securing Clean Water Resources By installing basic environmental facilities upstream of the dam to treat domestic sewage and livestock waste water, and to cultivate a wetlands in the inflow areas of the reservoirs, the source of pollution can be and a 2nd buffer zone can be secured at the same time. In addition, through the \\u201cTaking Care of Forest Project\\u201d in the watershed, sources of watersupplies are being expanded and self-purification functions are being enhanced to ensure K-water supplies clean water.

K-water has been building piles of rocks, piles of timber, ecological ponds, artificial wetlands that also acts as water purifiers, and natural rivers. Fishways and egg laying sites have also been installed to protect fishes' habitats. In addition, movement passageways (eco-corridors) for wildlife have been created using roads that have been relocated. Through the forestation of the rear side of dams, in concert with the surrounding forest vegetation, from an integrated perspective, severing or fragmenting the ecosystem can be avoided. By connecting the surrounding nature ecologically, the natural environments can be maintained as natural habitats. | Bio-habitat Environment Preservation Facility  | Forestation of Rear Side of Dam Fish Egg Laying Site Transplanting Damaged Trees Fish Habitat Eco-corridor Bird Habitat  K-water 2010 Sustainability Report 51 Ecological Restoration for Protective Species K-water established and is implementing its plans to restore the ecology by minimizing the impact to the surrounding environment due to water resource development projects, and by building substitute habitats in areas adjacent to dams to preserve the ecology. A substitute habitat (gravel fields, water insect habitats, diverse aquatic living organisms) within the Hwabuk Dam area was built for otters (Natural Treasure Number 220) and white necked plovers (Designated by the Ministry of Environment designated as a species in danger of extinction \\u2013 level 2). Artificial wetlands are also being built for amphibian animals and reptiles. Various measures are being formulated to preserve the natural growth environment for Supple-jack shrubs (Berchemia berchemiaefolia) located around Sungduk Dam. When designing ecology restoration facilities, taking into consideration the ecological characteristics of species in danger of extinction, K-water acquired advice from domestic and overseas ecological experts, to make sure that the ecology restoration facilities are appropriate and environment-friendly. Monitoring for Environmental Changes in Project Areas When initiating projects, K-water monitors various sectors of the ecology, including water quality, air quality, animal & plant life (vegetation, mammalian, bird species, amphibia\\u00b7reptilia, insect species, Large benthos invertebrates, plankton, etc.), and noise vibrations to identify changes in the environment due to the project and to establish & implement measures to minimize any changes to the environment. An example is the Kunnam Flood Control Reservoir being constructed on the Imjin River. The habitat for the Red-crowned Crane, a natural treasure that comes around the Imjin River during winter, was researched. As a result, with the participation of local citizens, related organizations, environmental organizations and experts, the flood area was cultivated, feed was provided and a substitute habitat was built to preserve the habitat for the red-crowned crane. Through these efforts, the number of red-crowned cranes that comes around winter in the Imjin River area continues to increase. Establishing \\u231cRed-crowned  Crane Preservation Measures\\u231f The Red-crowned Crane is designated as a natural treasure and has a high treasury value. To preserve the Red-crowned Cranes that comes around the project areas, local citizens, environmental organization, and experts came together to put together a plan to build a substitute habitat where dragonflies exist, as a feeding ground, and to cultivate the flood areas to provide feed to the Red-crowned Cranes. \\u25cf\\u25cf\\u25cfBEST PRACTICE Soyang Dam Siniperca Scherzeri (golden freshwater mandarin fish) & 3 other Fish Species,  Paeonia Obovata Maxim (Obovata) & 2 other Plant Species, Short-tailed Viper Snake & 3 other amphibia & mammals, leopard cat & 7 mammals  Daechong Dam Mandarin Duck & 10 other Bird Species,  Otter & 1 other mammal Boryung Dam Otter & 1 other mammal, Chinese  Sparrow Hawk & 4 other Bird Species Yongdam Dam Otter, Mandarin Duck & 5 other Bird Species, Pseudopungtungia Nigra & 4 other Fish Species, Goodyera Schlechtndaliana  & 2 other Plant Species Booan Dam Otter, Cobitis Koreensis Pumilus, Korean Rat Snake, Narrow-mouth Frog & 1 other amphibia, Common Buzzard & 4 other Bird Species Jooam Dam Reeve\\u2019s Turtle & 5 other amphibian & reptilia, Yellow-throated Marten & 3 other mammals Choongju Dam Crassirhizoma & 4 other Plant Species, Short- tailed Viper Snake & 1 other amphibian & reptilia, Siberian Flying Squirrel & 2 other mammals Andong Dam Korean Rat Snake, Siberian Flying Squirrel  & 4 other mammals, Common Kestrel & 2 other Bird Species Imha Dam Reeve\\u2019s Turtle, Leopard Cat & 3 other mammals, Mandarin Duck & 4 other Bird Species Seomjin Dam Acheilognathus Somjinensis, Fareastern Brook Lamprey, Microphysogobio Koreensis (3 Fish Species); Otter, Leopard Cat (2 Mammals); Lilium Distichum (Kochang Lily) (Total 10 Plant Species) Hapchun Dam Sparrow Hawk(Accipiter Nisus), Mandarin Duck, Leopard Cat & 2 other mammals Namkang Dam Anax Nigrofasciatus Nigrofasciatus & 2 other Insect Species, Pseudobagrus Brevicorpus & 1 other Fish Species, Otter, Common Kestrel & 1 other Bird Species Strategy Approach Performances Challenges_GREEN Environment Strategy \\u2022Status of Red-crowned Cranes Coming Around Project Sites (Unit: Number of Species) 109 153 266 2003~2004 2007~2008 2008~2009 Results of the Research on Species in  Danger of Extinction Around Major Dams  Challenges 52 Management of Water Quality The public's trust towards K-water is increasing to the clean and high quality water being provided to them through advanced water quality management by adopting upgraded purification facilities and lowering the carbon level at project sites.  Upgrading the Water Production Process By adopting upgraded purification treatment technologies such as the Ozone and Granular Activated Carbon process, difficulties of eliminating tastes & smells can now be eliminated, while disinfecting by-products and minute quantities of pollutants can be treated, enabling K-water to enhance the quality of water. The upgrade technologies were adopted at 4 water purification plants (Bansong, Goryong, Banwol, Goyang) in 2009, and by the end of 2010, 12 more water purification plants are expected to adopt the new technologies. To utilize IT & Web technologies, K-water has set up a 2nd generation water quality rating system (K-water QPI) to evaluate the water quality of multi-regional water purification plants nation-wide on a real-time basis. Through the \\u201cK-water QPI,\\u201d 14 items, including turbidity, were selected for concentrated management. The 14 items were strictly evaluated using K- water\\u2019s own standards, which are stricter than legal standards. This is to achieve higher quality water. In cases of turbidity, the QPI standard is targeted and managed at 0.1NTU, 5 times the legal standard of 0.5NTU. As a result, on June 2009, the Cheongju water purification plant became the first first plant to receive 5-Star certification, the highest ranking certification, outside the North American region from AWWA (American Waterworks Association) The AWWA carried out a sponsored purification operational management capability certification policy evaluation. By expanding the number of 5-Star standard water purification plants, K- water will provide the world\\u2019s best quality water to gain greater trust from customers.

To secure the world\\u2019s best water quality inspection analysis capabilities, through the Water Quality Analysis Research Center, 500 items for inspection were identified up until 2009. By receiving the \\u201cBest International Certified Test Institution Grand Prize\\u201d in 2008, K-water was able to further enhance the credibility of its analysis results.  Water quality information from all of K-water's water purification plants that it manages is disclosed on K-water\\u2019s homepage (www.K-water.or.kr) in real-time, making it more accessible for customers. At the same time, in 2009, the supply process and water quality information was also added with the water purification plant data which is supplied on the company's homepage, widening the scope of disclosed information.  K-water 2010 Sustainability Report 53 Strengthening Quality Management in the Supply Process Even though water is safely processed at the water purification plant, the water can be polluted as it flows through rusted pipes before it reaches the tap. This is the major cause for reddish water (rust water). Every year K-water identifies worn-out pipe route sections and continuously replaces any worn-out sections, helping minimize water quality deterioration during the supply process. In 2009, by replacing a total of 19.5\\u339e of worn out pipe sections, the multi-regional waterworks average revenue water was maintained above 99%. The rust water index achievement rate was improved by 9% by developing and applying the newly developed rust water improvement process. Water Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) The Water Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a technique used to reduce and improve the pollution level in water by quantifying and evaluating the causes of environmental pollution from the entire process from water production to supply (\\u201cfrom water source to tap\\u201d). In 2009, the Environmental Evaluation technique was applied to the life cycle of water production by water purification plants at Gosan, Deokso, Boryong, Songnam, Ilsan and Choongju. After analyzing the contribution level using 6 categories that are affected, including resource exhaustion and global warming, the \\u2018Global Warming\\u2019 category was affected the most. It was also found that green house gas emission management was the controlling factor in the water environmental evaluation. Water Labeling Certification: Realizing the First Waterworks Corporation to be Recognized as a Green Business Site Carbon Labeling is a policy of labeling products with the amount carbon dioxide that was generated during the life cycle of the product, including product, transportation, distribution, usage and discarding. K-water received the Carbon Labeling certification from the Ministry of Environment for its Cheongju Water Purification Plant Waterworks. K-water was the first waterworks corporation in Korea to be certified by producing and supplying 1\\u33a5 (ton) of water, 188g of carbon dioxide is emitted. Starting in 2010, K-water will replace its environment labeling with carbon labeling and expand its carbon labeling certification efforts to other facilities to improve water production by making the entire water production process low carbon and environment-friendly. | Quality Management during the Supply Process  | | Water Life Cycle Assessment  | Carbon Labeling Certificate \\u2022U.S.\\u2019s 5-Star Standard Water Purification Plant Operational Management \\u2022Improve Water Corrosiveness \\u2022Improve Local Waterworks Water Management System \\u2022Stabilize the Management of the Water Quality Verification Policy \\u2022Eco-friendly Process Management & Carbon Labeling Certification Expansion \\u2022Optimize Operations of Water Discharge Treatment Facilities& Improve Discharged Water Quality \\u2022Strengthen Measures to Counter Water Quality Accidents as a Result of the Water Quality Management System \\u2022Operate an Early Water Quality Pollution Warning System for the 4-River Restoration  Project High Quality Water Production\\u00b7Supply & Credibility Enhancement \\u2022Carbon Labeling Certification Implementation Plan (Unit: Cases) 1 7 15 16 2009 2010 2011 2012 Strategy Approach Performances Challenges_GREEN Environment Strategy Enhancing Water Processing Credibility Establishing a Green Water Purification Plant  Strengthening Measures to Counter Abnormalities in Water Quality  Challenges 54 Source Water Quality Improvement Clean tab water comes from clean source water.  We supply high quality source water through scientific management of reservoirs and the watershed. Strengthen Management of Pollution Source in Watershed Typhoons and concentrated heavy rains induce large quantities of soil and flood debris to flow into reservoirs, causing long term high turbid water phenomena and water pollution.  To overcome the insufficiency of water quality control after the pollutants coming into reservoirs, joint efforts with organization concerned such as pre-inspection and preventive measures for the pollutant sources are being taken. As a fundamental measure, integrated turbid water prevention plan for the drainage sections of the 5 major river watersheds was established. And for the better management of pollutant emissions source, \\u201cIntegrated Pollution Source Information Management System\\u201d was established based on IT & GIS technology Expanding Participation to Improve the Water Quality in the Watershed Efforts to participate in the projects for water quality improvement in the watershed area, such as ecological wetland development project which is being implemented by K-water, are being taken to reduce pollution sources in the watershed area. K-water established an integrated management platform for management of domestic sewage and livestock waste water, which are the main sources of the dam's water pollution. K-water is constructing 8 waste water treatment facilities and operating 102 facilities. Technological Advancement in Water Quality Management and Control of Dam Reservoirs For water quality management of the dam reservoirs, it is necessary to scientifically forecast the future quality of water. However, since the dam reservoirs are huge, and there are diverse factors affecting each reservoir water quality including weather factors, it is very difficult to identify the exact causes & influences to water quality, making it imperative to use water quality forecast modeling techniques. For more rational decision- making and for the application of water quality improvement technologies, 3 dimensional water quality forecasting technologies are to be used, which is more advanced and accurate rather than 2 dimensional models. The 3 dimensional forecast technologies were applied at a dam as a trial in 2009. K-water has a plan to apply the 3 dimensional Hydrodynamic Water Quality Model to all at dam reservoirs. Efficient Algae Control Technology Adoption During summer, the eutrophication of reservoirs and rivers, results in causing water pollution and purification treatment obstacles. Various water quality improvement facilities are adapted to control algae bloom such as curtain weir (inflow current prevention layer), water circulation systems (aeration facilities) and selective intake equipment. To enhance operational efficiency, diverse research is being implemented such as efficiency analysis & the establishment of operational guidelines for each technique. In 2009, new algae control technologies, such as algae removing (harvesting) ship and curtain weir (and advanced multi-regional algae control facilities), were successfully introduced and applied.

Therefore, pollution source management is a very important factor to preserve high quality water resources. For efficient and systematic management of the information related to water quality and pollution sources, the integrated information management system based on GIS & IT has been established, which provides high definition aerial photos, 3 dimensional image of the reservoirs and a watershed, water quality status and water control facilities status. The user friendly interface of the system will make it possible for the users to manage the pollution sources and facility more easily and efficiently by providing optimal information. \\u25cf\\u25cf\\u25cfFOCUS Implementation System for Water Quality    Management of Reservoirs & their Watershed     Strategy Approach Performances Challenges_GREEN Society Strategy K-water 2010 Sustainability Report 55 56_ Respecting Human Rights & Diversity 58_ Fostering Global Human Resources 60_ Creating a Great Work Place 62_ Social Contribution Activities 64_ Activities of Water Love Volunteers Sharing green hope, providing strength to neighbors and sharing the hope of water by filling people's lives with Love.

GREEN  Society  Challenges 56 Respecting Human Rights & Diversity K-water is taking the lead in protecting human rights & interests by protecting the social minorities and respecting diversity. Efforts to Protect Human Rights K-water is protecting the rights of minorities within the corporation, while maintaining a policy of solving problems faced by employees & executives. Diverse policies such as programs to expand employment opportunities, maintain gender equality and protect workers during pregnancies are being initiated to protect the rights of minorities such as the disabled, female employees and contract workers. A Gender Equality Department has been established within the labor union, and efforts are being taken to provide the same benefits to contract workers as regular employees.  Human rights training courses are mainly carried-out to protect the rights of minorities. The training courses mainly consist of the company-wide sexual harassment prevention training and personal information protection training courses. Human rights training courses will be expanded to cover other areas. By guaranteeing the right to form collective agreements and initiate collective bargaining, there is no potential for rightsto be infringed upon at any of K-water\\u2019s worksite. Achieving Gender Equality Since K-water announced Gender Equality regulations in 2004, discrimination factors in employment and promotion of female employees has been eliminated. At the same time, counseling for female employees faced with problems has been greatly promoted, and gender equality programs have been implemented by actively managing and supporting the female workforce through strengthened maternity protection. The basic salary is the same for male and female employees in similar positions and for those that have entered the corporation in the same year. Promotions and compensations are also equally provided to male and female employees. As of December 2009, there were 393 female employees, comprising 9.8% of total work force at K-water. The number of female managers is increasingly growing in numbers. At the end of 2009, there were a total of 24 female employees in managerial positions: 2 directors (level 2) and 22 managers (level 3). In 2009, 17% (18) of the new recruits were females. In accordance with article 17 of the Framework Act on Women\\u2019s Development and enforcement ordinance article 27-2 of the same act, a sexual harassment prevention training program is held once every year and the results of the training program are reported to the Ministry of Gender Equality. To prevent any decreases in labor productivity at the worksites, a member from each department is required to complete a cyber training course once a year and disseminate the contents of the training program to his/her department. Handling Employee Problems Employee problems are solved by operating a problem counseling window at all times within the HR-Bank (An Integrated Human Resource Management System). The utilization rate of the problem counseling window and face-to-face counseling to solve problems faced by employees increased two fold to 98 cases in 2009. Out of the 98 cases, 67 cases were solved (a 68.4% solve ratio) through an investigations. Unsolved cases are continuously evaluated and considered at a later date. In addition, from the corporation\\u2019s perspective, various methods were considered to aggressively prevent and alleviate stress caused from employees not being able to adapt to the organization, overwork, and other sources of stress, by operating an Employee Assistance Plan (EAP), which is an expert counseling support program. As a result of K-water\\u2019s diverse efforts to enhance the quality of employees' lives and satisfaction through a healthy and dynamic organizational life, 16% of the employees, or 584 employees, received counseling.

In regards to information provided by K-water, the collection of personal information is minimized. By utilizing i-Pin (Internet Personal Identification Number) rather than the personal registration numberon the company's homepage, discretion is maintained in protecting personal information. Personal information is systematically managed by establishing personal information protection standards. Toimprove the awareness about the importance of personal information and the seriousness of the potential damages it can cause, and to emphasize the discretion required when providing information, cases of actual information leakages and personal information infringement prevention training courses are held regularly for new employees, external trainees, information security personnel and relevant personnel at cooperative firms.   In September of 2009, K-water was the first public enterprise to receive the ISO27001 certification. Through this certification, K-water established a strict personal information security system so as not to infringe upon customer rights. As a result of these efforts, out of 86 institutions, K-water was selected as the best institution in the National Intelligence Service\\u2019s (NIS) Security Management Status Evaluation in November of 2009. Expanding Employment Opportunities for the Disabled A policy to provide additional points to the disabled has been adopted when hiring employees. In regards to testing, depending on the level of the disability, an additional 3~5% points are added to applicants who have a disability. As for employees that have been disabled due to accidents, 100% of their salary is provided as support. For those employees registered as having a disability, a 3 day paid leave and gifts of encouragement are provided around disability day. Various convenience facilities have been installed for the disabled, which include parking zones, elevators, rest rooms, stairways and roadways. The disabled employment rate was 2.3% or 104 employees in 2009. Since 2000, over the last 10 years, the disabled employment rate was above the compulsory legal rate of 2%. Maternity Protection Program A breast feeding area and female employee rest areas have been secured within the head office, and a corporate child care center has been established to assist female employees during maternity. The child care center has been expanded, while existing facilities have been remodeled to help alleviate the burden of raising their children, and to create harmony between work and family life. Diverse maternity protection programs are being carried-out such as the child care temporary leave and selective child care work time reduction policy. Breast pump support has also been expanded for female breast feeding employees.  \\u2022Operating a Child Care Center within the Company: Water Love  Children\\u2019s House \\u2022Every Week Wednesday, Family Day <Childcare Day> \\u2022Adopting a Joint Spouse Leave of Absence Policy  - Conditions for Leave of Absence: If the Spouse is Working Overseas for Over a Year, Training, or Joint Leave of Absence - Leave of Absence Period: Once for Two Years \\u2022Improved Childcare Leave of Absence Policy - For employees with Children Younger than 3 Years Old \\u2022Childbirth Encouragement Support - Payment of Childbirth Encouragement Support, Work Circulation Exceptions for Pregnant Employees - Installation of a Breast Feeding Facility, Pregnant Women Only Parking Zone - Increase Miscarriage / Stillbirth Leave: Provide Sufficient Time to Physically / Mentally Recover Application of i-Pin as a Substitute to the Personal Registration Number to Protect Personal Information \\u2022Annual Disabled Employment Status (Unit: Persons, %) 87 90 90 104 2006 2007 2008 2009 2.3% 2.2% 2.1% 2.3% Employed Personnel \\u25cf Employment Rate Strategy Approach Performances Challenges_GREEN Society Strategy  CRP System \\u2022One-Stop HR Fostering System that ranges from Competency Diagnosis to Training Performance Evaluation 58 Challenges Global Human Resource Roadmap As K-water\\u2019s core partner in achieving its visions and strategies, employees' functions are aligned based on competencies and performances. To achieve this, K-water is securing global competitiveness for its personnel resources. K-water also strives to enhance work competencies by awarding employees for work merits, employees selected as model employees, employees with superior knowledge, and employees providing excellent suggestions. Competency-based HR Management & Information System K-water established a competency-based human resource management system that has helped to develop competency model (Common, Leader, Duty). A competency-based training system is being utilized to enhance current competency levels by identifying required competencies to generate performance. This kind of human resource management is implemented based on an advanced human resource management system such as integrating personnel management data through the HR- Bank (An Integrated Human Resource Management System), and by processing 100% of all HR management functions through the system. Capability & Performance-based  Compensation & HR Management The monthly salary of new employees is set at 212% of the minimum wage in accordance to the government\\u2019s public enterprise advancement policy, and all employees and executives are evaluated on performance regularly. In the case of executives, compensation is based on performance in accordance to the management contract signed with the President. As the executives are paid annual salaries, level 1 executive\\u2019s compensation is based on the department\\u2019s evaluation, while level 2 executives are compensated on individual MBO (Management by Objectives) evaluations. As for level 3 or below for general employees, performance compensation is based on the department\\u2019s evaluation. However, to encourage employee competency enhancement, there could be a difference of more than 20% higher or lower in compensation depending on the individual competency evaluation. In addition, to provide greater competency development opportunities through diverse work careers, a policy enabling employees to exchange functions, especially with employees in the administration and technology areas.  Employee & Executive Career Development Since 2003, K-water established and operates a CRP (Competency Reinforcement Plan) system to help employees & executives in their career development. The CRP system helps in providing a balanced career development plan by appropriately reflecting the organizational and individual needs. Starting in 2010, selective learning for employees & executives is being strengthened, while various programs to enhance training effectiveness are being implemented, which includes \\u201cModule- based Courses,\\u201d and the \\u201cOpening of All Training Courses to Employees & Executives.\\u201d Fostering Global Human Resources To become the world\\u2019s best integrated water service corporation, K-water is fostering global human resources by concentrating its corporate-wide competencies. | Roadmap to Fostering Global Human Resources  | Competency-based HRM \\u2022Establish a Competency (Common, Leader, Duty) Model \\u2022Establishing Competency-based Management Structure with the Various HR Functions for Employment, Appointments, Evaluations, Compensation, and Promotions Competency-based HRD (Human Resource Development) \\u2022Training Structure by Competency,  Position, Level \\u2022Career Development Plan (CDP) Establishment\\u00b7Implementation by Linking Functions with 4 Stages (Early, Mid, High, Expert) 430 Courses HR-Bank \\u2022Competency, Position-based HR Management Integrated System - Integrated HR Data Management, 100% Completion of HR Function Systemization, Termination of Errors at the Source Management Structure (Policy) Information System I n f o r m a t i o n S y s t e m H R D H R M Individual Competency Diagnosis  Selection of Required Courses  Studying  Performance Evaluation  Feedback ~2008 2009~2010 2011~ \\u2022Work Competency Based HR Structure \\u2022Established K-water\\u2019s Competency Model \\u2022Secure Talented Personnel, Customized Training \\u2022Establish the Competency Reinforcement Plan (CRP)  \\u2022In Connection with the Performance-oriented Personnel Compensation Structure  \\u2022Create Greater Links between Mid-to-Long-term Management\\u00b7Project Strategies & Personnel Strategies \\u2022Support Future Growth Engine Creation \\u2022Expansion of the Work Competency-oriented Platform \\u2022Secure & Foster Professional Personnel \\u2022Establish a Training Structure for Core Personnel \\u2022Establish an HR System that is linked to the Mid-to- Long-term Management & Business Strategies    \\u2022Secure Global Standard Competencies \\u2022Work Competency- oriented HR Management \\u2022Establish a Performance Creation Virtuous Circle Fostering System through Core Personnel \\u2022Realization of the company as being a Respectable GWP (Global Water Partnership) Corporation Performance  Competency-oriented Personnel Management Strategically Focused Personnel Management Securing Global Competitiveness  59 K-water 2010 Sustainability Report Fostering Core K-water Professional Personnel To secure global competitiveness by fostering professional personnel, in addition to the 2008 \\u201cK-water Technical Expertise Course,\\u201d the \\u201cK-water Management Professional Course\\u201d was opened in 2010.

Parts of a home purchase loan are provided for to assist in purchasing a private home to ensure stable housing and living conditions. K-water received the Family Friendly Corporation Certification on November 17, 2009 by operating family friendly welfare policies and programs such as recreational facility accessibility to all family members, cultural & arts experiencingopportunities, writing classrooms & English camps for employees\\u2019 children. Voluntary Learning Structure K-water is helping employees continuously upgrade their capabilities by providing diverse training programs. A representative program is the Competency Reinforcement Plan (CRP) which helps individual employees to enhance expertise in their specialized work functions on their own. The CRP is a \\u2018T-shaped\\u2019 personnel development concept. A T- shaped employee refers to an employee that is not only specialized in one\\u2019s traditional sector, but is also well-versed in terms of knowledge and insight in adjoining areas around the employee. It is a program that enables employees to acquire in depth knowledge in one area through expert training for a certain period of time when first entering the corporation. Once the employee reaches a managerial position, the employee is allowed to participate in training to expand his/her knowledge in a field that is relevant to the overall corporation. Welfare Safety K-water is creating a Great Work Place (GWP) for healthy people.The results of health examination in 2009, showed that 67.7% of employees were classified as healthy (class A, B group), while 32.3% were classified as those having comments on their health (class C2 group). In comparison to the previous year, class C2 group increased by 6.3%p. However, among those examined, the prevalence rate, which refers to the ratio of those diagnosed with a disease, stood at 5.9%, which was a decrease from 6.6% in 2008. In regards to this, to prevent adult diseases from occurring in healthy patients and to manage the health of employees on the health black list and employees with diseases, a non-smoking program, an obesity clinic and a mental health program (EAP: Employment Assistance Program) were initiated, receiving great reviews from employees. To reduce the number of employees with comments on their health examination, cerebrovascular & cardiovascular disease attack potential assessments were carried-out on all patients in 2010, and a health training session was included in the work training at the training center. Greater focus has been placed on supporting employee health programs by adding an employee (nurse) to the health management personnel and supporting on-site health management for small project sites. An MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) was concluded in October of 2009 with KOSHA (Korea Occupational Safety & Health Agency) to adopt the KOSHA 18001 (Construction Project Health Safety Management System) to secure the safety of on-site workers for national projects that have officially being initiated. KOSHA 18001 is currently being operated on a trial basis, but K-water plans to adopt it to all project sites by the end of 2010.

As a result of these efforts, through a successful agreement between labor and management, an annual salary policy was adopted for all employees. Since K-water was the first SOC-type public enterprise to adopt the most advanced annual salary model, 15 media firms, including Yonhap News and Maeil Economic Daily reported this as an exceptional case. Labor and management continue to cooperate as one to adopt advanced management techniques. \\u25cf\\u25cf\\u25cfFOCUS 2009 Wage Agreement Signing Labor / Management Discussions Policy Improvement Labor / Management Joint Team Internal Intranet Difficulty Processing Management Presentation Session Labor / Management Council Establishing Labor / Management Consensus Policy Improvements such as HR / Organizational Explanation of Management Status Prevention-oriented Employee Difficulty Processing Sharing of Management Information between Labor & Management Integrating the Main Office\\u2019s Operational Status into the Departmental Organization Culture Access to Similar Management Information between Labor & Management Strengthen Cooperation between Labor & Management Established in 1987, the labor union is comprised of level 3 or lower employees. In a union shop system, new employees are automatically registered as members. As of the end of 2009, 81.5% of employees, or 3,285 employees were registered as labor union members. Through policy improvements, management briefing sessions and corporate-wide cooperative bodies, information sharing between labor and management has increased, while a corporate-wide consensus has been established by strengthening mutual trust.  Since 2006, the Labor-Management joint Committee, K-water\\u2019s unique labor-management cooperative body, established and operates a policy improvement working committee to solve long-term management issues such as issues related to the organization of human resource organization, welfare policies, and waterworks integrated operations. As a result by the end of 2009, 96 improvement issues had been identified and are gradually being implemented. Specifically, in regards to the issue of expanding the annual salary policy to all levels of the organization, through an agreement between labor and management, the conversion to an annual salary model based on performance and competency was completed. Amongst the SOC-type public enterprises, K-water adopted the most advanced annual salary model.

Performances  68 Performances Sustainable Management Performance Index (GRI) Economy Direct Economic Effects Economic Value Creation & Distribution The water resource business, which includes dams & waterworks business are require projects that are directly linked to the public economy. By utilizing limited resources efficiently, K-water is creating economic values. With the drought in 2009, power generation dropped, reducing revenues slightly. As a result, the distributed economic value also dropped slightly. Over 79% of the total revenue generated in 2009 was invested in sales expenses and capital expenses related to production activities. | Economic Value Creation & Distribution  | Retirement Grants In preparation for the possible retirement of employees, in accordance to Labor Standard Act, retirement provisions have been allocated. Taking into consideration the average wage of employees during their employment period and 3 months before retirement, K-water guarantees that the employee will be able to receive the retirement grant on the date of retirement. K-water is considering converting the current retirement grant system to a retirement pension policy. This will be carried-out after an agreement is reached with the labor union. Government Subsidy Benefits Since K-water is carrying-out national projects, parts of the project costs are supported by the government in a form of government subsidy benefits. For the past 4 years, K-water received government subsidy benefits for various projects including Water Purification Facility Upgrade Projects, which follow the Ministry of Environment\\u2019s model project, revenue water enhancement projects, and public rental apartment complex infrastructure construction projects. As for the construction project for the Innovation City, K-water received KRW 10,140 million in subsidy benefits from the government.  | Recipients of Government Subsidies | Market Status Legal Minimum Wage Vs. New Employee Wage Ratio The monthly wage for entry level employees with a university degree (level 5) is 212% of the legal minimum wage. Local Purchasing Policy Purchasing is carried-out through the electronic purchasing system. However, to promote local purchasing by field offices, a maximum value amount was set, making it possible to contract construction or purchase merchandise locally. Local Hiring in Domestic & Overseas Project Sites In general, K-water ensures equal employment opportunities for all new employees, eliminating limitations on academic background, regionalism, and age. However, for local waterworks meter reading personnel and water project operators, K-water hires locally. Since initiating local waterworks consignments in 2004, as of the end of 2009, K-water hired 223 personnel locally, contributing to the development of the local communities. Countering Climate Change Financial Impact from Climate Change, and Risk & Opportunity Factors As the sense of a crisis regarding climate change increases, a target to limit global temperature increases by 2 \\u00b0C was reached at the Copenhagen Conference on December 2009 to help reduce green house gases. The government is also actively taking measures to counter climate change by enacting the \\u201cLow Carbon Green Growth Basic Law\\u201d in April of 2010. Through the Framework Convention on Climate Change, green house gas reductions has become a new trade barrier, and new markets are expected to be created such as credit point sales and trade regulations utilizing advanced reduction technologies led by advanced nations such as countries in Europe and Japan. As such, it is perceived that countering climate change to be a new growth opportunity for K-water\\u2019s management, K-water is doing everything possible to enhance  its capabilities to counter climate change and to utilize an integrated approach to countering climate change through strategic methodologies such as securing sustainable water resources & integrated water management, developing & establishing low carbon & environment- friendly technologies & infrastructures, and developing new & renewable energy sources.

Investments include KRW 427.3 billion in new dam construction projects such as the Hantang River and Sungduk River Dam Projects, water resource facilities such as the expansion of water resources in existing dams, KRW 259.3 billion in construction of waterworks facilities and water supply system control projects, and finally, KRW 570.4 billion was invested in the construction of new cities and development of industrial complexes. Dam Environment Improvements and the Opening of the Water Cultural Center The construction of a new dam takes into consideration environmental factors from the beginning. However, since existing dam facilities tend to be worn-out and obsolete, they are not able to provide much support to the local economy. Considering this, K-water is establishing overall plans to improve the environment of existing dams, while substantially renovating the surrounding facilities. Some of these efforts include setting up observation decks, elevators and promenades. Water Cultural Centers are also either being newly constructed or renovated to create a resting area and cultural space for visitors. Providing Support to Local Citizens in Areas Adjacent to Dams K-water continues to carry-out \\u201cDam Support Projects\\u201d to help enhance the income level and welfare of local citizens in the areas adjacent to dams. In 2009 alone, K-water provided a total of KRW 55.6 billion as support to \\u201cLocal Support Projects\\u201d such as installing joint farming facilities, paving farm roads, and constructing town centers, and to \\u201cLocal Citizen Support Projects\\u201d such as providing medical, heating expense and tuition / scholarship support. Generation-based support projects such as providing native English speaking teachers for elementary students, supporting environment-friendly farming, and constructing filial piety sharing welfare centers are representative support projects that directly affect local citizens. being encouraged to be converted into environment-friendly farm land. Through this conversion, pollution sources are minimized, helping preserve dam water quality. In return, K-water is helping farmers acquire environment-friendly certifications for their agricultural products, while helping enhance their income by securing sales channels. Farmers in areas adjacent to dams that are carrying- out environment-friendly farming are cultivating potatoes, corn and other crops using organic methods and non-agricultural chemical methods. K-water is helping these farmers by providing environment-friendly farm equipment and natural compost depositaries. In addition, to enable the agricultural products produced in these areas to acquire environment-friendly certification, through a technology support agreement with Agricultural Technology Centers of local governments, K-water is providing environment-friendly agricultural technology. To secure objectiveness in the credibility of agricultural products produced in these areas, K-water is providing support in inspecting agricultural products for residual agricultural chemicals and heavy metals, and in acquiring environment- friendly agricultural product (no or low agricultural chemicals) certifications. By 2010, the model for environment-friendly agricultural complexes will be expanded to cover all areas designated as farm land. | Eco-friendly Farming Implementation Status & Plans  | Environment Materials For detailed information on the quantity of source water used to produce water and materials such as purification chemicals that are used to purify water, refer to page 53, Water Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Material Income & Expenditures.

To convert to a high efficient energy consumption structure, equipment should be inspected and energy efficiency assessments should be carried-out during the design stage, while power unit costs should be managed carefully for existing facilities since power unit costs take up the largest portion in the waterworks expenses. Energy Efficiency Enhancement in Dams & Waterworks Facilities To reduce green house gas emissions and counter the energy crisis due to recent oil price hikes, improvements are being made to enhance energy efficiencies by deciding on optimal pump specifications, and optimizing internal coating & pump operational scheduling. Power consumption and green house gas emissions are being reduced through the increase of local waterworks revenue water. By enhancing the performance of multipurpose dam hydropower plants, K-water is contributing to increasing the supply of clean energy domestically and effectively countering climate change. Feasibility studies on the waterworks facility energy efficiency enhancement CDM projects were carried-out in 2008, and model projects were implemented in 2009. In 2010, K-water plans to receive verification of its model projects from a feasibility verification organizations, and in 2011, a registration registration from the UNFCCC will be requested (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). Water Usage Water Sources Affected by Water Intake K-water initiated the Gyungnam, Busan Area Multi-regional Waterworks Project to supply clean water to the Gyungnam, Busan Nakdong River main stream area where water conditions are vulnerable. Initially K-water had plans to supply water by developing the Namkang Dam water intake level and river bank filtration water. However, due to concerns over increasing the intake level, plans to secure a water source through utilizing surplus Namkang Dam water and river bank filtration water was revised and a feasibility test was contracted-out. The Daap intake facility located in Gwangyang City, Jeonnam, supplies natural and industrial water to the Gwangyang Port area by intaking water from the Seomjin River. To minimize the effect on the environment and damage from sea winds, sufficient water from the rivers was secured and an environmental impact survey initiated. Recently, as the Seomjin River\\u2019s river mouth is converting into a sea, changes are occurring in the ecological environment such as ocean organisms inhabiting the river mouth. Surveys were carried-out as to the cause of the phenomena. Multiple factors, in addition to the Seomjin River water intake were the cause. Causes include a drop in river bed due to rock extraction, increase in tide level due to landfill of Kwangyang Bay, and Dam construction upstream. Through local citizens\\u2019 suggestions, K-water will initiate impact surveys on the damages caused to the fishing industry due to intake from Seomjin River and construction of Jooan Dam. Continuous monitoring of the changes in environment will also be carried-out. Reusing & Recycling Water Recycled waste water (graywater) is used in restrooms and gardens at the head office. For customers using recycled waste water, a rate reduction (30% off of water rates) policy is applied to increase the use of recycled waste water and to establish a circulation-type society. In 2009, customers using recycled waste water increased by 28% compared to the previous year, resulting in a rate decrease of KRW 7.6 billion. | Energy Savings Implementation Plan & Performance  | General Management Sector \\u2022Energy Expense Reduction through Equipment Improvements  (Lighting Equipment) \\u2022Operational Efficiency through Lighting & Air Equipment Improvements \\u2022Energy Reduction through Rational Utilization of Electrical Appliances \\u2022Energy Consumption Total Amount Policy Management & Energy Reduction Target Management Water Supply Sector \\u2022Develop & Operate an Electricity Charge Calculation Program \\u2022Revise Optimal Electricity Rate Contracts for each Project Site \\u2022Apply & Improve High Efficient Equipment such as Improving Capacity of Transformers Dam Sector \\u2022Equipment Improvement to Maintain a Load Power Factor over 95%  \\u2022Target Establishment & Management of Dam Power Consumption Rate & Savings Rate \\u2022Expanding the Applications of New & renewable energies \\u2022Improve Waterworks Power Unit Cost (2008: 0.3182\\u33beh/\\u33a5 \\u2192 2009: 0.3176\\u33beh/\\u33a5) \\u2022Power Generation Sector Energy Reduction \\u2192 3,450\\u33beh/\\u33a5 Please refer to page 95 for K-water\\u2019s recycled waste water usage achievements.

To be at the forefront of improving discharged water quality, K-water has adopted and operates a self-developed Sewage Treatment Program. Green House Gas Emissions Total Green House Gas Emissions Total green house gas emissions reached 485,877 ton CO2, a 2.9% increase over the previous year. This was mainly due to the increase in power consumption stemming from the expansion of new projects (Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business) and an increase in water supply. In 2009, direct green house gas emissions from the usage of diesel fuel and gas increased by 27.6% to 4,459 ton CO2, while indirect green house gas emissions from the use of electricity increased to 481,418 ton CO2, an increase of 2.7% from the previous year. In addition, indirect green house gas emissions from transportation of employees & executives to and from work, and business trips were 581,252 ton CO2 in 2009. Green House Gas Reduction Project & Performance Refer to page 31 of the main text for details regarding K-water\\u2019s CDM projects & performance. Quantity of Ozone Layer Destroying Substance &  Air Pollution Substance Emissions  There are no processes in the production of water that emits ozone layer destroying substances such as Freon gas. There could be potential leakages from cooling facilities that contain Freon gas. To prevent this from happening, regular safety inspections are carried-out on all cooling facilities. At the same time, there are no production processes that directly emit air pollution substances at any of  K-water\\u2019s project sites. However, there could be air pollution substances emitted while using oil to operate the project sites and facilities. To minimize this, by reflecting this into each department's environmental target, the departments implement diverse activities to reduce the consumption of kerosene. | 2009 Air Pollution Discharge Status  | Total Waste Water Discharge Quantity & Water Quality As the amount of discharged water from water purification plants and its quality directly affect the water quality of rivers and the ecological environment,  K-water applies management standards that are stricter than legal standards.

Discharging & Recycling Waste Products Sludge from Waterworks & Sewage Treatment Systems In 2009, the amount of sludge produced from purifying 1\\u33a5 of water was approximately 58.1g. The total amount of sludge produced at water purification plants in one year was 90,717 tons, and 100% of the sludge was recycled and used as cement material, earth filling material and planting soil. Sludge produced at sewage treatment plants operated by K-water was 26,307 tons. From the total amount of sludge produced, the percentage of sludge recycled increased by 17% to 31% of total sludge, or 8,276 tons. The sludge was mostly used for planting soil, cement material and compost. The reason for the increase in sludge recycling in 2009 was mainly due to using the sludge produced from the Hwaensong District as land fill. K-water will gradually increase the recycling rate of sludge by converting sludge into a resource and to prevent ocean disposals. any leakages of hazardous substances. However, to prepare for hazardous substance leakage accidents, K-water is enhancing its ability to take measures to counter potential accidents by establishing an accident manual and holding regular training activities. Waste Material Discharge Management As a result of the London Dumping Convention (1996) banning the dumping of waste materials into the ocean, there was an amendment of enforcement regulations in the Maritime Pollution Prevention Law (Ministry of Maritime Affairs & Fisheries Regulations No. 330 on February 21, 2006). As a result, disposing sludge from purification plants into oceans have been banned as of 2007. Since 2006, all sludge generated from purification plants has been recycled, and no sludge is exported. Products & Services Environmental Impact Reduction Activities & Performance K-water is continuously achieving environmental performance through a dynamic circulation process of P (Planning), D (Deed), C (Checking), and A (Amendment) that reflects the conditions of ISO14001. In 2009, 30 environmental targets in 30 categories were established. 99% of the targets were achieved. Recycling Construction Waste By promoting the environment-friendly treatment and recycling of construction waste generated as a result of K-water\\u2019s water resources business, K-water is contributing to the green preservation of the country, resource reductions and public welfare enhancement. The total construction waste generated in 2009 was 140,537 tons and from this 95.6% or 134,353 tons was used as road pavement material, material for creating green tracts of land through mounding and soil covering, recycled rock, and wood chips. Going forward, K-water will minimize construction waste generation and create a resource recycling green society by \\u201cinitiating designs for an environment that can coexist with nature\\u201d from the construction business planning stage, and \\u201crealizing a productive construction site through the recycling of construction waste\\u201d during the construction stage.

Details can be found on page 56 of this report. \\u2022Filial Piety Sharing Welfare Center By selecting ways to solve problems related to the welfare of senior citizens living in the areas adjacent to dams as an activity theme, a \\u201cFilial Piety Sharing Welfare Center\\u201d was first established adjacent to the Hapcheon Dam in 2006. With the established of the Choongju Dam \\u201cFilial Piety Sharing Welfare Center\\u201d in 2008, there are currently 7 centers country-wide operated by K-water. Going forward, through the active participation of local governments, K-water will continue to try and solve welfare problems for senior citizens living in the areas adjacent to dams and to construct additional filial piety centers to enhance the local welfare. Education & Training Evergreen Program for Retirees To effectively prepare employees who are planning for retirement, an \\u201cEvergreen Program\\u201d is being implemented. K-water is trying to provide a 2nd opportunity to the retirees by providing training course related to change management & personal finances, real estate, and start-ups. Target for Performance Evaluation All employees & executives receive performance evaluations on a regular basis. For executives (Vice President), based on the performance & management contracts signed with the President, compensations are decided based on performance. As for employees below division heads, the department\\u2019s management performance and evaluation are reflected in their personnel management and compensation. The evaluation items are segmented into a joint index and quantifiable and non-quantifiable indexes. The results are then divided into department evaluation, overall team evaluation, and team project evaluation, which are then used in personnel evaluation. Divisional, departmental and team evaluations also affect the calculation of compensations. Injuries, Occupational Disease, Days Lost, Work-related  Disaster Rate & Prevalence Rate in 2009 \\u203b The Industrial Disaster Rate is a Sum of the Total Disasters after Unifying the Business Registration Numbers.  Diverse & Equal Opportunities Employee & Executive Composition As of 2009, the ratio of male and female employees stood at 90.2% and 9.8%. Although the ratio of female employees is relatively low, starting in 2003, K- water established its quota system for female. As a result, as of the end of December 2009, there were a total of 24 female employees.

Human Rights Investment & Procurement Practices In the preamble of K-water\\u2019s Ethical Principals, in addition to clearly stating the principles of respect for human rights, a clause is included that states that individual diversity and dignity are respected. It is stipulated so that all management activities are carried-out based on the principles of human respect. Human Rights Review on Investment Agreements Since the overseas projects that K-water is initiating are small investment projects that are mostly Official Development Assistance (ODA) projects and engineering (Survey & Design, Construction Inspection) technology export projects, the projects do not include a clause related to human rights protection. However, K-water will consider including the human rights protection clause in future direct investment projects and its decision-making process. Human Rights Review for Contractors By eliminating unjust firms by establishing contract review standards when transacting with K-water such as service contracts, K-water is able to substitute human rights reviews with an overall review with includes financial soundness & corporate credit rating, quality, and delivery performance. Especially in pre-qualification (PQ) reviews for large construction biddings, reviews in the sectors of human rights and labor, including disaster rates, have been strengthened. Firms with low disaster rates are given preference. In addition, to protect the rights of one-time construction laborers, social insurance rates (Health Insurance, National Pension) are reflected in construction costs to settle insurance payments once construction is completed. Through these efforts, K-water is trying to increase social insurance payment rates by contractors. Human Rights Training Currently, human rights training are concentrated on protecting the rights of minority employees such as the corporate-wide sexual harassment prevention training and personal information protection training. However, K-water plans to expand the contents of human rights training. For more detail, please refer to page56 of this report. Prohibiting Anti-discrimination  In K-water\\u2019s Ethical Principles, it is clearly stated that individual personalities are to be respected, and that there should not be any discriminatory treatment. Through this, K-water is abiding by the ILO policies (No. 111, \\u201cConvention on Discriminatory Treatment of Employment & Work\\u201d). To protect the rights of minority employees such as the disabled, female, and & contract employees, various measures are being implemented, which include the expansion of employment opportunities for minorities, the reduction of working hours for child caring, and securing interim workers in case of child caring or maternity leave. A Gender Equality Department was created in the labor union to protect the rights of female workers. For further detail, please refer to page 56 of this report. Freedom to Form Organizations & Collective Bargaining Based on the 3 Labor Standard principles of the 10 principles of the Global Compact, the right to form organizations in collective agreements and collective bargaining is guaranteed. There are no grounds for infringing on these rights in any of the project sites. Eradicating Child Labor K-water prohibits the use of child labor at all project sites. There have been no cases of using child labor in any of K-water\\u2019s project sites. To prevent child labor, based on K-water\\u2019s youth employment regulation, anyone under the age of 15, or students in middle-school under the age of 18 are prohibited from employment. All new employees are required to provide documents proving their age. Through these efforts, K-water is faithfully abiding by the 5th Labor Standard principle from the 10 Global Compact principles.  Eradicating Forced Labor K-water is abiding by Korea\\u2019s Labor Laws and ILO policies (No. 105, \\u201cConvention on Eliminating Forced Labor\\u201d) to prohibit forced labor. K-water is faithfully abiding by the 4th Labor Standard principle from the 10 Global Compact principles. Security Practices To protect individual rights and to prevent labor productivity from declining at the project sites, a cyber training course is held for 1 member from each department. That person has the responsibility to disseminate the knowledge gained from the cyber training program to his/her department. In addition, to protect against personal information being disclosed, K-water has replaced personal registration numbers with i-Pin (Internet Personal Identification Number). K-water is continuously searching for ways to enhance security measures. For more details, please refer to page 57 of this report. Rights of Local Residents As an SOC investment related public corporation that constructs dams, waterworks, and industrial complexes, there are inadvertent disputes with local residents in the process of implementing projects. Most are lawsuits related to property compensations. Out of the 13 lawsuit cases in 2009, 1 case has been solved, while 12 others are still in legal proceedings. Despite the proceedings, K-water is trying to protect the local citizens that have to leave their base of life, while expediently solving these cases. As part of a support package to provide support to local citizens that have had their base of life submerged after construction, K-water is providing diverse benefits to the to local citizens through the various support projects to areas adjacent to dams.  Strategy Approach Performances Challenges Strategy Before Project Initiation Society Influence on Local Communities Initiating Environmental Assessments for Each  Project Stage & Conducting Local Environmental Management By taking into consideration the environmental & social effects in each stage of a project, K-water is carrying-out sustainable water resource development. From the administrative planning stage of a K-water water resource project, suggestions & opinions from local citizens are collected. At the same time, a local council is established through the participation of local citizens and project related parties to alleviate various problems that might affect the local community. In addition, by participating in overseas water resource development projects, K-water is contributing to the sustainable development of those countries where the projects are being carried-out, by initiating environmental evaluations to implement sustainable development from the planning stage.  \\u2022Strategic Environment Assessment As a strategic decision-making support measure taking into considering administration planning, which is the first stage in each development project, to environmental, economic and social effects, the environmental feasibility of a plan must be secured that contributes to an environmentally rational dam candidate location selection process achieved through strategic environment. \\u2022Pre-environmental Review System As a policy to prevent any environmental impacts through the establishment of environmentally desirable administrative plans and development plans by reviewing the environmental effects and appropriateness of the selected development site based on administrative plans, which is the higher ranking stage in development projects, and development plans, the pre-environmental review helps in selecting an environment-friendly site when establishing basic plans for the construction of dams. When deciding on national projects such as the Youngju Multipurpose Dam and Bohyunsan Multipurpose Dam basic construction plans in 2009, a pre- environmental review was initiated. The review helped in decision-making by taking into consideration economical and technological factors, including environmental factors. \\u2022Environmental Impacts Assessment As a policy to minimize any environmental impacts by projecting & evaluating the effects on the environment from the actual esigning stage of a development project, and by identifying methods to reduce the effects on the environment, K-water is trying to protect the local environment by searching for appropriate reduction methods through an environmental impact assessment when establishing actual plans for dam construction. In 2009, an environmental impact assessment was carried-out on large scale national projects such as the Youngju Multipurpose Dam and the Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business. As a result, environmental impact reduction measures were established through the creation of ecological wetlands, fish ways and canals for desalinization.  \\u2022Post Environmental Audit Through the environmental impact assessment, an environmental audit is carried-out from the start of construction at the 5th year of construction on the construction sites to make sure that agreements are strictly adhered to and any potential environmental impacts from construction and operations are prevented. Measures were established to minimize the environmental impacts by initiating post environmental audits on 16 projects including the Gunwi Multipurpose Dam, 4-River Restoration Business, Sihwa River Hydropower Plant, etc. \\u2022Environment Restoration & Cultural Treasure Preservation Efforts are being taken to restore the local environment by creating environment-friendly facilities such as eco-corridors, fish ways and substitute habitats to prevent changes in the environment from water resource development projects, and to secure ecological soundness. As can be seen through the Jangheung Dam Seonsamun Cultural Park and the Daegok Dam Cultural Exhibition Hall construction, K-water is placing its effort on preserving local cultural assets that can be potentially submerged or damaged. Preventing Corruption Researching & Implementng Voluntary Improvement Measures  in Sectors which are Vulnerable to Corruption  Work transparency was been enhanced and anti-corruption internal controls were strengthened by identifying potentially vulnerable areas vulnerable in the face of corruption and by proposing measures to voluntary improve policies. 19 measures out of the 43 policy improvement implementation measures in 6 sectors were selected as excellent case measures by the Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission. By reviewing the policy improvement implementation status quarterly, and regularly providing feedback on implementation performances, policy improvement measures are strictly reviewed to see whether they have been implemented. As a result, 100% of the measures have been implemented. Achieved 1st Place for Improvements based on  Overall Clean Index Evaluation Results K-water received 1st place in the overall clean index improvement status through various measures, including i) developing & operating a clean index assessment model for senior positions, ii) revising clean ethical regulations & strengthening punishment standards, iii) initiating a 3-dimensinal concentrated inspection on vulnerable sectors, iv) strengthening clean training for employees & executives (increased by 61% over the previous year to 15,958 people), v) establishing clean portals to increase the information flow between parties, vi) creating a clean activity differential compensation structure, vii) developing & operating a smart-type regular audit system, and viii) improving vulnerable work areas based on the diagnosis of corruption risks (BPR). \\u2022Establishing Partnerships with Stakeholders - Collecting the Demands & Suggestions from Customers such as the Local Councils - Expand the Exchange of Communication with Local Citizens and Environmental Organizations \\u2022Pre-evaluation of the Environment through Strategic Environmental Assessment & Factors Affecting the Local Communities  After Project Initiation During Project Initiation \\u2022Participating in the Entire Process by Making Customer Participation a Policy - Local Councils & Customer Participation Committees involvement in Dam Construction \\u2022Monitoring the Effects on the Ecology of Project areas under construction Post-environmental Impact Surveys Feed- Back \\u2022Initiating Post-environmental Impact Surveys & Ecological Environment Impact Surveys \\u2022Operating Programs to Improve Relations with Local Citizens \\u2022Provide Greater Assistance to Areas Adjacent to Dams & Create  \\u2022Operate Programs to Preserve Cultural Treasures & Restore Damaged Environments K-water 2010 Sustainability Report 77  Performances 78 Selected as an Excellent Anti-Corruption Policy Organization the 4th Consecutive Years by the Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission of Korea With the strong will of the CEO towards transparent management and active participation of the employees & executives, among 104 organizations & institutions (39 administrative institutions, 26 local governments, 16 offices of education, and 23 public enterprises), K-water received a \\u201cVery Good\\u201d ranking for the 4th consecutive years in 2009 by the Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission of Korea after an anti-corruption policy review (Only 6 organizations have had the same honor).

Mission Statement for Innovative Vision K-water 2010 Sustainability Report 95 (                                             ) (                                             )  Performances 96 Publishing the Sustainability Report Efforts were taken to reflect the voices of our internal and external stakeholders when publishing this Report,  and to ensure credibility, assurance on the contents of this report was provided by a third party. The main objective of this Sustainability Report is to provide stakeholders with credible transparent corporate information and to gain the respect of the stakeholders. Matters of concern of the internal employees were accumulated through a survey, while those of the stakeholders were gained through advisors. The issues of concern were evaluated for their materiality and through the analysis of the evaluations, major issues of concern were established. K-water has tried to provide full disclosure of the performance indicators outlined by the G3 guideline, which is the international standard. Scope of the Performance Indicator Report The scope of this Report covers 31 domestic project sites, including the main office, and 6 overseas project sites, providing sustainable management status and performance. Since the accounting periods are the same for K-water and its investors, it does not affect the comparison in terms of the period or structure. Depending on the share ownership, the actual value method or the cost method is applied. Performance Data Reporting Standard K-water has made every effort to follow the reporting principles stated in the G3 guidelines when preparing this Report. Each of the economic, environmental and social performance data was derived based on the indicator covenants attached to the G3 guidelines. Environment related data was mainly quoted from data derived from the Environmental Performance Evaluation electronic system, while financial data was derived from audited financial statements and statement of accounts. Information related to society and other sectors were directly received from related departments. K-water has tried to provide greater clarity by providing 3~4 year performance indicator data, and ratios and absolute data at the same time. Efforts to Enhance Sustainability It has been 6 years since K-water first published its Sustainability Report. In the 6 years, K-water has painstakingly tried to identify the expectations and concerns of the stakeholders, but there's still room for greater improvements. In the next Sustainability Report, K-water will listen more carefully to the suggestions of the stakeholders to create a more advanced Sustainability Report.

If we do not take responsibility today, we will only  hurt ourselves as a business tomorrow. Minimizing our environmental impact, pri- marily by reducing energy consumption in stores, has therefore been a high priority  for many years. An exciting example of how far we have come is ICA Kvantum San- neg\\u00e5rden in Gothenburg, the first store we have built entirely based on our guide- lines on maximizing energy efficiency while not sacrificing customer experience. It is  a store of the future that will serve as a model for all new stores.\\u201d    Read the President\\u2019s statement in its entirety on page 2-5 in the ICA Group\\u2019s Annual Report.  \\u201d  If we do not take  responsibility today,  we will only hurt our- selves as a business  tomorrow.

This is the  very foundation of iCa\\u2019s business. With the help of strong shared  values and an attitude that every link in the chain is important, from  supplier to employee and customer, we have integrated Cr work in  every area of the Group\\u2019s operations. iCa is a sustainable company  with a solid financial footing, a commitment to the environment and  strong social engagement.  The ICA Group\\u2019s CR strategy is focused on creating a more sustainable value chain,  from primary production to customer, and guiding us in integrating the issues of cli- mate change, food safety, quality in stores and corporate responsibility into day-to- day operations. We are continuously working to improve our CR work and to in- crease transparency through an active dialogue externally and internally. The CR  strategy is based on our materiality analysis which is defined annually to identify  current areas and issues that are of importance to our economic, environmental  and social performance. ICA\\u2019s most important Group goals are shown below. They are complemented by  more customer-oriented targets for each company to strengthen their local presence. ICA\\u2019s CR work is coordinated with our two owners, Royal Ahold and Hakon Invest.  Ahold and ICA support similar philosophies in this work, report using the same  guidelines and generally share the same approach to how this work is performed.

ICA\\u2019s Good Business iCa\\u2019s Good Business describes  the Group\\u2019s stance on corpo- rate responsibility. Together  with iCa\\u2019s core values, they  are essential to achieve the  Group\\u2019s vision and mission.  ICA will: Be driven by profitability and  \\u2022\\t high ethical standards. listen to customers and al- \\u2022\\t ways base decisions on their  needs. nurture diversity and growth   \\u2022\\t among its employees. Maintain an open dialogue  \\u2022\\t internally and with the com- munity. ensure quality and safe  \\u2022\\t products. promote a healthy lifestyle. \\u2022\\t adopt sound environment  \\u2022\\t practices to promote sus- tainable development.  6 Gri report 2010, iCa Group standard disclosures ICA\\u2019s Good Business philosophy and policies are shared by the entire Group. Al- though this work rests on the same foundation, there are local variations in the mar- kets where the ICA Group is active that affect conditions on a practical level. There  are several reasons for these local variations: Different markets: \\u2022\\t  ICA Sweden is the leader in a mature market. In Norway, on  the other hand, ICA Norway is in an upstart working hard to turn around a nega- tive long-term trend. In Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Rimi Baltic operates in a po- tentially expansive, but uncertain market. Differences in customer behavior:  \\u2022\\t Customer preferences tend to vary. In the Bal- tic countries, which has been hard hit by the financial crisis and recession, food  prices are a critical issue. In Sweden, the recession and financial crisis have not af- fected spending patterns as much, and consumers have the freedom to buy less  price-focused alternatives such as organic and Fairtrade products. Norwegian cus- tomers have felt the recession to an even lesser extent. They remain interested in  healthy meal solutions. Different opinions:  \\u2022\\t Different topics garner different responses depending on local  opinions in the country. In Sweden, food shrinkage, additives and greenhouse gas  emissions are major concerns. Norwegians feel strongly about healthy living and  nutrition. Interest in not throwing food away unnecessarily has also grown in Nor- way. Due to the financial crisis, the Baltic countries have been forced to focus on  economic issues, although the public is also concerned about GMO\\u2019s and littering. Similarities:  \\u2022\\t The common denominator is an interest in local foods. Country-of- origin labeling has grown in popularity in all our countries. Sweden has the Swed- ish Seal of Quality, and in Norway a new industry trademark, \\u201cNyt Norge\\u201d (\\u201cEn- joy Norway\\u201d) has had a major impact. Latvia uses the same type of labels, \\u201cGreen  Spoon\\u201d and \\u201cGrown in Latvia with Pride\\u201d. How ICA manages its CR work The overall strategic direction of ICA\\u2019s CR work is set at the Group level and is man- aged through strategic planning and business planning processes. Overarching re- sponsibility for CR issues rests with ICA\\u2019s CEO.   The Business Ethics and Policy Committee of Group Management, which has been  in place since 2005, is responsible for monitoring CR goals and strategies, ICA\\u2019s Good  Business and related Group-wide policies. It also proposes CR priorities and monitors  ethical dilemmas, risks and public opinion about the ICA Group. The cross-organiza- tional team is led by the head of the Corporate Responsibility department.  The line organization can direct questions to each policy owner, who informs and  involves the Business Ethics and Policy Committee when needed. Every employee  is responsible for complying with ICA\\u2019s Good Business, and everyone is encouraged  to report irregularities based on ICA\\u2019s Good Business and related policies. If they are  noticed early enough, we have a better chance of preventing risks and taking action.  This benefits not only us but also our employees and other stakeholders.  A whistleblower possibility is included in ICA\\u2019s business ethics policy, to ensure that  any employee or manager who becomes aware of an irregularity and does not want  to report it through the normal chain of command can do so anonymously.

We must constantly adapt to de- mands for greater transparency, regulatory changes and increasing requirements  placed on sustainability in every level of the supply chain. Unless we can satisfactorily  meet the market\\u2019s expectations and our own goals, there is a risk that the brand and  ICA\\u2019s position in the market will suffer. There is also a risk that cost efficiencies will be  affected unless satisfactory measures are taken to conserve energy and reduce waste,  among other things.  On the other hand, our market position could improve if ICA can meet customer de- mand for environmentally friendly and healthy products better than the competition.  We can also be more cost-effective by reducing consumption of energy and materials  in our operations. Generally, we are best able to address sustainable development issues through our lo- cal presence in each market and by educating and informing customers. The model below shows ICA\\u2019s degree of influence and ability to affect every part of the  value chain.

Maintaining a  continuous dialogue with these groups is also an important part of  ICA\\u2019s CR work. Among the most important dialogue partners are: Global Compact:  \\u2022\\t The UN initiative to promote corporate citizenship international- ly. ICA has signed the Global Compact\\u2019s Caring for Climate action platform and is  a member of a Swedish government initiative overseen by the Ministry for Foreign  Affairs to encourage Swedish companies to be ambassadors for human rights, fair  labor practices, a better environment and anti-corruption practices, in accordance  with the principles of the Global Compact. Global Social Compliance Program (GSCP): \\u2022\\t  International alliance seeking to build a  consensus on best practices for labor standards in consumer goods supply chains.  The program is run by the Consumer Goods Forum (formerly CIES), which is a  principal partner of ICA. Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI):  \\u2022\\t Alliance between a number of the world\\u2019s  leading experts on food safety from retailers, manufacturers, food service com- panies and service suppliers in the food industry. Coordinated by the Consumer  Goods Forum. Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI):  \\u2022\\t ICA is a member of the Norwegian Ethical Trading  Initiative (ETI) since 2001 which is a forum for ethical trade and other challenges in  global supply chains. Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI):  \\u2022\\t European platform for companies to  improve work conditions at consumer goods suppliers in high-risk countries. ICA  participates together with one of its owners Ahold, which is a member. World Wide Fund of nature (WWF): \\u2022\\t  ICA has worked with the environmental orga- nization WWF on the issues of sustainable fishing, palm oil and free range meats. World Childhood Foundation, Red Cross, the Scoutmovement, the Glada Huddik  \\u2022\\t Theatre, The H.M. King Carl XVI Gustaf\\u2019s Foundation for Young Leadership and  the Swedish Cancer Society/Pink Ribbon: ICA Sweden has longstanding coopera- tions with these organizations. Swedish Society for Coeliacs and Swedish Asthma and Allergy Association: \\u2022\\t  Annu- al campaigns at the Swedish ICA Maxi and ICA Kvantum-stores offering the local  organisations a platform to highlight the allergy handicap. At the same time the  consumers get hands-on assistance in food allergy issues in the stores.  9 Gri report 2010, iCa Group standard disclosures Swedish National Institute of Public Health: \\u2022\\t  ICA is cooperating on a project called  \\u201cA healthier Sweden\\u201d to draw attention to the importance of a proper diet and ex- ercise. Federation of Swedish Farmers (LRF):  \\u2022\\t ICA Sweden and LRF have cooperated for  years and are now working together on various projects. The goal is to meet the  increased demand for foods made from Swedish commodities. Dialogue with ICA\\u2019s stakeholders ICA has identified its stakeholders from the materiality analysis and the relevant CR  issues. The most important stakeholder groups are customers, employees, owners,  independent ICA retailers in Sweden, franchisees in Norway, suppliers, government  authorities and a number of NGOs. These groups have different expectations and  place different demands on the Group\\u2019s CR work. Maintaining a continuous dialogue  is also an important part of ICA\\u2019s CR work.  By cooperating with consumer and environmental organizations, trade organiza- tions, sports clubs and other interest groups, ICA has the opportunity to compare  and improve the way it works. The aim is to use different methods to structure the  dialogue. Key interest stakeholders include: Consumer Goods Forum (CGF)  \\u2022\\t dagligvarehandelns Milj\\u00f6forum (dMF) \\u2022\\t dagligvareleverand\\u00f8renes Forening (dlF),  \\u2022\\t employers\\u2019 Confederation of latvia  \\u2022\\t \\u201cemployers will fight against hiV\\u201d   \\u2022\\t (rimi Baltic is a member) eu animal Welfare platform \\u2022\\t Forest stewardship Council (FsC) \\u2022\\t Good pharmacy practice (Gpp) \\u2022\\t Greenpeace  \\u2022\\t Green Warriors of norway  \\u2022\\t handels- og servicen\\u00e6ringens hovedorgan- \\u2022\\t isasjon, (hsh)  international Chamber of Commerce (iCC) \\u2022\\t investors Forum in lithuania \\u2022\\t KraV/debio  \\u2022\\t latvian association of Food retailers \\u2022\\t latvian Chamber of Commerce and   \\u2022\\t industry (lCCi)  livsmedelshandlarna (sslF) \\u2022\\t Marine stewardship Council (MsC) \\u2022\\t Mattilsynet \\u2022\\t roundtable on sustainable palm oil  \\u2022\\t (through ahold) roundtable on responsible soy   \\u2022\\t (through ahold) swedish Trade Federation \\u2022\\t svensk dagligvaruhandel  \\u2022\\t swedish Food Federation \\u2022\\t swedish institute for Food and   \\u2022\\t Biotechnology (siK) swedish national Food  administration \\u2022\\t swedish society for nature Conservation \\u2022\\t swedish association of environmental   \\u2022\\t Managers sweden Forest & Trade network \\u2022\\t swedish Consumer Coalition \\u2022\\t swedish pharmacy association \\u2022\\t The association of lithuanian Trade   \\u2022\\t enterprises (alTe)  The Foreign investors\\u2019 Council in latvia  \\u2022\\t The swedish Trade Council in lithuania \\u2022\\t Ziedot lv  \\u2022\\t  10 Gri report 2010, iCa Group standard disclosures stakeholders\\u2019 key issues and dialogues in 2010 Stakeholder  Key issues  Dialogues/activities to manage these issues Employees   opportunities for skills train- \\u2022\\t ing and professional devel- opment. strong leadership. \\u2022\\t Good work environments. \\u2022\\t diversity. \\u2022\\t annual employee survey. \\u2022\\t performance reviews. \\u2022\\t iCa school and iCa\\u2019s Good Business. \\u2022\\t Values-based leadership, i.e., the hr department supports leaders with coaching,  \\u2022\\t relationship building and employees\\u2019 career development.  preventive wellness by giving leaders tools to work with their employees. \\u2022\\t Stores  energy efficiency in stores. \\u2022\\t Food safety. \\u2022\\t Food waste. \\u2022\\t reduce energy consumption in stores by providing tools, solutions and ideas for  \\u2022\\t new and existing stores. information and training activities with quality coaches, retail intranet, etc. \\u2022\\t Continuous meetings and consultations with iCa retailers. \\u2022\\t daily contacts with iCa stores through iCa call centers and operations   \\u2022\\t managers.

The  sustainability report comprises this Gri-report and the annual  report, also available in printed form. We have published an annual  environmental and corporate responsibility report since 1995. as of  2006, it is published together with iCa\\u2019s annual report. The report  follows the iCa Group\\u2019s financial year. The 2010 edition covers the  period January 1, 2010 to december 31, 2010. The previous report was  published in March 2009. Information and performance indicators in the report have been selected based on  the CR aspects that are relevant to our operations. The opinions of our stakeholders  are important to consider when defining the key issues in our CR work. These opin- ions are valuable in order to make continuous improvements. With the help of the  GRI\\u2019s \\u201cGuidance on Defining Report Content,\\u201d we have conducted a materiality anal- ysis, where the demands and expectations of our stakeholders, among other things,  served as a basis. The materiality analysis was defined for the first time in 2008 and  is revised each year.   Boundaries The report mainly comprises operations that have a significant, direct impact from  a CR perspective, i.e., the Group\\u2019s own operations. In Sweden, we collaborate with  around 1,400 independent retailers through agreements. Information on them is  presented when relevant to the overview of the ICA Group\\u2019s CR work, e.g.: Electricity consumption  \\u2022\\t Waste collected from deliveries of goods to stores  \\u2022\\t Sales data from stores  \\u2022\\t The number of stores that are certified according to food standards and are  \\u2022\\t Swan-labeled Operations outside ICA\\u2019s direct control, such as suppliers and customers, are not in- cluded in the report. Information on suppliers of ICA\\u2019s corporate brands is included  in the report when applicable.  13 Gri report 2010, iCa Group standard disclosures Measurement and calculation methods iCa sweden, iCa norway and rimi Baltic use a common iT system to collect data on Cr issues. The system  supports continuous reporting with the aim to ensure the long-term quality of the indicators included in iCa\\u2019s  continuous monitoring and annual Cr report. The company in each country reports data according to the  Group\\u2019s definitions and routines for Cr reporting. iCa\\u2019s calculation and reporting parameters are described in  detail below.    Charitable contributions  include voluntary donations from iCa  \\u2022\\t sweden as well as donations from cus- tomers, employees and suppliers collect- ed through iCa sweden. The recipients  are charitable organizations and nGos. Energy  includes stores and warehouses as well  \\u2022\\t as offices belonging to logistics depart- ments. The two iCa To Go stores are not  included. To calculate electricity consumption in  \\u2022\\t swedish and norwegian stores, a sam- pling of stores in each format is used.  Their actual consumption is extrapolated  based on the total number of stores at  the end of the report period.  To calculate energy consumption per  \\u2022\\t square meter in warehouses and stores,  the area of the stores and warehouses in  operation at year-end is used.   rimi lithuania reports average area in  \\u2022\\t connection with the transfer of ware- houses in mid 2010. Goods transports and climate impact  include goods transports between stores  \\u2022\\t and iCa\\u2019s warehouses. Transports by sup- pliers to warehouses are not included. iCa sweden and rimi Baltic is calculated  \\u2022\\t based on distances driven and average  fuel consumption. diesel consumption  for own goods transports in iCa norway  and rimi Baltic is obtained directly from  the diesel supplier. Measurement does  not take into account the amount of re- newable fuel used. a revised method is  scheduled to be introduced in 2011. leased transports between warehouses  \\u2022\\t and stores in norway are estimated on  driven transport distance and average  diesel consumption for their own trans- portation.  Cooling agents  include cooling agents refills in all ware- \\u2022\\t houses and rimi Baltic\\u2019s stores. stores in  norway and sweden are not included. data on iCa sweden\\u2019s warehouses are  \\u2022\\t based on official coolant reports.  Business travel  includes business travel by air booked  \\u2022\\t through iCa\\u2019s central travel agency for  employees of iCa norway and iCa swe- den. as of 2008, we buy carbon offsets  for air travel.  includes business travel by rail made by  \\u2022\\t employees within iCa sweden booked  through iCa\\u2019s central travel agency or di- rectly through travel providers with iCa\\u2019s  customer number. includes business travel by car made by  \\u2022\\t employees in sweden.   Climate change  The following factors are used to calculate  Co2 emissions:   emissions factor for 2006 nordic elec- \\u2022\\t tricity for conventional electricity in  sweden and norway.  supplier-specific emissions factor for  \\u2022\\t units that have signed iCa\\u2019s central elec- tricity agreement.

Waste  includes all warehouses as well as iCa  \\u2022\\t norway\\u2019s and rimi Baltic\\u2019s stores. soft  plastics from stores are not included for  all countries, since this type of waste is  returned from stores to warehouses.  national laws and regional waste man- \\u2022\\t agement systems define the types of  waste involved.  information on waste management  \\u2022\\t methods and amounts is obtained from  waste contractors.  Waste volumes in iCa norway and rimi  \\u2022\\t Baltic stores are based on actual waste  amounts collected during the year for a  significant part of the stores. Generated  waste is extrapolated using the number  of stores at year-end. rimi Baltic\\u2019s waste is based on actual  \\u2022\\t waste data extrapolated by the number  of stores at year end. Waste from out- sourced warehouse in estonia are ex- cluded. Waste reported for rimi Baltic also in- \\u2022\\t cludes packaging waste for products that  rimi Baltic introduces on the market.  Compostable waste comprises biode- \\u2022\\t gradable organic waste, i.e., waste sorted  as compostable and 90 percent of organ- ic waste fractions with packaging. Combustible waste comprises combus- \\u2022\\t tible waste fractions and 10 percent of  organic fractions with packaging. in nor- way, 75 percent of unsorted production  waste is included as well. recycled/reused waste includes glass,  \\u2022\\t metal, wood, plastics and other non- landfill waste. iCa norway also includes  10 percent of unsorted production waste  in recycled/reused fractions and 15 per- cent in landfill waste fractions.  Supplier-related data GFsi-certified suppliers comprise iCa\\u2019s  \\u2022\\t corporate brand suppliers approved ac- cording to one of the quality standards  approved by the Global Food safety ini- tiative (GFsi). information on socially audited suppli- \\u2022\\t ers refers to active suppliers in high risk  countries and their production units   which have been socially audited ac- cording to iCa social audit or any of the  third party audit scheme that accepted  by iCa. The definition of a high risk country is  \\u2022\\t based on a combination of the un de- velopment programme (undp ) human  development index and economic se- curity index. a country is considered a  high-risk country if it has  <0.85 in the  human development index and <0:50 in   14 Gri report 2010, iCa Group standard disclosures the economic security index. unless the  two index levels are consistent, the level  of the human development index will  be crucial when a country\\u2019s level of risk  is assessed.    Sales trends and number of products  includes sales from swedish and nor- \\u2022\\t wegian iCa/rimi-stores. in sweden, only  iCa sweden\\u2019s central assortment of the  products described below is included. The number of products corresponds to  \\u2022\\t the total number of unique ean codes  in iCa\\u2019s range of food intolerance prod- ucts or those labeled according to Fair- trade, Keyhole, organic (KraV/debio, eu  organic). Keyhole-labeled products and products  \\u2022\\t for food intolerances are available in  swedish and norwegian iCa stores.  Quality work and product safety  recalls comprise all recalled products  \\u2022\\t from warehouses and/or stores. re- calls that are considered a risk to human  health or the environment are public re- calls, i.e., the public is informed through a  press release, among other measures.  Tests comprise the number of internal  \\u2022\\t and external product tests on iCa\\u2019s cor- porate brands, both new and existing  products. Quality in stores  Certified stores in sweden refer to stores  \\u2022\\t approved and certified by a third party  according to the swedish standard for  food quality. stores that have implemented the food  \\u2022\\t quality standard refer to swedish iCa  stores that apply the standard, but are  not certified by a third party.  hygiene inspections comprise the num- \\u2022\\t ber of inspections performed by iCa  norway\\u2019s own employees at iCa/rimi  stores in norway. Employees  include personnel employed by the  \\u2022\\t Group, i.e., including workers in stores  owned by iCa. The number of employees comprises  \\u2022\\t full-time workers, workers hired on a tri- al basis and workers with temporary as- signments of longer than three months.  The number of full-time employees  \\u2022\\t (FTe) comprises full-time workers, work- ers hired on a trial basis and temporary  workers of longer than three months.  The average number of employees is  based on the Group\\u2019s measure of normal  working hours, i.e., 1,800 hours per year.  employee turnover is calculated as the  \\u2022\\t number of people who left during the  year in relation to the average number of  permanent workers and workers hired  on a trial basis.  sick-leave is calculated as the number of  \\u2022\\t hours of sick leave in relation to sched- uled working hours.  The share of men/women at the man- \\u2022\\t agement level refers to all management  levels within the Group and is based on  the number of full-time employees (FTe). store robberies includes number of rob- \\u2022\\t beries or robbery attempts of products  or money from a store or store employ- ee including physical violence or threats  of physical violence. Material changes since previous   report period Compared with previous years, the follow- ing changes in the report parameters and  calculation principles were made in 2010:  iCa sweden\\u2019s sales of organic and Fair- \\u2022\\t trade-labeled products for 2009 have  been revised. a review of the system  showed that a number of products had  not been included in the 2009 figures.  The system has been analyzed and cor- rected.  The number of Fairtrade and organically  \\u2022\\t labeled products is reported as the num- ber of units, i.e., unique ean codes.  The calculation method for diesel con- \\u2022\\t sumption for hired transport for iCa  norge has changed during the year.  15 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Economic Performance EC Engagements and  investments \\u2013 creating  value in society       Our aim is to achieve profitable long-term growth based on a well- managed business that creates value for our owners and other  stakeholders. The work includes serving as a positive force in society  and making wise investments for the future. In 2010, the Group  generated revenue of SEK 93 billion.  Our cooperations with charitable organizations are also investments. These cooper- ations endorse important values. The ICA Group benefits in both the short-and long- term from a healthier, more humane and better-informed world.  Popular, high-quality products, new control systems for distribution, improved en- ergy and waste management, good work environments and employee training lead  not only to a better environment and greater social benefit but also lower costs and  better business over time.

In 2010, we were involved in a number of well received  campaigns and activities together with NGOs:  Since 2003, ICA Sweden has been the principal partner of the World Childhood  \\u2022\\t Foundation, where we are working to help marginalized children. We contrib- ute by collecting money for Childhood\\u2019s projects. The 2010 Christmas campaign  and other activities generated SEK 8,3 million. ICA Sweden sold M\\u00e5ns Zelmerl\\u00f6v\\u2019s  Christmas album and donated one percent of total corporate brand sales in stores  during a two-week period in December.  For the eighth consecutive year, ICA Sweden was the chief sponsor of the Pink  \\u2022\\t Ribbon campaign, which collects money for Swedish cancer research with the  goal of creating a greater understanding of the connection between food and  breast cancer. In 2010, the Pink Ribbon and promotional products were sold in  ICA\\u2019s stores through payment cards in the customer magazine Buff\\u00e9, which raised  SEK 7,1 million. During the year, ICA Sweden was also the chief sponsor of the  mustache campaign against prostate cancer, which raised over SEK 3.5 million. ICA Sweden arranged the \\u201cWe can do more\\u201d lottery in cooperation with the  \\u2022\\t Swedish National Association for Persons with Intellectual Disability (FUB), which  collected a total of SEK 5 million.  ICA Sweden was the main sponsor of the Swedish road race series Blodomloppet  \\u2022\\t for the eighth consecutive year. During that time, the number of runners has in- creased from 14,000 to over 76,000. Blodomloppet brings attention to the impor- tance of blood donations, as well as food and health, and in 2010 races were run  in 14 locations around Sweden. In cooperation with the charity Algojimas, which supports disabled children, Rimi  \\u2022\\t Baltic in arranged a charitable concert on Lithuanian TV. In connection with the  concert, EUR 50,000 was donated by viewers.  Rimi Baltic in Latvia fundraised 342 711 EUR in 2010 and therefore giving a signifi- \\u2022\\t cant help for eight projects which helped to improve childerns health and even  save their lifes ICA Norway has now installed bottle recycling machines in 293 stores, where cus- \\u2022\\t tomers can choose to receive their refund or donate the money to the Red Cross.  By donating the deposit, the customer is automatically entered into a lottery. In  total, the lottery generated NOK 12.6 million in ICA Norway\\u2019s stores in 2010, of  which NOK 4.2 million went to the Red Cross. Similar machines in Swedish ICA  stores generated SEK 4.8 million for the Red Cross.

Our  overall risk analysis also includes the assessment and management of risks related to climate change. Society\\u2019s growing awareness of climate change  is likely to result in new laws and regulations,  which in turn affect our operations financially  and physically. We continuously monitor these  issues so that we are ready to quickly adapt. Im- portant areas include emissions limits on goods  transports, taxes that lead to more expensive  fossil fuels and society\\u2019s transition to renewable  energy sources. The physical risks that climate change could  cause \\u2013 temperature changes, drought, \\ufb02oods,  etc. \\u2013 affect everyone in society. For us, it means  that access to various crops could change over  time due to new growing patterns. Goods trans- ports could be affected if extreme weather con- ditions were to limit our access. New store open- ings could also be affected. Flooding in certain  areas, for example, would be a risk that would  have to be considered in such decisions. Re- duced access to fossil fuels also represents a po- tential risk if ICA cannot handle the transition of  its operations to renewable fuels.   New spending patterns due to a growing aware- ness of climate change could constitute a risk  unless the ICA Group adapts quickly enough to  shifting customer demands. Change Risks Opportunities Challenges give rise to new ideas. The climate change  debate is likely to lead to stricter limits on CO2 emis- sions from transports. This increases the need for en- vironmentally friendly solutions such as more rail  transports. New technology is also being developed  for new demands, which provides opportunities for  eco-friendly solutions. For example, a tax on synthetic  cooling agents would steer development toward more  eco-friendly alternatives in everything from transports  to refrigeration systems in stores.  As customer demand for products adapted to climate  change and environment safety increases, we can also  find new opportunities, e.g., by developing new prod- ucts or finding locations within biking or walking dis- tance of residential areas. Moreover, the ability to bet- ter manage wastes in society in general means that  our stores can also manage their wastes more safely.  The attention being given to the impact of food waste  on climate change is leading to a greater focus on re- ducing shrinkage. Through an early transition to re- newable energy sources, we can ensure that our op- erations will remain viable even if access to fossil fuels  were reduced. Reducing energy consumption is also a  way to save money.    Satisfied customers are a competitive advantage. By  being open, inventive and ambitious, we can improve  customer relations. This can give us a business advan- tage.

In  addition to several initiatives to label local products in all our countries, we are doing  several things to satisfy the growing interest from consumers.  Rimi Baltic in Lithuania has launched a concept it calls \\u201cVikis,\\u201d a shop-in-shop that  \\u2022\\t sells only local products. In a Vikis store, customers can find everything from dairy  products, meat, vegetables and bread to jams, oils and honey. Lithuanian produc- ers have their own ways of making the products and their own recipes. Today cus- tomers can find Vikis in four stores. Plans call for an eventual launch in all three Bal- tic markets.  A popular product launch in Sweden in 2010 was ICA Selection pork, locally pro- \\u2022\\t duced by four selected farms in southeastern Sweden. The breeding pigs are raised  on feed made only from Swedish commodities, i.e., without any imported soy. The  sows farrow on thick straw. The farms are expected to run primarily renewable  electricity from wind and hydropower. Production is certified according to IP Sigill  (Swedish Seal of Quality), which guarantees that certain criteria are met in terms of  animal welfare, environmental protection and food safety.  ICA Sweden has launched an intranet marketplace, ICA Torget, where local pro- \\u2022\\t ducers and retailers can meet. Local producers also have the opportunity to come  in to contact with retailers and stores at network meetings and at the annual ICA  convention, where a number of local producers market their products. Marketing  templates have been produced in Sweden to help local producers get their prod- ucts seen in stores. Rimi Baltic\\u2019s promotions in Latvia for freshly harvested local products have re- \\u2022\\t ceived an enormous response. In Estonia, Rimi Baltic cooperate with the Associa- tion of Estonian Food Industry to label local products with the Estonian flag.   Community development initiatives EC8\\u20139 reported EC8\\u20139 reported The ICA Group wants to be a positive force with a local presence in society. We  therefore participate in debates and various initiatives, in addition to sponsoring and  supporting projects in local communities. In connection with new store openings,  we work with municipalities, regions and authorities to support local development.  In rural Swedish communities, ICA stores serve as an agent for Apoteket and Sys- \\u2022\\t tembolaget, the state-run pharmacy and alcohol monopolies, as well as for the  postal service. In cooperation with Kuponginl\\u00f6sen, ICA Bank has been handling payment servic- \\u2022\\t es since 2008 for rural communities that were dropped when Svensk Kassaservice  went out of business.  Through local mail carriers and services of the ICA Bank, residents in about 70 ru- \\u2022\\t ral routes can pay bills and cash checks.  ICA Bank has an agreement with the Swedish Migration Board to pay out assis- \\u2022\\t tance to asylum seekers, who receive a debit card from ICA Bank where the mon- ey is deposited. The cardholder can then withdraw cash or make purchases at any  ICA store.  ICA Bank has joined together with ECPAT, 12 other Swedish banks and the police  \\u2022\\t to stop online purchases of child pornography. ECPAT is a global network of orga- nizations working to eliminate child prostitution, pornography and trafficking.  19 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Economic Performance EC ICA is also an active partner in \\u201cArena for Growth,\\u201d a public-private partnership to  \\u2022\\t promote local and regional growth through collaboration and growth-promoting  processes.  We support projects like \\u201cJobbsjansen\\u201d in Oslo, ICA\\u2019s trainees in the G\\u00f6teborg sub- \\u2022\\t urb of Bergsj\\u00f6n, and Merit.nu in Stockholm. Besides that Rimi Baltic has an initi- tive to integrate employees with functional disabilities in the stores. ICA Sweden  in collaboration with the ICA retailers association and local ICA retailers also em- ploy people with functional disabilities through Samhall and municipal day care fa- cilities. Rimi Baltic\\u2019s hypermarkets in Lithuania and Estonia have set up boxes where cus- \\u2022\\t tomers can donate products to families in need. In 2010 in 14 Rimi Lithuania stores  were collected 91 188 food products, which total value is approximately EUR  83,500. Rimi Baltic in Estonia are donating food for the Red Cross, Food Bank and  Shalom charity. During one promotion in November four Rimi stores in Estonia  collected 7,800 food items.  In Latvia, Rimi Baltic sponsored the Nordea Riga Marathon providning 10,000 run- \\u2022\\t ners with meal and an environmental friendly shopping bag.  In 14 locations in Latvia, Rimi has donated food to soup kitchens, which feed  \\u2022\\t around 15,000 people a month.   ICA Norway helped to renovate Fattighuset in 2010 and contributed the food dis- \\u2022\\t tributed to needy families twice a week. At Christmas, all employees have the op- portunity to donate to Fattighuset.  Rimi Baltic in Lithuania and the Vilnius employment office launched a bicycle park- \\u2022\\t ing project, Veloparkas, in the capital. In 2010, 200 sheltered bike parking facilities  were installed around the city. Rimi Lithuania works closely with Eco dot (recycling system improvement and fu- \\u2022\\t ture education campaigns are planned) Rimi Lithuania together with Lithuanian Public Health Offices are initiating an edu- \\u2022\\t cation project \\u201cSuperkids\\u201d which concerns healthy nutrition. For the third year in succession, Rimi Latvia supports the Large Joint Cleaning in  \\u2022\\t which in more than 300 000 persons have participated . In Rimi and Supernetto  stores any consumer wanting to go cleaning could receive bags for waste. Also,  Rimi office employees took part in the preliminary cleaning by gathering waste  and facilitating improvements in the yard and surroundings of some multi-apart- ment houses.  20 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Environmental Performance EN Environment and climate  change \\u2013 critical to our future Every part of the ICA Group impacts the environment. This is why we  work with environmental issues throughout our operations. We think  sustainably in our sourcing and distribution and develop climate smart  stores and warehouses. We are working in several ways to preserve  biological diversity and to further increase the number of organic and  eco-labeled products we offer. Reducing energy consumption and waste  is an important part of our internal environmental work. In addition, we  encourage consumers to reduce their own impacts in various ways.  We have a climate goal to reduce the Group\\u2019s known greenhouse  gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020 compared to 2006. Initiatives to preserve oceans, forests,  meadows and species EN12\\u201315 reported Global Compact 8 EN12\\u201315 reported Global Compact 8 Every day the ICA Group sells large amounts of food in five different countries. In the  process, our operations use the Earth\\u2019s resources. But we are careful to do so cau- tiously. If the oceans are overfished and the rainforests are plundered, it will affect  us not only as people but also as a retail company. This is why we constantly look  for new ways to preserve biological diversity. One of the key partners in our work  with biological diversity is World Wide Fund of nature (WWF).  We are continuously expanding our range of organic products with the goal of offer- ing organic alternatives in every product group. Free range beef and open landscapes Since we started working with WWF in Sweden in the 1990s, more than 90,000 acres  of pastureland have been restored. Grazing cattle keep the landscape open and en- sure a rich diversity of flora and fauna. Their grazing and waste are important to the  species richness in the pastureland.  In 2010, the cooperation entered a new phase when WWF transitioned from pri- marily restoring overgrown pasture to ensuring that the results achieved to date are  maintained in the long term as well as spreading the concept to new landowners  and other stakeholders. To avoid seeing restored pasture abandoned once again re- quires owners who remain committed to their preservation. The strongest driver is  the demand for free range beef.  In 2010, ICA launched one new product in its line of free range beef, which now con- sists of a total of 13 products. Sales in 2010 correspond to around 1,800 head of free  range cattle, while about 13,300 acres of Swedish pastureland have been preserved.  21 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Environmental Performance EN Healthy oceans have enough fish The ICA Group has taken a stand in several ways to protect endangered species of  fish. We utilize WWF\\u2019s guide with a red, yellow and green listed fish in Norway and  Sweden. As far as possible, we try to avoid red listed fish in the main assortment  sold to the stores. WWF\\u2019s fish guide was updated in October 2010, and we are work- ing to adapt our product range to it as far as possible. We are also expanding our  range of MSC-certified fish such as frozen haddock and cod fillets.  Consumers can trace the cod, haddock and alaska pollock sold under ICA\\u2019s brands  on the Group\\u2019s Swedish website, where they can follow its journey from the Baltic  Sea outside Norway to ICA\\u2019s warehouses and stores and find out what is being done  to protect the species. ICA Sweden\\u2019s website also shows how our seafood products  are classified according to WWF\\u2019s fish guide. In 2010, farmed salmon was a hot-button issue in seafood-crazed Norway. The de- bate has been whether it is healthy to eat farmed salmon and whether its produc- tion harms the environment. Despite contradictory opinions, we have tightened our  requirements on the fishing industry and require suppliers to provide us with ad- equate information on farmed salmon and its origins, and to take measures to pro- duce the fish sustainably.  Soy and palm oil from preserved forests The manufacture of ICA\\u2019s corporate food brands in the Swedish market annually re- quires around 2,000 tons of palm oil. We have decided that all palm oil used in ICA\\u2019s  private labels must be certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) by  2015. This is part of an effort to encourage palm oil plantations to meet environmen- tal, social and economic criteria and preserve the rainforests. The volumes are lim- ited, however. We are therefore buying Green Palm certifications to support more  palm oil plantations in their efforts to meet RSPO criteria.  We are also involved in the issue of soy, whose cultivation can have a major long- term impact on tropical forests and savannas, including in Brazil.  During the year,  we held discussions with the Federation of Swedish Farmers (LRF) among others,  the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and feed producers on how the world  can transition to more sustainably produced soy and how we can reduce its use.  Through the ICA Group\\u2019s owner, Ahold, we are a member of the Roundtable for Sus- tainable Soy and are carefully monitored developments in this area. ICA Sweden has decided to sell only FSC-certified private-label charcoal and that all  products made of tropical woods, such as outdoor furniture, must be FSC-certified.  The stores in Sweden annually sell around 10,000 tons of certified charcoal. ICA also  offers FSC-labeled disposable grills, notebooks and copy paper.

In 2010 the focus has been on concrete actions and ef- forts have paid off.  2010 was a year of unusually long and cold winter and a very hot summer, which  had an impact on energy consumption. Despite this, energy efficiency in our ware- houses in Norway increased due to energy conservation measures and increased  warhouse surface during the year. Total energy increased in our Baltic warehoueses  since they during the year opened new, larger storage units, and during a period had  double warehouses in operation.  The refill of refrigerants increased by approximately 3.7 tonnes during the year. This  is mainly due to the very hot summer that were demanding for the cooling systems  in stores and warehouses.  The objective of the Swedish ICA stores energy usage to decrease by ten percent in  2010 compared with 2007 was achieved. The total energy savings amounted to 14  percent compared to 2007. The Baltic stores\\u2019 energy consumption increased during  the year mainly due to the unusual weather conditions, because a number of stores  opened during the year. For many stores there is a much larger potential for energy  saving than ten percent.

This applies on a widespread basis  in Sweden and Norway. In the Baltic countries, stores are upgrading their refrigera- tors and freezers in connection with Rimi\\u2019s rebranding. The stores are gradually replacing their lighting with more modern, energy ef- \\u2022\\t ficient alternatives. A number of Rimi Baltic\\u2019s Lithuanian stores have automated  lighting. Savings are estimated at up to 50 percent, and for the whole store it can  generate energy savings of 10\\u201315 percent. The CoolICA system, which is used in Norway to monitor energy consumption  \\u2022\\t and temperatures, has been installed in 393 stores. Rimi Baltic uses an Automatic Monitoring System to control temperatures in re- \\u2022\\t frigerators and freezers. Several stores have hired energy consultants and conduct  energy audits. Opened in 2010, ICA Kvantum Sanneg\\u00e5rden in G\\u00f6teborg has put ICA Sweden\\u2019s en- \\u2022\\t ergy-efficiency strategy into practice. Among other things, the store has solar pan- els on its roof, automatic lighting and ventilation, and lids and doors on all refriger- ated cases and freezers. In total, energy consumption has been reduced by about  35 percent compared to a conventional store of the same size. ICA Kvantum San- neg\\u00e5rden is therefore seen as a store of the future. Rimi Baltic in Latvia encourages store employees to share their knowledge of en- \\u2022\\t ergy savings. In Sweden, 377 ICA stores were certified according to the Nordic Swan eco-la- \\u2022\\t bel at year-end 2010, compared to 382 a year earlier. One of the reasons why the  number has decreased while the share has remained constant is that the total  number of ICA stores in Sweden was reduced by ten. The requirements to have a  store Swan certified were tightened in 2010 in terms of waste sorting and energy  efficiency, among other things. The ICA Maxi Hypermarket, ICA Kvantum and ICA  Supermarket formats are all trying to meet the Nordic Swan criteria.

The goal is to have stations at  about 20 ICA stores around the country within five years. By year-end, there were  charging stations at ICA stores in \\u00d6stersund, V\\u00e4ster\\u00e5s and G\\u00f6teborg.  In 2010, ICA Sweden ran a campaign offering regular customers discounted pric- \\u2022\\t es on energy-saving light bulbs. If customers use the bulbs sold during the year in- stead of conventional incandescent bulbs, CO2 emissions will be reduced by an  estimated 26,600 tons, compared to 18,300 tons in the 2009 campaign. Rimi stores in all three Baltic markets offer bags made from 33 percent recycled  \\u2022\\t material as well as cotton and paper bags.   24 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Environmental Performance EN Rimi Baltic in Estonia participated in \\u201cKillerkott tapab,\\u201d a major campaign to in- \\u2022\\t crease awareness about the environmental dangers of plastic bags and to show  customers the alternatives. For example, it offers recyclable bags as well as cloth  bags at an inexpensive price.  Rimi Baltic in Latvia participated in a project called 10/10/10, Worldwide Green  \\u2022\\t Works Day for the first time in 2010 and offered to exchange a cloth bag for ev- ery four plastic bags customers brought in. In a single day, Rimi stores distributed  30,000 cloth bags.     Greenhouse gas reduction initiatives EN18 reported Global Compact 7, 8, 9 EN18 reported Global Compact 7, 8, 9   Since 2006, the ICA Group\\u2019s direct emissions of greenhouse gas emissions has de- creased by around eight percent. In 2010 the Group\\u2019s direct emissions of greenhouse  gases slightly increased compared to last year. This is mainly because the refrigerant  consumption in the Baltic stores and stocks rose because of the unusually hot sum- mer and long and cold winter that has been demanding on systems. Climate impact  of the Norwegian stores decreased drastically when a large percentage of the stores  in 2010 switched to renewable electricity.

A decision has been  \\u2022\\t made that all Maxi ICA Hypermarkets will use it. About 40 percent of Swedish ICA  stores were using renewable electricity at year-end 2010. All warehouses in Swe- den and Norway have been doing so for a number of years. ICA Sweden has around 20 stores that use 100 percent natural coolants, and the  \\u2022\\t number is growing. Coolant levels in refrigeration and freezer systems have been  greatly reduced. Large stores primarily use glycol, which circulates in the system  and cuts the amount of cooling agents. Glycol is used in the refrigeration systems  and carbon dioxide is used for freezers at ICA Maxi, Kvantum and Supermarket.  ICA Sweden is well-positioned in this area relative to the competition. In 2010, ICA Sweden completed a project together with five selected ICA I love Eco  \\u2022\\t suppliers that has provided an important understanding of climate impacts from  products as well as of future sourcing requirements. In 2010, ICA Sweden decided to participate in the project \\u201cOne Tonne Life,\\u201d which  \\u2022\\t began in January 2011. The goal is to reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions  per person from seven to one ton by living and eating sustainably. The results  are being followed through a test family that lives in a specially built, sustainably  equipped home. We will contribute our knowledge of how choosing the right  foods can help the family to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. To draw attention to the issue of climate change, we participate in WWF\\u2019s \\u201cEarth  \\u2022\\t Hour\\u201d campaign in all our markets. We turned off the lighting in the number of  warehouses, offices and stores and encourage our customers to turn off their  lights for an hour for the sake of the environment.  All warehouses in Sweden have fossil free electricity, reducing carbon dioxide  \\u2022\\t emissions by 85 percent compared to normal electricity.    Initiatives for greener transports  EN29 reported Global Compact 8 EN29 reported Global Compact 8   To reduce the total mileage our vehicles drive, we continue to raise efficiencies in  our infrastructure and distribution network, including by ensuring that trucks are  well-filled and have carefully planned routes.  The ICA Group currently does not own any trucks, with the exception of Norway,  where we use our own and lease others. Modern engine technology and alternative  fuels reduce emissions, which we require our trucking companies to verify. In Swe- den, alternative fuels are blended with diesel and the trucks are equipped with tires  with low rolling resistance to reduce fuel consumption and environmental impacts.  ICA Sweden has been a member since 2009 of KNEG \\u2013 Climate-Neutral Goods Trans- port \\u2013 and has therefore been committed to promoting future fossil-free distribution  in Stockholm. Since April 2010, three of our trucks are powered by ethanol and have  less climate impact than traditional diesel. Since December, another vehicle also  runs on ethanol. We are open to testing other alternative fuels and are carefully fol- lowing developments in the belief that a mix of alternative fuels will be the best fu- ture solution. Biogas is one alternative, although it is sometimes in short supply. Us- ing alternative fuels on a large scale requires both reliability and access.  Diesel consumption for goods transport between stores and warehouses rose  slightly during the year. This is mainly because ICA in Sweden gradually takes over  the goods transports from suppliers to not run with empty trucks back to ware- houses from the store. This means that ICA\\u2019s goods transports increases, but the en- vironmental impact overall has declined. In the Baltic countries, goods transports  increased since during the year new warehouses opened and new and old ware- houses where open during a period.  Read about our Diesel Consumption on page 26.  26 We are also trying to shift more transports from road to rail. Today ICA Sweden  transports practically all its beverages by rail. ICA Norway transports imported, re- frigerated and frozen products as well as fruit and vegetables by train to the distribu- tion terminal in Narvik.  ICA Sweden, ICA Norway and Rimi Baltic in Estonia require their drivers to practice  eco-driving. Since 2009, all trucks that drive for ICA Sweden are equipped with alco-  locks.  ICA Sweden has hired a third party to audit its freight forwarders every year. In 2010,  the number of violations was cut in half compared to 2009. Four freight compa- nies followed the requirements completely, compared to only one in the previous  year. The most frequent issue was that they could not properly manage the speeds  of their vehicles. After the annual audit, the freight forwarders submit action plans,  which we review and approve.  The ICA Group limits air shipments to products that do not keep the quality on boat- shipments like sensitive fruits, vegetables and flowers. Any exceptions must be ap- proved by ICA\\u2019s management. Initiatives for greener business travel  ICA employees in Sweden have guidelines on choosing company cars. In 2010, the  number of eco-friendly cars in ICA\\u2019s fleet increased from 38 to 42 percent. ICA\\u2019s cen- tral leasing agreement for Swedish employees steers drivers toward eco-friendly  choices.  Since 2008, ICA buys carbon offsets for air travel by employees in Sweden and Nor- way if they book through our main travel agency. The money is helping to finance  wind power turbines in China. The offsets are purchased according to the Clean De- velopment Mechanism (CDM) Gold standard. CDM is a project model that meets the  requirements of Kyoto Protocol\\u2019s directive for greenhouse gas-reducing measures in  developing countries. ICA Sweden and ICA Norway have increased their number of videoconferences by  19 percent and teleconferences by 53 percent. Business travel by train in Sweden de- creased slightly, while air travel increased, due to the long winter prompted many to  choose air circulate.

During the  year we improved the degree of sorting in our warehouses in Sweden and Nor- way, which further reduced the amount of waste going to landfill and increased  the amount that goes to composting and anaerobic digestion. The total amount  of waste increased during the year compared to previous years, since Sweden and  Norway now also handles waste consisting of non-prescription drugs. During 2010  the issue of food waste was raised in all our markets, and many new ideas were of- fered how we can reduce shrinkage and the amount of food waste.  In Sweden, ICA retailers prepare lunches made from products near expiration,  \\u2022\\t sell blemished fruits and vegetables at a discount and have introduced a concept  called \\u201cEat Soon,\\u201d which allows customers to buy products that otherwise would  go to waste at sharply discounted prices. ICA Norway has a \\u201c50%\\u201d concept where  products near their expiration date are discounted by 50 percent in stores, which  reduces shrinkage.  ICA Sweden\\u2019s warehouses sort all their wastes, and in 2010 99 percent was re- \\u2022\\t cycled. During the year, procurement contracts were awarded to manage ICA\\u2019s  inventory waste. Waste providers that could show they recycle the waste while  maximizing recovered energy and minimizing the impact of transports have been  given priority as business partners. ICA Norway has introduced a new quality control system for fruit and vegetables  \\u2022\\t in five warehouses, including in Luhrtoppen and Bryne. The system is clearly re- ducing inventory shrinkage. The quality of fruit and vegetables has improved and  thereby reduced shrinkage in stores as well. ICA Norway has joined with the Church City Mission, the Ministry of Agriculture  \\u2022\\t and Food and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority to create a food bank in Oslo  that accepts items that the industry must discard for practical or legal reasons and  distributes them to charities.  In Latvia, Rimi Baltic works with around 30 zoos and animal shelters that receive  \\u2022\\t soon-to-expire products, while in Estonia it was the chief partner in the UN\\u2019s \\u201cEuro- pean Week on Waste Reduction,\\u201d which was arranged for the third and final year.

All our suppliers have to comply with legal  requirements and ICA\\u2019s policies.  Structured quality work  PR1 reported Global Compact 1 PR1 reported Global Compact 1   We monitor compliance with the help of audits, product label reviews, product tests  and structured quality assurance in logistics and stores. Taking responsibility for a  sustainable product range also means inspiring customers to make well-informed,  healthy choices on a daily basis. In addition, we offer a wide range of eco-labeled, or- ganic and ethical labeled products.   Quality assurance of our suppliers We require ICA\\u2019s private label food suppliers to be third-party certified according to  a product safety standard approved by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). These  standards cover food safety management systems, Hazard Analysis and Critical  Control Points (HACCP) plans and good manufacturing practices.  ICA Group\\u2019s objective was that 80 percent of all food suppliers of our corporate  brands should be third party certified under GFSI by 2010. At the end of 2010, this  amounted to 67 percent for the whole group due to efforts to ensure that we con- tinually have updated certificates in our systems and that enforcing GFSI-require- ment takes longer than expected. ICA Sweden reached the target in late 2010.  We also have our own quality standard in markets where third-party certification is  not yet established or where we feel there are higher product quality risks.  In 2008, we played a part in developing a third-party standard for small-scale food pro- duction, IP Livsmedelsf\\u00f6r\\u00e4dling (IP Food Processing), and reached an agreement to of- fer reduce auditing prices to small producers.  Suppliers of corporate brand cosmetics and hygiene products are required to be  certified by BRC Global Standard Consumer Products (BRC CP) or similar standards.  For other private label non-food suppliers, the goal is to be certified according to  BRC CP, ISO 9001 or similar standards.    29 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social performance  PR Quality assurance of our products All of ICA\\u2019s private label products undergo sensory and quality tests on the way to  becoming a finished product. The sensory tests evaluate appearance, odor, taste  and consistency. Ingredients, nutritional information and other properties are de- tailed in internal product specifications. In addition to sensory and quality tests, we  test each product\\u2019s function, as in the case of baking powder, washing detergent and  housewares. All products are examined and approved to ensure that they live up to  ICA\\u2019s policies and internal guidelines. Packaging information is also inspected and ap- proved. Rimi Baltic has expanded its corporate brands in recent years and now has its  own quality organization to assure the quality of these brands in the Baltic markets.   In 2010, we conducted a total of around 5,000 tests, 2,100 of which were sensory  tests on new and existing products.   Read how we control products from the factory   to the store, page 30 in our Annual Report.  Quality assurance of distribution  High quality is maintained throughout the supply chain until our products reach the  store. Product quality is assured through self-assessments and product safety work.  This includes a fully implemented HACCP plan, which is required by law and de- scribes how the company investigates, evaluates and inspects food risks. Quality assurance of stores Since 2009, ICA stores in Sweden have applied the Swedish standard for food han- dling. ICA Sweden played a decisive role in developing what became the world\\u2019s first  third-party food safety standard for food stores. In Sweden, the routines are being  introduced in stores under the leadership of our quality coaches. In total, 1,125 stores  have implemented the standard and 223 have been audited and certified by an in- spection body, including all 72 Maxi ICA Hypermarkets.

ICA Norway has begun building  systems and an organization to meet the requirements of the standard. In Norway,  quality coaches have been hired since early 2010 to support and inspect food safety  in stores. Until now, ICA Norway has measured quality in stores based on hygiene in- spections.  Rimi Baltic conducts internal audits to see how well its stores comply with the qual- ity standard; violations have been few in number.

In total, the ICA Group had 31 public recalls during 2010; ICA Norway,  17, ICA Sweden, 10 and Rimi Baltic, 4.  The public recalls of corporate brands included for example Euroshopper Raspberry,  which contained calicivirus and was stopped on March 18. We followed up the re- call by visiting the supplier, which confirmed that it was taking corrective measures  to improve quality. Two hot dog products, ICA\\u2019s Grillkorv 500 gram and Euroshopper  Grillkorv 400 gram, were recalled on April 13 when it was feared that they might con- tain listeria. Tests later showed no trace of listeria. The third recall pertained to three  types of imported chopped meat sold under the Euroshopper name, when it was  shown that certain batches contained salmonella.  For less serious quality problems, such as different texture, different appearance,  problems with labels and small labelingmistakes, do we withdraw the party from  the warehouses and stores. As a total for 2010, the ICA Group withdrew 920 prod- ucts; ICA Norway, 57, ICA Sweden, 76, Rimi Baltic, 764 and non-food, 23, in stores and  warehouses.

The aim is also to offer a large variety of eco-labeled, organic and Fairtrade  products and to always apply environmental thinking when selecting products.  Healthier eating habits for everyone   Our goal is to be seen as a leader in inspiring people to eat healthy. This includes be- ing a source of inspiration for people with food intolerances, which is a growing cus- tomer group in our Nordic markets. We are already an industry leader in products  for allergy sufferers.  In 2010, we modernized our Swedish ICA Gott Liv line, which includes around 70  products with more fiber and less sugar, salt and fat compared to other brands. In  this work we use the official Nordic nutritional recommendations. Salt is a major is- sue, since studies show that a lower salt intake can help to prevent cardiovascular dis- ease and high blood pressure. We will use the keyhole criteria as a guide regarding the  question of salt. Another future challenge is satisfied consumers\\u2019 desire for fewer ad- ditives and less salt and sugar in their food without sacrificing taste and shelf life.   31 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social performance  PR Keyhole-labeled products  In 2009, the keyhole became a Nordic health symbol and is now used by the en- tire Nordic food retail industry. ICA Norway introduced the keyhole to Norwegian  consumers back in 2006. Through a series of activities and consistent information,  Norwegians were educated to buy healthier food and what the keyhole represents.  Thanks largely to ICA Norway\\u2019s efforts, there was widespread familiarity with the  keyhole in Norway at the time of the Norwegian launch.  Number and the sale of keyhole-labeled products in Sweden and Norway decreased  during 2010. Demand has declined partly because of the public debate on the addi- tives, and different diets. ICA\\u2019s private label products that are labeled keyhole does  not diminish in sales in Sweden due to that ICA continued to label our products with  the keyhole while other suppliers removed the label. In 2010, ICA\\u2019s annual \\u201cBuddy with Your Body \\u2013 5 a Day\\u201d campaign gave 30,000 el- ementary school students the opportunity to learn about fruit and vegetables and  why the body needs them. Around 800 ICA stores welcomed classes to discuss  health.  Encouraging children to eat healthy is also on the agenda in Estonia, where Rimi Bal- tic and health authorities support a campaign called \\u201cYour Health Is in Your Hands.  - eat 5 handful fruit and vegetables in a day\\u201d Rimi is also involved in Latvia in encour- aging students to eat right.

ICA I Love Eco is  also a success in Sweden and accounts for a significant share of organic sales.  Products in the ICA I love Eco brand are certified according to the EU\\u2019s organic crite- rias or according to KRAV rules in Sweden or Debio in Norway. Animal-based ingre- dients in ICA I love Eco-products must be approved according to KRAV in Sweden or  Debio in Norway, both of which place more stringent requirements on animal wel- fare than the EU.  ICA Swedens organic sales have more than doubled since 2007 and in 2010 it rose by  over five percent. The organic range continued to gain share of sales, partly to wid- en the range and in part because more customers are choosing organic. Baby food,  fresh spices, grains and tea are some of the commodity groups in which the organic  sales increased sharply in Sweden. In 2010, the number of organic items in our Swed- ish main assortment counted to 1,138 products, an increase of about 100 items com- pared to 2009. ICA Norway\\u2019s organic sales dropped by around four percent during 2010. This trend  is also seen for Fairtrade and keyhole-labeled products. Reduced demand for value- added products have been identified for the industry as a whole in Norway.

In 2010, a new packaging de- sign was introduced in Sweden for ICA\\u2019s ethical private labels to make it easier for  customers to find them on the shelf and to spark interest in what the various labels  stand for. Rimi Baltic launched a few of its own Fairtrade-certified products in 2010.  ICA Sweden introduced a private label banana in 2010, certified by Rainforest Alli- ance and originating from selected plantations in Costa Rica and Ecuador. The first  shipments are being tested in early 2011.  The Swedish ICA store sales of Fairtrade certified products have continued to in- crease. Since 2008, sales growth has been more than 90 percent. In 2010, sales in- creased by approximately eight percent due to ICA\\u2019s continued commitment to ex- pand and highlight the ethical marked range.  In Norway, sales of Fairtrade marked products decreased. Reduced demand for val- ue-added products have been identified for the industry as a whole in Norway so it  is important to continue to make clear what these products represent.

Many consumers find it  difficult to understand what E-numbers stand for and whether they are really neces- sary. Our position is that they should be used restrictively and only if they add value  for the consumer, e.g., by improving food safety. In accordance with current laws,  we clearly label all additives in the list of ingredients, so that customers can make in- formed decisions.  We are also working actively to limit the use of chemicals that could be hazardous  to humans and the environment. In our agreements, suppliers must pledge to com- ply with our chemical restrictions. We ensure that they do through samples and in- spections.  According to the European regulation on chemicals, REACH, we are required upon  request to inform customers whether specific products contain any substances that  could be classified as toxic. Our goal is not to sell any products containing such sub- stances.  In 2010, the subject of bisphenol-A in baby bottles and other products received a  lot of attention in Sweden. We had been discussing bisphenol with our suppliers of  these products for some time. In 2010, we phased out all baby bottles, cash regis- ter receipts, baby food jars and other baby products containing bisphenol from ICA  Sweden\\u2019s main assortment.  Our stance on animal welfare and GMOs Our products must be manufactured under fair conditions. Animals should not be  put at risk, and natural ingredients should not be altered without good reason. Prod- ucts sold by ICA should be traceable to when and where they were manufactured.  When it comes to fresh meat, we place stricter requirements on animal welfare than  the EU, and we refuse to sell Belgian Blue breed of cattle.  In the ICA I love eco line, all animal-based ingredients are KRAV-certified to ensure  that the animals are treated with respect. KRAV\\u2019s requirements have been chosen  because they are stricter than the EU\\u2019s organic rules on animal welfare. Our ICA Se- lection pork and free range beef are also a way to protect the well-being of animals.  ICA takes a fundamentally positive view of new technology that provides consum- ers with better products. For ethical and environmental reasons, however, ICA does  question the production and cultivation of genetically modified foods and seeds  that are not produced in a closed environment . Genetically modified foods (GMO)  and ingredients shall be kept separate and shall be traceable. Consumers are entitled  to information on whether a product comprises or contains ingredients with geneti- cally modified origins.  No such product has ever been or is part of our assortment. Decisions on whether  to include such products in the product range are taken by ICA\\u2019s management.  36 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social performance  PR How we are perceived by the customers  PR5 reported PR5 reported We work systematically with internal and external surveys to communicate with  consumers and find out what they think about us and our products. In the Swedish Quality Index (SKI) for 2010, ICA maintained a leading position among  Swedish food retailers. The four Swedish formats all rank at the top against the com- petition. ICA Kvantum has the highest customer satisfaction among the formats.  Customer expectations are higher than in previous years, and all the major chains  have managed to live up to them in terms of perceived product quality. The gap is  slightly larger when it comes to service expectations. However, service quality has  improved since 2009 for all retail chains.  SKI measures and analyzes how actual customers and other users rate products and  services in Sweden. Its 2010 retail survey comprised 4,000 interviews. ICA Sweden  received a rating of 72.1 in 2010, compared to 70.6 in 2009. SKI also measures the opinions of bank customers, and in 2010 it showed that ICA  Bank\\u2019s customers are more satisfied in recent years. Measured by customer satis- faction, ICA Bank exceeds the industry average. The SKI bank survey for 2010 com- prised around 22,000 telephone interviews. The Customer Satisfaction Index survey is conducted annually. In the 2010 survey,  all four ICA store formats maintained a strong position in Sweden. ICA Kvantum and  ICA Maxi Hypermarket ranked at the top of their lists. The 2010 survey was based on  telephone interviews with 6,200 customers covering a number of questions.  In Latvia\\u2019s \\u201cBrand Top,\\u201d Rimi came in seventh on the list of the country\\u2019s most pop- ular brands presented by the ad agency DDB Latvija, the business magazine Kapital  and the research firm TNS Latvia. Rimi also placed eighth on the list of Latvian com- panies with the best reputations (Reputation Top 2010). The list was compiled for the  fourth consecutive year by the newspaper Diena in collaboration with the PR firm  Porter Novelli based on consumer and business opinions of 150 companies. 100,000 customer contacts in 2010 ICA\\u2019s call centers are there to maintain contact with customers, stores and suppli- ers. In 2010, the volume of calls and e-mails from customers in Sweden and Norway  reached 100,000. The questions mainly concerned our products, specifically nutri- tional information, ingredients, packaging and origin.

We inspect independent Swedish retailers using  undercover purchases to verify that they comply with the law. ICA Sweden\\u2019s goal is  that stores will properly check IDs at least 85 percent of the time. In 2010, The total  outcome of the inspections buying pharmaceuticals, games, tobacco and beer un- dercover was 83 percent. Inspections are made from two to 24 times a year depend- ing on the format. Evidence shows that undercover purchases are producing good  results. They remind the staff to check IDs. Through continuous information and  training for store employees, we want to maintain a high level.  In Norway, all the stores are now hiding tobacco products according to a new law.  The ICA-retailers in Sweden are discussing a similar decision at a later point.  Since 2009 there was change in the Swedish pharmacy market, which meant that  the vast majority of ICA stores decided to sell certain non-prescription drugs. During  2010 ICA Sweden also opened 30 full-scale pharmacies under the name of ICA Cura  in a number of major ICA stores around the country. In rural areas, many ICA-stores  already has a history as pharmaceutical agents, and thus already offered drugs.  The new pharmacy market offer great opportunities but also challenges for us as a  food retailers. The Medical Products Agency (MPA) has strict requirements on how  the non-prescription drugs should be exposed to prevent them from falling into the  wrong hands. During 2010 MPA notified that ICA sold and advertised nicotine re- placement products without referring to it as a drug. Steps have been taken to en- sure that this does not happen again. We have an ongoing dialogue with MPA and  see the regulations as a good starting point for the stores to ensure customer safety. In general, our sponsorships support the Group\\u2019s long-term business plan and em- phasize food and health, social responsibility, the environment and sustainable de- velopment. We commit in various ways and especially in Sweden and Norway we  prefer projects that target children and young adults. The sponsorship policy and  guidelines follows the principles of the International Code of Sponsorship.   38 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social Performance LA We develop with   our employees ICA faces high expectations as an employer. In total, the Group  employs people in over 150 different professions and 500 different  positions, from systems developer to banker and pharmacist, from  Oslo in the west to Shanghai in the east. Every day we have to adapt  our operations based on our various businesses and local market  conditions.  We continuously utilize our policies and guidelines on diversity, gender equality and  training. An important part of this work comes from leadership and the connection  to ICA\\u2019s Good Business values. By maintaining a consistent approach to leadership  within the Group, we put all our employees in a better position to help us reach our  business objectives and to enjoy their work.  About ICA\\u2019s employees LA1 reported LA1 reported LA2 reported Global Compact 6 LA2 reported Global Compact 6   In the immediate years ahead, our biggest challenge will be to motivate and attract  the right employees for the long term. To achieve this and further strengthen the  ICA Group\\u2019s employer brand, we took several measures in 2010. In cooperation with  the ICA School in each country, we are reinforcing core competencies in sales, prod- uct selection and logistics.  CEO Kenneth Bengtsson has initiated a network of young leaders to promote ex- changes within the Group and to raise the knowledge and understanding about the  ICA Group. The network has been in existence in various forms for several years and  since 2010 is called the ICA Group Network. In 2010, ICA Norway launched a \\u201cTal- ent Program,\\u201d where employees with leadership abilities receive training to become  store managers. Rimi Baltic has a Management Trainee program since seven years.  A total of 38 employees  have graduated and today works in different managers po- sitions in stores and within the company. The program has given Rimi Baltic a good  pool for internal recruiting. In total, the ICA Group employs about 28 800 employees. In 2009, a reorganization  in Sweden was done in order to decentralize the organization.   39 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social Performance LA In addition, we have created a Group-wide leadership development program to en- sure that future managerial needs are met and to call attention to opportunities for  personal development and careers within the Group. Staff turnover and staff numbers in Rimi Baltic has declined since 2009 since the  country was strongly influenced by the financial crisis, and was marked by rising un- employment. ICA Real Estate, a relatively small organization, where a minor change  in the number of employees turns out in a large percentage difference on staff turn- over. Wellness contributes to a good work  environment LA7 reported Global Compact 1 LA7 reported Global Compact 1 A good work environment is created when leaders join with their staff to make the  workplace safe and secure. To position the ICA Group as a healthy company, we  stress early rehabilitation and prevention of disease and accidents. This improves  the health of our employees and reduces rehabilitation costs.  The sick-leave within the ICA Group is quiet stable. ICA Norway has the highest ab- senteeism but working with preventive wellness during the last year has improved  the health among the employees during 2010.

Preventing accidents and creating safe environments  is obviously critical. In Sweden, Norway and the Baltic countries, employees receive  training in fire safety, first aid and how to prevent robberies and avoid threatening  situations. Preventive measures such as neighborhood watches together with other  retailers, authorities, municipalities and schools are also important.  In Sweden and Norway, the ICA Group is in the process of implementing a common  safety standard for stores and periodically conducts safety audits. The aim is to pre- vent internal and external criminality and create a safe and secure environment.  ICA Sweden is working in several ways to support ICA retailers. All employees have  the opportunity to enroll in an interactive online course on Store Safety free of  charge. In addition, it is recommended that all stores implement a 13-point program  to prevent threats, violence and robberies. ICA Sweden has also conducted insur- ance inspections to prevent damages from fires or break-ins. A coordination center  in Sweden provides resources and crisis support round-the-clock if an ICA store is  victimized by crime.  In 2010, there was a total of 47 robberies in Swedish ICA stores, an increase of about  eight percent from the previous year. Small stores were primarily victimized, and the  most common type of robbery, and attempted robbery, involved a cash register.

The goal is that all our employees will  receive a review once a year. According to the results of the Temperature Survey in  2010, 76 percent have had a review in the last twelve months.  To ensure that all our leaders have the same platform for performance management  and evaluation, a new leadership model was integrated into performance reviews in  2010.   Diversity and gender equality initiatives LA13 reported Global Compact 1, 6 LA13 reported Global Compact 1, 6   An active approach to diversity increases our attractiveness as an employer. Every- one, regardless of gender, age, sexual preference, religion, ethnic or national back- ground, or disability should have the same chance of being hired and developing on  the job. We condemn sexual harassment and discrimination in any form. One indica- tion of the importance we attach to this issue is that the ICA Group now have diver- sity manager. Since 2009, ICA Sweden and the Association of ICA-retailers have collaborated on a  project called \\u201cWe can do more,\\u201d which offers a number of people with functional  disabilities the opportunity to work in ICA-stores and at ICA\\u2019s offices and warehous- es. The other partners are Samhall and Sweden\\u2019s municipalities. The goal is that be- tween 500 and 1,000 people in total will be recruited during a three-year period. By  year-end 2010, the number was over 450. \\u201cWe can do more\\u201d begun on the initiative  of the ICA Group\\u2019s CEO inspired by the Glada Hudik Theater.  The idea to help the people with functional disabilities to join the workforce origi- nated in Rimi Baltic, which has been working to integrate employees for several  years. Today Rimi Baltic Estonia has around 35 employees with functional disabilities  in its stores and Rimi Lithuania count about 70.

We require our  suppliers to meet our expectations in terms of social responsibility  and labor conditions in production. The requirements are based on  the UN\\u2019s declaration on human rights, UNICEF\\u2019s Convention on the  Rights of the Child and the International Labour Organisation\\u2019s core  conventions.        Since 2008, the ICA Group is represented by ICA Global Sourcing  in Asia. With a local presence, we now have new opportunities to  build partnerships with our suppliers and audit that the production is  done in accordance with our requirements. Our goal is that every product we sell will be produced in an acceptable manner  with respect to human rights. We will not accept discrimination, infringements on  the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, child labor or other hu- man rights violations. This is clarified in our policy guidelines and in the contracts all  our suppliers must sign.  We monitor labor conditions in the factories that produce our corporate brand  products as well as products we import directly, e.g., generic non-food items called  \\u201cno-names.\\u201d  In addition to the UN\\u2019s Global Compact, we support and follow other human rights  initiatives, such as the OECD\\u2019s sustainability guidelines for multinational companies,  the International Chamber of Commerce\\u2019s (ICC) Business Charter for Sustainable De- velopment and the ICC\\u2019s anti-corruption and anti-bribery principles.  Social audits lead to faster improvements HR2 reported Global Compact 1\\u20136 HR2 reported Global Compact 1\\u20136 To monitor and help suppliers that produce our corporate brands to meet our re- quirements, we conduct social, environmental and quality audits. In 2008 and 2009,  the ICA Group opened sourcing offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Ho Chi Minh  City, staffed by teams for product quality, environmental safety and social responsi- bility. Being close to our Asian suppliers gives us better insight and valuable experi- ence that helps these collaborations. After three years, our efforts have resulted in a  greater mutual understanding and better compliance with our social requirements.  The job of our auditors is to verify human rights compliance. They also work pre- ventively by reviewing our suppliers\\u2019 employment routines and discussing what they  can do, for example, to avoid hiring underage workers and improve work environ- ments. The ICA Group has its own control system, ICA Social Audit, whose require- ments are based on similar criterias as the Business Social Compliance Initiative  (BSCI).  The combination of our own inspections and third-party audits has successfully  sped up the often time-consuming process of obtaining an audit from a third party.  Through the ICA Social Audit, we can help suppliers to more quickly improve human  rights in their production.  43 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social Performance HR Our supplier inspections are focused on countries that are considered to be a great- er risk of human rights violations. The countries are classified as high-risk based  on an analysis of the Human Development Index and the Economic Security In- dex, which are updated about every second year. We also inspect suppliers in other  countries when we see a risk of human rights violations. For example, berry suppli- ers in Sweden will be closely inspected in 2011. With the help of colleagues from Asia  who speak the right languages, we will conduct social audits during berry-picking  season in the Swedish woods. Approximately two thirds of the production units, factories, farms or warehouses,  located in high-risk countries and that makes ICA\\u2019s own products were socially re- vised in late 2010. In late 2009, the corresponding share was around 50 percent.  In 2011, great attention should be paid to continue to pursue this work to achieve the  goal of 100 percent of ICA\\u2019s corporate brand suppliers in high-risk countries should  be socially revised.   See page 34 in the ICA Group\\u2019s Annual Report regarding   where in the world our corporate brands are produced.  Share of socially audited corporate brand suppliers  % 2010 2009 Total ICA Group 68 47   Increased knowledge increase understanding   Providing our employees with training on social responsibility guidelines and rou- tines is an important measure. Internal training is offered on a continuous basis to  the organization responsible for the product assortment and sourcing.   Sharing our knowledge with suppliers is critical to improvement efforts. During the  year, we arranged a seminar on social responsibility in Shanghai. Several of our sup- pliers have also participated in four seminars arranged by the Business Social Com- pliance Initiative (BSCI). We use ICA Social Audit as a training tool as well, since sup- pliers receive support on how to rectify every violation we detect.  All employees of the Group receive training in ICA\\u2019s Good Business and related poli- cies, through a web-based courses. The aim is that all ICA employees in Sweden and  Norway will complete the course. In 2010 22 percent have done so.   Stakeholder dialogue on social responsibility In November 2010, ICA Sweden invited its key stakeholders to a dialogue to discuss  sustainable development and working conditions for producers of fruit and vegeta- bles. This follows several controversial documentary films on banana and pineapple  plantations. The dialogue resulted in a concrete 10-point list of measures and activi- ties to sustain the progress that has been made on ethical and sustainability issues  affecting fruit and vegetables. Among the points are: Improve and increase information in stores and in the ICA Group\\u2019s annual report  \\u2022\\t to emphasize improvement work. Bring up positive, concrete examples when communicating the social responsibil- \\u2022\\t ity work being done in the supply chain. Clarify the ICA Group\\u2019s long-term goals in terms of organic and Fairtrade labeling. \\u2022\\t Focus on building capacity building rather than just inspections. \\u2022\\t  44 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social Performance HR Human rights measures  HR4 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 6 HR4 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 6 HR5 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 3 HR5 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 3 HR6 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 5 HR6 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 5 HR7 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 4 HR7 reported Global Compact 1, 2, 4 We regularly buy goods from suppliers in countries where human rights are not tak- en for granted. If ICA\\u2019s own auditors or third-party auditors detect violations at a  production facility we use, a concrete action plan is established and followed up in a  re-audit. The first time a supplier violates our contractual requirements, they gener- ally get a second chance to correct the problem. If they do so to our satisfaction, we  will keep working with them. If a serious offense is repeated, the cooperation with  the supplier will be terminated. In social audits conducted with our own personnel in Asia during the year we identi- fied a number of shortcomings among our suppliers. These are mainly concentrated  in five areas: \\u2022\\thealth\\tand\\tsecurity  \\u2022\\tmanagement\\troutines  \\u2022\\tovertime\\thours  \\u2022\\tthe\\tpossibility\\tfor\\temployees\\tto\\tjoin\\ttrade\\tunions  \\u2022\\tminimum\\twage In twelve cases, the auditors identified serious violations in production locations  that we chose to stop buying products from them. On the other hand, several sup- pliers have received larger orders after they demonstrated positive results and im- proved working condistions in their production.    It is very important for ICA also to work with enforce and respect the fundamen- tal right for its own employees. Based on the analysis of high risk countries it is seen  that the risk of not respecting human rights is larger in some of the countries where  our products is produced and therefore the report of our work within this area is fo- cused within this area. During the year no incident regarding discrimination came to  the managements attention. Our stance on child labor  Our basic rule when it comes to child labor is that individuals younger than 15 may  not work for any of our suppliers. If national laws have stricter limits, we apply them.  In China, for example, the legal working age is 16, so there we do not allow employ- ees below this age. We also require our suppliers to give special consideration to  young workers (younger than 18) in terms of the right to limited working hours, for  example.  If we detect or suspect that an employee is not of legal age, the supplier is obligated,  through ICA\\u2019s contract, to take measures to protect the best interests of that person.  Together with the supplier, we try to find the best possible solution in light of the  child\\u2019s age, education and social situation.  45 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Social Performance SO ICA \\u2013 part of the community  We want to be seen as a positive force in society. A strong local  presence is essential to this work. We therefore participate  continuously in debates and outside initiatives, in addition to  sponsoring and supporting various local projects in all our markets.  Guidelines for relationships with our suppliers and partners are contained in a busi- ness ethics policy. ICA\\u2019s new store policy contains the fundamental guidelines on  how and where new stores are opened. Our sponsorship policy explains how we re- sponsibly manage sponsorships. A retail network in balance with local needs SO1 reported SO1 reported ICA contributes to the community in several ways. We work with municipalities, re- gions and authorities in connection with new store openings. In Sweden, there is a  connection through local ICA retailers, who own their stores and live and work in  the local area.  ICA is constantly refining the retail network it has built up over more than 90 years,  so that it remains sustainable and attractive. This means considering the local envi- ronment when deciding where to open new stores. We also try to balance customer  needs with transports to and from stores in a way that benefits the local communi- ty. For example, new stores are given priority along existing thoroughfares to avoid  increasing traffic and allow customers to get to the store on bike paths or walkways  or by using mass transit.  ICA\\u2019s also tries to maintain clear-cut rules on new stores with effective decision-mak- ing channels that emphasize the autonomy of local municipalities. ICA\\u2019s dialogue  and strong local connections with decision-makers, local businesses and interest  groups are important to the development of the retail network.

This is the translation of the auditor\\u2019s report in Swedish To the readers of ICA AB\\u2019s Sustainability Report Introduction We have been engaged by the executive team of ICA AB to review the ICA AB Sus- tainability Report for the year 2010. Our review is limited to the information related  to 2010. Our review covers the ICA Group\\u2019s Annual Report pages 10\\u201311 and pages 21\\u2013 39, and the ICA Group\\u2019s GRI report 2010 disclosed on ICA AB\\u2019s website www.ICA.se/ AnnualReports. The Board of Directors and the Executive Management are respon- sible for ongoing activities regarding the environment, health & safety, quality, social  responsibility and sustainable development, and for the preparation and presenta- tion of the Sustainability Report in accordance with the applicable criteria. Our re- sponsibility is to express a conclusion on the Sustainability Report based on our re- view. The Scope of the Review We have performed our review in accordance with RevR 6 Assurance of Sustainabil- ity Reports issued by Far. A review consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons  responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, and applying analyti- cal and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit  conducted in accordance with IAASB\\u2019s Standards on Auditing and Quality Control  and other generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. The procedures per- formed consequently do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become  aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we  do not express an audit opinion. The criteria on which our review are based are the parts of the Sustainability Report- ing Guidelines G3, published by The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which are appli- cable to the Sustainability Report, as well as the accounting and calculation princi- ples that the Company has developed and disclosed. These criteria are presented on  pages 2 and 12\\u201314 in the ICA Group\\u2019s GRI report 2010. We consider these criteria suit- able for the preparation of the Sustainability Report.  50 GRI Report 2010, ICA Group Limited assurance report Our review has, based on an assessment of materiality and risk, e.g. included the fol- lowing procedures: a.  an update of our knowledge and understanding for ICA AB\\u2019s organization and ac- tivities b.  assessment of suitability and application of criteria in respect to stakeholders  need of information  c. assessment of the result of the company\\u2019s stakeholder dialogue   d.  interviews with responsible management, at group level, subsidiary level and at  selected business units with the aim to assess if the qualitative and quantitative  information stated in the sustainability report is complete, correct and sufficient    e.  read internal and external documents to assess if the information stated in the  sustainability report is complete, correct and sufficient        f. analytical review of reported information g.  assessment of the company\\u2019s stated application level according to GRI\\u2019s guide- lines  h.  overall impression of the sustainability report, and its format, considering the in- formation\\u2019s mutual correctness with applicable criteria i.  reconciliation of the reviewed information against the sustainability information  in the company\\u2019s annual report for 2010. Conclusion Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe  that the information in the ICA Group\\u2019s Annual Report pages 10-11 and pages 21-39,  and the ICA Group\\u2019s GRI report 2010 has not, in all material respects, been prepared  in accordance with the abovestated criteria.

Sumitomo Chemical was founded in 1913 as Sumitomo\\u2019s  fertilizer manufacturing company, which produced fertilizers  by converting harmful emissions from smelting operations  at the Besshi Copper Mine in Niihama, Ehime Prefecture.  Created to provide solutions to overcome an environmental  problem and help increase agricultural production, the Com- pany is a perfect example of the Sumitomo Family\\u2019s Business  Philosophy, and the conviction that the essence of corporate  social responsibility (CSR) is to contribute to the sustainable  development of society through business activities is encod- ed in the Company\\u2019s DNA.        In formulating our recently announced Corporate Busi- ness Plan for fiscal 2010 to 2012, we have developed our  Corporate Vision that sets out our long-term management  policies. One of the central policies is that we will aim to help  meet global challenges, from improving people\\u2019s lives and  health to increasing energy and food security, to building a  low-carbon society, and will contribute to the sustainable de- velopment of the global community by taking full advantage  of the power of chemistry. In January 2010, we established  our CSR Department to promote our CSR activities while  stepping up eff orts to achieve our Corporate Vision.       Responsible Care (RC), an initiative for ensuring safety,  protecting the environment and maintaining high product  quality throughout the lifecycle of our products, from de- velopment to manufacturing and sale, to use and disposal,  is a central pillar of our CSR activities. In aiming to help solve  problems related to resources, energy and the environ- ment\\u2014particularly the issue of climate change\\u2014all of which  are becoming more pressing globally, we have been putting  forth signifi cant eff orts to achieve the world\\u2019s highest energy  effi  ciency and develop processes and products that help re- duce CO2 emissions. In January 2010, we established our En- ergy & Climate Change Offi  ce to promote concerted eff orts  by the entire Sumitomo Chemical Group and respond more  eff ectively to the issues of energy and climate change.       We are also actively participating in international initia- tives led by the global chemical industry. The International  Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA), the global organiza- tion of major chemical industry associations representing  Our Commitment to the Sustainable  Development of the Global Community Hiroshi Hirose, President Hiromasa Yonekura, Chairman   3 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 chemical companies worldwide, has established a climate  change and energy working group, and Sumitomo Chemical  has been playing a central role in the group and leading its  activities since its inception. The group demonstrated lead- ership in the ICCA\\u2019s initiative in 2009 to quantitatively study  and analyze how products of the chemical industry, such as  insulation materials and photovoltaic cell materials, as they  are used by consumers and other industries in various ap- plications, contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas  emissions. The fi ndings revealed that the reduction in green- house gas emissions from the use of chemical products is ap- proximately double to triple the amount of greenhouse gas  emissions attributable to chemical products over their entire  lifecycles.       The chemical industry, which provides a wide range of  products in various forms, from raw materials and compo- nents to finished goods, and makes vast contributions to  daily lives of people around the world, should continue to  play a major role in meeting the global challenges of climate  change. We, the Sumitomo Chemical Group, will remain fi rm- ly committed to tackling these issues by making full use of  the power of chemistry and our technological prowess and  to providing leadership in the eff orts of the global chemical  industry.       We have been providing support for Africa by working on  the prevention of malaria, which is one of the Millennium De- velopment Goals (MDGs), a set of goals defi ned by the United  Nations to address the most pressing challenges facing hu- man society. Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease  that claims the lives of more than one million people every  year. Many of the victims are children under the age of fi ve  living in the Sub-Saharan region of Africa.       Sumitomo Chemical developed the Olyset\\u24c7 Net, a special  insecticidal mosquito net for controlling malaria. The Olyset\\u24c7 Net is highly durable and also retains its insecticidal effi  cacy  for more than fi ve years because our technology enables the  insecticide contained in the material of its fi bers to migrate  gradually to the surface of the fi bers. In 2001, our Olyset\\u24c7 Net  was endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a  long-lasting insecticidal net, becoming the fi rst of its kind in  the world, and has since enjoyed strong demand growth as  one of the most eff ective means of preventing malaria.       To increase Olyset\\u24c7 Net production capacity, we licensed  our manufacturing technology free of charge to a mosquito  net manufacturer in Tanzania and started local production in  2003 in the hope of creating new jobs and supporting self- sustaining economic growth in Africa. In 2007, we started  operation of a joint venture with this local manufacturer, and  we currently have an annual production capacity of 29 mil- lion nets and employ as many as 7,000 people in Africa. This  year, we expanded our global production capacity to 60 mil- lion nets per annum in response to a request from the WHO,  which has set the goal of providing one long-lasting insecti- cidal net for every two people in areas at high risk of malaria  infection.       We are also supporting projects to build schools and re- lated facilities in Africa by returning a portion of the revenues  from the Olyset \\u24c7 Net business. We are thus implementing a  variety of initiatives to help meet the major challenges facing  Africa and accelerate progress toward the MDGs.       As a framework for businesses to contribute directly to  solving international problems caused by globalization and  achieving sustainable growth, Kofi Annan, then Secretary- General of the United Nations, proposed the Global Com- pact, which sets forth ten principles for corporate behavior in  the areas of human rights, labor standards, the environment,  and anti-corruption. Sumitomo Chemical joined in this initia- tive in 2005. Since becoming the fi rst Japanese company to  participate in the Global Compact working groups in 2008,  we have helped prepare guidelines on the tenth principle for  anti-corruption as well as on the contribution of businesses  to peace and development. We will continue to work closely  together with a variety of stakeholders, including the United  Nations and other international organizations, NGOs, and  other companies, and promote CSR activities as a member of  the global community.       We, the Sumitomo Chemical Group, will strive to help ad- dress pressing global challenges, such as the improvement  of the lives of people around the world, the issues of energy  and the environment, and the creation of a low carbon so- ciety, and contribute to the sustainable development of the  global community through our businesses. We would greatly  appreciate your continued support and cooperation. Hiromasa Yonekura Chairman of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. Hiroshi Hirose President of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.  4 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 1 Feature Malaria Takes the Life of One Child Every 30 Seconds      To many people, mosquito nets may sound like an  obsolete technology, but a great many people worldwide  are still in need of the protection they provide. Children in  Africa, in particular, are especially vulnerable to malaria,  an infectious disease transmitted by the Anopheles mos- quito.      Every year, over 300 million people around the world  develop malaria and more than one million people die  from the disease. People living in Africa account for 90  percent of these deaths, and most of the victims are  children under the age of \\ufb01 ve living in the Sub-Saharan  region. It is a sad fact that malaria takes the life of one  child every 30 seconds.      Those who survive malaria still suffer from a high fever  and must stay in bed for several days, which leads to in- creased poverty due to the loss of employment and edu- cational opportunities added to the high cost of medical  treatment. If the economic growth of a whole country is  hindered by the spread of malaria, funding for anti-malar- ia measures dries up and the country falls into a vicious  circle.

Malaria-Prone Regions Source: \\u201cWorld Malaria Report 2009\\u201d (WHO)  5 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 development in Africa, and the economic losses caused  by the disease are estimated at 12 billion dollars annu- ally.      Stopping the spread of malaria is therefore included  in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which are  targets with action plans to be urgently implemented  and achieved by 2015 based on the Millennium Declara- tion adopted by the United Nations in September 2000.  These targets are grouped into eight categories, includ- ing poverty, education, the environment, and human  rights. Malaria Control Initiatives  and the Olyset Net      The World Health Organization (WHO) has been im- plementing the Roll Back Malaria campaign since 1998.  Recognizing the added effectiveness of mosquito nets  when insecticides are applied, the WHO initially tried to  encourage people to apply insecticide to mosquito nets  themselves. This method, however, was not very effec- tive because most people failed to repeat the application  process regularly and the effect was lost through wash- ing and the passing of time.      The WHO\\u2019s attention was then drawn to the Olyset  Net developed by Sumitomo Chemical, which retains  its insecticidal ef\\ufb01 cacy for \\ufb01 ve years or longer even with  repeated washing. The fibers of this highly durable net  are made from polyethylene resin kneaded together with  an insecticide, which is then gradually released to the  surface of the netting \\ufb01 bers. Because it is designed to be  used in Africa, where it is very hot, the mesh is twice as  large as that of an ordinary mosquito net in order to im- prove air circulation. Sumitomo Chemical developed the  Olyset Net through Creative Hybrid Chemistry, combin- ing its proprietary technologies in the two separate \\ufb01 elds  of insecticides and resin processing.      In 2001, the WHO endorsed the use of the Olyset  Net, calling it the \\ufb01 rst \\u201clong-lasting insecticidal net.\\u201d With  results from a limited regional trial indicating an impres- sive decline in the local rate of malarial infection, the  distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets has become  one of the major means of controlling malaria. Creating Employment through  Local Production      In 2003, Sumitomo Chemical provided its Olyset Net  manufacturing technology free of licensing fees to A to Z  Textile Mills Limited, a Tanzanian manufacturer, with the  aim of kick-starting local production of the net in Africa  and building a framework for public-private partnerships  with international organizations such as the WHO and  United Nations Children\\u2019s Fund (UNICEF). Subsequently,  in order to respond to a rapid increase in demand, Sumi- tomo Chemical and A to Z Textile Mills established the  joint venture Vector Health International Limited in 2007.  As of July 2010, the local production capacity in Tan- zania totaled 29 million nets, and the number of people  employed by the company reached approximately 7,000.  The Olyset Net business is thus contributing to local  economic development.      In 2008, the WHO, promoting the policy of \\u201cuniversal  Photograph \\u24b8 M.

The meeting brought together a total of 430 people from Africa and  around the world representing international organizations, NGOs, and  the private sector. The meeting was co-chaired by President Kikwete  of Tanzania and Mr. Katsuya Okada, then Japan\\u2019s Minister of Foreign  Aff airs. Participants reviewed progress on the implementation of the  Yokohama Action Plan drafted at the Fourth Tokyo International Con- ference on African Development (TICAD IV) held in Yokohama in 2008  and discussed future challenges. Representing Japanese industry, Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s Chairman,  Hiromasa Yonekura, also attended the meeting and delivered a speech  in which he considered the roles to be fulfi lled by the private sector for  the growth and development of Africa, emphasized the importance of  public-private partnership, and shared examples of how the Olyset \\u24c7  Net has been used. During his stay in Tanzania, Mr. Okada visited the lo- cal Olyset\\u24c7  Net factory to see how the nets were sewn, inspected and  put through other processes. coverage,\\u201d enlarged its pool of candidates for malaria  control, which had previously been limited to pregnant  women and infants. Under this policy, the organization  aims to distribute one long-lasting insecticidal net per  two people in malaria-prone areas. It is estimated that  the ful\\ufb01 llment of this aim will require 250 million nets. To  meet the demand, Sumitomo Chemical has increased  the total Olyset Net production capacity of its produc- tion bases in the three countries of Tanzania, China and  Vietnam to 60 million nets per year. Educational Support for  the Leaders of Tomorrow      For Africa to achieve development, it is critical to pro- vide local people with education. African countries, how- ever, have a shortage of schools and a great number of  children have to study outdoors or in overcrowded class- rooms.      Sumitomo Chemical has been supporting education  in Africa by returning a portion of its revenues from the  Olyset Net business to local communities.

Through its Olyset Net business, Sumitomo Chemi- cal is working to prevent the spread of malaria and there- by reduce child mortality and improve maternal health.  Moreover, we are conducting a wide range of other ac- tivities to contribute to the achievement of the MDGs. For  example, local production of the Olyset Net contributes  to the elimination of poverty and providing educational  support using a portion of the revenues from the busi- ness contributes to achieving the goal of universal pri- mary education.      We will continue to make contributions to the sustain- able development in Africa through our business opera- tions.

It is said that without greenhouse gases such as car- bon dioxide (CO2) and methane in the Earth\\u2019s atmosphere,  the global average temperature would drop to 18\\u00baC below  zero. It is indeed thanks to atmospheric greenhouse gases  maintaining comfortable temperatures that plants and ani- mals, including humans, can live on Earth.      Minor changes in the concentrations of greenhouse  gases in the atmosphere, however, can exert an impact on  the surface temperature of Earth, and it is said that global  warming is caused by increases in greenhouse gases re- sulting from the increased use of oil and coal in industrial  activities.      Amid concerns about the grave consequences, such  as rising sea levels, desertification, and changes in the  ecosystem if global warming continues at its current pace,  international guidelines have been formulated for reducing  greenhouse gas emissions. The report of the Intergovern- mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is one prominent  example. The report asserts that CO2 emissions must be  reduced by 50-80% from 2000 levels by 2050 in order to  limit rises in average temperatures to 2.0\\u00ba-2.4\\u00baC above  temperatures prior to the Industrial Revolution. Chemical Products Contributing to Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions      As the problem of climate change escalates, it is cru- cial for industries to set more ambitious reduction targets  and devise and implement multifaceted measures. Ac- 2 Feature Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s  Next-Generation Technologies to  Meet the Challenge of Climate Change Sumitomo Chemical continues to leverage the power of chemistry to provide products that  contribute to bettering people\\u2019s lives. Our technological prowess has also enabled us to boast  a variety of achievements in the \\ufb01 elds of energy and the environment. Here, we present the past  achievements and future initiatives of Sumitomo Chemical, where we are promoting a broad  spectrum of activities with our sights set on the future of the global environment.  9 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 cordingly, the Japanese chemical industry has set a non- binding target to reduce the entire industry\\u2019s average unit  energy consumption for the period from 2008 to 2012 by  20% relative to the fiscal 1990 level. Sumitomo Chemi- cal has taken a further step in this direction by making  an Eco-First commitment to the Japanese Minister of the  Environment, in which we promised to reduce the energy  intensity* of all our plants by 25% relative to fiscal 1990  levels by \\ufb01 scal 2015, and we are currently working toward  ful\\ufb01 lling this commitment. We have already made signi\\ufb01 - cant progress, having achieved the world\\u2019s highest energy  ef\\ufb01 ciency at our petrochemical manufacturing plants, as  demonstrated by the results of many surveys conducted  by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other organi- zations.      Many chemical products used in a range of industrial  \\ufb01 elds are based mainly on naphtha, a byproduct of re\\ufb01 ned  crude oil, and the chemical industry is generally thought of  as a vast consumer of energy and resources. What is less  known, however, is that the industry provides a variety of  products that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For  example, light-weight resin products have contributed to  reduced vehicle weight, which has in turn led to higher  fuel effciency. In addition, resin-based insulating materials  have substantially improved housing insulation while pan- els for solar power generation systems were developed  through chemical technologies. Climate Change Initiatives from a Medium- to Long-Term Perspective      Sumitomo Chemical has been promoting activities to  reduce its environmental impact and has achieved steady  results based on the idea that the Company should pro- mote energy conservation in production processes while  manufacturing products based on innovative technologies  that contribute to energy conservation in various sectors  of society worldwide. We regard the problem of climate  change as one of our management\\u2019s top priorities, and  established the Energy & Climate Change Of\\ufb01 ce in Janu- ary 2010 in order to respond appropriately to the problem  from a medium- to long-term perspective.      In our Three-Year Corporate Business Plan started in  fiscal 2010, we have also positioned achievement of the  world\\u2019s highest energy ef\\ufb01 ciency and development of pro- cesses and products that help reduce CO2 emissions as  our important missions.      We have already been working for many years on the  development of next-generation products that contrib- ute to the reduction of CO2 emissions in numerous areas  of R&D and are accelerating the development of related  technologies for early commercialization. On the following  pages we will introduce some of these technologies. For example, the development of a more  environmentally friendly car requires: Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s major petrochemical manu- facturing plants have been proven to be among the  world\\u2019s most energy-efficient through surveys con- ducted by the IEA and other organizations. This photo  shows the ethylene plant (naphtha cracker) at the  Chiba Works. Several approaches can be taken to developing a more  environmentally friendly car, all of which require chemi- cal technologies. The chemical industry contributes to  the prevention of global warming by providing products  that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

PLEDs use poly- mer materials that emit light when an electric current is  applied, and consume little power and are environmentally  friendly. The production process itself is also more ener- gy-ef\\ufb01 cient because these products, which have a thinner  and simpler structure than that of LCDs, can be manufac- tured using printing technology. Furthermore, they do not  contain hazardous substances, making it possible also to  reduce energy consumption during their disposal.      For the development of its unique PLED technology,  Sumitomo Chemical has brought together a range of its  related proprietary technologies, including those for poly- mer materials, thin film formation, and the design and  synthesis of organic compounds. We are now making de- termined efforts toward the early commercialization of this  technology. Lithium Ion Secondary Battery and Fuel Cell Materials      Gasoline-powered vehicles are increasingly being  phased out and replaced with hybrid, electric, and fuel cell  vehicles. In response to this trend, Sumitomo Chemical  is developing the materials for lithium ion secondary bat- teries and fuel cells, which will be used mainly in automo- biles.      We have already commercialized our heat-resistant  separator for lithium ion secondary batteries, which has  won the praise of customers, and have begun studying  commercial production of our cathode material, following  the mass production of our heat-resistant separator, which  has won the praise of customers. The development of  electrolyte solutions has also started at one of our Group  companies. We are thus seeking to supply general materi- More Energy-Ef\\ufb01 cient TV and  Lighting Equipment Cobalt-Free Cathode Material Cathode materials are a major determinant of the performance  of lithium ion secondary batteries. Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s innova- tive cathode material is made without using cobalt, a rare metal  that is in short supply  worldwide. Moreover,  compared with conven- tional cathode materials  that contain cobalt, our  product has achieved a  higher output in batter- ies of the same capac- ity.

The  organic thin film photoelectric  conversion materials that Sumito- mo Chemical is now developing  have achieved some of the high- est energy conversion efficiency  in the industry, and we are now  engaged in R&D for the practical  use of these materials and related  technologies within several years. 2  11 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 als by promoting R&D.      In the area of fuel cells, we are developing a polymer  electrolyte membrane, which is one of the main compo- nents of fuel cells. We are developing a hydrocarbon poly- mer electrolyte membrane which is more enviromentally  friendly, and are now working to achieve higher perfor- mance. Plant Growth Regulators  (Stress-Resistance Inducing Compound)      High temperatures, dryness, and salinity levels are ex- amples of environmental stress, which hinders the growth  of green plants. Sumitomo Chemical is focusing efforts on  the development of plant growth regulators that increase  resistance to such environmental stress. These regulators  are expected to help prevent a decrease in crop yields  due to climate change.      In addition to developing technologies for reduction of  CO2 emissions, Sumitomo Chemical has been develop- ing next-generation technologies to deal with the impact  of climate change on agriculture, capitalizing on its R&D  strengths in the area of agrochemicals\\u2014strengths that the  Company has cultivated since its foundation.      Sumitomo Chemical is continually seeking to further  develop its current cutting-edge technologies in order to  remain a company that contributes to society and peo- ple\\u2019s quality of life as well as helping to address the issue  of climate change. Non-CO2-Emitting Vehicles Climate Change-Resistant Crops Crop Stress Management Crop stress management is designed to mitigate the effects of  environmental stress\\u2014such as global warming, desertification,  harmful insects, and diseases\\u2014on agricultural products, and  thereby increase agri- cultural yields. It is at- tracting attention as a  means to help redress  projected food short- ages resulting from an  increase in the global  population.

The chemical industry  has contributed to the development of various industries  and society through technological innovation.      At present, we are facing a variety of global problems,  especially with regard to energy, resources, and the envi- ronment, and the chemical industry is expected to play an  even greater role than ever in solving these problems.      Sumitomo Chemical, as a member of the chemical  industry, has de\\ufb01 ned its corporate mission as the achieve- ment of Sustainable Chemistry. To ful\\ufb01 ll this mission, we  are providing useful, high-quality and high-value-added  products to society while giving due consideration to en- ergy and resource conservation as well as to safety and  the environment. Creative Hybrid Chemistry     In order to practice Sustainable Chemistry, it is neces- sary to have scienti\\ufb01 cally proven technologies. Sumitomo  Chemical is pursuing Creative Hybrid Chemistry, which  links and combines technologies, know-how, and the  ideas and different perspectives of individuals both inside  and outside the company to create new value beyond ex- isting frameworks.      Sumitomo Chemical has been accumulating a variety  of \\u201cbase technologies\\u201d in organic synthesis, inorganic  synthesis, polymer synthesis, physical analysis, toxicolog- ical safety assessment, genomic development, process  development, materials and plant engineering technol- ogy, and others through extensive research activities over  many years. In addition, through the development of vari- ous products, we have expanded our \\u201ccore technologies,\\u201d  namely advanced polymer processing, functional dyes  and pigments, crystal structure control, calcinations, func- tional polymer design, biotechnology, chiral synthesis, and  catalysts.      Sumitomo Chemical combines these \\u201cbase technolo- gies\\u201d and \\u201ccore technologies\\u201d in diverse ways to develop  greater breadth and depth in its own unique technologies.  Furthermore, the Company promotes industry-govern- ment-university collaboration through joint projects with  the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development  Organization (NEDO), the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth  Science and Technology, the Japan Synchrotron Radiation  Research Institute, the University of Tokyo, and Tokyo In- stitute of Technology. This collaboration is driving the de- velopment of innovative new technologies and products.

We need to use energy and resources,  which are in limited supply, to manufacture  chemical products. In the production pro- cess, unneeded substances (byproducts)  or waste may also be generated. Sumitomo  Chemical is pursuing Green Processes,  which minimize the environmental impact of  manufacturing to the greatest extent pos- sible, and developing Clean Products, which  are safer, more environmentally friendly, and  of higher quality. The polylactic acid-based plastic developed by  Sumitomo Chemical is the world\\u2019s first eco-friendly  plastic to find applications in automobile parts. The  eco-friendly plastic, a polymer alloy of polypropyl- ene with 25% or more of plant-based polylactic  acid, has sufficient rigidity, impact resistance  strength, and heat resistance for use in automobile  interiors. By using this plastic, total life cycle CO2  emissions can be reduced by approximately 10%  compared with conventional polypropylene.  Caprolactam (Beckmann Rearrangement) Proces In the caprolactam (Beckmann rearrangement)  process, caprolactam can be manufactured without  producing the byproduct ammonium sulfate. This  process also allows for a significant reduction in the  amount of raw  materials used as  well as a short- ened manufac- turing process. In  addition, it uses  a safer catalyst. Proprietary Propylene Oxide-Only Process (PO-Only Process) In the propylene oxide-only process, propylene oxide can be  manufactured without byproducts by recycling cumene. Fur- thermore, this process helps conserve energy and resources by  the effective use of the heat  generated by reactions, and  produces less wastewater. In  addition, the facilities used  for the process are more  compact than those used  for conventional processes,  enabling high cost competi- tiveness.

Sumitomo Chemical supplies the materials indis- pensable for the manufacture of LEDs. These include high  purity alumina for the sapphire substrates of LED elements,  metalorganics for semiconductor thin film formation, and  aluminum hydroxide and alumina powder, which are used to  disperse the heat released from the light-emitting compo- nent. Sumi\\ufb01 x HF (Environmentally Friendly Reactive Dye) With its high level of affinity for fibers and good dyeing  reactivity, Sumifix HF enables us to achieve high fixa- tion rates with less inorganic salt and to significantly  reduce the impact of discharged wastewater on the  environment. In addition, on a molecular basis, the un- fixed dyes of Sumifix  HF are designed so  that their function is  reduced after dyeing,  shortening the washing  process and reducing  energy consumption. Super Engineering Plastics Super engineering plastics are plastics with considerably  higher thermostability than typical engineering plastics.  Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s super engineering plastics, Sumika  Super LCP and Sumika Excel PES, are used in various  fields\\u2014from electronics and electrical parts to automobiles  and aircraft. Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s super engineering plas- tics, free from flame retardants, have cleared top-level fire- retardant standards.  They have also been  evaluated as an excel- lent material in terms  of environmental pro- tection, because they  can also be used for  lead-free soldering. Pluto MC Pluto MC is an insecticide for use only in the control of mul- berry scale, a serious insect pest, on tea plants. With only  one winter application to the crop, this  product will provide effective long-term  control of mulberry scale. This allows  tea growers to reduce the frequency of  insecticide spraying and eliminates the  need for spraying during the busy sum- mer season. Furthermore, this product  has little adverse impact on natural  enemies of this pest, such as parasitic  wasps, making it also suitable for inte- grated pest management (IPM). Hydrochloric Acid Oxidation Process In the hydrochloric acid oxidation process, hy- drochloric acid generated as a byproduct in the  manufacture of chemical products is recycled  through conversion to chlorine using a catalyst and  oxygen. This process is considerably more energy- efficient than  conventional  processes.

CSR History from the Foundation of the Company      Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s business dates back to 1913,  when the Company sought to solve the problem of sulfur  dioxide emissions from smelting operations at the Besshi  Copper Mine in the Shikoku region of Japan. The Com- pany got its start producing sulfuric acid and calcium su- per phosphate fertilizers using the emitted sulfur dioxide.  This not only solved environmental problems by curbing  the emission of pollutants, but also helped increase crop  yields through the provision of useful fertilizers.      Since then, we have laid out and implemented policies  in the areas of safety, the environment, product quality,  risk management, and business conduct to ensure that  we ful\\ufb01 ll our responsibilities as a member of society. Basic CSR Policy      Sumitomo Chemical established its Basic CSR Policy  in November 2004 based on Sumitomo\\u2019s Business Prin- ciples and the Sumitomo Chemical Charter for Business  Conduct. Under the Policy, speci\\ufb01 c goals are set and CSR  activities are implemented to achieve them. Subsequently,  in January 2010, we established our CSR Department,  which is devoted to the further enhancement and develop- ment of our CSR initiatives. Basic CSR Policy      By continuously creating and providing useful new  technologies and products that have never before existed,  Sumitomo Chemical will increase corporate value while  contributing to both the solution of problems facing our  environment and society, and the betterment of people\\u2019s  lives.      In order to achieve this, the Company will work to  achieve a balance between profitable business opera- tions, safety, preservation of the environment, and  product quality as well as social action. In addition, we  will actively pursue and promote our CSR activities with  consideration for the interests of all our stakeholders, in- cluding our shareholders, employees, business partners,  and the local residents of all regions in which we conduct  business. Th rough our endeavors in these areas, we hope  to play a signifi cant role in building a sustainable society,  while continuing to grow to realize our goal of becoming  a truly global chemical company in the 21st century.

The CSR Promotion Coordinating Board, consisting  of members from each Business Sector, Works, and other  sites, communicates and coordinates CSR-related activities  and compiles company-wide CSR implementation plans.  The CSR Department serves as the Board\\u2019s secretariat.      In March 2010, the CSR Promotion Coordinating Board  convened and determined priority tasks for initiatives in  \\ufb01 scal 2010 based on the Basic CSR Policy. Each Business  Sector, Research Laboratory, and Works, and other sites  set specific targets in line with the priority tasks, and are  implementing their CSR activities accordingly.      These activities are described in this CSR Report. Promoting Compliance      The Sumitomo Chemical Group promotes compliance- oriented management with the firm belief that ensuring  legal and ethical compliance is the linchpin of corporate  management and that we must neither violate the rules  nor ethics of society as we carry out business activities all  CSR Promotion Coordinating Board CSR Department  (Secretariat) CSR Promotion Coordinating Board Organization Compliance Committee Organization over the world. In order to sustain and enhance society\\u2019s  trust and con\\ufb01 dence in our compliance-oriented manage- ment, we have established common guidelines for business  conduct to be followed by all companies of the Group. Em- ployees, of\\ufb01 cers and Board members of the companies are  required to fully familiarize themselves with the guidelines.  We regularly review the guidelines and update them when  necessary.      Fully determined to achieve compliance-oriented man- agement from an impartial and objective perspective, we  have a dedicated organization, the Compliance Committee,  which operates independently from our business units. The  Secretariat Office of the Committee, composed of mem- bers from various corporate departments of the Company  (as shown in the chart below), supports the Committee in  performing its activities.      As part of our day-to-day efforts on promoting compli- ance, we appoint departmental managers and those in  higher positions as Compliance Supervisors, persons in  charge of ensuring compliance in respective workplaces to  prevent unlawful or unethical conduct or improve conduct  in our daily operations from a compliance viewpoint. In ad- dition, various internal systems are available to reinforce  the compliance-related activities of each workplace, such  as compliance auditing by a specialized department, the  Speak-Up System (by which employees can inform the  Compliance Committee or designated external lawyers of  incidents violating compliance) and compliance educa- tional and training programs.

Due to the decreasing birth rate, which is becoming a  signi\\ufb01 cant social concern in this day and age, it is more im- portant than ever that companies provide employees with  working conditions that allow them to continue working  while raising their children. Therefore, in addition to such  systems as childcare leave and shortened working hours,  Sumitomo Chemical is also promoting the establishment of  in-house childcare facilities to assist employees with chil- dren.      In October 2009, we opened an in-house childcare  facility called Sumika Kids Chiba on the premises of the  Company-owned employee housing located near the Pet- rochemicals Research Laboratory at the Chiba Works. Su- mika Kids Chiba takes care of infants less than a year old  (whose mothers have \\ufb01 nished postpartum childcare leave)  to preschool-aged children of Sumitomo Chemical Group  employees during working hours, with extended care till  eight o\\u2019clock at night. The facility has a grassy area and  a vegetable \\ufb01 eld where children can learn about growing  vegetables, ensuring the well-rounded development of the  children.      Sumika Kids Chiba is the third in-house child- care facility, following the establishment of Sumika  Kids Ehime in Ehime and Izumi Kids in Osaka in  April 2008. As of April 1, 2010, 37, 14, and 19 chil- dren are regularly taken care of at the Ehime, Osa- ka, and Chiba facilities respectively. The facility in  Osaka also accepts children of local residents not  employed by the Group.      In August 2010, the Company opened its fourth  childcare facility, Sumika Kids Tokyo, on the first  \\ufb02 oor of its Tokyo head of\\ufb01 ce.      Sumitomo Chemical will work to make further  improvements to the workplace environment to en- able employees to work with even more peace of  mind. Opening Sumika Kids Chiba,  an In-house Childcare Facility Sumika Kids Chiba Growing vegetables at Sumika Kids Chiba Sumika Kids Tokyo opened in August 2010  23 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010      To help prevent global warming and conserve biodiver- sity, Sumitomo Chemical has been conducting a mangrove  planting project in cooperation with OISCA in Thailand\\u2019s Ra- nong Province since \\ufb01 scal 2008.      Many mangrove trees were felled in Thailand to provide  land for shrimp cultivation and charcoal production, and as a  result the forest area has decreased substantially. Mangrove  trees are said to be especially effective in the prevention of  global warming because they have a high capacity to take in  and \\ufb01 x CO2. These trees also help mitigate tsunami damage  and conserve biodiversity. Their disappearance would have  a serious negative impact on the lives of local people.      The project\\u2019s aim is to plant mangrove trees in order to  recover a rich forest that was devastated by destructive  felling. It is being fostered through cooperation between  the Thai government, local residents, OISCA, and Sumi- tomo Chemical. Sumitomo Chemical provides funding for  the project in the form of donations made by directors and  employees of the Sumitomo Chemical Group, matching the  amounts under the Matching Gift program, which is promot- ed in cooperation with the Company\\u2019s labor union (p. 44).      The area for which the Company is providing support as  of March 2010 consists of about 125,000 mangrove trees  over 50 hectares and is managed as \\u201cSumitomo Chemical\\u2019s  forest.\\u201d In February 2009, Sumitomo Chemical employees  visited the area and worked as volunteer tree-planters and  in February 2010, the Company sent a delegation to inspect  the growth of the trees in the forest. Support to the Victims of the  Major Earthquake in Haiti  Donating Olyset Nets       To support the victims of the major earthquake that  struck the Republic of Haiti on January 12, 2010, Sumitomo  Chemical donated Olyset Net insecticidal mosquito nets  via a US NGO and the UN Secretariat.      Approximately 3.7 million people fell victim to the earth- quake, and at least 1  million of those have  lost their houses and  been forced to live  as refugees in tents.      As the Republic  of Haiti is in a ma- laria-prone region,  Sumitomo Chemical  donated 5,000 Olyset Nets to local victims through a US  NGO called \\u201cPopulation Services International\\u201d (PSI) as well  as to UN peacekeeping staff engaged in support activities  in Haiti. PSI distributed the mosquito nets to refugee camps  across the country in cooperation with local volunteer orga- nizations. Initiative by a Group Company Sumika Electronic Materials (Shanghai) and  Sumika Electronic Materials Trading (Shanghai) Giving Support to Local Schools      Two Group companies in Shanghai have been donating  funds to schools in nearby poor districts in cooperation with  their labor unions. The donations are made by both employ- ees and the companies themselves.      In fiscal 2009, they provided support to an elementary  school in Huoqiu County, Anhui Province, helping the school  refurbish its classrooms and open a library as well as donat- ing furnishings, supplies, and books to the school. At the do- nation ceremony held on October 30, 2009, representatives  from the companies made friends with the students, who  expressed their excitement about the new classrooms and  donated items.  \\u201cSumitomo Chemical\\u2019s Forest\\u201d in Ranong  Province, Thailand Planting trees with local residents  (delegation sent in February 2010)  24 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 CSR Highlights 2009  (Responsible Care Activities) Submitting a Follow-up Report for  the Eco-First Program      Sumitomo Chemical became the \\ufb01 rst diversi\\ufb01 ed chemi- cal company to be certi\\ufb01 ed as an Eco-First company by the  Japanese Ministry of the Environment in November 2008. In  February 2010, we submitted a follow-up report to the Min- ister on the progress in implementing the initiatives we had  committed to and the results.      The Eco-First program was launched by the Ministry of  the Environment in April 2008 with a view to encouraging  leading companies in each industry to undertake more en- vironmental activities. Under the program, companies make  Eco-First commitments to the Minister of the Environment.  Speci\\ufb01 cally, they promise to implement advanced measures  for global environmental protection, including measures for  the management of chemical substances and the preven- tion of global warming.      Sumitomo Chemical reported to the Minister that it was  making \\u201cvery favorable\\u201d progress on seven out of the 11  items, including \\u201cReviewing safety information for chemicals  and conducting risk assessments\\u201d and \\u201cVoluntarily inspect- ing the safety of HPV chemicals and conducting LRI activi- ties to study the impact of chemicals on human health and  the environment\\u201d      As a leading company in the chemical industry and a  member of the global community, Sumitomo Chemical will  continue to ful\\ufb01 ll its Eco-First commitments for a better fu- ture and the sustainable development of society.

Since  then, led by this country, the United States, and Europe,  the group has been holding regular discussions on what  measures the chemical industry should take to contribute to  solving the problem of global climate change. Mr. Yonekura  and Mr. Kawachi, Chairman and Senior Advisor respectively  of Sumitomo Chemical, served as the \\ufb01 rst leader and chair- man of this group, and the group has been achieving excel- lent results with the Japan Chemical Industry Association  (JCIA), including Sumitomo Chemical, playing a leading role.      Speci\\ufb01 cally, the group focuses its activities on (1) policy,  (2) establishing a common energy ef\\ufb01 ciency evaluation indi- cator based on benchmarking, (3) quantifying contributions  made to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by the  chemical industry through carbon life cycle analysis (cLCA),  and (4) public relations.      With regard to cLCA initiatives, the group published a  report titled \\u201cInnovations for Greenhouse Gas Reductions\\u201d  to predict the in\\ufb02 uence of the chemical industry over global  greenhouse gas emission reductions, and the ICCA pre- sented the report worldwide in Japan, the United States,  and the EU in July 2009. This report shows quantitatively  and objectively that, though the global chemical industry  emits vast amounts of greenhouse gases from its produc- tion activities, it has made great contributions to reducing  global greenhouse gas emissions through the use of insula- tors, solar power generation materials, and other products it  provides.      The chemical industry will utilize these findings and  analysis data effectively for the good of nations, industries,  and people\\u2019s daily lives and make even greater contributions  to more ef\\ufb01 cient and effective measures to combat global  warming.

Three-Year Corporate Business Plan for  Fiscal 2010 to 2012      Sumitomo Chemical is currently implementing its Three-      Year Corporate Business Plan for \\ufb01 scal 2010 to 2012.      In formulating this new Corporate Business Plan, the  Company first conceived its Corporate Vision based  on analysis of the long-range prospects for the global  economy and business environment in conjunction with  its portfolio of businesses. The new Corporate Business  Plan is positioned as the first step toward achieving the  Company\\u2019s Corporate Vision, and under this new plan the  Company is striving to achieve seven goals, including the  prompt improvements in pro\\ufb01 t and cash \\ufb02 ow from the ma- jor investments made under the previous Corporate Busi- ness Plan and enhancement of its \\ufb01 nancial strength.      In fiscal 2012, the final year of the plan, we aim to  achieve sales of 2,400 billion yen, operating income of 190  billion yen, ordinary income of 220 billion yen, and net in- come of 140 billion yen.

The Sumitomo Chemical Group  handles a variety of agricultural products, including pes- ticides, fertilizers, irrigation tubes, and polyolefins for  agricultural use, and Sumika Farm Nagano and Sumika  Farm Oita are producing high-quality crops using these  products. Sumitomo Chemical is committed to its \\u201ctotal  solution provider\\u201d business, which comprehensively sup- ports the ef\\ufb01 cient production of safer, healthier agricultural  products. The Company will accumulate cultivation tech- nologies, agricultural management know-how, and various  other skills gained through establishing and managing ag- ricultural corporations, and will spread these technologies  throughout the country in cooperation with agricultural  producers, cooperatives, and local governments to help  revitalize local agriculture. Starting Sales of the  SUMILOOK Edge-Light Type LED Light      Sumitomo Chemical has developed an edge-light type  LED light, and started sales of this product, called \\u201cSUM- ILOOK,\\u201d through Sumika Acryl in February 2010.      SUMILOOK has special features, including (1) being gen- tle to the eyes because it has small variations in brightness  and is not dazzling; (2) being very thin (15 mm or thinner),  and (3) reducing power consumption and CO2 emissions  by approximately 20%, thus reducing operating costs while  achieving the same brightness as conventional \\ufb02 uorescent  lights.      SUMILOOK is expected to be used in mainstream light- ing equipment, and we plan to promote sales of this highly  efficient light  first to schools  and of\\ufb01 ces and  then further ex- pand our sales  targets. Developing an Aluminum  Titanate DPF      Sumitomo Chemical has developed an aluminum  titanate diesel particulate filter (DPF) that can be at- tached to the muf\\ufb02 er of a diesel-powered vehicle. The  aluminum titanate DPF outperforms conventional sili- con carbide (SiC)-based DPFs in several parameters,  including the amount of soot it can continuously \\ufb01 lter.      In Europe, the use of diesel-powered vehicles is be- ing promoted for higher fuel economy and lower CO2  emissions, and in the future DPFs will be attached to  diesel-powered vehicles as standard equipment to  comply with exhaust gas regulations.      Sumitomo Chemical will begin providing samples of  its aluminum titanate DPF to automobile manufactur- ers in 2010 for practical evaluation on actual vehicles,  and once these evaluations have been completed, is  targeting  full-scale  commercial produc- tion by 2015, when  use of DPFs in diesel- powered vehicles are  expected to come  into widespread use  in Europe.

We will continue to implement measures to expedite  important decision-making, more clearly define respon- sibilities in the execution of our business, enhance and  strengthen the compliance system and internal control,  and promote the timely disclosure of information. Management Structure      Sumitomo Chemical has a board of corporate audi- tors and has also introduced an executive of\\ufb01 cer system  to expedite important decision making and more clearly  define responsibilities in the execution of our business.  The company\\u2019s management structure currently consists  of 10 directors and 32 executive of\\ufb01 cers (including those  who serve in a dual capacity as directors). The Board of  Directors ensures that important management decisions  are appropriately made in accordance with laws and regu- lations, the Articles of Incorporation and the regulations  concerning the Board, and also monitors and supervises  the performance of the directors. The executive officers  are responsible for ensuring that business operations are  carried out in accordance with the Board\\u2019s strategic man- agement planning.      There are \\ufb01 ve corporate auditors, three of whom are  from outside the Company (as of July 2010). Internal Control      We consider the continuous development and en- hancement of our internal control system as a neces- sary process in maintaining a sound organization, and  and believe this system should be actively utilized for the  achievement of  business objectives.      We have established the Internal Control Committee,  in accordance with the Basic Policy for Enhancement of  Internal Control formulated in 2006, for the purpose of  building an internal control system to conduct appropriate  business operations throughout the Sumitomo Chemi- cal Group, and to inspect and maintain the system in  response to changing circumstances. This committee is  administered by the Internal Control & Audit Department,  which proposes and promotes various measures for im- proving the internal control system and monitors their  implementation. Internal Auditing      The Internal Control & Audit Department also conducts  internal auditing for the following in the execution of busi- ness duties by executives and employees of the Sumi- tomo Chemical Group: (1) effective and efficient opera- tions; (2) reliability of \\ufb01 nancial reporting; (3) enhancement,  operation, and appropriate functioning of internal control  concerning compliance with relavant laws and statutes in  all business activities; and (4) proper and appropriate ex- ecution of business duties.      In addition, the Internal Audit Committee has been  established to improve the effectiveness and efficiency  of internal audits throughout Sumitomo Chemical and all  Group companies. Information Disclosure System      Sumitomo Chemical is committed to providing its vari- ous stakeholders, including shareholders, business part- ners, and local communities, with information in a prompt,  accurate, and fair manner. Our Corporate Communica- tions Department, established exclusively to engage in  investor relations (IR) and public relations (PR) activities,  promotes timely and appropriate information disclosure  and dialogue with society.

Guidelines for Business Conduct Common to the Entire Group      Each of the Sumitomo Chemical Group companies  in Japan adopts a Business Conduct Manual (written in  Japanese), while those overseas have a Code of Ethics or  documents of the same nature (in English or other local lan- guages). These documents serve as shared guidelines for  business conduct with which all employees, officers and  Board members of the Group companies operating both in  Japan and overseas must fully familiarize themselves with  these guidelines so that we may gain the greater trust and  stronger con\\ufb01 dence of society in the compliance-oriented  management of the Group as a whole and of its individual  companies alike.      We regularly review and update the Business Conduct  Manual and the Code of Ethics to re\\ufb02 ect the latest changes  in relevant laws and regulations as well as continuing de- velopments in the socioeconomic environment and speci\\ufb01 c  business operations of each Group company. In particular,  the Code of Ethics in place at overseas Group companies  is revised and updated in a timely manner with close sup- port from local external specialists such as lawyers, in light  of the vital importance to keep abreast of various changes  evolving in what society requires of business corporations,  including changes in local legal systems. Operation of the Compliance System  by an Independent Organization      Sumitomo Chemical has a Compliance Committee  chaired by one of the executive vice presidents, which is  an organization set up independently of business operating  units, aiming to promote compliance-oriented management  from an impartial and objective perspective. The Compli- ance Committee investigates and supervises the activities  of Sumitomo Chemical and its Group companies for their  proper legal and ethical compliance and advises on im- provement as necessary. The Committee also plans and  provides compliance education programs to help enhance  compliance-oriented management of the Sumitomo Chemi- cal Group. In order to support the Committee in fulfilling  these functions, a Secretariat Office for the Committee,  composed of members from various corporate depart- ments, actually engage in day-to-day compliance activities.      Likewise, the Group companies adopt their own compli- ance systems equivalent to that of Sumitomo Chemical to  ensure their compliance-oriented management. As of April  2010, 80% of the Group companies have completed intro- ducing the systems, and Sumitomo Chemical is continuing  the same efforts  not only on the  remaining Group  companies, but  also as companies  are incorporated or  acquired anew. Sumitomo Chemical is undertaking a variety of concrete initia- tives to assist its Group companies in enhancing their compli- ance systems. As part of these eff orts, the Company provides  Group companies, both domestic and overseas, with specifi c  common criteria for establishing a compliance system, based  on which each of the companies reassess their current compli- ance system and, if necessary, improve the system. Sumitomo  Chemical is thus working closely with each of its Group com- panies in Japan and overseas, not only to establish their re- spective compliance system, but also optimize its operation. Initiative for Enhancing Operation of  Compliance Systems in Group Companies      In addition, we endeavor to build stronger relationships  of trust with society and capital markets by publishing  documentation in accordance with the rules stipulated by  the securities exchanges in Japan, including a corporate  governance report that details the Company\\u2019s corporate  governance philosophy and system, and noti\\ufb01 cation of in- dependent directors and auditors that eliminates con\\ufb02 icts  of interest between our general shareholders and outside  directors and auditors. These documents are viewable on  the websites of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Osaka Se- curities Exchange where Sumitomo Chemical is listed. Corporate Governance/Compliance  Meeting of the Compliance Committee (April 2010)  30 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 TOPIC We conducted our second survey on employee compliance  awareness in January 2010, utilizing it as on opportunity to  raise awareness of compliance among employees and with  the aim of looking into any potential compliance risks (risk  factors and unidentifi ed problems) at workplaces. The sur- vey targeted 1,000 employees who had been chosen ran- domly, and we received 775 valid responses. According to  the results, employees are highly aware of the inportance of  compliance, but with regard to compliance risk managment  eff orts within each workplace, there may be still room for  inprovement. We will utilize the results in our future educa  tional activities and, more broadly, to enhance our risk man- agement. Second Survey on Employee Compliance Awareness Foundation of CSR-based Management Daily Efforts in the Workplace to Prevent or Correct  Illegal or Unethical Conduct      Sumitomo Chemical considers it fundamental to its  compliance-oriented management to have in place and  maintain mechanisms for effectively preventing or promptly  correcting any illegal or unethical conduct in the day-to-day  business operation. Accordingly, all those employees hold- ing the position of department managers or higher posts  are appointed to serve as Compliance Supervisors for their  individual workplaces. The Compliance Supervisors have  the clear responsibility to make sure that legal and ethical  compliance is always maintained in their workplaces, to  prevent and take corrective action in the event of any ille- gal or unethical conduct having taken place, and to report  such conduct to the Compliance Committee without fail.  If employees uncover illegal or unethical conduct inside or  outside their workplaces, they are required to promptly re- port such conduct through their superiors to a Compliance  Supervisor and the relevant departments.      Along with these efforts, at Sumitomo Chemical, the Re- sponsible Care Committee, the Antitrust Law Compliance  Committee, the Internal Audit Reporting Meeting and other  committees are conducting a host of activities on a daily  basis to ensure compliance in their respective \\ufb01 elds of re- sponsibility. Reinforcing Workplace Initiatives      To support the workplace initiatives mentioned above,  we are working actively in the following manner, expecting  that those activities will restrain illegal or unethical conduct  and at the same time will bring their self-cleansing effects  into play effectively against such conduct. Compliance Auditing System      The Internal Control & Audit Department at Sumitomo  Chemical specializes in internal audits and monitors the  Company\\u2019s compliance activities from a third-party per- spective. Speci\\ufb01 cally, it veri\\ufb01 es that initiatives toward com- pliance undertaken by Sumitomo Chemical and its Group  companies in Japan and abroad are appropriate and identi- \\ufb01 es items requiring improvement, thereby further heighten- ing the level of compliance by the entire Group. Speak-Up System (Direct reporting to the Compliance Committee)      Virtually all Sumitomo Chemical Group companies have  adopted their Speak-Up Systems. Under the system, an  employee*1 who has found any illegal or unethical conduct  and believes it cannot be resolved promptly via the ordinary  business reporting route may report such conduct directly  to the Compliance Committee. The Committee Secretariat  Office, or alternatively, designated external lawyers serve  as contacts for this reporting system, and employees may  choose to whom they report the case*2. All information  provided in the reporting is kept strictly confidential, and  the informant incurs no risk of unfair treatment, such as  dismissal, transfer, or discrimination, for reporting such  conduct. The Speak-Up System has been in operation for  several years now, and cases actually reported under the  system at Sumitomo Chemical and domestic or overseas  Group companies have been handled promptly and in good  faith in accordance with the purpose, objectives, and speci- \\ufb01 ed procedures of the system. We will continue our steady  efforts to maintain and improve this reporting system. Other Initiatives for Promoting Day-to-Day Compliance      In addition to the compliance activities conducted in the  course of daily operations as mentioned above, Sumitomo  Chemical and its Group companies provide a variety of  educational and training programs periodically to raise the  level of compliance awareness among employees, of\\ufb01 cers  and others, and deepen their understanding of specific  compliance-related issues. In \\ufb01 scal year of 2009, following  the enforcement of the  revised Antimonopoly  Act in Japan in January  2010, a total of 20 train- ing seminars on the Act  were held for approxi- mately 1,000 employ- ees, of\\ufb01 cers and others  at Sumitomo Chemical  *1. In the event of any violation of compliance by Sumitomo Chemical personnel,  this system is available also to those people who are involved in any manner in  the activities of the Company, such as the families of the Company\\u2019s employees,  officers and Board members as well as the Company\\u2019s affiliates and business  partners. *2.While some of the Group companies currently employ no external lawyers to  serve as the contact for the reporting, they are supposed to retain one as far as  possible in the future. Compliance seminar  31 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 Compliance/UN Global Compact The Global Compact\\u2019s Ten Principles     In January 2005, Sumitomo Chemical became the \\ufb01 rst  Japanese chemical company to announce its participation  in the UN Global Compact* advocated by then UN Secre- tary-General Ko\\ufb01  Annan. Since then, we have been further  promoting our CSR activities in compliance with the ten  principles of the Global Compact, while networking with  the United Nations and other institutions and reporting on  the status of our efforts in our CSR Report. Contributing to Society through Our Business      Sumitomo Chemical is committed to contributing to the  sustainable development of society as the core of its CSR  and believes it crucial to comply with international norms  and cooperate with international organizations, NGOs,  and other companies in meeting the challenges faced by  society. The Global Compact initiative is fully consistent  with the Company\\u2019s conceptions.      Sumitomo Chemical conducts all its business activi- ties with due consideration for the principles of the Global  Compact regarding human rights, labor, the environment,  and anti-corruption. Initiative Taken by the Global Compact Working Group on the 10th Principle (Anti-Corruption)      In December 2008, Sumitomo Chemical became the  \\ufb01 rst Japanese company to participate in the Global Com- pact Working Group on the 10th Principle (Anti-Corruption).  This working group, which comprises companies, NGOs,  and others with divergent interests, discusses compa- nies\\u2019 needs and their efforts in combatting corruption.  As a member of the task force on supply chains, whose  duty was to prepare a Guide for Customers and Suppli- ers, Sumitomo Chemical prepared parts of the draft. This  guide was completed and announced at the general as- sembly of the Working Group on the 10th Principle held on  June 23, 2010.      As a member of the global community, Sumitomo  Chemical will continue to address the global challenge of  UN Global Compact anti-corruption in cooperation with other organizations. and its Group companies in Japan. Furthermore, we active- ly and continually hold various kinds of seminars, including  those on the basics of compliance as geared to the partici- pants\\u2019 job grades, years of employment or other conditions,  and those handling individual compliance issues, as well as  utilizing external educational resources such as participa- tion in lectures or inviting lecturers from outside the Com- pany.      We are also developing ways and means of sharing in- formation about periodic changes in laws and regulations in  Japan with domestic Group companies for use in their day- to-day operations. For example, we operate an electronic  system by which information on the revision of laws and  other developments related to compliance issues are dis- seminated to the companies automatically via the Internet. *UN Global Compact  The UN Global Compact is a United Nations initiative in which businesses  demonstrate responsible and creative leadership and voluntarily participate in  efforts to establish a worldwide framework that enables them to act as good  corporate citizens and achieve sustainable growth. Businesses should support  and respect the protection of internationally  proclaimed human rights; and make sure that they are not complicit in hu- man rights abuses. Businesses should uphold the freedom of as- sociation and the effective recognition of the  right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced and  compulsory labour; the effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in respect  of employment and occupation. Businesses should support a precautionary  approach to environmental challenges; undertake initiatives to promote greater en- vironmental responsibility; and encourage the development and diffusion of  environmentally friendly technologies. Businesses should work against corruption  in all its forms, including extortion and brib- ery.

Promotion of Social Action Unique to  Sumitomo Chemical      Sumitomo Chemical undertakes its social contribution  activities with a focus on covering three different areas:  coexistence with local communities, sustainable future- oriented support for society, and responsible business as  a global company.      Sumitomo Chemical has been promoting efforts at  its Head Office and other worksites as well as at Group  companies to (1) ensure safety and health, and protect  the environment; (2) raise children who will lead the next  generation; and (3) assist in natural disaster relief. Contri- butions are categorized into the following three areas: (1)  Community Contribution supporting the communities in  the vicinity of its worksites; (2) Future Contribution building  a world for the next generation; and (3) Global Contribu- tion providing assistance to the international community.  For the Future of Local Communities and Children      Sumitomo Chemical conducts a variety of localized  activities at its worksites for information disclosure and  communication with local residents on a daily basis, and  education of children who will be the next generation of  leaders. We are endeavoring to help local residents deep- en their understanding of our activities and to build and  maintain good relations with them. Tours of Manufacturing and Research Facilities      Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s Works and Research Laborato- ries organize tours of their facilities as a way of educating  local children, who will lead the next generation and of  disclosing information to local residents and governments. Community Beauti\\ufb01 cation Activities      Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s worksites are also conducting  cleanup and beauti\\ufb01 cation activities around their premises  and actively participating in community cleanup events. VOICE Social Activities Plant tour  (Osaka Works) Community beauti\\ufb01 cation activities (Tokyo head o\\ufb03  ce) As a member of society, Sumitomo Chemical endeavors to build better relations with local residents and  employees, believing that its business must be based on mutual prosperity with society.  The head offi  ce in Tokyo has been engaged in local cleanup  activities in cooperation with neighboring companies since  May 2009, advocating the Clean Day campaign promoted by  Chuo City, Tokyo. Once every two months during lunch time,  employees volunteer to clean up the area surrounding the  Sumitomo Twin Building, where our Head Office is located.  Although we walk on these streets every day, unless we take  the trouble to look, we don\\u2019t notice the various types of trash  or the surprising amount of litter people casually toss away.  We intend to continue this activity as  a way of showing our gratitude to the  local community. Showing Gratitude to Local Communities Hiroyuki Yada CSR Department  33 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 Hand in Hand with Local Communities and Society Participating in and Supporting Community Events      As part of their local communication activities, Sumi- tomo Chemical\\u2019s worksites participate in local events and  support them by providing public access to their premis- es. For example, the Oita Works participated in the Honba  Tsurusaki Dance Festival, employees at the Osaka Works  volunteered to support the table tennis championship  for the disabled, and the Misawa Works provided special  support for the Misawa International Wheelchair Tennis  Tournament.  Accepting Student Interns      The internship program is intended to provide students  with an opportunity for work experience related to their  chosen subject area or future career and to nurture their  own view of occupation and work. Every year, we accept  local senior high school and junior technical college stu- dents as interns at  our worksites, where  they are deepening  their understanding  of what it means to  work and the kind of  work people do in a  chemical company. Giving Special Lessons at Elementary and  Junior High Schools      Sumitomo Chemical sends instructors to elementary  and junior high schools for School Science Visits and to  give classes on environmental issues to stimulate chil- dren\\u2019s interest in science and contribute to science educa- tion. Every year the instructors prepare creative programs  to show children how fascinating science is, and they al- ways have fun interacting with the children.      In addition, the Chiba Works continues to promote the  Ichihara-Sodegaura Young Inventors\\u2019 Club, which receives  the enthusiastic support of employees, retirees, school  teachers, and local residents.  Promoting Sports      We also sponsor or support various sporting events to  provide local children with opportunities to develop men- tally and physically through sport.

The following shows some  representative examples of these activities in various re- gions. Controlling Red Imported Fire Ants in Australia      Sumitomo Chemical Australia is supporting the control  of red imported \\ufb01 re ants in Australia by providing specially  developed ant baits containing insect growth regulators,  which are not directly toxic to ants and other fauna but  target reproduction and growth in the ant colony.      Red imported fire ants are native to South America. They have an irritating and painful sting, which sometimes  causes serious allergic symptoms or anaphylactic shock. The habitat of the red imported \\ufb01 re ant has been expand- ing.      They have spread to many parts of  the world including Australia, where  they were \\ufb01 rst detected in 2001. Fire  ants and other invasive ant species  in Australia and nearby Pacific na- tions are a serious threat to both hu- man health and local ecosystems.      In response, the Australian government began devel- oping a program to prevent damage caused by the \\ufb01 re ant  and other non-native ants. Sumitomo Chemical Australia  is helping the government develop this program by pro- viding ant baits as well as its knowledge and expertise.  Distance Ant Bait, containing Pyriproxyfen developed by  Sumitomo Chemical, is one of the major tools used by the  Australian Government to combat \\ufb01 re ants and other inva- sive ant species. Sumitomo Chemical Australia has also  donated ant bait to villages in Papua New Guinea to help  combat the effects of another species of \\ufb01 re ant, the Little  Fire Ant.         Sumitomo Chemical Australia will continue to cooper- ate with relevant organizations to eliminate non-native in- vasive ants, including the red imported \\ufb01 re ant.

Garlic mustard, a biennial plant of the mustard  family, is a non-native plant that was introduced into  North America as a culinary herb in the 1860s. The  plant is fertile and kills bacteria around it by emit- ting chemical substances, thereby preventing other  plants from growing. At Wright Woods, garlic mus- tard is expanding its range at the expense of other  native woodland plants.     Armed with gloves and plastic bags, 12 VBC  employees volunteered to remove the bothersome  weed.     It was the first experience of this kind for VBC,  which will continue to help maintain and restore the  natural harmony and biodiversity of Wright Woods.

Bara Chemical Co., Ltd., a Group  company in Thailand, conducts unique environmental ac- tivities that include seaside cleanups and tree planting.      In July 2009, the company conducted a cleanup activity  at the beach of Rayong, 200 km south of Bangkok, during  a company trip there, with the participation of 108 employ- ees. In addition, a total of 15 employees also planted 50  mangrove trees on the coast south of Bangkok near Bara  Chemical.     The company believes that these activities not only  contribute to society but also raise employees\\u2019 awareness  of the environment,  and it will continue to  conduct these volun- teer activities.  Donating to Society      Sumitomo Chemical regards donating as an integral  part of its corporate social responsibility and makes dona- tions taking into consideration all factors including social  impact, long-term continuity, and urgency. Specifically,  the company matches the donations made by employees  and donates the total amount under the Matching Gift pro- gram, and employees can also donate through the TABLE  FOR TWO meals available in the Company cafeteria. We  are also continuing to donate the Olyset Net to help pre- vent malaria. In \\ufb01 scal 2009, we made 349 donations total- ing 237.47 million yen. Promoting Closer Ties of Friendship Providing scholarships for Chinese students      Since \\ufb01 scal 2006, Sumitomo Chemical has been pro- viding scholarships for students at Dalian University of  Technology, which is located in Dalian, Liaoning Province,  a city with which the Company has close relations through  the manufacture of its Olyset Net and local business op- erations by its af\\ufb01 liates.

To this end, we  give \\ufb01 rst priority to increased information disclosure and  the promotion of dialogue.      We are also making efforts to improve the landscape  and environment at our worksites in response to com- ments we have received. Company-Wide Promotion of Risk Communication  Activities     Sumitomo Chemical actively works to improve risk  communication by developing company-wide policies on  risk communication and further clarifying challenges and  initiatives. Localized Information Disclosure by the Works    CSR reports and other materials are issued annually by  the Company and all its Works. Works versions are called  \\u201cReport on the Environment, Health and Safety,\\u201d and  complement the Company\\u2019s CSR Report with regard to  local efforts. In addition, three Works (Ehime, Osaka and  Oita) publish local newsletters for the distribution of area- speci\\ufb01 c information. Engaging in a Variety of Risk Communication Activities     Each Works engages in a variety of risk communication  activities for various purposes. These include risk com- munication model projects carried out jointly with local  governments, environment and safety support projects  for domestic and overseas governments and businesses,  regular meetings with local residents, and dialogues with  the community based on cooperation with the chemical  industry.  In February 2010, the 7th Oita Region Responsible Care (RC)  Regional Dialogue was held on issues regarding environ- mental protection, industrial safety and disaster prevention  by the local members of the Japan Responsible Care Coun- cil (JRCC), including Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s Oita Works. The dialogue meeting, which was designed to deepen  communication between the companies and local resi- dents, was a success, with a total of 170 people participat- ing, including some 80 local residents and representatives  of residents\\u2019 associations, as well as local government of- fi cials, school staff , and employees of related companies. Representatives of local residents, environmental NPOs,  universities, governments, and companies took part in a  panel discussion, during which they enthusiastically dis- cussed issues such as corporate RC activities and global  warming. At the Q&A session, the audience raised candid  questions and off ered their comments, making the session  quite exciting. The Oita Works participates in each regional dialogue  meeting as the leader of the companies and facilitator of  discussions, and is committed to improving the content. To  this end, the Works proposed to organize a plant tour for  both the JRCC member companies and non-members. Also, in March 2009, JRCC member companies in Oita held  RC Regional Dialogue and a RC Small Meeting  (Oita Works) a small RC meeting, which they had been holding bienni- ally. At the meeting, representatives of the companies and  local residents exchanged opinions, and a panel exhibition  was held in response to strong requests from residents. At  the exhibition, the Oita Works showed videos illustrating  its 70-year history and introduced downstream products  made using products from the Works as well as the social  contributions made through the Olyset \\u24c7 Net. A number  of participating residents expressed their desire for these  kinds of dialogues to continue. We will continue to promote active  communication with local residents  to ensure harmonious coexistence  with local communities.

In addition to ensuring fair- ness, equitability, and transparency in our transactions,  we are also promoting responsible procurement by pur- chasing preferentially from suppliers of raw materials and  packaging materials that are committed to CSR. Basics of Responsible Procurement Clarifying regulations within the Company     Sumitomo Chemical clearly states the following basic  principle of responsible procurement in its Basic Procure- ment Policies (shown below):    \\u2018\\u20184. In its procurement, the Procurement Section shall give  preference to those suppliers that are active in CSR initia- tives, with the aim of ful\\ufb01 lling its corporate social responsi- bilities and building sound relationships with suppliers.\\u2019\\u2019     In addition, we clearly state our basic responsible pro- curement policy in the Group Business Standards of Pro- curement, which apply to Group companies both in Japan  and overseas. Clarifying regulations within the Company (1) Using the Sumitomo Chemical Supply-Chain CSR Deployment       Check Sheet     Sumitomo Chemical has created the Sumitomo Chemi- cal Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Guidebook, which  explains CSR items to be focused on by suppliers. Sumi- tomo Chemical aims to help its suppliers address their  issues by monitoring and providing feedback on the re- sults of their self evaluation using the Sumitomo Chemical  Supply-Chain CSR Deployment Check Sheets and helping  them promote CSR activities by repeating the PDCA cycle.  (See Figures 1 to 3) (2) Webpage on Procurement Information     Sumitomo Chemical has a CSR Procurement webpage  on its Procurement Information website linked from the  Company homepage in order to broadly inform its stake- holders about its CSR procurement initiatives. This CSR  Procurement webpage allows suppliers to download the  guidebook and check sheets and report the results of  their self evaluation.

(Pls. fill in)  Social Activities 40 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010      Sumitomo Chemical will plan and implement a vari- ety of human resources measures, giving due consid- eration to compliance and diversity among employees.  Most importantly, the Company will strengthen its hu- man resources system from a global perspective, pro- mote talent development, practice the \\u201cright person to  the right position\\u201d principle, and enhance the workplace  environment. HR System that Maximizes Employees\\u2019 Potential     Sumitomo Chemical will work to further enhance and  appropriately implement its role- and performance- based human resources system to enable employees  to maximize their potential. The Company will address  challenges in the retention, deployment and develop- ment of its diverse talent, while paying special attention  to changes in the business environment inside and out- side the Company as well as trends in globalization. Implementing our Manpower Plan    Sumitomo Chemical will secure and retain the opti- mum talent and workforce to support its business de- velopment, and will deploy the right person to the right  position throughout the Group, so that each employee  can conduct his or her duties with a sense of ful\\ufb01 llment  and job satisfaction, contributing to the overall strength  of the Company. Diverse Employees at Work     In response to the global business environment as  well as the aging society and declining birth rate in Ja- pan, Sumitomo Chemical will work to diversify its work- force, including rehiring retirees, so that each employee  can fully demonstrate his or her abilities regardless of  nationality, gender or age. The Company will also work  on the development of talent who can play a role inter- nationally to contribute to its globally expanding busi- ness operations. Creating a Vibrant Workplace   The Company will work to create a vibrant workplace  by encouraging communication so that each employee  can make use of his or her own strengths and further  enhance teamwork. Health Management     Sumitomo Chemical will enhance its health manage- ment and promotion measures to enable its employees  to work in good health, both mentally and physically, by  addressing mental health issues as well as challenges in  enhancing the health management system for expatri- ates. HR System that Inspires Greater Motivation Role-Based HR System     Sumitomo Chemical has introduced a role-based hu- man resources system for both managerial and non-man- agerial employees.     The system operates on the same concepts of perfor- mance evaluation, salary, and other HR parameters for  both managerial and non-managerial employees. Evaluation System     Both managerial and non-managerial employees are  evaluated not only for performance but also for competen- cies, behavioral processes and attitude. The aim of this  system is not merely the pursuit of short-term achieve- ments, but rather employee development and medium- to  long-term corporate development.     Since \\ufb01 scal 2009, evaluation items for attitudes and ac- tions that contribute to the organization have been given  greater weight in evaluations in order to highlight the im- portance of achieving results through teamwork. Compliance and CSR Evaluations     Compliance and CSR are included in the items evalu- ated for non-managerial employees with a view to raising  compliance and CSR awareness. CSR evaluations focus  on Responsible Care (safety, environment, and product  quality).  Priority Targets for Fiscal 2010 to 2012 Hand in Hand with Employees Sumitomo Chemical is working to create a workplace environment in which individual employees can feel  motivated and make the most of their abilities.  41 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 Creating a Comfortable Workplace (1) Promoting Work-Life Balance     Sumitomo Chemical continuously implements mea- sures for improving employees\\u2019 work-life balance and also  seeks to further raise their motivation and morale by offer- ing shortened working hours and increased time off. Support for Childcare and Nursing Care     To help employees respond to various developments  in their lives at different stages, and also to ensure that  we retain talent, we are providing a number of childcare  and nursing care support systems, including an enhanced  childcare leave system and new in-house childcare facili- ties (see page 22).     In April 2008, in recognition of the formulation and  implementation of an action plan to support employee  childcare, we obtained approval  from the Japanese Ministry of  Health, Labour and Welfare to use  the \\u201cKurumin\\u201d mark, which certi\\ufb01 es  a business operator as supporting  the upbringing of children who will  become the leaders of the next generation.     Since \\ufb01 scal 2008, we have been implementing a \\ufb01 ve- year plan to help employees make work and childcare  compatible. Supporting Employees\\u2019 Social Contribution and  Full\\ufb01 llment of Social Duties     Sumitomo Chemical has been enhancing its working  environment to actively support employees\\u2019 social contri- butions and full\\ufb01 llment of social duties.     Speci\\ufb01 cally, we have instituted a volunteer leave system  that enables employees to take paid volunteer leave of up  to two consecutive working days per year to support their  social contribution activities. Since launching this system  in April 2008, 16 employees have made use of it (as of  March 31, 2010).     We made improvements in the working environment  to enable employees to participate easily in the lay judge  system that started in Japan in May 2009. When employ- ees of Sumitomo Chemical are selected to be lay judges,  they will be allowed to take paid holidays and will also re- ceive a daily allowance from the court.

Employees are encouraged to leave work on time on \\u201crefreshment days\\u201d designated by each individual  workplace and worksite at least once a week. Twenty days paid holiday are granted to all employees from the first year of work. Annual paid holidays are allocated systematically by each worksite. Employees under the flextime program without any core time can also take half-day holidays now. Employees going abroad because of the job transfer of their spouses can take this special leave subject to  certain conditions.

In January 2009, the Company assigned a chief  occupational health physician to centrally manage the  health of employees, and has been implementing a variety  of measures to help employees manage and improve their  health. Mental Health     Employees can use the counseling services provided by  the in-house mental health facilities and also by special- ist external institutions. In \\ufb01 scal 2009, seminars on caring  for mental health were held for new employees and newly  promoted employees.     In addition, in order to help employees who have been  absent from work for extended periods due to mental  health problems return to work, we introduced a work  rehabilitation system in April 2009. Under this system, an  employee can work shorter hours or days and with re- duced responsibilities for up to three months, and the on- site occupational health physician, HR staff member, and  the employee\\u2019s manager cooperate in helping the employ- ee to start working again. In \\ufb01 scal 2009, seven employees  returned to work under this system. Physical Health     By law, all employees and their dependents aged 40 or  older are entitled to special health checks and guidance  on preventing metabolic syndrome. Sumitomo Chemical  works with its health insurance association to ensure that  all employees undergo this special health check regard- less of age and employees aged 35 or older receive guid- ance on early diagnosis and prevention of lifestyle-related  diseases.     In \\ufb01 scal 2009, the company sent its chief occupational  health physician to provide medical counseling and evalu- ate the medical service environment to Saudi Arabia three  times and to the United States and Singapore once each  to provide support for employees working overseas and  their families. VOICE TOPIC At Sumitomo Chemical, internal occupational health physi- cians, health workers, and nurses cooperate with the HR  department and workplace to prevent employees from be- coming physically or mentally unwell and to improve their  physical and mental health. Employees are the company\\u2019s main players in its global busi- ness operations, and we will support them in many diff erent  ways to enable them to lead both physically and mentally  healthy lives, reviewing and improv- ing these services as required. Supporting Employees Both Physically and Mentally Hiroaki Itatani Chief occupational health physician Holding Experiential Health Seminars The Misawa Works has been holding experiential health  seminars as part of its health management efforts. In  fiscal 2009, the Works held a seminar on preserving  physical and mental health, in which employees learned  a relaxation method, listened to talks by external lectur- ers (a nationally registered dietitian and a health fi tness  instructor), ate a healthy lunch, and did stretches and  walking exercises. Through this seminar, employees learned about good  nutrition, exercise, and rest, and how to use this knowl- edge to manage their health through delicious meals  and pleasant exercise. Mental health training Health seminar  43 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 Hand in Hand with Employees Use of Diversi\\ufb01 ed Human Resources Diversi\\ufb01 ed Employment     Sumitomo Chemical looks for and recruits talented  people, regardless of age, background, gender or nation- ality in a wide range of areas, and a diverse spectrum of  people are working in the Company. In fiscal 2009, the  Company recruited 149 university graduates, including 17  foreign nationals.     We are also committed to providing employees with a  workplace in which they feel comfortable working regard- less of gender, and an increasing number of women feel  able to exercise their talents at the Company. Employment of People with Disabilities     Sumitomo Chemical has been actively employing  people with disabilities. When we accept them, we assign  them suitable work, and modify the workplace where nec- essary so that they can make the most of their abilities. Reemployment of Retirees     We began reemploying retirees in fiscal 2001 and in- troduced a new reemployment system in April 2006, in  response to the revision of the Japanese Act on Stabiliza- tion of Employment of Elderly Persons. In \\ufb01 scal 2009, we  reemployed 116 (65.9%) from among 176 retirees (of Sumi- tomo Chemical). They are able to continue demonstrating  the skill and expertise they have gained through working  for the Company. Human Rights Protection of Human Rights     To educate employees on human rights issues and re- sponsible behavior, Sumitomo Chemical holds a meeting  on human rights every year, formulates annual policies  on human rights, and holds seminars and other activities  based on these policies. The Company also undertakes  company-wide efforts to prevent sexual harassment and  other disturbing behavior. In order to create a workplace  where employees of both genders can demonstrate their  abilities, the Company is working continuously to raise  awareness among employees by giving new managers  training on sexual harassment, discrimination and other  problems. Participating in the TABLE FOR TWO program     Sumitomo Chemical has been participating in the TA- BLE FOR TWO program since May 2008 to promote em- ployee\\u2019s health and contribute to society. The Company  serves healthy menu options at the cafeterias at its sites  according to the criteria set down by the \\u201cTABLE FOR  TWO\\u201d (TFT) organization. When employees choose to  eat any of the healthy meals, 20 yen per meal is donated  to the TFT secretariat and the money is used to pay for  a school lunch for one child in an African country. In this  way the company is helping to alleviate hunger in Africa  while also helping employees avoid obesity and lifestyle- related diseases at the same time.     Furthermore, as a Matching Gift, the Company makes  a donation to the TFT secretariat matching employees\\u2019  donations, and donations to this organization totaled  5,668,280 yen as of March 2010. VOICE Numbers of New Women Employees and Female Managers  Reemployment of Retirees (of Sumitomo Chemical) I sometimes go on business trips to Africa, where people face  serous food shortages. I feel pleased that I can contribute  to solving this problem by choosing a TFT meal. TFT meals,  which are composed of a low-calorie main dish and a small  side dish, are also good for my own health: although I go jog- ging at least one hour every morning and exercise at a sports  gym on weekends, I used to fi nd it dif- fi cult to improve my diet.

Providing opportunities for exchanges, semi-annual  central labor-management meetings and regional labor- management meetings are held at all worksites.     The Company and the labor union also hold meetings  to discuss and formulate various programs for non-mana- gerial employees to enable them to increase their morale  and motivation at work. Labor-Management Initiatives     Sumitomo Chemical has been cooperating with its labor  union in combating global warming and in social contribu- tion activities initiated by employees. (1) Promoting CO2 emissions reductions in the household     In cooperation with its labor union, Sumitomo Chemical  is encouraging reductions in CO2 emissions, not only in  its factories and of\\ufb01 ces, but also in its employees\\u2019 house- holds.     Since \\ufb01 scal 2008, the Company has been distributing  its own \\u201cenvironmental accounting books\\u201d to all employ- ees and encouraging them to identify the sources of CO2  emissions in their homes. In \\ufb01 scal 2009, we started a pro- gram to encourage employees to reduce CO2 emissions  at home and to commend those who achieve substantial  reductions. (2) Matching Gift Program     In \\ufb01 scal 2007, Sumitomo Chemical started its Matching  Gift program jointly with its labor union. In this program,  donations are solicited from employees and executives of  Sumitomo Chemical Group companies, and the Company  matches the amount collected. The total is then donated  to the organizations selected as recipients of support.      In \\ufb01 scal 2009, we donated to ASHINAGA* a private NPO,  as part of our support for children\\u2019s upbringing and edu- cation. We also made a donation to the Organization for  Industrial, Spiritual and Cultural Advancement-International  (OISCA)\\u2020 to support its tree-planting activities as part  of our support for global environmental protection and  the prevention of global warming. Amounts of 5798,733  yen and 6,390,633 yen were donated to ASHINAGA and  OISCA respectively by employees and executives, and the  Company matched the amounts.

Enhanced Human Resources Development     In \\ufb01 scal 2009, we provided all employees with training  that meets the requirements of their individual job grades  and various other measures focusing on the following four  items. Planned development of global leaders who will play  a central managerial role Smooth inter-generational transfer of technologies  and skills that support our business  Development of the human resources required for  global business expansion Support for employees in acquiring and developing  the knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary  for their job grades     As a new initiative, we held training sessions to enable  individual employees to carry out their business duties  based on a full understanding of the Company\\u2019s Business  Philosophy. We also created a workplace management  guidebook to help employees \\u201cdevelop a vibrant corpo- rate culture and continue to be a company that society  can trust,\\u201d as stated in the Business Philosophy, and dis- tributed copies of the guidebook that outlines the basics  of workplace management to all section managers and  above. Training Rotation System     Since \\ufb01 scal 2004, Sumitomo Chemical has been carry- ing out systematic training rotations of younger employees  to ensure that individuals are placed in the positions for  which they are best suited. To date, nearly 200 employees  have undergone training rotations.     In \\ufb01 scal 2009, we started a new training rotation system  and expanded it to include all non-managerial employees  regardless of their job categories and some managerial  employees. Under the system, we are using the prefer- ences submitted by employees and the development  plans made by their managers to help employees plan and  develop their ideal careers. In \\ufb01 scal 2009, rotation plans  were made for 898 employees and these plans are being  steadily implemented. Trainer System     Sumitomo Chemical introduced a Trainer System in  January 2008, under which older employees who are  highly skilled and have an aptitude for teaching the young  are certified as trainers. These trainers provide instruc- tion and advice to younger employees to facilitate their  development and to ensure the succession of skills from  generation to generation. As of April 2009, a total of 51  employees have been certi\\ufb01 ed as trainers throughout the  company.     In April 2010, we also introduced a Mentor System to  give supervisors and potential supervisors on-the-job  training.

In this plan we clarify our medium-term  targets (for \\ufb01 scal 2010 to 2012) and main items for imple- mentation (see Figure below).      Based on this plan, each Group company formulates  its own medium-term and annual RC action plans and re- peats the PDCA cycle* to implement the plan and further  raise the level of their RC activities. In April 2010, we established a Chemical Safety Group  within the Responsible Care Offi  ce to improve our man- agement of chemical substances. This group will cooper- ate with our Environmental Health Science Laboratory to  ensure scientific management of chemical substances,  complying with relevant regulations both in Japan and  overseas, and encouraging volun- tary risk-based management of  chemicals. Launching a Chemical Safety Group  in the Responsible Care Offi  ce In March 2010, Sumitomo Chemical held its fourth RC Global Meeting  at its head offi  ce in Tokyo and also at the Chiba Works. This meeting  has been held annually for overseas Group companies since fiscal  2006, and a large number of employees from 19 overseas Group  companies involved in RC participated in the fourth meeting. At the  meeting, people from  Sumitomo Chemical  and overseas Group  companies reported  on the challenges and  topics related to their  RC activities and ac- tively exchanged opin- ions and comments. Holding Regular RC Global Meetings Formulating Group Standards for Responsible Care      In fiscal 2009, Sumitomo Chemical formulated its  Group standards for Responsible Care with the aim of  strengthening internal control and management ef\\ufb01 ciency  throughout the Sumitomo Chemical Group. The standards  set out the basic Responsible Care requirements to be  met by the Group, including policies, measures, and pro- cedures. The Company is now raising employee aware- ness of the standards at both domestic and overseas  Group companies.      At present, each Group company is striving to improve  their RC management based on these standards, includ- ing enhancing their RC systems and establishing the nec- essary rules and regulations.

Koei Chemical has been manufacturing a wide  range of unique organic chemical products in re- sponse to society\\u2019s needs for over 90 years since its  foundation in 1917. We deliver various products while  conducting RC activities to ensure safety and quality  and to protect the environment and human health, and  these activities form the cornerstone of our business  management.     We conduct a range of activities at our plants  based on our basic policy of Making Safety the First  Priority. For example, in introducing new products and  equipment, our plants always examine issues related  to safety, the environment, and quality before start- ing; hold meetings to review past failures and learn  lessons; and conduct disaster prevention drills jointly  with local \\ufb01 re departments.     In \\ufb01 scal 2010, we created a new plant reform pro- gram, including activities to promote environmental  safety, in order to raise our levels of safety and envi- ronmental protection.     We work to avoid any noncompliance with laws and  regulations on chemical safety. We check the legal  requirements for chemicals when we receive inquiries  on them and are building a system that allows us to  ensure legal compliance for all products for export.     In 1998, we also began publishing a report on safe- ty, the environment and product quality each year to  outline our RC activities. We will continue to promote  RC activities under the corporate slogan \\u201cWe love the  Earth, and we love chemistry,\\u201d aiming to earn ever  more trust from society. Specifi c Initiatives to Further Enhance RC Since 2004, Koei Chemical has been holding monthly meet- ings for all departments to review one or two examples of  its past failures, aiming to prevent the recurrence of similar  safety, environmental, and product quality issues through- out the company and also to pass on our technologies to  younger employees. At the meeting held in April 2010, we  reviewed some cases that could have resulted in serious  incidents related to operating the reactors and managing  product analysis. At the meetings, participants exchange  candid opinions and discuss in a sometimes tense but excit- ing atmosphere. We make the meeting worthwhile by fol- lowing up on results and checking whether they are being  used eff ectively in order to improve our standards of work.  In response to concerns that our older employees might  not be able to pass on all our technologies to younger  employees before retiring, we began building a data- base of the experience and expertise accumulated in the  company starting in 2005. All employees can access this  database for information on items including occupational  health and safety, industrial safety and disaster prevention,  environmental protection, production technologies, and  equipment maintenance. We also use this database in our  technology training, where our technologies are passed  on directly from older to younger  employees. We will continue these  activities to ensure safe plant man- agement. Monthly Meeting to Review Failures and  Technology Training Koei Chemical Co., Ltd.

Koei Chemical\\u2019s Chiba Plant Norio Nawa Deputy Plant Manager Koei Chemical Co., Ltd.  53 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010     Dalian Sumika Chemphy Chemical (DSC) celebrat- ed its seventh anniversary in April 2010, and it is al- ready \\ufb01 ve and a half years since it started operations  in December 2004. DSC manufactures intermediates  for agricultural chemicals and has been maintaining  stable full operation for several years while establish- ing a record of zero accidents or disasters since its  start.     As a result of our RC activities, we received the  highest evaluation and commendation in the inspec- tions on health and safety conducted by the Chinese  authorities for two consecutive years in 2008 and  2009. Also in 2009, at the first meeting held to an- nounce the introduction of RC in the Dalian Develop- ment Area, DSC gave a presentation on its RC activi- ties as a representative of local companies. In this  presentation, we placed an emphasis on one idea we  always bear in mind, which is that the damage caused  to facilities by a fatal accident or environmental prob- lem can always be recovered by spending money,  but people killed in an accident can never be brought  back to life and the relationship of trust with local resi- dents and communities can be lost in a moment.      Fatal accidents tend to be the result of leakages  and clogging, which we work to prevent through on- site patrols to detect initial leakages and clogging  using all \\ufb01 ve senses. We make concerted efforts fo- cused on investigating the basic causes of the prob- lems detected and preventing their recurrence.     Recently, the employees themselves have created  a health and safety education handbook that illus- trates the basic safety rules with photos, and easy-to- understand safety signs are now posted not only for  employees but also for visitors. We are also publish- ing a \\u201csafety newspaper.\\u201d     To communicate with local residents, we participat- ed in local dialogue meetings to explain our environ- mental measures and also invited local residents on  tours of our plant to improve mutual understanding.     Meanwhile, within the company, we held a brief- ing for all employees to educate them on what they  should know as members of the Sumitomo Chemi- cal Group, including Sumitomo\\u2019s history as well as  overcoming environmental problems and also ful\\ufb01 lling  social responsibility and contributing to local commu- nities, principles that have formed the basis of Sumi- tomo Chemical\\u2019s business since its start. This brie\\ufb01 ng  allows us to convey Sumitomo\\u2019s Business Principles  and Business Philosophy to employees.     We aim to become a model chemical plant for the  other plants in Dalian and to be a  company that is truly accepted by  the local community.

From  fi scal 2008 to 2009, the annual total output was  severely affected by a decrease in production  volumes and as a result the cost effi  ciency of our  environmental protection activities decreased. In  response, we will implement more eff ective mea- sures by analyzing and studying the breakdown  of costs and reviewing each item to determine  its importance. In fi scal 2009, we decided to cal- culate the cost efficiency of our environmental  protection as the ratio of annual total production  value to total environmental protection costs, in  order better to reflect actual production activi- ties in the calculation, and we have now applied  this calculation method retrospectively. *17 major consolidated subsidiaries Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd.; Koei Chemical Co., Ltd.; Taoka Chemical  Co., Ltd.; Sumitomo Joint Electric Power Co., Ltd.; Sumika Color Co., Ltd.; Nihon  Medi-Physics Co., Ltd.; Nippon A&L Inc.; Thermo Co., Ltd.; SanTerra Co., Ltd.;  Sumika Kakoushi Co., Ltd.; Nihon Oxirane Co., Ltd.; Sumika Agrotech Co., Ltd.;  Dongwoo Fine-Chem Co., Ltd.; Sumitomo Chemical (Singapore) Pte.

Sumitomo Chemical shares the targets for major envi- ronmental protection management items with 15 Group  companies in Japan and takes specific measures to im- prove environmental performance (Figure 4). We are also  implementing similar initiatives with overseas Group com- panies. Promoting Sustainable Environmental Management Enhancing LCA for Products and Processes (at Plants)      For more practical and effective use of LCA*3 data (in- cluding CFP*4 assessment specialized for CO2) both inside  and outside the Company, we use the LCA software (JE- MAI-LCA Pro) from the Japan Environmental Management  Association for Industry as our standard calculation tool.  We are studying how to standardize (universalize) the use  of LCA in the Company and work systematically to imple- ment it across all divisions. Trial Evaluation of Material Flow Cost Accounting (MFCA)     From September 2008 to February 2009, Sumitomo  Chemical participated in an MFCA*5 introduction dem- onstration project supported by the Japanese Ministry of  Economy, Trade and Industry. In this project, the Compa- ny implemented MFCA on a trial basis at its manufacturing  facilities for pharmaceutical intermediates. Based on the  knowledge and experience gained through this trial, we  are now evaluating the effectiveness of the accounting  method and continuing detailed studies on how to utilize  the method more widely.     In \\ufb01 scal 2009, we held seminars and lectures on the trial  results and widely disclosed and announced related infor- mation by contributing articles to professional journals.

Responsible Care Activities 60 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010     Sumitomo Chemical has chosen the following items as  specific targets in the field of environmental protection  and is strengthening measures to achieve them in order  to make tangible improvements in its environmental per- formance. These items include promoting climate change  prevention measures and energy-environment strategies,  advancement and standardization of the environmental  performance totaling system, improvements to the environ- mental ef\\ufb01 ciency indicator and improvements to and stable  use of the environmental efficiency evaluation method,  expanded use of the environmental accounting method,  identifying the optimum mix of appropriate legal compli- ance measures and voluntary activities, and promotion of  Group-wide environmental protection targets. Energy Conservation and the Prevention of Global Warming Summary of Initiatives     We aim to achieve the world\\u2019s highest level of energy  ef\\ufb01 ciency, and are achieving de\\ufb01 nite results by improving  our operating methods and the ef\\ufb01 ciency of our facilities  and equipment while rationalizing our processes.     We are also studying proactive and effective forward- looking measures for responding to CO2-related issues,  and are leveraging our strengths in advanced technologies  to develop processes and products that will contribute  widely to reductions in CO2 emissions. VOICE Environmental Protection Activities At the Chiba Works, we are using the active sludge method to  treat wastewater at the wastewater treatment facilities. This  method consumes large quantities of electricity in driving  the air blowers that pump air into the aeration tank and break  down organic matter in the wastewater. To reduce the power  used, we installed highly effi  cient aeration equipment, which  diff uses air widely into every corner of the tank. As a result, we  were able to reduce the use of air, which led to a reduction of  roughly 30% in the power used to drive the air blowers. In fi scal  2009, we reduced our power consumption by approximately  1,000 MWH in total, which is equivalent to a reduction in en- ergy use of 260 kl in terms of  crude oil (corresponding to  approximately 500 tons of  CO2 emissions).

Takuya Yamashita No. 1 Manufacturing Department Chiba Works Mr. Yamashita (far left) and his colleagues  61 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 VOICE Environmental Protection Activities The Osaka Works has been developing its energy conserva- tion activities with the active participation of all employees  since it started its energy conservation promotion system  in 1998. In fiscal 2009, we actively promoted energy con- servation through the effective use of simplified watt-hour  meters. Specifi cally, we attached watt-hour meters (shown in  the photo) to all the electric devices used in our workplaces,  which enables us to identify power consumption, electric- ity charges, and CO2 emissions all at  a single glance. This \\u201cvisualization\\u201d  of the energy used is making each  employee more energy-conscious  and voluntarily committed to energy  conservation, which is expected to  bring about great results throughout  the Works. At the Oita Works, exhaust gas from one of the main boilers  was sent into the air preheater to recover heat from the gas  through a heat exchange with the combustion air. The equip- ment, however, had become quite old and we replaced it  with a feed-water preheater to achieve more effective heat  recovery. The new equipment allows heat exchange between  boiler exhaust gas and the boiler feed-water, and this has re- duced use of the heavy oil C used  as boiler fuel by approximately 4%  (400 kl) annually. This replacement  has also contributed to a reduction  in atmospheric NOx emissions. The Okayama Plant \\u201cvisualizes\\u201d the hourly and monthly power  consumption for its major manufacturing equipment and its  office equipment by using power meters equipped with a  communications function. The data transmitted from the me- ters to a PC installed in the meter room are totaled in graphs  (shown below), and the data are sent to the individual depart- ments, which consider how to reduce their power usage (by  making year-on-year comparisons). As a result, lunch- time power con- sumption in the  office and other  facilities has been  reduced by about  half, and we are  now looking into  establishing an online visualization system that allows us to  constantly monitor power usage.  The Okayama Plant uses fuel (heavy oil A) and electrical ener- gy to drive small one-through boilers to generate steam from  water. The plant manufactures a diverse variety of pharma- ceutical intermediates using the batch production method,  and the volume of steam required by the entire plant varies  greatly from day to day. To conserve energy by responding  to changes in the demand for steam, it would be necessary  to ensure operation of the optimal number of boilers and  eliminate any waste. To achieve this, we have adopted a con- trol method that operates the minimum number of boilers  required in order to generate steam more effi  ciently, enabling  us to achieve a reduction of approximately 4% in energy con- sumption per unit of steam production.

This substance is composed of  insoluble mineral constituents and saltwater. Sumitomo  Chemical has been safely disposing of red bauxite in the  sea in accordance with the relevant Japanese laws. In ad- dition, the Company formulated a policy to switch to the  use of imported aluminum hydroxide, which generates no  red bauxite, with a view to stopping the dumping of red  bauxite in the sea as early as possible while continuing its  alumina products business. In May 2010, we completed  the shift with the understanding of our major customers.  Since then no red bauxite has been generated from the  manufacture of alumina products, and we are currently  treating the red bauxite that remains at our facilities. We  will complete treatment as early as possible and discon- tinue sea dumpling. Also, as one effective use of the red  bauxite, we used approximately 2,100 tons as material in  cement in cooperation with cement companies in fiscal  2009. VOICE Environmental Protection Activities TOPIC Due to increases in population and  an increasing preference for poultry  around the world, demand for methi- onine* has been expanding. Accord- ingly, our methionine manufacturing  facilities at the Ehime Works continue  to be in full operation. The methi- onine production process generates  wastewater that contains ammonia.  We studied measures to remove and  recover ammonia from wastewater  and installed the necessary equipment  in October 2009, reducing nitrogen in  wastewater by nearly 30% in the Nii- hama area. The Misawa Works classifi es wastewater from  manufacturing processes according to vari- ous treatment methods and treats the stored  wastewater by breaking it down with microor- ganisms (active sludge method) or by directly  incinerating it (when the wastewater is not  suitable for treatment using the active sludge  method). In recent years, the number of diff er- ent types of wastewater has increased but we  were unable to classify these easily because  the number of reception tanks was limited,  which posed challenges such as inability to  dispose of wastewater in a stable manner us- ing the active sludge system and increases in  the amount of wastewater being incinerated.  In 2009, to solve these problems, we divided  one of the reception tanks into fi ve, improving  and strengthening our wastewater manage- ment methods. This has helped to stabilize  active sludge treatment, and by suspending  the incineration of wastewater we were able  to cut fuel consumption by 160 kl in crude oil  equivalent and also reduce CO2 emissions by  approximately 420 tons  annually. Initiatives for Conserving  Biodiversity  As an initiative for conserving bio- diversity, Sumitomo Chemical has  been committed to global environ- mental protection, as stated in the  Sumitomo Chemical Charter for  Business Conduct and in its Eco-First  Commitments to the Japanese Min- ister of the Environment. Specifi cally,  we are developing excellent energy-  and resource-saving technologies  and products, engaging in tree- planting activities using donations  from the Matching Gift program, and  ensuring responsible procurement  by asking our suppliers to implement  environmental protection measures. We conduct experiments in which  we use genetically-modified organ- isms in a safe manner in line with our  own safety control regulations. We  will further strengthen our initiatives  based on the Ministry of the Environ- ment\\u2019s Guidelines for Private Sector  Engagement in Biodiversity and the  Declaration of Biodiversity by Nip- pon Keidanren. 0 500 1,000 1,500 \\uff08tons\\uff09 \\u201802 \\u201806 \\u201807 \\u201808 \\u201809 1,158 \\u201810 665 579 1,027 131 631 34 606 552 551 394 158 55 445 411 34 Release volumes \\uff08Target FY\\uff09 \\uff08Base FY\\uff09 Air Water 50% reduction by fiscal 2010  relative to fiscal 2002 Figure 1\\u3000Releases of Substances Subject to the PRTR Act Figure 2\\u3000Generated Waste and Land\\ufb01 ll Disposal Amount 0 100 200 300 400 \\uff08Thousands of tons\\uff09 \\u201890 \\u201807 \\u201808 \\u201809 \\u201806 \\u201810 Waste generated 225 44.4 13.6 238 Landfill amount \\uff08On-site and off-site landfill\\uff09 4.4 \\uff08Target FY\\uff09 \\uff08Base FY\\uff09 Reduce by 90%  relative to  fiscal 1990 9.2 7.7 219 192 154 7.4 Measures to Reduce Nitrogen in  Wastewater Containing Ammonia Stabilizing Wastewater Treatment by  Dividing Reception Tanks \\u25c6 As a result of implementing measures to recover and break down \\u03b5-caprolac- tam, release into water substantially decreased in \\ufb01 scal 2009, while release into the  air increased slightly from an increase in production volumes. Takao Mizuno Niihama Second  Manufacturing  Department Ehime Works * Methionine Methionine is a nutrient and one of the essen- tial amino acids that cannot be synthesized  by animals.

Masanori Sato Manufacturing  Department Misawa Works  Responsible Care Activities 64 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 TOPIC Safety Performances in Fiscal 2009     In \\ufb01 scal 2009, two accidents resulted in lost workdays  (accident frequency rate of lost-workday injuries: 0.16) with  another three such accidents occurring at contractors (ac- cident frequency rate of lost-workday injuries: 0.29).     The annual average for the frequency of lost-work day  injuries during the 10 years from \\ufb01 scal 2000 to 2009 was  2.9. Sumitomo Chemical has been aggressive in pursu- ing occupational safety and health activities to prevent  labor accidents under the fundamental principle of Making  Safety the First Priority. To this end we are repeating the  PDCA cycle to identify all conspicuous and potential risks  and hazards in each workplace and implementing a series  of measures including making improvements based on the  results of risk assessments. As a result of these efforts, all  our sites have already acquired certi\\ufb01 cation for their oc- cupational safety and health management systems (OS- HMSs). Unfortunately, however, we have not yet achieved  our target of zero accidents. From this \\ufb01 scal year, we will  continue to promote a culture of safety throughout the  company to ensure that all employees truly understand  and practice our principle of Making Safety the First Pri- ority to foster a corporate culture that will enable us to  achieve and maintain our zero\\u2013accident target.     The number of accidents among contractors\\u2019 employ- ees has remained at the same level or has increased  slightly since fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2009, three accidents   resulting in lost workdays occurred. Now we need to re- confirm the fundamental principle of \\u201censuring occupa- tional health and safety through a concerted effort with  contractors\\u201d to achieve zero accidents. Surveying Buildings Constructed Using  Materials Containing Asbestos     Sumitomo Chemical surveyed all its buildings to deter- mine whether they had been constructed with materials  containing asbestos. Subsequently, asbestos was re- moved, enclosed or surrounded, in accordance with the  Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare\\u2019s Regu- lations for the Prevention of Asbestos-related Disease. All  such work was completed by December 2005. Safety Initiatives Sumitomo Chemical is building a robust industrial safety and disaster prevention system  making the safety of everyone \\ufb01 rst priority. The RC activity plan for the Ohe Works,  which was established in April 2009, and  Sumika Assembly Techno (SAT) included  the acquisition of JISHA certification for  their occupational safety and health man- agement systems (OSHMSs). In April 2009, the Works and SAT started  jointly to create manuals, provide education, train internal auditors, and  perform internal audits as preparatory work for the inspections that form  part of the certifi cation, and in February 2010, the Japan Industrial Safety  & Health Association (JISHA) conducted onsite inspections and as a result  presented certifi cates to both the Ohe Works and  SAT in March of the same year. However, we have  much more to do to improve our OSHMS and will  implement further measures to establish truly  safe workplaces. For six months starting in October 2009,  the Tsukuba Research Laboratory con- ducted a traffic safety campaign to edu- cate employees on how to avoid causing  traffic accidents while commuting. In this  campaign, named the \\u201cYYY Campaign,\\u201d employees (You)  were urged to pay careful attention to driving slowly (Yuk- kuri) and comfortably (Yutori). The campaign achieved its  target successfully through use of a  voice navigation system and activities  in small teams of four to fi ve people.

So far we have organized physical examinations  for 1,465 persons, 24 of whom have been deemed eligible  for workers\\u2019 compensation insurance benefits under the  Workers\\u2019 Accident Compensation Insurance Act, and 81  persons were issued a Health Check Note. Four persons  have been deemed eligible for special bereaved family  compensation under the Act on Asbestos Health Damage  Relief (as of the end of March 2010).     Information on these physical examinations is also  provided on the Sumitomo Chemical website (in Japa- nese only).

Plants must also be  protected against natural disasters and terrorist attacks.  Stringent risk assessments are therefore conducted, in  addition to continuous safety improvement and compre- hensive voluntary safety management.      Unfortunately, however, we had two serious accidents in  succession in April and May 2009. Learning lessons from  these accidents, we have created error prevention manu- als and checklists, enhanced our document management  system to make effective use of the documents, clari- fied the judgment criteria for emergency measures and  information communication, and established a fail-safe*  system for the abatement tower equipment. These safety  measures are helping us to promote safety management  throughout the Company aimed at achieving our target of  zero accidents.     We also conduct emergency drills including drills to  provide emergency information to local communities. \\u201cLook out for one another and predict risks,  I must play a leading role in establishing a  culture of safety\\u201d This slogan is based on the following idea: workplace safety  cannot be ensured unless employees predict risks to protect  themselves and point out risks that they have identified to  each other to protect their colleagues. All members of the  company, including both top executives and onsite employ- ees must play an active role in creating a culture of safety de- signed to achieve our zero\\u2013accident  target by committing themselves to  preventing accidents in their work- place. Fiscal 2010 Slogan for Occupational Safety  and Health Fiscal 2010 Poster for Occupational Safety and Health We designed the poster to show our com- mitment to achieving a sound workplace.  Specifi cally, we will deepen our understand- ing of the fundamental principle of Making  Safety the First Priority and make a concert- ed eff ort to advance our culture of safety as  members of Sumitomo Chemical. The keys  to achieving this target are (1) to look out for  one another; (2) to thank each other; (3) to  greet each other; (4) to inform each other;  and (5) to be considerate of each other. The  poster depicts pigeons, which symbolize  peace, as the symbol for our commitment to  enhancing our culture of safety. Fire at SN Kasei Co., Ltd.   (in the Ohe area at the Ehime Works)     On April 29, 2010, a fi re broke out at SN Kasei, a subsidiary  of Nippon A&L Inc. (a subsidiary of Sumitomo Chemical). Th is  fi re, which occurred in the Ohe area at Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s  Ehime Works, inconvenienced and created anxiety for many  people, including local residents, and we apologize sincerely for  the incident.     The fire, which occurred in a resin processing process, did  not cause any damage to persons and had no impact on the  surrounding environment. Nonetheless Sumitomo Chemical  regrets the fi re and is determined to enhance its safety measures,  review its reporting and notifi cation methods, and provide more  emergency education throughout the Sumitomo Chemical  Group to raise safety awareness among all Group employees and  reestablish trust between the company, local residents and all  other stakeholders. * Fail-safe system A fail-safe system employs an apparatus or subsystem that ensures recovery to  a safe state in the event of a system failure.

Examination of Process Safety     The Process Safety Review Committee convenes at  every step, from R&D through to industrial scale produc- tion processes, to oversee a system in which the safety of  each stage is thoroughly veri\\ufb01 ed before moving on to the  next stage. The system is in use at Sumitomo Chemical,  and all Group companies are instructed to adopt it. R&D Safety Con\\ufb01 rmation     At the R&D stage, materials safety data and other relat- ed data on the chemicals to be handled are examined and  assessed in detail. These data are then used to select the  safest chemicals and to assess the required amounts in  order to ensure that the R&D will entail only fundamentally  safe chemical processes.     The construction materials for new chemical plants are  also examined and evaluated to select the optimum mate- rials with lower life cycle costs. Plant Safety Con\\ufb01 rmation     While plant design and construction are based on legal  technical standards, processes are additionally subjected  to hazard assessments in order to highlight potential dan- gers and incorporate, from the standpoint of self-adminis- tered management, more stringent safety precautions into  the design and construction processes.     In addition, operational manuals are created and train- ing is provided for operators. The Company also conducts  process hazard evaluations regularly after the start of  plant operations and any time there is a change in operat- ing parameters in order to ensure plant safety. Advanced Self-administered Safety Management     Aiming to achieve advanced self-administered manage- ment, Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s Process & Production Tech- nology Center works to improve and effectively utilize the  support system and tools obtained from various sources.  Its mission is to support process security and disaster  prevention management, prepare various security and  disaster prevention guidelines, and compile a database of  security information (technical information and accident  information) and risks related to mixing of or contact with  substances.     In \\ufb01 scal 2009, we revised the guidelines on static elec- tricity safety measures and on chemical process safety  in the industrial safety and disaster prevention guidelines  and are now using the revised versions as our guidelines  for 2010. They have also been posted on the Company\\u2019s  intranet. In November 2009, the Ehime  Works (in Kikumoto) conduct- ed an emergency drill with  the cooperation of the local  Niihama fire department,  inviting the directors of local  resident associations from the  neighborhood. The drill is conducted regularly by the local joint fi re prevention  council comprising Sumitomo Group companies. This time, in  addition to ordinary training to deal with a fire, we also intro- duced a scenario where a fi re had generated poisonous gas and  organized an emergency drill to broad- cast the incident to the local communi- ties surrounding the factory. Conducting a Joint Emergency Drill  in the Presence of Local Residents The Osaka Works has been implement- ing various measures to prevent plant  accidents. In addition we conduct  emergency drills to prepare for such  accidents. In June 2009, we held a com- prehensive emergency drill jointly with  the local fi re department in Konohana, Osaka and with the joint  fi re prevention association in the Osaka Hokuko district. The drill  consisted of initial fi re fi ghting, relief for victims, preventing the  fi re from spreading, and notifying the relevant agencies. We in- vited the directors of neighborhood local resident associations  to the drill as observers. Their response included comments such  as \\u201cThe drill was very disciplined, making  us feel more comfortable to be living near  the factory.\\u201d We will continue to improve  the quality of our emergency drills.

The divisions are making a concerted effort with partner logistics companies  to implement this policy. Initiatives for Improving Logistics Safety and Quality (1)  Ensuring logistics safety in cooperation with        logistics companies     Our RC activities are designed to eliminate labor injuries  and quality accidents in our logistics operations in close  cooperation with partner logistics companies. Speci\\ufb01 cally,  we conduct cross-organizational activities with the logis- tics companies in order to train one another and improve  voluntary management levels and also find solutions to  various challenges through the Sumitomo Chemical Lo- gistics Partnership Council. We also provide individual  instruction for each of the partner companies through  logistics RC audits. These cross-organizational activities  and RC audits form our two core RC logistics activities.  (2)  Preventing logistics quality-related problems using        IT technologies     We are working to prevent shipping and delivery errors  through the use of barcodes and RFID* tags. The Osaka  Works has developed a system that combines the use of  barcodes to prevent shipping errors and the use of RFID  tags to manage containers, while also using returnable  containers to make our logistics operations more environ- mentally friendly.     Sumika Logistics, a Sumitomo Chemical Group com- pany, has also introduced a system that uses QR codes  for valve operations to prevent shipping errors. Reducing the Environmental Impact of Our Logistics Operations    Sumitomo Chemical has been actively implementing a  modal shift to rail and ship transportation. In our transpor- tation quality improvement project with Japan Freight Rail- way, we formed a local solution team in Chiba and started  joint transportation with companies working in different  industries in 2009. As a result, in \\ufb01 scal 2009 we improved  the unit energy consumption of our logistics operations in  Japan by 0.2% relative to \\ufb01 scal 2008, achieving an aver- age annual reduction rate of 2.7% since fiscal 2006. We  also reduced CO2 emissions by 5.5% from the \\ufb01 scal 2008  level (by 17.8% from \\ufb01 scal 2006). As part of the company-wide efforts to encourage the shift  to railway transportation and to upsize containers, the Chiba  Works formed a solutions team to improve the quality of  railway transportation jointly with JR Freight Railway and Kei- yorinkai focusing on the bulk transportation of resin products.  In December 2009, the Works started joint transportation  with Toyobo Co, Ltd., the company to which it delivers its resin  products. Products from the Chiba Works are transported in  ISO containers by rail from Keiyo Kubota Station to Tsurugako  Station, and then from this station fi lm products from Toyobo  are transported to the Kanto region (to Kumagaya Kamotsu  Terminal Station). As a result of this roundtrip transportation  method, CO2 emissions  can be reduced by a total  of 1,060 tons annually.  The Works is also ex- panding this modal shift  for shipments to Nagoya,  Niihama and Mizushima. Activities of the Local Solutions Team in Chiba In filling tanks with a variety of products that flow through  numerous valves, the risk of errors in the mixing process is  high. To solve this problem, in November 2009, Sumika Logis- tics began assigning  each valve its own QR  code, which is then  read to prevent mix- ing errors during the  fi lling process.

Recently, however, identi\\ufb01 cation  through the combined use of non-contact communication using radio waves  and IC chips is becoming a mainstream RFID technology, and so RFID is now of- ten used to mean a non-contact identi\\ufb01 cation technology using IC chips. RFID  tags are therefore also called \\u201c IC tags.\\u201d Energy consumption Unit energy consumption CO2 emissions 32,800 kl in crude oil equivalent 0.0105 kl/ton 86,700 tons Ceremony held by JR Freight Railway to  celebrate the start of the joint transporta- tion project  Responsible Care Activities 68 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 TOPIC Chemical Safety Management throughout the Life Cycle of Chemical Products Increasing Global Requirements for Chemical Risk Reduction     In August 2002, the World Summit on Sustainable De- velopment (WSSD) was held in Johannesburg, the Repub- lic of South Africa. The Summit proposed targets for 2020,  aiming to ensure that \\u201cchemicals are used and produced  in ways that lead to the minimization of signi\\ufb01 cant adverse  effects on human health and the environment.\\u201d This led to  the adoption in February 2006 of the Strategic Approach  to International Chemicals Management (SAICM), admin- istered and inspected by the UN Environment Programme  (UNEP), in the International Conference on Chemicals  Management (ICCM). This has accelerated global initia- tives toward reducing risk throughout the life cycle of  chemical substances.     As a member of the chemical industry, Sumitomo  Chemical is advancing initiatives for both regulatory com- pliance and voluntary measures to strengthen risk-based  chemical management in our commitment to contribute to  the implementation of SAICM. Environmental Health Science Laboratory Playing a  Central Role in Safety Research     At Sumitomo Chemical, the Environmental Health Sci- ence Laboratory plays a central role in a diverse variety of  safety assessments for various products developed by the  Sumitomo Chemical Group.     The Laboratory conducts sophisticated research in di- verse fields ranging from genetics to environmental and  ecological science on a global scale, making use of the lat- est scienti\\ufb01 c knowledge and advanced technologies as well  as the Company\\u2019s abundant expertise in chemical safety  assessment developed over many years. In addition, as  the core laboratory supporting the technological aspects  of RC activities for chemical safety at Sumitomo Chemical,  the Laboratory provides the entire Company with safety  information and the results of risk assessments in order to  ensure safety and protect the environment throughout the  lifecycles of chemical products and is also implementing  measures to improve its risk assessment level. Building a New System in Line with Global Trends     With an increase in international awareness of the need  for appropriate management of chemicals, it is becoming  extremely important for chemical companies to collect  and manage chemical safety information in order to be  able to properly respond to chemical regulations that are  becoming stricter every year and ensure chemical safety  based on risk assessments.      In a proactive response to these trends, Sumitomo  Chemical launched a program for compiling existing \\ufb01 nd- ings and information on the safety management of chemi- cal products in fiscal 2005. In order to properly manage  all safety information, including that collected through  this program, and utilize it effectively, Sumitomo Chemi- cal has been building a new generation database system,  the Sumitomo Chemical Comprehensive Environmental,  Health & Safety Management System (SuCCESS).      SuCCESS is a system that enables us to review informa- tion on safety, applicable laws, composition, and MSDS for  In risk assessment, the assessment of hazards is indispens- able, and therefore, in fiscal 2005, we started a program to  gather existing fi ndings and evaluate information on hazards.  We have continued this program while assessing the toxicity  and properties of chemicals by proactively using a category  approach, prediction models and databases, and encourag- ing the development and introduction of the cutting edge  evaluation technologies such as alternative testing methods  and omics analysis. To assess exposure, another essential element of risk assess- ment, we have consolidated exposure scenarios for the life- cycles of our products while verifying and introducing a vari- ety of exposure simulation models. Furthermore, we are ac- tively introducing and developing refi ned models for specifi c  exposure situations to ensure legal regulatory compliance  and encourage the voluntary management of our products. By assessing the risks of chemicals promptly and precisely us- ing various advanced technologies, we will further increase  the eff ectiveness of our risk management and risk communi- cation. Risk-based Chemical Management  Risk Management throughout the Lifecycles of Chemical Substances Manufacturing Products Environment Foodstuffs  69 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 TOPIC Elucidating Toxicity Mechanisms and Predicting Toxicity through Metabonomic Analysis In recent years, metabonomic analysis has been attracting   attention as a method to quantify a variety of internal me- tabolites such as amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids present  in animals and plants. Concentrations of internal metabolites  are maintained within a certain range in the body, but if given  an external stimulus such as exposure to chemical substances,  the information is communicated from genes to metabolic  substances, and can cause changes in the concentrations of  some internal metabolites. Sumitomo Chemical is monitoring the new metabonomic  analysis technologies using gas chromatography and mass  spectrometry and is endeavoring to establish a method for as- sessing the toxicity of chemicals by identifying changes in the  concentrations of internal metabolites brought about through  exposure to chemicals. For example, we conducted metabo- nomic analysis of the blood and urine of rats to which we had  administered hepatotoxic substances, and identifi ed changes  in the concentrations of specifi c internal metabolites to eluci- date the mechanism of toxicity. (We reported the results at the  34th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Society for Biomedical  Mass Spectrometry in 2009.) In addition, this research is ex- pected to lead to the discovery of new toxicity biomarkers. Sumitomo Chemical is focusing its efforts on assessing the  safety of various chemicals and agricultural pesticides and be- lieves that metabonomic analysis will help us elucidate toxicity  mechanisms and predict chemical toxicity more precisely. Chemical Safety Management throughout the Life Cycle of Chemical Products all chemicals handled by Sumitomo Chemical and use this  information for risk management, while also making better  use of the data accumulated by the Company over many  years. The system came into full operation in 2009, and now  all employees can access the system through the Company  intranet.     Using cutting-edge technologies, Sumitomo Chemical is  proactively assessing and managing chemical risk at each  stage of the lifecycle, including development, manufacture,  sale, use, and disposal. As part of these efforts, we have  considered how best to respond to the start of full registra- tion in 2010 under the EU\\u2019s REACH legislation. We are as- suming a variety of applications for our chemical products  along the supply chain and verifying these by communi- cating with downstream customers and incorporating the  information thus obtained into the risk assessments for our  products. Active Participation in Voluntary Initiatives in Japan  and Overseas     Sumitomo Chemical plays a leading role in compiling  reports on some of the target chemicals in the voluntary  safety assessment program for high production volume  (HPV) chemicals conducted by the ICCA. As a member of  the chemical industry, the Company also provides data  on other chemicals that it handles. Furthermore, we are  actively involved with the Japan Challenge Program, a  Japanese version of the HPV program by, for example,  participating in data entry trials to create templates for or- ganizing the collected data.     Sumitomo Chemical is also an active participant in and  is providing continuous support for the Long-Range Re- search Initiatives (LRI) for research on the impact of chem- icals on human health and the environment, which, like the  HPV program, was initiated by the ICCA. This initiative is  being implemented by chemical industry associations in  Japan, the United States, and Europe. Animal Welfare     In the process of developing useful chemical substanc- es, a variety of safety assessments are required. Some  of these assessments, however, cannot be completed  without conducting experiments using laboratory animals.  Sumitomo Chemical advocates humane treatment of  laboratory animals and applies the 3Rs of animal use and  animal welfare: replacement, reduction, and refinement.  Beyond the standards speci\\ufb01 ed by current laws and regu- lations on animal care and use issued by the Japanese  Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Education,  Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the Ministry of  Health, Labour and Welfare, and the Ministry of Agricul- ture, Forestry and Fisheries, we also have internal rules for  conducting animal experiments and have established the  Animal Welfare Committee to verify compliance with these  rules and to ensure that animal experiments are conduct- ed properly and appropriately with due consideration for  animal welfare.     We regularly monitor the care and use of animals as  speci\\ufb01 ed in the law as well as our internal regulations and  ask external experts such as university professors spe- cializing in the ethics of animal experiments to evaluate  our animal experiments for further improvement.     We have also been actively improving our system for  educating those engaged in animal experiments and de- veloping alternatives to animal experiments.

Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s Works and Research Laborato- ries are subject to the following two types of RC audits: (1)  Specialized audits, in which specialists conduct audits   on RC systems and their operation; and (2)  Management audits involving Responsible Care Com- mittee members led by the executive vice president in  charge of Responsible Care.     Specialized audits are also conducted for each of  Sumitomo Chemical\\u2019s business sectors as well as Group  companies in Japan and overseas. Medium-term RC Audit Plan (Fiscal 2010 to 2012)     We plan to promote RC activities throughout the Sumi- tomo Chemical Group for three years starting in fiscal  2010 and to conduct RC audits on Group companies that  are directly relevant to their management in order to help  them improve their RC activities. Specific details are as  follows. -RC audits of global standards     RC audits based on the entire Group\\u2019s RC activity stan- dards -Enhanced support for RC activities     Establishing a support system to promote and improve  RC activities throughout the Group -Development of human resources to support RC activities     Support for the training of RC staff throughout the Group RC audits help enhance corporate value by contributing to in- creasing the eff ectiveness of RC activities through verifi cation  of a wide range of activity items. In fi scal 2009, we thoroughly  revised the checklist used in auditing Group companies for  the fi rst time since the list was created in fi scal 2001, thereby  substantially raising the level of our RC activities. That year we  were thus able to take the  fi rst steps toward achiev- ing higher targets.

In \\ufb01 scal 2009, a total  of 47 Group companies acquired ISO 9001*1 and other  certifications in Japan and overseas, while a number of  companies have been carrying out GMP*2 quality assur- ance activities.     In fiscal 2009, Sumitomo Chemical again held meet- ings for information exchange with domestic and overseas  Group companies to promote quality assurance activities  throughout the Group. At the meetings, the Company ex- plained the Group policies on quality assurance, details of  the global standards for quality assurance operations and  product safety operations to be applied to Group compa- nies, and GHS*3-related trends in the EU. Pervio-Related Activities    Sumitomo Chemical markets Pervio*4, a separator for  lithium ion secondary batteries. The lithium ion secondary  battery separator is positioned between the anode and  cathode and functions to prevent short circuits. It thus  plays an essential role in ensuring battery safety and must  therefore be of the highest quality. We have obtained ISO  9001 certi\\ufb01 cation both at Sumitomo Chemical and some  Group companies for the development, manufacture, and  sale of Pervio, and we are committed to assuring the  highest product quality. In \\ufb01 scal 2009, we received praise  from customers, who appreciate our contributions to the  commercialization and stable production of their batteries. VOICE In order to provide high-quality, competitive products, Sumika  Electronic Materials (Wuxi) Co., Ltd. strives to assure the quali- ty of its products comprehensively, and all its employees work  with a strong sense of commitment to social responsibility. In  the Quality Assurance Department, we are also endeavoring  to improve quality to maintain the trust of our customers and  increase customer satisfaction. In terms of product quality, we obtained ISO 9001 certifi cation  for our quality control system in June 2006 and at the same  time installed processing equipment as well as inspection,  measurement, and analysis equipment, all of which are at the  most advanced levels in the industry. We provide employees  with education and training on quality control and give them  opportunities to practice what they have learned in order to  continually raise their awareness of quality in our efforts to  encourage all employees to participate in improving total  quality. In terms of quality assurance as well, we have created  a system that allows us to respond to customer\\u2019s concerns  within 24 hours to resolve quality-related issues promptly. We  also continue to improve our level of quality control and pro- ductivity while reducing production  costs. Constantly Committed to Improving Our Quality  Assurance System Initiatives at Sumitomo Chemical     At Sumitomo Chemical, our Business Sectors, Works,  and Research Laboratories formulate and implement their  own annual quality assurance plans based on the Com- pany\\u2019s annual quality assurance policies that have been  discussed and approved by the Responsible Care Com- mittee. In fiscal 2009, we experienced no major quality- related problems. We achieved results by enhancing our  product safety activities, continuing to raise all employees\\u2019  awareness of quality, and strengthening our upstream  management.

Responsible Care Activities 72 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 VOICE Strengthening Product Safety Activities     One of the essential CSR activities for any company is  to ensure the safety of the products it delivers to its cus- tomers. To meet this requirement, we conduct a variety of  activities, including identifying product risks, implement- ing measures to ensure higher levels of safety, educat- ing employees and others who handle our products, and  formulating company rules to ensure that such measures  are implemented successfully. We must also implement  measures based on the identi\\ufb01 cation of product risks. For  example, in developing new products, we repeat the risk  identi\\ufb01 cation and response measures from the R&D stage  through to the study of mass production and actual deliv- ery to customers according to company rules.     Sumitomo Chemical has been conducting these prod- uct safety activities since before the Japanese Product  Liability Act* came into effect, and reviews its activities  periodically to ensure even higher levels of safety. In \\ufb01 scal  2009, we reviewed procedures to identify product risks  and the implementation of measures, and established a  new risk assessment method that takes into account the  world\\u2019s latest trends. The new method allows us to assess  product risks more precisely, including both risks to cus- tomers and the impact on the environment. We are also  planning to apply the new method to products that have  already been risk assessed to provide our customers with  even safer products. Enhancing Upstream Management     Quality engineering, also known as the Taguchi method,  is one of the technology development tools that allow us  to indentify the optimal conditions for manufacturing high- performance products of stable quality in the product  design and development stages. Use of this methodology  has not yet been widely adopted in the chemical \\ufb01 eld, but  Sumitomo Chemical is disseminating its use throughout  the company to provide customers with products with  The fi rst internal presentation meeting on the results of ap- plying quality engineering was held in May 2009 at the Petro- chemicals Research Laboratory. A total of about 60 employees  attended the meeting from each of the Works, and the pre- sentation of seven case studies of application was followed by  a lively exchange of opinions. The meeting represented the  culmination of eff orts made by our employees over a period  of roughly two years. Quality engineering is used in the product design stage to  ensure stable high product quality. Initially, I found it diffi  cult  to understand the innovative concept of the Taguchi method,  but after listening to advice from a consultant, I was finally  able to achieve results by applying the concept to an ongoing  development project.    In the past, the Works and Research Laboratories were using  their own individual Taguchi method systems in their activi- ties, but after the meetings started, a joint system to utilize  the concept was established, and since then we have been  encouraging its use laterally throughout the organization. We  are planning to expand our application  of the concept by applying the Taguchi  method to new projects. Attending the Presentation Meeting on the Results of Applying Quality Engineering even higher performance and stable quality.     In fiscal 2009, we held our first internal presentation  meetings on the results of applying quality engineering  in Chiba and Ehime, and participants actively exchanged  opinions in the discussion and Q&A sessions.

Japanese Industrial Standards*1     In response to the recommendations made by the  United Nations on a Globally Harmonized System of Clas- si\\ufb01 cation and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS), countries are  establishing their own national laws and standards, and  Japan has become the first country to make implemen- tation of the GHS a legal requirement. Specific items to  be implemented under the GHS are now included in the  Japanese Industrial Standards, and are categorized into  a classi\\ufb01 cation method, MSDS*2 description details, and  labeling details. Sumitomo Chemical was one of the mem- bers responsible for creating the draft of the Japanese  Industrial Standards corresponding to GHS.     Following the revision of the UN recommendations on  the GHS, the corresponding Japanese Industrial stan- dards were also revised in \\ufb01 scal 2009. Sumitomo Chemi- cal participated in the revision work and helped write the  draft based on its  knowledge of GHS- related worldwide  trends and the ac- tual use of MSDS. Product Information Communication System     Companies need to obtain information about concentra- tions of some chemical substances used in home electri- cal appliances and automobiles in order to comply with  REACH*3 in the EU and other similar regulations. To this  end, manufacturers of chemical substances (upstream  companies), companies that mix and combine chemical  substances and manufacture parts using those substances  (midstream companies), and companies that assemble the  parts into final products (downstream companies) must  share relevant information throughout the supply chain.     The chemical industry has been providing information  on chemicals to customers via MSDS, but to comply with  the REACH regulation, the industry requires more detailed  information. However, individual companies in the industry  trying to communicate this information in their own sepa- rate ways will be inef\\ufb01 cient and could result in a failure to  communicate the required information clearly. To avoid  this, upstream, midstream, and downstream companies  must communicate information with each other using a  standardized form. Sumitomo Chemical and other compa- nies established JAMP*4 with a view to creating and revis- ing standardized forms (MSDSplus*5 and AIS*6).      In \\ufb01 scal 2009, Sumitomo Chemical supported the es- tablishment of an IT infrastructure called JAMP-GP*7 to  disseminate the use of MSDSplus and AIS forms through- out the supply chain.

In order to improve business performance under these  conditions, the Sumitomo Chemical Group made a con- certed effort to reduce costs through thorough rational- ization while revising the sales prices of its products and  increasing sales volumes. As a result, net sales totaled  1620.9 billion yen in \\ufb01 scal 2009, a 167.3 billion yen decline  from the previous \\ufb01 scal year. Operating income was 51.5  billion yen, ordinary income was 35.0 billion yen, and net  income was 14.7 billion yen.      In \\ufb01 scal 2009, due to further globalization of its busi- ness, the Sumitomo Chemical Group\\u2019s overseas sales ra- tio reached a record high level of 45%.

In particular, we were able to start operation  of facilities as planned for the Rabigh Project, our top prior- ity under the plan. We also acquired Sepracor Inc., a US  pharmaceutical company, and actively invested in R&D for  polymer organic LEDs (PLEDs) and energy-related technol- ogies. We missed no opportunities to make steady invest- ments for our future growth, and were thus able to continue  with the globalization of our business.      However, we were unable to achieve our initial business  performance targets for the \\ufb01 scal year because of the rapid  decrease in demand caused by the world economic down- turn. Due to this and the aforementioned investments, our  interest-bearing liabilities increased substantially.  Corporate Business Plan for Fiscal 2010 to 2012      Sumitomo Chemical is now implementing its Corporate  Business Plan for fiscal 2010 to 2012. In formulating this  new Corporate Business Plan, the Company \\ufb01 rst conceived  its Corporate Vision based on the results of analysis of fu- ture trends in the world economy and business environment  from a long-term perspective and the Company\\u2019s business  portfolio. We regard this new Corporate Business Plan as  the \\ufb01 rst step toward achieving our Corporate Vision and are  now implementing a variety of measures under the plan. Corporate Vision      The Company\\u2019s Corporate Vision comprises the following.      In I, we will accelerate the global expansion of our  business and meet continually changing market needs by  making use of our advanced technologies. In II, we will  make full use of our chemical technologies to meet global  challenges, including improvements to people\\u2019s living  standards and health, solutions to issues related to energy  and food, and the creation of a low carbon society. In III,  we will continue to enhance and increase our pro\\ufb01 tability  to meet the expectations of our shareholders. Three Strategies To Achieve Our Corporate Vision      In order to achieve our Corporate Vision, the Com- pany will actively pursue its Technology Strategy, Climate  Change Strategy, and Business Portfolio Strategy. Corporate Business Plan (Fiscal 2010 to 2012) -Focus R&D resources on the three high-growth areas of  Environment and Energy, Life Sciences, and Information &  Communication Technology (ICT).   -Practice Creative Hybrid Chemistry, combining key tech- nologies in different areas to create new value by continu- ally developing new technologies and products. -Pursue Green Sustainable Chemistry to develop competi- tive products and technologies that contribute to meeting  global challenges. -Achieve the world\\u2019s highest level of energy ef\\ufb01 ciency. -Develop products and technologies that will contribute to  CO2 emission reductions. Environment  and Energy Life  Sciences ICT (Information  & Communication  Technology) Corporate Vision Achieve sustainable strong growth as a stronger,  more innovative global company. Help meet pressing global challenges and contribute  to sustainable development of the global community. Continuously enhance the value of the company. Technology Strategy Climate Change Strategy Business Areas with High-Growth Potential <Basic Policy> Help solve pressing global issues of resources, en- ergy and the environment <Priority Climate Change Initiatives> -Achieve the world\\u2019s highest level of energy effi- ciency -Develop products and technologies that will con- tribute to CO2 emissions reduction <CO2 Emissions Reduction Measures> Enhance carbon management and implement  proactive, effective and coordinated measures  throughout the Sumitomo Chemical Group Climate Change Strategy \\u2160 \\u2161 \\u2162  79 Sumitomo Chemical CSR Report 2010 Basic Initiatives      Under the Corporate Business Plan, we have determined  the following as the seven basic initiatives, including quickly  maximizing pro\\ufb01 ts and cash \\ufb02 ows from major investments  and enhancing \\ufb01 nancial strength.

This award is granted to those who have achieved  remarkable industrial results by making comprehensive  technological developments for machinery and equipment  in the \\ufb01 elds of oil, natural gas, and petrochemicals. Technology Award for Fiscal 2009 from the Catalysis Society of Japan In recognition of efforts made to develop a ruthenium- based hydrogen chloride oxidation catalyst and put it into  practical use, five employees of Sumitomo Chemical re- ceived the technology award for \\ufb01 scal 2009 from the Catal- ysis Society of Japan at an award ceremony held on March  24, 2010. The society praised the development of the world\\u2019s first  ruthenium-based catalyst, which exhibits much higher per- formance than conventional catalysts, and the practical re- alization of catalysis process technology using a \\ufb01 xed bed  reactor. The process is effective in conserving resources  and energy and prevent- ing global warming, and  Sumitomo Chemical has  licensed the technology  to several chemical man- ufacturers both in Japan  and overseas.

The GRI Guidelines represent the sus- tainability reporting framework that is used most widely in the world, and the inclusion of the table demon- strates the Company\\u2019s commitment to ensuring \\u201ccomparability\\u201d for its global stakeholders. Now I would like to  propose that the Company consider whether to make a self-declaration on the GRI application level. As regards the contents of the CSR Report, it was pointed out in our previous review that there was room for  improvement regarding the disclosure of information on the Company\\u2019s social performance, because not all  of the related data were aggregated and reported on a consolidated basis. In response, the Company has en- hanced its global aggregation system and begun aggregating consolidated data for some indicators. The con- solidated data, however, are not included in the CSR Report because the Company\\u2019s disclosure policy has not  yet been determined. I hope that the Company will continue its eff orts to aggregate and report consolidated  data to expand the reporting boundary. With regard to the environmental and safety performance indicators included in the CSR Report, as a result of  a visit to the Company\\u2019s factory, it was found that, although the factory had calculated the emissions according  to the rules initially set by the Head Offi  ce, the factory had calculated VOC emissions to be reported to the Head  Offi  ce without examining the eff ects of the emission reduction measures implemented at the factory. The fac- tory needs to refer to the review in examining the eff ects of the measures to reduce their environmental impact  and regularly review the established rules so that the Sumitomo Chemical Group can de- scribe its current situation more precisely in the CSR Report.

Certainly, 2021 did not draw us out of the COVID-19 pandemic as we had  hoped: our economy and communities unfortunately continue to struggle  with the outbreak\\u2019s lingering impacts. Our mission to tackle environmental,  social, and political challenges has therefore never been clearer.  I am proud to say that Henkel has taken further bold action in 2021, for  which we were once again recognized by key sustainability ratings.  Despite the challenging environment, we remained resilient and resolute  in our commitment to embed sustainability into the heart of our business.  We advanced commitments to becoming a climate-positive company  by converting the first of many sites to climate-neutral production. We  reduced waste by using more recycled packaging material with help from  partners like Plastic Bank, which turns plastic waste into Social Plastic\\u00ae  for product packaging. And we elevated sustainable financing by  launching a \\u201cSustainable Finance Framework,\\u201d tying company financing  to transparent ESG criteria.  Beyond this, we also reinvigorated our culture by defining a new com- pany purpose: Pioneers at heart for the good of generations. It is built  from our roots and carries our long-standing legacy of innovation,  responsibility, and sustainability into the future. This lies at the center  of Henkel\\u2019s strategic framework \\u201cPurposeful Growth,\\u201d our formula for  success in the current decade. With these achievements in mind, we also spent the last year developing  our sustainability strategy \\u2013 how can we be faster, bolder, and go further?  We want to drive the sustainability transformation towards a regenerative  planet and thriving communities, acting as a trusted partner to our  stakeholders. We pushed ourselves to define our roadmap beyond our  2025 targets and shape new ambitions for 2030 and beyond.  Looking ahead, we are well prepared: sustainability is deeply anchored  in our business strategy and alive in our purpose. With that foundation,  our sustainable transformation continues \\u2013 because a true pioneer is never  finished and continuously seeks out the next frontier! On behalf of everyone at Henkel, I would like to thank you for your interest  in our 2021 Sustainability Report.

This spirit is deeply  anchored in our DNA, and it drives our success story of innovation,  responsibility and sustainability into the future. Henkel AG & Co. KGaA is operationally active as well as being the parent  company of the Henkel Group. In this capacity, it is responsible for  defining and pursuing the company\\u2019s goals. It is also responsible for the  management, governance and control systems, including risk manage- ment, as well as the allocation of resources. Henkel AG & Co. KGaA   performs its responsibilities within the legal scope afforded to it as part  of the Henkel Group, with the affiliated companies otherwise operating  as legally independent entities. Operational management and control is  the responsibility of the Management Board of Henkel Management AG  in its function as sole Personally Liable Partner. The Management Board  is supported in this by the central corporate functions.  Henkel is organized into three operational business units: Adhesive  Technologies, Beauty Care, and Laundry & Home Care.  Adhesive Technologies offers a broad and globally leading portfolio of  high-impact solutions in adhesives, sealants and functional coatings.  The business unit is composed of four business areas: Automotive &  Metals, Packaging & Consumer Goods, Electronics & Industrials, and  Craftsmen, Construction & Professional.  The Beauty Care business unit is globally active in the consumer goods  business area with hair cosmetics, body care, skin care and oral care  products. It is also active in the professional hair salon business world- wide. We hold leading positions in numerous markets and categories  in both business areas.  The Laundry & Home Care business unit occupies leading market positions  in both its Laundry and Home Care business areas. Our product portfolio  ranges from heavy-duty and specialty detergents, laundry additives,  dishwashing products, hard surface and WC cleaners, to air fresheners  and insect control products.  The business activities of our three business units are supported by the  central functions of Henkel AG & Co. KGaA, our Global Supply Chain  organization and our Global Business Solutions organization, with its  Shared Service Centers. This enables the optimum utilization of corporate  network synergies.  Implementation of the business activities at the country and regional  level is the responsibility of the national affiliated companies. Their  operations are supported and coordinated by regional centers. The   executive bodies of these national affiliates manage their businesses  in line with the relevant statutory regulations, supplemented by their  own articles of association, internal procedural rules and the principles  incorporated in our globally applicable management standards, codes  and guidelines. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  06 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE BUSINESS MODEL VALUE ADDED STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  VALUE ADDED Henkel\\u2019s innovative products and solutions create value in its business  units for its stakeholders \\u2013 across the entire value chain. We operate  174 production sites in 56 countries worldwide, invest in research and  development, maintain close cooperation with our suppliers, and con- tribute to economic development in our target markets. As an employer,  we  create jobs in industrial countries, as well as in emerging and devel- oping economies, and we generate purchasing power through wages  and  salaries. The taxes and levies we pay help to finance communities  and support public infrastructure. Value added statement 2021  The value added statement shows that most of the generated sales flow  back into the global economy. The largest share of the value added \\u2013  60.2 percent \\u2013 went to our employees in the form of salary and pension  benefits. Central and local governments received 9.8 percent in the  form of tax revenues; lenders received 1.6 percent in the form of interest  income.

This makes us an important local employer and business partner.  The issue of the social added value of products is especially important in  emerging markets. Products that are geared to the needs of lower income  groups have more than just economic potential. They also make positive  contributions to social well-being, for example to hygiene and health in  the home. In order to meet needs that differ greatly around the world, we  pursue different strategies depending on the market situation.

STRATEGY  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  09  SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY  Responsibility for people, planet and society Our corporate purpose defines the common ground that unites all of us at  Henkel: Pioneers at heart for the good of generations. With our pioneering  spirit, our knowledge, our products and technologies, we want to enrich  and improve the lives of billions every day and shape a viable future for  the next generations. Sustainable business practices have been an integral  part of our    company culture for decades, and are also a central element  of our vision of the future.  Our sustainability strategy is inspired by our purpose. We will actively  drive the transformation to a sustainable economy and society, help to  protect and regenerate the natural environment, contribute to strong  communities and to strengthen trust with our stakeholders. Together with innovation and digitalization, sustainability is at the  heart of our corporate strategy (   \\u201cPurposeful Growth\\u201d agenda) to shape  competitive edge and enable us to grow our company and create value  for our customers, consumers and all of our stakeholders. Transformation towards sustainable development At Henkel, we see sustainability as a constant endeavor to make progress  on present topics and keep learning about new issues, based on scientific  knowledge. Global climate change is one of the greatest challenges  humanity is facing today, requiring urgent and ambitious action. It is  also critical to protect and regenerate life-support systems like forests,  water and  biodiversity, for present and future generations. At the same  time, we are seeing global poverty and social inequality increase, in part  because of the COVID-19 pandemic. And in the process, we acknowledge  that companies like Henkel play a role in meeting these challenges and  bringing about transformational change.  \\u201c Our corporate purpose  describes our ambition to  act for the good of present  and future generations.   With the help of our new  sustainability strategy, we  will accelerate our trans\\u00ad formation and evolve our   portfolio and processes   even more strongly towards  sustainability.\\u201d CARSTEN KNOBEL Chair of the Management Board HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  10 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY MATERIAL ISSUES TARGETS AND AMBITIONS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGS TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  This is a collective undertaking. For several years now, our customers,  partners and consumers have expressed an increasing interest in   sustainability-oriented products and solutions. They are looking to  understand and track sustainability contributions along the value chain.  Investors are also placing increasing emphasis on the sustainability of  their investments. The issue of corporate responsibility is gaining further  importance in media reporting, as is the discussion of sustainability  issues on public platforms such as social networks. In addition, at the  political level, we have seen great progress toward a shared understanding  of global priorities over the past few years, most notably the global   climate agreement in Paris in 2015 and the climate summit in Glasgow in  2021, as well as the    17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Global  awareness of issues such as climate change, the circular economy,  human rights, and the management of water and biodiversity are on the  rise. This underscores the urgency of a comprehensive transformation  towards sustainable development.  We will build on our particular strengths, such as the innovation of our  business units, the outstanding knowledge of our employees, as well as  various contact points of our products and technologies with customers  and consumers. We see our company as an important player and partner  in society, and we intend to work with others to create fundamental change. Three dimensions of our strategy Building on our previous strategy, we developed our \\u2192 2030+ Sustain- ability Ambition Framework in 2021 encompassing three dimensions:   \\u2022 Regenerative Planet: We want to enable a circular and net-zero carbon  future by transforming our business, products and raw materials  underpinned by science and innovation.  \\u2022 Thriving Communities: We want to help people lead a better life  through the collective strength of our business and brands by   supporting equity, education and wellbeing.  \\u2022 Trusted Partner: We want to drive performance and systems change  with integrity through our values-based culture, deep rooting in science  and our passion for technology. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  11 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY MATERIAL ISSUES TARGETS AND AMBITIONS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGS TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Levers for change We also defined how we aim to make progress across our value chain by  defining three key levers to achieve systemic change:  \\u2022 Products and technologies are at the heart of everything we do. We  create more value for our customers and consumers by constantly  innovating to offer  better performance with a reduced ecological foot- print.  \\u2022 People are the focal point for our business and our sustainability-  related activities. This includes our employees, who contribute to   sustainable development \\u2013 through their expertise in daily work and  in their private lives. It also includes the people in our supply chain,  our  customers and consumers, our neighbors, our shareholders and  the communities we operate in.  \\u2022 Partnerships play a decisive role in driving sustainability in our value  chain and beyond. We help our customers and consumers to reduce  their ecological footprint and to use resources responsibly. We work  together with our suppliers to promote sustainable practice and  respect for human rights, and we cooperate with partners to share  knowledge and drive systemic solutions forward together. Our targets and ambitions Our new sustainability strategy revolves around implementing our   ambitions through concrete measures and projects to achieve practical  progress. We will build on the success of recent years and our medium-  term targets for 2025 and beyond, \\u2192 for which we provide detailed  information in this Sustainability Report. With our \\u2192 2030+ Sustainability Ambition Framework, we have developed  new long-term ambitions in the three dimensions of \\u2192 \\u201cRegenerative  Planet,\\u201d \\u2192 \\u201cThriving Communities\\u201d and \\u2192 \\u201cTrusted Partner\\u201d to drive  further progress.  We have robust plans and investments in place to advance on our sustain- ability transformation. We expect to continue to develop our strategic  framework, responding with agility to stakeholder expectations, new  scientific insights and emerging issues.

These include aspects such as the environment,  employee and social topics, respecting human rights, and combating  corruption and bribery. These topics and others are also reflected in the  international    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For the develop- ment of our sustainability strategy and the definition of the related targets  and ambitions, we engage in dialog with the Management Board and  form working groups that act under the guidance of the \\u2192 Sustainability  Council. In these groups, we evaluate trends and developments, while  also reviewing the expectations of our stakeholders and analyzing our  environmental footprint along the value chain. Engaging in dialog with stakeholders to gain new perspectives \\u2192 Dialog with our stakeholders helps us to obtain insights and per- spectives from inside and outside our company, and fosters a common  understanding of expectations and priorities. In 2021, we conducted a  comprehensive survey of our stakeholders. We have also engaged in dialog  with opinion leaders, the professional public, academia, international  rating agencies and analysts for many years. Sustainability analysts and  professional institutions regularly evaluate how companies manage the  economic, environmental and social aspects of their business activities. We  welcome these \\u2192 external assessments of our sustainability performance,  as they lead to greater transparency in the market and show us how  our performance is assessed. We also consider the assessment criteria  of various financial and sustainability-oriented ratings and the guidelines  of the Global Reporting Initiative (\\u2192 GRI). Identifying relevant topics To determine and categorize relevant topics for our business activities  and reporting, we engage in a continuous process of recording and   evaluating the challenges and opportunities of sustainable development  using various tools. We assess the importance of the topics for the   company, environment and society, and also for our stakeholders. When  selecting the topics, we go beyond the definition of materiality included  within the CSR Directive Implementation Act (\\u201cCSR-RUG\\u201d) in conjunction  with Sections (\\u00a7\\u00a7) 289b to 289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB).  The results of this process can be broken down into the three dimensions  of Regenerative Planet, Thriving Communities and Trusted Partner, each  with three themes that we identified in a materiality analysis. In these  nine topic areas, we want to drive sustainable development around the  world and along the value chain with our business activities.

To assess  our footprint, we use representative \\u2192 life cycle appraisals across all  product categories. We also assess data on the raw materials and packaging  materials we use, as well as the transport operations.  This enables us to identify hot spots as fields of action that are most   relevant to sustainability for the company as well as for every product  category and specific products on the basis of scientific measurement  methods. Viewed across our entire portfolio, improvements in input  materials and in the use phase are the decisive factors when it comes to  our water and \\u2192 CO2 footprints. We systematically integrate the assessment tools and findings into our  \\u2192 innovation process. By combining product performance and quality  with responsibility for people and the environment, we strive for all  of our new products to make a contribution to sustainable development. Definition of targets and roadmaps for implementation  Based on this assessment and our priorities, we have set specific targets  for 2025 and beyond as well as additional long-term ambitions that  will help transform the economy and society toward sustainability.  Engagement with our stakeholders and the broader framework of our  strategy, which was further developed in 2021, have also revealed new  areas of focus that we will work on together. Some of these ambitions,  such as those related to \\u2192 water resources and \\u2192 biodiversity, are still in  their early stages, and assessment methods are constantly evolving. We  will work with experts and partners to contribute our experience and  develop coordinated action plans. To implement our strategy, we have  also established \\u2192 management systems, standards and guidelines, as  well as related processes and organizational structures that provide a  framework for measures to implement these concepts. We continuously  review our targets and roadmaps for implementation, and develop them  further when necessary.

HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  19 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY MATERIAL ISSUES TARGETS AND AMBITIONS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGS TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGS Achieving the global Sustainable Development  Goals together Henkel supports the implementation of the    17 Sustainable Develop- ment Goals (SDGs) that were adopted by the 193 United Nations Member  States in September 2015. As a company, we are convinced that the goals  provide a shared focus that can empower collaborative action and will  accelerate progress toward sustainability. Sustainable consumption,  packaging and plastics, combating climate change, water, human rights,  equal opportunities and education are important topics for our work.  The following examples highlight our contribution to the implemen- tation of the global development goals and demonstrate the range of our  activities.  By continuously reviewing our company\\u02bcs goals and initiatives, we  ensure that these are aligned with the    SDG priorities that are relevant  for us. Our activities support the SDGs because we have a long history  of working intensively on various aspects of sustainability, as well as  a broad product portfolio and a presence across diverse markets. In the  context of our social commitment, for example, we track the percentage  of projects we support that contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Committed to protecting the climate  In view of the urgent need to reduce CO2 emissions, it is our long-term  vision to become \\u2192 climate-positive in production by 2030 and to make  progress in further relevant parts of our value chain. On the way, we plan  to achieve a 65-percent reduction in the carbon footprint of our production  by 2025. We also want to obtain 100 percent of our electricity from  renewable sources by 2030. In addition, we want to leverage our \\u2192 brands  and technologies to help our customers, consumers and suppliers save  100 million metric tons of CO2 in the period from 2016 to 2025. Promoting sustainable   consumption We support the goal of promoting sustainable and resource-efficient   consumption. Our products and technologies are key to this because they  are used in millions of households and industrial processes every day. We  focus on developing products that lead to resource efficiency in everyday  use. We also strive to encourage responsible use of our products through  targeted communication. This is important because the environmental  footprint of many of our products is determined during the use phase.  The    Henkel footprint calculator helps individuals to calculate their  CO2 footprint.

Improving quality of life  With our social engagement activities, we aim to support people around  the globe and improve their quality of life. For example, the volunteer  efforts by our employees have provided support for social projects in   Guatemala, in cooperation with the organization    United Way Worldwide.  The focus is on education, financial stability and health. Our \\u2192 corporate   citizenship has been an integral part of our corporate culture ever since  the  company was established by Fritz Henkel in 1876. Turning waste into opportunities  It is our continuous ambition to reduce the flow of plastic waste into  nature, especially into the oceans. In 2017, Henkel became the first major  global consumer goods company to work with the social enterprise  \\u2192 Plastic Bank. In 2019, we extended this partnership for another five  years. The aim is to reduce plastic waste in nature, including the oceans,  while also providing new opportunities for people in poverty \\u2013 especially  in countries with no or insufficient recycling infrastructure for waste   disposal. We plan to steadily expand this commitment in the coming years.  Promoting sustainable   palm oil As part of our responsibility, we aim to support sustainable practices in the  palm oil industry along the entire value chain. By supporting \\u2192 sustainable  palm (kernel) oil, we contribute to sustainable forest management and  prevent deforestation. Collaboration with representatives from across the  industry is at the heart of our approach. We aim to increase the availability  of sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil on the market, for example,  through collaborative projects that enable \\u2192 smallholder farmers to certify  their crops as sustainable, increase productivity and improve their livelihoods. Providing access to good education   We aim to promote access to high-quality education and increase the number  of young people and adults with relevant abilities and skills. \\u2192 Schwarzkopf\\u02bcs  Million Chances initiative was launched in 2016 to support women and  girls in building a successful future for themselves. The long- running  project Shaping Futures gives young people the opportunity to gain   professional training in basic hairdressing techniques. Henkel is also the  main sponsor of the \\u2192 Teach First Deutschland initiative. In this way, we   support the commitment of university graduates who, as additional teachers,  support children in schools in socially disadvantaged  communities.

Henkel systematically anchors \\u2192 sustainability assessment criteria in  its innovation process to manage product development in line with  our sustainability strategy right from the start. In 2021, we employed  an average of around 2,600 people in research and development, and  invested 504 million euros in these activities.  Sustainability is a central pillar of the innovation strategies of the   Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care consumer goods businesses.  They place particular focus on developing their product portfolios using  resource-efficient technologies with sustainable packaging solutions  and optimized ingredients, and are driving the expansion of sustainable  brands such as Love Nature,    Pro Nature,    Nature Box or    N.A.E.  (Naturale Antica Erboristeria) with a holistic approach.  Our Adhesive Technologies business unit combines technical material  expertise and science-based innovation to support our industrial   customers and business partners in achieving their sustainability goals.  Customized solutions help to increase energy and material efficiency,  recycle valuable resources and improve safety during the manufacturing  and use phases, as well as for end users. Contribution of our product portfolio to  sustainability  Our business units \\u2013 Laundry & Home Care, Beauty Care and Adhesive  Technologies \\u2013 are responsible for adapting our \\u2192 sustainability strategy  to their operating needs. They align their brands and technologies to  sustainability in line with the specific challenges of their product portfolio.  They also work on sustainable products and tomorrow\\u2019s key technologies.  Achieving our ambitious new \\u2192 targets means integrating sustainability  even more closely into our brand and business strategies in the future. Our goal is to transform our company and our product portfolio sustain- ably so that we can stand at the side of our stakeholders as a reliable  partner. We strive to ensure that each new product contributes to   sustainability. We also intend to provide our customers and consumers  with a comprehensive sustainability profile of our products by 2025.  Our aim is to offer increasingly better solutions, products and services  that also have a positive impact on the environment and society, and  therefore make a positive contribution to value.   504 million euros in  research and  development around 2,600 employees in research   and development HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  24 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Promoting sustainable consumption Our products are used millions of times a day in households and indus- trial processes. This is why we concentrate on developing products that  enable resources such as energy and water to be used efficiently during  everyday life. Our aim is to help our customers and consumers save \\u2192 CO2  through our products and expertise. Through targeted communication,  we also strive to encourage responsible-minded behavior while using  our products. This is especially important because the use phase accounts  for up to 90 percent of the environmental footprint of many of our  products. The importance of the use phase is also shown in the    Henkel  footprint calculator. It shows that not only companies, but also each  individual can make a contribution to greater sustainability through  their behavior.  To promote sustainable consumption, Henkel partnered with cosmetics  companies Unilever, LVMH, L\\u2019Or\\u00e9al and Natura to establish an    Eco  Beauty Score Consortium in September 2021. The goal is to develop an  industry- wide system for assessing the environmental impact of cosmetic  products to make it easier for consumers to make sustainable shopping  decisions. This approach, which is based on the latest research, is  designed to take into account the entire product life cycle. We also have  plans to create a database of standard cosmetic ingredients and their  environmental impact. up to 90\\u2009% of the environmental footprint of our   products is generated during their use Developments in Laundry & Home Care Our clear vision in our Laundry & Home Care business unit is: \\u201cTogether  Creating a Cleaner World\\u201d. We believe that our team, our customers,  and our suppliers have to innovate together to provide better solutions,  products and services \\u2013 and to create value for consumers and society.  We focus on resource-efficient technologies, innovative    products,  and optimized \\u2192 packaging and ingredients to maximize cleaning   performance. In 2021, Laundry & Home Care made significant progress in promoting a  circular economy. Our    partnership with Plastic Bank and the use of  Social Plastic\\u00ae in much of our product packaging contributes to our  commitment to prevent plastic waste in nature while improving living  conditions for people in poverty. The bottle body of the limited edition  Pril dishwashing product is made from 100 percent Social Plastic\\u00ae and  the bottle cap is now made from 84 percent recycled material. We also  promote the circular economy in the selection of our ingredients. In  partnership with BASF, we have succeeded in transforming vegan bio- mass from agricultural waste into active ingredients, which we use in  our Love Nature laundry and dishwashing detergents.  In addition to the ongoing portfolio transformation and innovation strat- egies in sustainability, Henkel acquired a leading provider of sustainable  homecare solutions,    Swania SAS, based in Nanterre, France, in July  2021. This acquisition expanded Laundry & Home Care\\u2019s position in the  market for sustainable laundry and home care products. Our sustainable  brand portfolio now includes strong sustainable brands such as Maison  Verte (   EU Ecolabel certified) and the vegan brand You (   ECOCERT  labeled), which appeals to a young, tech-savvy target audience.

This includes the relaunch of our    Fa brand, with shower product   formulas that consist on average of 94 percent ingredients of natural  origin (including water; calculated according to the ISO standard). All of  the products for men and a large number of the Fa shower products for  women now also have transparent packaging. This optimizes recyclability  and supports the circular economy. The transparent bottle bodies are  made of 100 percent recycled PET (excluding the cap), 25 percent of  which is Social Plastic\\u00ae. The caps have also been modified and use  10 percent less plastic than before.  While recycling remains an important consideration in terms of sustain- ability, refill solutions are also becoming more important. Refill packs  for products from our ECOCERT-certified natural cosmetics brands     N.A.E. and    Nature Box have been available in stores since 2021. We  also offer refill packs for some Fa shower gel and liquid soap products.  These refill packs hold the contents of two shower gel bottles. The refill  packs can, when disposed of correctly, be recycled. Their manufacture  requires around three-quarters less plastic than bottles of the same  capacity.  Refill packs are just one component of the sustainability commitment of  our hair and body care brand Nature Box. It is the first consumer goods  brand worldwide to use Social Plastic\\u00ae as a packaging material for its  entire bottle portfolio. All bottle bodies are made of 100 percent recycled  plastic. These liquid products have been supplemented since 2021 by  solid conditioners in recyclable packaging made of FSC-certified paper,  in addition to solid shampoos and shower care products. Nature Box  combines high standards of production and quality with a long-term  sense of responsibility. For this reason, the brand\\u2019s team collaborates  with the international development organization    Solidaridad and the  specialty chemicals company Solvay. It supports smallholders in the   sustainable farming of guar and palm kernel oil, both feedstock materials  used to make ingredients found in this product range.  The    Syoss brand is another example of the sustainable transformation  of our product portfolio. Following the comprehensive relaunch of our  hair care lines in 2020, we launched a new generation of hair sprays in  2021. Syoss Compressed Micro Sprays in 200 ml format are only half  the size of conventional products that can be used the same number  of times. This means that less aluminum and propellant gas are used,  reducing the spray\\u2019s environmental footprint. The reduced weight and  volume during transport also results in lower CO2 emissions.

We develop customized technological solutions for  this. Even though our products typically make up only a small proportion  of the end product, they can be a relevant factor that help our  customers  achieve their sustainability goals. We analyze the sustainability contribution of our products during  product development and systematically evaluate the contribution  of our existing    portfolio. This transparency has allowed us to anchor   sustainability as an integral part of our strategic orientation while   forming the basis for aligning our business for the challenges of the  future and  identifying the most important levers we can use to con- tribute to solving global challenges.   \\u2022 Our products conserve resources by promoting the efficient use of  energy and materials. They also help cut emissions in production and  application, for example, by using electrically conductive adhesives  from the    LOCTITE\\u00ae ABLESTIK range to make solar panels more   productive. These technologies and others can also be found in our  CO2-saving portfolio.   \\u2022 Our solutions ensure that valuable resources are kept in the cycle. We  do this by using renewable raw materials in production, and by   promoting the reuse and recycling of materials at the end of their life  cycle. For example, we use    LOCTITE\\u00ae LIOFOL coatings for solutions  that can be fully recycled with paper without affecting the quality of  the recycled material.   \\u2022 We are committed to continuously optimizing the safety of our  products  while going beyond legal requirements and working actively to  avoid substances of concern. Our    TECHNOMELT\\u00ae PUR adhesives,  for example, have been developed to contain a particularly low   proportion of isocyanates.  We also strive to use our broad market access to put innovative approaches  into practice across industries: for example, the use of renewable carbon  sources through the mass balance principle. This is a transparent model  for tracking the amount of certified and non-certified material along  the entire production process.

Risk management as a prevention tool Group-wide risk management also makes an indispensable contribution  to our strategic focus on sustainability and enables us to identify potential  risks and business opportunities at an early stage. As part of the non-  financial reporting process, a risk analysis has been conducted in line  with the concepts and processes for risk mitigation that are described  in this report. During this analysis of our own operations, our business  relationships, our products and our services, no material risks were  identified that meet, or will meet, the criteria of \\u201chaving severe  negative  consequences\\u201d and \\u201cbeing very probable\\u201d according to the definition  set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of section 289c, as well as section 315c of the  German Commercial Code (HGB).

The Henkel   Management Board bears overall responsibility for our sustainability  strategy and for the compliance organization in order to ensure that   legislation and internal guidelines are observed.  Sustainability Council  Chaired by Sylvie Nicol, Chief Human Resources Officer, the Sustainability  Council is the central decision-making body for our global sustainability  activities. On behalf of senior management, the committee performs  coordination, initiative and control functions in relation to sustain- ability issues. These include strategic topics as well as issues that are  operationally relevant, such as climate change and its effects, human  rights,  sustainable products and technologies, packaging, product safety  and management systems. The Sustainability Council sets up project  groups to deal with sustainability topics, and monitors the results. It also  handles cross-departmental projects and regularly monitors the extent  to which sustainability targets are met. This includes the progress of  our climate- related corporate targets and initiatives, for example. The Sustainability Council is made up of top managers from all of the   business units and functions of the company. It normally meets six  times a year. In addition, the members take decisions on matters as  required during the year.  Management systems govern our structures and processes  Globally uniform standards for Safety, Health, and Environment (SHE),  together with integrated management systems, provide the basis for our  worldwide optimization programs. Our SHE Standards and our Social  Standards apply to all sites. Our management systems ensure that these  standards are implemented consistently across our global production  network and at all sites. This is based on the continuous training of our  employees.  We carry out \\u2192 regular audits at our production and administration sites,  and at our subcontractors and logistics centers, to verify compliance  with our codes and standards. All audit results, including the monitoring  of our SHE and Social Standards, are included in the Internal Audit  department\\u2019s annual report to the Henkel Management Board. We have  our management systems externally certified at the site level wherever  this is expected and recognized by our partners in the respective markets.

For example, they develop appropriate supplier   manage ment tools or systems for measuring greenhouse gas emissions.  Key  sustainability topics for Henkel are coordinated by a specialist  unit that reports directly to the Management Board and which serves as  the  company-wide interface for sustainability. Ulrike Sapiro, Chief   Corporate Sustainability Officer, has been head of this specialist unit  since May 1, 2021.  Management conferences and specialist committees  In addition to the central role of the Sustainability Council and the  interaction between the various units and functions, international   management conferences and the sharing of information in specialist  committees form an important basis for the ongoing development of  Henkel\\u2019s  sustainability policy. These meetings deal with new scientific  findings, practical experience, changes in laws and regulations, and  other current topics. The objective is to initiate new projects within  Henkel, as well as to further develop approaches to solving problems  and to encourage employees to share their experiences with one another. Business units  The business units (Adhesive Technologies, Beauty Care and Laundry &  Home Care) are also responsible for adapting our sustainability strategy  to their operating needs, as well as providing the resources needed for  its implementation. They align their brands and technologies, and  the sites involved, to sustainability in line with the specific challenges  and priorities of their product portfolio. The research and development  departments of our three business units work on key technologies and  supply the basis for tomorrow\\u2019s sustainable products. Regional and national companies  Managers in the regional and national companies steer the implemen- tation of Henkel standards and compliance with legal requirements in  their respective regions. With the support of the corporate functions and  the operating business units, they develop an implementation strategy  appropriate to the individual sites and their local circumstances.

Footprint across the entire value chain We use representative life cycle appraisals for all product categories to  assess our footprint along the entire value chain. We also assess data  covering the raw ingredients and packaging materials we use, as well as  relevant transport operations. We have assessed more than 99 percent of  our annual sales through life cycle appraisals: more than 67 percent has  been evaluated through representative life cycle analyses and about  32 percent through simplified life cycle appraisals. In this way, we ensure  validated greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting along the value chain.   In preparing life cycle analyses, we use our own primary data as well  as data from our partners along the supply chain. If such data is not  available, we draw on secondary data from existing databases of life cycle  analyses, average values, and emission factors. To further develop metrics  and indicators, we collaborate with external partners on topics such  as product carbon footprints and water footprints. We also participate  in international initiatives such as the    Sustainability Consortium  and the    Consumer Goods Forum\\u2019s Measurement Group. We are also  over 99\\u2009% of annual sales is covered   through life cycle appraisals Measurement and evaluation over the entire   life cycle  We use a variety of methods and tools to assess our progress across the  entire company and our value chain. We are continuously developing  these methods and tools, which include trend and market analyses, as  well as the evaluation of ratings and life-cycle analyses. In addition to  the achievement of our \\u2192 sustainability targets, we continuously review  our management processes and optimize them where needed. This  includes measures in the areas of environmental protection and occupa- tional safety, technical developments and process optimization to  reduce resource consumption and costs. These measures are supported  and implemented by our three business units, as well as our regional  and national companies and our corporate functions. Together, they  contribute to the achievement of our sustainability targets. Our innovation process employs a variety of tools to systematically analyze,  measure and evaluate our products. Hot spots can be identified as fields  of action that are most relevant to sustainability for every product category  on the basis of scientific measurement methods. Our researchers have  to identify the points in the value chain and the strategic areas in which  the product offers concrete advantages. Each product receives a separate  sustainability profile based on this data. To make it easier to optimize  our products while they are being developed, we integrate the environ- mental profiles of possible raw ingredients and packaging materials into  the information systems of our product and packaging development  teams. This allows the footprint of a new formulation to be calculated as  early as the development phase. Our three business units also collaborate  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  32 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  involved in standardizing the methodology for calculating footprints and  the associated data exchange for all participants in the automotive value  chain as part of the    \\u201cCatena-X Automotive Network\\u201d. In addition, we have further developed our \\u201cEasyLCA\\u201d software tool  for the fast calculation of CO2 footprints for product formulations. This  is a quick way to make the footprint of formulations transparent for  decision-making processes during the product development process.  In order to measure the contribution of individual products to climate  protection, experiments are being carried out worldwide to measure  product carbon footprints. Unlike complete life cycle analyses, this  involves determining only the climate-relevant greenhouse gas emissions  throughout the value chain of a product \\u2013 from the purchase of the raw  materials through to production, use and disposal. However, until now  there has been no standardized method for determining the carbon foot- print of a product. For this reason, Henkel participates in pilot projects  in the USA and Europe with the aim of driving forward the development  of a reliable and internationally harmonized method of determining   carbon footprints. Sustainability assessment by our business units In collaboration with the European Commission and various stakeholders,  in 2014 the Europe-based International Association for Soaps, Detergents  and Maintenance Products (Wasch-, Pflege- und Reinigungsmittelverband     A.I.S.E.) launched a pilot project on the Product Environmental Footprint  (PEF) of heavy-duty liquid detergents for machine applications to reduce  the overall footprint of products. Henkel, represented by the Laundry &  Home Care business unit, was joined in the project by other companies,  national industry associations, and the external organizations    CESIO,     Global Standards 1,    SGS, the    Sustainability Consortium, the     Swiss Federal Office for the Environment, and the    Technical  University of Berlin. The pilot project resulted in the publication of  rules based on product categories and life cycles. This is the first method  based on a harmonized and transparent life cycle assessment throughout  Europe. However, it is not yet sufficiently mature at the current stage of  development to allow accurate product comparisons, as LCA science  is still evolving. For example, some impact assessment methods are  not yet ready to be applied to comparative, detailed assessment at the  product level or to market communication. However, they are useful for  reviewing, prioritizing, and managing the eco-design of products within  the  company. We  support A.I.S.E.\\u2019s objective of integrating a harmonized  PEF method into the product assessment of the long-standing    \\u201cCharter  for Sustainable Cleaning\\u201d. This method had been in place since 2006  and is regularly updated.

As part  of this effort, in 2021, with the help of cross-departmental innovation  teams in Laundry & Home Care, we laid the foundations for developing  a country-specific consumer app based on the latest scientific research.  This internal pilot project has made it possible for us to compare different  third-party assessments with our own data. This provides valuable  insights for our product development. We initially began with new  health criteria, but we are also taking into account criteria relating  to the environment and product performance. Our Beauty Care business unit has calculated the environmental foot- print of more than 200,000 product formulas over the past six years.  Each formula comes with a compact sustainability report that clearly  summarizes relevant categories, such as carbon footprint, biodegrad- ability, data on ingredients of natural origin (according to the ISO 16128  standard developed for cosmetic products), as well as their proportion  of the overall product formula. There is also a database that provides  sustainability data for all relevant raw materials. This makes it possible to  compare the sustainability profiles of specific raw materials. At all times,  the standardized methodology, the comparability of the reports and the  raw material properties provide our developers with easy access to infor- mation about how our formulas contribute to sustainability, as well as  full transparency about potential optimization approaches for a reduced  overall footprint. Our Adhesive Technologies business unit has introduced an internal  portfolio assessment process to analyze the sustainability contribution  of our portfolio. By integrating this assessment into our strategic  management and product development, we are able to sustainably align  our portfolio based on the latest scientific facts. The assessment criteria cover different dimensions of sustainability  and were determined on the basis of a customer-oriented approach.  They focus on CO2 reduction and energy efficiency, the circular economy,  health and safety, water conservation and quality across the value chain.  A systematic and fact-based approach means that appropriate supporting  documentation must be available for all products with a contribution  that is judged to be significant. We have trained more than 900 employees from our Adhesive Technologies  business unit in the implementation of this portfolio assessment process  since it was developed.

The survey confirmed that  our  target groups place great importance on our efforts to integrate sustain- ability into all of our activities and product life cycles, and that they also  have a strong focus on the environmental impacts that occur during the  individual phases of our products\\u2019 life cycles. The sustainability topics our  stakeholders particularly prioritize are \\u2192 materials and waste, \\u2192 energy  and climate, and \\u2192 water and wastewater. A  special focus is also placed  on the \\u2192 mental health and well-being of employees. Our stakeholders  consider Henkel to be well positioned in addressing these key issues.  Another result of the survey was that Henkel is perceived as a reliable  partner by 87 percent of the stakeholders. This is due to our commitment  to high industry standards, our clarity of direction, our reliability and  competence, and last but not least, our employees.  We are in close dialog with our stakeholders on a continuous basis. The  following overview shows a current selection of the main dialog formats  and activities, as well as the expectations placed on our company.  Additional information on collaboration and partnerships can be found  on our    website. 87\\u2009% of our stakeholders consider  us to be a reliable partner around 700 stakeholders  surveyed STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT Dialog with our stakeholders Understanding the social demands that stakeholders of all kinds place  on our company is a key component of our \\u2192 sustainability management.  This includes our customers, consumers, suppliers, business partners,  employees, shareholders, investors, neighbors and  local communities,  associations and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), academia,  as well as politicians and government authorities.  To better understand the expectations and perspectives of our stakeholders  and to engage in dialog that is more targeted and solution-oriented, we  make use of specific surveys and continuously monitor the opinions  at several levels: in direct dialog, in multi-stakeholder initiatives, and  through dialog platforms. Cooperation with NGOs and opinion leaders  gives us insights into global challenges and enables us to respond to issues  at an early stage. Stakeholder  dialog is a key element of our approaches to  innovation and risk management, and helps us to  continuously develop  our sustainability strategy and reporting.  Stakeholder survey confirms Henkel as a reliable partner In 2021, we once again conducted a comprehensive survey of our stake- holders to identify which topics have priority for them and to map the  current expectations of the various stakeholder groups as part of the  development of our \\u2192 sustainability strategy. Another aim was to obtain  a clear picture of our international sustainability reputation.

For many of our employees, this includes   regular dialog with stakeholders \\u2013 both on specific topics and on sustain- ability in general. Experts at our various company sites and in our  business units engage in discussion with relevant stakeholder groups  on specific local and regional challenges. This allows us to develop  customized concepts and solutions that can be implemented and  assessed effectively. In 2021, as in each year, Henkel employees met with  politicians, scientists and scholars, businesspeople and members of the  public. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many events were again held in  virtual formats to protect the participants.   \\u2022 Sustainable packaging and the circular economy were key topics of  discussion at many stakeholder dialog events in 2021. In November  2021, Henkel invited key stakeholders from the packaging and consumer  goods industry to the    \\u201cSustainability Days 2021\\u201d. By bringing  together the entire value chain in the field of packaging and consumer  goods, Henkel has established a strong platform for discussions and  solutions for current and upcoming topics \\u2013 from circular economy  and energy saving to health and safety and many more. The business  fields this year will include end of line packaging and labeling, flexible  packaging, paper solutions, tapes and labels and \\u2013 for the first time \\u2013  personal hygiene.   \\u2022 Recyclable packaging and  sustainable product applications were also  addressed in April 2021 at the \\u201cBetter Future Conference \\u2013 Sustainability,\\u201d  an initiative of WELT AM SONNTAG. In an interview, Carsten Knobel,  Chair of the Management Board, highlighted how Henkel is embedding  sustainability in the company and among consumers.   \\u2022 In May 2021, the    ChangeNOW Summit took place for the fourth time  in a row as an online format in which Henkel France was a partner.  ChangeNOW is one of the world\\u2019s most important innovation platforms  and brings together a large number of actors from various sectors,  all committed to promote sustainable development. At this event,   representatives from Henkel and the social enterprise    Plastic Bank  discussed the challenges of the circular economy.  \\u2022 In the digital Futuretalk, hosted by the Futurewoman initiative, Henkel  representatives discussed with other experts the extent to which plastic  can be part of the solution for greater sustainability and where concrete  action is needed.   \\u2022 Another focus was the discussion on diversity and inclusion. At a  panel discussion during the \\u201cBetter Future Conference \\u2013 Diversity\\u201d of  WELT AM SONNTAG in November 2021, Sylvie Nicol, Executive Vice  President Human Resources and Chair of the Sustainability Council,  discussed the relevance of an inclusive, strong leadership culture to  promote diversity, equal opportunity and inclusion in the company.

The involvement is an expression of a public commitment on the part  of the participants and their companies.  \\u2022 In November 2021, the    Henkel Xathon, an ideation hackathon for  female founders, took place for the third time. The aim of the hybrid  event was to promote female entrepreneurs and talents in the technology  industry, strengthen their business innovation and support them in  building a relevant business network. It was hosted by Henkel dx  Ventures, Henkel\\u2019s platform for open innovation and collaboration,  together with the initiative Global Digital Women. A key focus this  year was the rapidly accelerating direct-to-consumer (D2C) sector,  influenced by changing consumer behaviors towards hyper-personal- ization across all channels.  \\u2022 Henkel was again a partner of the    German Sustainability Award  in 2021 and took the opportunity to engage with stakeholders on  German Sustainability Day. Ulrike Sapiro, Chief Sustainability Officer  at Henkel, provided insights into how Henkel is actively driving the  transformation to a sustainable economy and society in a plenum on  the topic \\u201cAccelerating Transformation \\u2013 Embracing Challenges as  Opportunities\\u201d. The German Sustainability Award is an initiative of  the Stiftung Deutscher Nachhaltigkeitspreis e. V. in cooperation with  the German Federal Government, the German Council for Sustainable  Development, economic associations, local government associations,  civil society organizations and research institutions.   \\u2022 In November 2021, the annual partnership meeting between the develop- ment organization    Solidaridad and Henkel took place virtually. The  participants discussed cooperation to support \\u2192 smallholders and  local initiatives to promote \\u2192 sustainable palm (kernel) oil. In addition  to the milestones that have already been achieved, the development  of Henkel\\u2019s palm (kernel) oil strategy and future cooperation with  Solidaridad were also discussed. This collaboration will continue to  focus on improving livelihoods for  smallholders. To further scale  up our joint actions, we started developing our Partnership  Theory of  Change in 2021. This framework will help us to define our strategic  actions in the future as well as to define and achieve a concrete impact.

It is supported by integrated management systems  and an organizational structure with clearly defined responsibilities.  The General Counsel & Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the  Chair of the Management Board. He is supported by the Corporate   Compliance Office, our interdisciplinary Compliance & Risk Committee,  and 50 locally appointed compliance officers all over the world. Our   Corporate Data Protection Officer is also part of our Compliance orga- nization. Together, this organization coordinates the flow of information  and helps our employees to implement our requirements locally \\u2013 for  example, through specially adapted training courses. The General  Counsel & Chief Compliance Officer reports any infringements, as well  as the measures taken to deal with them, to the Management Board  and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on a regular basis.  Our internal reporting and complaints channels are supported by a   compliance hotline, which was set up to enable employees to report  infringements of our    Code of Conduct, internal standards, or applicable  laws anonymously. It is run by an independent external provider and is  available globally, allowing both open as well as anonymous reporting.  The hotline and alternative reporting channels are available to employees  and third parties. Focus on communication and training  Since we operate on a global scale, our employees find themselves   working within a variety of legal systems and value systems. Many of  our employees work in countries where, according to surveys by   organizations such as    Transparency International, there is a greater  risk of encountering corrupt practices. The same expectations apply to  all employees at all locations without exception: Henkel strictly opposes  the infringement of laws and standards, and rejects all dishonest business  practices. To impart clear rules of conduct to our employees, and   especially to avoid any conflicts of interest in everyday working situations,  we focus on regular training courses and communication measures. Our  managers play a key role with regard to compliance. Given their position  within the company, they bear a special responsibility to set an example  for their staff. For this reason, all of our managers across the globe must  participate in our mandatory Compliance eLearning program and  attend relevant training courses. The program addresses many different  compliance topics, such as data protection, competition law and anti-  corruption. In 2021, more participants took part in these compliance  training courses (52,471 registered participants) than in previous years.  Zero tolerance for violations of regulations  Improper conduct is never in Henkel\\u2019s interest. The Management Board  and senior management circles at Henkel all subscribe to this fundamental  principle. Improper conduct undermines fair competition and damages  our trustworthiness and reputation. Our employees attach great  importance to a correct and ethically impeccable business environment.

In the course of the  audits, a total of 852 corrective actions were agreed upon. The audits   covered all major units of the company: Sales, Marketing, Purchasing,  Finance, HR, IT, Supply Chain, Operations and SHE. Compliance with  our SHE Standards was audited at 25 sites, resulting in the initiation of  a total of 127 optimization measures. We examined compliance with our  Social Standards in three assessments.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant proportion of our 2021  audits was again conducted using a \\u201cremote audit\\u201d approach. This  requires powerful infrastructure, as well as the digitalization of pro- cesses and documents. Our overall assessment of our experience of  this remote audit approach remains positive, although the effectiveness  and efficiency of the approach is limited in certain audit areas and  when auditing across different time zones. In 2021, SHE audits were in  part supported by third-party vendors to enable on-site audits. All audit results are included in the Corporate Audit department\\u2019s annual  report to the Henkel Management Board and the Audit Committee of the  Supervisory Board. In addition to the regular audits, Corporate Audit also  conducted an assessment of internal control systems. In 2021, Corporate  Audit also trained 3,122 employees worldwide on compliance, risk   management and internal controls, in the course of seminars and  during audits. We react forcefully to violations of laws, codes and standards. Where  necessary, we initiate appropriate disciplinary measures. In 2021, four  employees received written warnings, and 27 contracts were terminated  as a result of conduct violating compliance rules.  Data protection and compliance management systems  Henkel\\u2019s compliance culture involves continuous    monitoring and  improvement of the compliance process. Against this background, our  data protection management system was reviewed and confirmed by  external auditors in 2019 in accordance with the IDW PS 980 auditing  standard \\u2013 with regard to the appropriateness, implementation and  effectiveness of the data protection processes. Henkel has previously  had similar external audits related to competition law and anti-corruption  carried out on several occasions. Results of our audits  The Head of the Corporate Audit department reports directly to the Chair  of the Management Board. We carry out regular audits based on our risk- based audit planning at our production and administration sites, and at  our subcontractors and in logistics centers, to verify  compliance with  our codes and standards.

As a rule,  we respond by critically reviewing the scientific basis of our assessments  with particular care. If this gives rise to reservations about product safety,  and if the scientific data and findings cannot dispel these doubts, we  either avoid using a substance altogether or restrict its use so that it will  still meet our stringent safety criteria.  At the same time, it is becoming increasingly important to enable  consumers to learn about the ingredients contained in our products. In  line with this, we will enhance global transparency about the substances  used and their respective safety. Regular audits are carried out to verify compliance with corporate product  safety requirements and procedures. The business units are responsible  for the implementation of the respective measures.  PRODUCT SAFETY Product responsibility as an important lever   for sustainability Our customers and consumers should be able to rest assured that our  products are safe when used as intended. All raw materials and finished  products are subjected to numerous assessments and tests to ensure a  high level of safety during production, use and disposal. This is based on  ensuring compliance with statutory requirements and more extensive     Henkel standards.  Our product developers and    product safety experts assess ingredients  according to the latest scientific findings and safety data. They   continuously track Henkel products on the market and incorporate the  insights gained into the assessments. We follow a risk-based approach  in accordance with scientific standards when assessing the consumer  safety and environmental compatibility of materials and products. A  key step in this assessment process is that, in addition to the safe  concentration for using a substance, we also determine the extent to  which humans or the environment are exposed to it. Since exceeding  the safe concentration for use may result in a risk to humans and / or  the environment, we restrict the use of the substance in these cases to   relatively low concentrations and / or certain product categories. In   individual cases, this can also lead to a substance not being used at all.

This looks at the properties of the individual ingredients,  their concentrations in the product and the conditions under which the  product will be used. Products for use on the human body are additionally  evaluated dermatologically. The results of these evaluations and assess- ments then form the basis for defining the required precautionary and  protective measures for safe use of the product. These measures are   specifically adapted as appropriate, taking account of whether the product  is to be used by consumers or industrial professionals, and can range  from package design features, through to detailed instructions and  warnings, or restrictions regarding use.  Controversially discussed ingredients  Scientists and the general public often take different views regarding the  risks that chemical substances might pose. There are many reasons for  this. Particularly often, we see that a direct link is made between the  potential hazard a substance may have for humans or the environment  and the ensuing risk, without taking into account the extent to which  humans or the environment are actually exposed to that substance. It is  our view that a differentiation must be made between hazard and risk,  and that this is in fact essential to ensure that safety assessments of  ingredients reflect reality.  Identifying hazards \\u2013 assessing risks  In assessing the safety of a product, the first step our experts take is to  determine whether its ingredients could pose a hazard to people or the  environment. An exposure analysis is carried out in a second step to  clarify the extent to which people or the environment could be exposed  to this substance. This analysis is important as, in most cases, a harmful  effect will only occur when the quantity and concentration of the   questionable substance reach a certain level. The results of these two  steps have to be combined to arrive at a comprehensive risk assessment.  It is only by considering this overall picture that our experts can make  reliable statements about whether a product will be safe when it is used.  A simple example is acetic acid, which represents a potential hazard  because it can cause serious harm in high concentrations due to its   caustic properties. When used as vinegar in diluted form in our food,  however, it does not pose a risk.  Evaluation of the substances used  Regarding substances with certain dangerous properties, we have  decided that these shall not be used at all for specific applications. For  other substances, we have introduced strict internal constraints and  restrictions and, by doing so, we often go beyond legal requirements.  In other cases, we work to further improve health compatibility by   developing alternative ingredients. One example of this is the switch  from solvent-based to water-based formulations for our consumer and  contact adhesives.

Furthermore, we believe being present in these  markets and supporting the non-animal testing agenda will ultimately  help to gain acceptance for alternatives to animal testing. We and other  manufacturers in our industry cannot rule out the possibility that an  ingredient was tested on animals at some point before it was introduced  to the market. In particular, this is because we mostly source our ingre- dients from suppliers, and manufacture very few ingredients ourselves.  In this context, it is also important to know that ingredients used in  products including detergents, cleaning products and adhesives are  chemical substances. This means they must be secured by the respective  manufacturer in line with the relevant legal requirements for chemicals,  such as the    REACH regulation in Europe. In some cases, animal testing  is still required by law to ensure safety and compatibility for humans and  the environment. This is because recognized alternative methods are  not yet available for all aspects of testing. We use recognized, alternative  testing methods or existing data to demonstrate the safety of our ingre- dients. For 40 years now, we have been intensively committed to  developing alternative testing methods ourselves. Henkel was one of the  companies that founded the    \\u2018European Partnership on Alternative  Approaches to Animal Testing\\u2019 (EPAA) in 2005, together with the Euro- pean Commission and several industry associations. Since then, this  partnership has advanced numerous projects that have successfully  promoted alternatives to animal testing and made them useable for  conducting safety assessments in line with the REACH regulation. Product recall process  Although our products undergo numerous tests and assessments to  ensure a high level of safety, unforeseen deviations from our high quality  standards may occur in very rare cases. In preparation for any such  cases and to ensure the best possible health and safety of customers and  consumers, in 2009 Henkel introduced a corporate standard for potential  product crises and product recalls that applies to all sites. This global  corporate standard defines binding procedures, clear responsibilities  and guidelines for an appropriate and rapid response if deviations and  unforeseen events were to occur in connection with our products, despite  all of the safety precautions we have taken. Following a fundamental  revision of this corporate standard, our internal target groups were  informed about new content in 2020 through training sessions and short  presentations. A digital training course has also been available since the  end of 2020. Innovations and alternative test methods  We have a clear    commitment: We do not test our cosmetic products,  our detergents and cleaning products, or our adhesives for industrial  customers, consumers and craftspeople on animals. Unfortunately, we  cannot claim that animal testing no longer plays any role at all. This is  because there are some countries where animal testing is still mandatory  to obtain market and/or regulatory approval for products such as   cosmetics, detergents and cleaning products, or adhesives. We are working  together with the relevant industry associations to convince the authorities  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  43 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Enhancing human health and safety We test and assess our raw materials and finished products throughout  the entire product lifecycle to make sure they meet the highest standards.  Of course, our customers share our commitment to health and safety \\u2013  and their focus is being sharpened by regulatory changes that aim to   protect consumers. A new chemical strategy for sustainability, for example,  is expected to be included within the Green Deal in the European Union.  Adapting our product formulas in Adhesive Technologies is just one  of the ways that we seek to enhance safety and help our customers to  exceed regulatory requirements. For example, our Loctite 2400 thread- locker is not required to display any hazard symbols, risk statements or  safety-related warnings on the packaging because it does not contain  any substances of concern.  Wherever possible, questions regarding the skin compatibility of  ingredients are now investigated with the help of in-vitro tests. In-vitro  tests have been developed over the past decades by Henkel in cooperation  with external partners. They have been proposed for international  recognition by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Develop- ment (OECD) as a substitute method for animal testing.  For this purpose, Henkel uses    epiCS\\u00ae skin models produced in its  own laboratories under the    Phenion\\u00ae brand. The epiCS\\u00ae technology  includes reconstructed human epidermal equivalents, which are   officially  recognized by the OECD for assessing skin-corrosive potential,  and, since April 2019, also assessing skin-irritant potential. Our scientists are currently working to ensure that the skin models,  which are the size of a one-cent coin, can also be used to research other  chemical safety issues. You can find more information on the website  of the European Commission\\u2019s    Scientific Committee on Consumer  Products.  Computer-aided analysis is also playing an increasingly important role  in our testing and assessment strategies. Additionally, we make our  expertise available to legislators through a range of associations to  shorten the lengthy processes leading to recognition of an alternative  test method and to promote the acceptance of proven alternatives.

With respect to \\u2192 climate action, we are making a  valuable contribution to a low-carbon economy within sourcing by   driving the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in our supply chains  and implementing appropriate sourcing solutions. We are supporting  the \\u2192 transition to a circular economy in sourcing raw materials and  packaging from sustainable sources and adopting a circular approach.  In particular, our Purchasing department makes a valuable and active  contribution to \\u2192 social progress by demanding and promoting sustain- able business practices and \\u2192 respect for human rights along the entire  value chain.  In the areas of strategic sustainability in sourcing mentioned above, a  large number of indicators are collected and made available to measure  the value contribution as a basis for strategic sourcing decisions.   Henkel currently has business partners from 119 countries. About  75 percent of our purchasing volume comes from countries that belong  to the    Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD).  However, we are increasingly opening up new purchasing markets  in countries that are not OECD members. We place the same exacting  demands on business partners worldwide. We expect their business  business partners from 119 countries SOURCING  Responsible sourcing underpins holistic growth  Our responsible sourcing approach focuses on sustainability aspects  along our supply chains for the benefit of people and our planet. Inten- sive dialog and close cooperation with our suppliers are essential for  achieving sustainable business, process and production practices. Over  a decade ago, we established a framework for sustainable procurement  in the supply chains of the chemical industry based on cooperation,  trust and responsibility.   100 percent responsible sourcing strategy Our ambition is to commit to 100 percent responsible sourcing together  with our partners. The key element here is our    responsible-sourcing  strategy, which places a clear focus on a shared fundamental approach.  We are firmly convinced that we can only establish sustainable procure- ment practices if every single decision-maker in the global supply  chains acts in the spirit of sustainability. This requires a fundamental  recognition of this responsibility, as well as adopting the right attitude  and building skills and knowledge.  Our strategy is based on our comprehensive \\u2192 risk management and   \\u2192 compliance approach. The aim here is to gather and provide transparent  key figures on the sustainability performance and risks of our suppliers  as a basis for fact-based decision-making in sourcing processes and the  awarding of contracts. The transparency gained in this area also benefits  risk management and risk mitigation, as well as dialog and cooperation  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  45 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Cooperation with strategic suppliers and partners Our current cooperation with our suppliers centers on the definition and  implementation of a common plan for Henkel\\u2019s sustainability targets for  2025 and beyond. We use different platforms and forums to develop   pioneering innovations in the field of sustainable products and technol- ogies together with our suppliers. We use target agreements with our  strategic suppliers to manage transparency, sustainability performance  and innovation potential in the area of sustainable sourcing solutions.  As part of our risk management approach, we are working to improve the  transparency of our upstream supply chains with regard to sustainability  risks. To support climate action across the value chain, we also require  our suppliers in the raw materials and packaging sectors to be transparent  about the emissions levels of their product portfolios. We expect them  to make a contribution to reducing CO2  emissions along their supply  chains in line with our science-based target for Scope 3 greenhouse gas  emissions. This approach addresses about 50 percent of our indirect  emissions in the area of raw materials. In addition, we encourage sustain- able innovation by engaging in dialog with suppliers and setting individual  targets. This is how we ensure that focus topics such as biodegradability are  systematically integrated into Henkel\\u2019s holistic approach to sustainability.  conduct to be consistent with our sustainability requirements. In selecting  and working with our business partners, we also consider their perfor- mance with regard to safety, health, environment, social standards and  fair business practices. This is based on our corporate    Safety, Health  and Environment Standards. Our corporate purchasing standards  apply worldwide, and we have supplemented these with an updated     Responsible Sourcing  Policy in 2018. The Chief Procurement Officer  (CPO) is responsible for all procurement activities and responsible   supply chain management. He reports directly to the Chief Financial  Officer (CFO).  Binding supplier code Compliance with the cross-sector Code of Conduct of the German     Association of Materials Management, Purchasing, and Logistics  (BME) is mandatory for all of Henkel\\u2019s suppliers worldwide. The BME  Code of Conduct is based on the ten principles of the    UN Global  Compact. This Code of Conduct makes international application   possible and, in addition to the Responsible Sourcing Policy, also serves  as the basis for contractual relationships with our strategic suppliers.

We expect our suppliers to acknowledge  our supplier code of conduct as well as our Responsible Sourcing Policy.  Our onboarding process is anchored in a globally uniform registration  system and provides a standardized summary of our sustainability  requirements. Step 3: Initial assessment or audit  At the start of a new business relationship, suppliers are asked to either  disclose existing sustainability performance results, or to undergo a  self-assessment that provides transparency about their sustainability  performance. We do this for the majority of our external purchasing  volume using a methodology developed by EcoVadis, an independent  sustainability assessment specialist. These questionnaires cover  expectations in the areas of safety, health, environment, quality, human  rights, employee standards and anti-corruption.  We also piloted the    IntegrityNext software-as-a-service solution in  2021 for suppliers with lower purchasing volumes. A compact assessment  questionnaire is used to make the sustainability performance and risks  of suppliers in various purchasing segments transparent. Selected suppliers undergo initial audits as an alternative to the  assessment of the self-assessment questionnaires. Our supplier base  also includes contract manufacturers from which we source around  10 percent of our production tonnage each year. Our requirements  regarding quality, environmental, safety and social standards are an   integral part of all contractual relationships and order placements, and  are reviewed as necessary. Six-step process as an integral component   of our procurement activities Our six-step Responsible Sourcing Process, which generates indicators  on the sustainability performance of our suppliers, is a central element  of  our strategic risk management and compliance approach. We use the  resulting transparency to support our buyers in working with suppliers  to continuously improve sustainability performance in the value chain.  These continuous improvement processes are based primarily on  know ledge transfer and competence building with respect to process   optimization, resource efficiency, and environmental and social standards.  The Responsible Sourcing Process is an integral component of our  sourcing activities. This process is initiated before the start of any new  cooperation. It culminates in a recurring cycle of review, analysis and  continuous improvement with existing suppliers. Using this process  for the audit and assessment of the sustainability performance of our  suppliers, we cover about 93 percent of our purchasing volume in the  areas of packaging, raw materials, and contract manufacturing.  Step 1: Pre-check and risk assessment  Henkel uses an early warning system for sustainability risks in global  purchasing markets. We begin by evaluating the potential risks in a  region or country. In doing so, we concentrate on countries identified by  international institutions as being associated with heightened levels of  sustainability risks. The assessment includes the criteria \\u201cHuman Rights,\\u201d  \\u201cCorruption\\u201d and \\u201cLegal Environment\\u201d. This also includes the assessment  of risk-value chains. Risk value chains are related to industries and  sectors that we consider to potentially represent a sustainability risk for  our company. This helps us to identify countries and purchasing   markets that may require special precautions.

Our audits consist of on-site inspections (e.g., at production sites of our  suppliers) and include both factory inspections and discussions with  employees at all levels of the hierarchy.  Step 4: Analysis of the performance assessment  External sustainability experts, as well as the supplier owners in our  Purchasing team, analyze the results of the audits or the results of the  self-assessment questionnaire to identify sustainability deficits and  improvement areas. At the same time, the suppliers are assigned to   different sustainability risk classes. A standardized process following  an assessment or audit ensures that our suppliers implement the  corrective actions that have been specified. Repeated serious non-  compliance leads to termination of the supplier relationship.  Step 5: Corrective actions and continuous improvement process  Independently of the results of an audit or assessment, we ask our  assessed suppliers to draw up a Corrective Action Plan and to work on  the defined areas of potential optimization. We monitor the progress  made in the implementation together with our suppliers in the course  of the period until the re-assessment or re-audit takes place. Step 6: Re-Assessment / Re-Audit  We use recurring re-assessments or re-audits to monitor the performance  progress of our suppliers and ensure a continuous improvement cycle  consisting of evaluation, analysis and corrective measures. Data on the  measured sustainability performance of our suppliers is made available  in real time via digital platforms.  Development or termination of the supplier relationship  As part of our supplier management activities, we work intensively with  our suppliers to improve sustainability performance. We strive to initiate  positive change throughout the value chain, through training programs  and joint projects. During 2021, we did not receive any notifications of an  infringement by any of our strategic business partners that would have  given cause for terminating our relationship with that supplier.

Above all, synergies are to be  created so that resources can be used more efficiently and with a minimum  of administrative effort, not only among the member companies but also  with all of our shared suppliers.  Together for a sustainable supply chain A strong partner in the \\u201cTogether for Sustainability\\u201d   (TfS) initiative In 2011, Henkel and five other companies in the chemical industry  introduced the initiative    Together for Sustainability \\u2013 Chemical Supply  Chains for a Better World (TfS). It is based on the principles of the     UN Global Compact and the Responsible Care Initiative of the  Responsible Sourcing Process Six-step supplier management process  \\u2022 Implemented in all regions, in all business units and for all  material groups  \\u2022 Managed by the Sustainability team within Purchasing and  executed by the global Purchasing team  \\u2022 Complemented by supplier audits conducted by the Safety,  Health and Environment (SHE) team Sustainability as an   integral component of all  procurement activities HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  49 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT COMPLIANCE PRODUCT SAFETY SOURCING SUSTAINABLE FINANCE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENTS REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  At the heart of the audits and online assessments of the TfS initiative is  the core idea: \\u201cAn audit for one is an audit for all!\\u201d: Suppliers then only  have to undergo one assessment or one audit. The audits are carried out  by a number of selected, independent audit companies. For the online  assessments, TfS works with    EcoVadis, a sustainability performance  assessment specialist.  Around 18,000 assessments and audits have taken place since TfS was  founded. Performance is assessed in the areas of management, environ- ment, health and safety, labor and human rights, and issues of ethical  corporate governance. The measures then introduced are reviewed via  re-assessments or re-audits. Follow-up monitoring and subsequent  supplier management are the responsibility of the individual member  companies. An online platform is used to make the results available to  all members of the initiative.  The initiative not only expanded to include additional member   companies in 2021, it also established a regional working group in   Singapore, headed by a Henkel representative. Together with the   Chinese Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation, TfS is working  to raise awareness of the initiative in China.  18,000 TfS assessments and audits 34 member companies   of the TfS initiative Another working group was also launched in 2021 with the goal of  establishing a global program to collect and share information on Scope  3 greenhouse gas emissions. This includes developing a standardized  approach for measuring greenhouse gas emissions data in the chemical  industry. This also includes defining a data  collection and sharing   process using a scalable platform, designing a supplier engagement  program, and maintaining dialog with key stakeholders.  In 2021, the initiative also developed the    TfS Academy. After completion  of the pilot phase, the Academy will provide a learning environment for  both of the core target groups, buyers and suppliers, as well as other  key stakeholders within TfS member companies. The TfS Academy will  initially offer more than 200 learning contents in four languages. Training and development of suppliers and employees  During the year, Henkel continued to focus on building up and expanding  the expertise of its buyers and suppliers. Henkel experts trained both  purchasing experts and suppliers in focus areas like palm oil, greenhouse  gas emissions and conflict minerals. Experts at TfS, together with repre- sentatives of the strategic supplier evaluation partner EcoVadis, were  also trained in content related to the assessment process. In total, about  2,360 participants were trained in various webinars in four languages  (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese) in 2021. At the annual conference  of the Chinese Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation, personal  training was provided for about 370 suppliers on site in Ningbo for the  second year.

During the year, 970 employees completed  eLearning courses on sustainability topics in purchasing. We placed a  special focus on human rights due diligence training in purchasing.  About 370 employees in the Purchasing area underwent extensive  human rights training in 2021, focusing on human rights due diligence  in supply chains.  Honoring our suppliers  Henkel has regularly honored suppliers for special achievements for many  years. In 2021, the    Adhesive Technologies business unit presented  BASF with the Sustainability Award for its outstanding contributions to  achieving our sustainability targets and ambitions. BASF\\u2019s contributions  include joint development projects for improved health and safety  standards, for reducing the company\\u2019s carbon footprint by sourcing raw  materials based on the biomass balance process for new adhesive  products, and the partnership in the ReciChain initiative for tracking  plastics and plastic products.  The    Laundry & Home Care business unit presented the 2021 Sustain- ability Award to Firmenich and Takasago in recognition of their achieve- ments in the development of new biodegradable capsules for fragrances.  We use this technological development for fabric softeners and laundry  detergents. It also fulfills the criteria of biodegradability and fragrance  performance and longevity.  The    Beauty Care business unit presented the Sustainability Award  for 2021 to Sasol, whose Parafol chemical line allows us to replace cyclic   silicones from antiperspirant sprays. This is an important step in adapting  our products to the current specifications and needs of consumers. Close collaboration with partners  In addition to our work in the Together for Sustainability initiative, Henkel  is a member of    AIM-PROGRESS, a forum of companies from the  consumer goods industry. The objective here is also to encourage member   companies to share experiences in the area of sustainable sourcing  and utilize synergies. The forum also focuses on holding regional supplier  events to improve sustainability performance within the value chain.  We are also a founding member of the    Action for Sustainable Deriva- tives (ASD) initiative. It brings together organizations from along the  palm oil derivative supply chain to support efforts to increase transpar- ency and promote compliance with NDPE (No Deforestation, No Peat,  No Exploitation) principles to positively transform the palm oil industry.

This topic is already highly relevant for investors and the  global financial markets today and is increasingly gaining in importance.  This means that the proportion of investors who use sustainability   criteria as a basis for both their strategic portfolio management and their  specific investment decisions is increasing. Institutional investors are  increasingly including sustainability in their risk and opportunity  management, as they are  convinced that sustainable companies are  more successful in the long term. This development is also being  actively promoted by political decision-makers at global level \\u2013 with  concrete legal requirements and initiatives for greater climate and   environmental protection. For example, the European Commission\\u2019s     \\u201cGreen Deal\\u201d includes measures for the financial market. In this  respect, sustainability is an increasingly critical success factor for  competitiveness as an issuer on the capital market. ESG (Environment,  Social, Governance) is therefore a key pillar of our financing strategy. Integrated dialog with our shareholders For many years now, we have been engaged in intensive dialog with  our shareholders on the topic of sustainability. As part of our capital  market communications, we regularly report on our strategy, goals, and  concrete initiatives and progress in this area. Sustainability has been an  integral part of our financial reporting in our Annual Report since 2001.  It is also a significant topic at our Annual Press Conference as well as  Annual General Meeting \\u2013 not least because it is deeply anchored in  Henkel\\u2019s corporate strategy, culture and values. In addition, we engage  with investors both in one-on-one meetings as well as at conferences  and roadshows. In particular, events with a special focus on ESG offer an  important platform for these exchanges. We also provide transparent  information about our positions, activities and progress in the area of  sustainability by responding to in-depth questionnaires from investors.  This also provides us with detailed insights into the interests and  requirements of capital market players with regard to relevant ESG criteria. Sustainable financing Henkel implemented innovative solutions in the area of  sustainable  finance at an early stage. We introduced an ESG Framework for Pension  Asset Management in 2015 and updated it in 2020 by integrating  ESG  ratings for active fund managers and ESG index benchmarks for  passively managed investments. In 2018, Henkel was the first company in  Germany to conclude a syndicated    \\u201cSustainability-Linked Loan,\\u201d a  \\u201c Sustainability criteria  continue gaining importance  in investment decisions and  hence also in our Investor  Relations activities.

In July 2020, we also  became the first company worldwide to issue a    \\u201cPlastic Waste Reduction  Bond\\u201d. The bond consists of two tranches of 70 million US dollars and  25 million euros and has a maturity of five years. The proceeds will be  exclusively invested in projects participating in Henkel\\u2019s activities to  reduce plastic waste. This bond underscores our commitment to pro- moting a circular economy and reducing plastic waste. We further expanded our commitment to sustainable finance in October  2021, by defining the    \\u201cSustainable Finance Framework\\u201d. This     framework enables the issuance of two types of bonds: Sustainability-  Linked Bonds and Green Bonds. The financing costs for Sustainability-  Linked Bonds are linked to the achievement of sustainability targets,  while the proceeds from the issuance of Green Bonds are used exclusively  for sustainable investments. The framework was reviewed by the inde- pendent ESG rating agency ISS ESG, which confirmed the environmental  added value and the compliance of the framework with the Green  Bond and Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles of the International   Capital Market Association (ICMA). Henkel successfully issued two     Sustainability- Linked Bonds with a volume of 720 million euros  under the framework in November 2021.  With this \\u201cSustainable Finance Framework,\\u201d we aim to align our business  as well as our financing with our commitments and values by creating a  direct link between our \\u2192 sustainability strategy and our funding strategy.  This underscores our commitment to achieving our sustainability targets,  as well as our Henkel Finance team\\u2019s ongoing commitment to actively  supporting our sustainability agenda. EU taxonomy  In view of global warming, the European states have committed themselves  to more climate protection. In this regard, both the Paris Climate  Agreement and the European Green Deal view sustainable investments  as an important starting point. A key instrument in this context is the     EU taxonomy \\u2013 an EU-wide classification system for sustainable  economic activities with the aim of promoting investment in them. According to the \\u201cRegulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to  facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU)  2019/2088,\\u201d an economic activity is considered environmentally   sustainable if it substantially contributes to achieving one or more of  the environmental objectives. At the same time, an economic activity  must not significantly harm the other environmental objectives. The  environmental objectives defined in terms of the Taxonomy Regulation  are: climate change  mitigation; climate change adaptation; the sustainable  use and protection of water and marine resources; the transition to a   circular economy;  pollution prevention and control; and the protection  and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. In addition, the economic  activity must be carried out in compliance with the minimum social  safeguards and comply with the technical screening criteria established  by the EU Commission by means of delegated acts. The technical screening  criteria specify the performance requirements for a specific economic  activity, determining under what conditions the activity makes a substan- tial contribution to achieving a particular environmental objective and  does not significantly harm the other objectives.

The Delegated Act covers economic activities of about 40 per- cent of listed companies in sectors that account for nearly 80 percent of  direct greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. These sectors include energy,  forestry, manufacturing, transport, and buildings. After a thorough examination involving all of our relevant business units  and functions, we came to the conclusion that our economic activities  are not covered under the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act and are  consequently not taxonomy-eligible. We therefore deduce that  Henkel, with its core business activities, is not identified as a relevant  source of emissions. Consequently, the share of taxonomy-eligible   economic activities accounts for 0 percent of our total sales and \\u2013 as a  consequence \\u2013 the related capital expenditures as well as operating  expenses also amount to 0 percent. The share of taxonomy non-eligible  economic activities in our total sales and capital expenditures and   operating expenses therefore amounts to 100 percent. In addition, the capital expenditures and operating expenses to be  reported include those related to the acquisition of production from  taxonomy-aligned economic activities and to individual measures that  reduce the carbon footprint or greenhouse gas emissions of the target  activities, as well as to individual building renovation measures. As the  reporting requirements for fiscal year 2021 relate exclusively to   taxonomy- eligible investments and expenditures and reliable statements  on taxonomy-alignment are not possible or such an assessment is not  required for this reporting period, we are unable to report any correspond- ing expenditures here either. We did not take into account the \\u201cDraft  Commission Notice\\u201d published on February 2, 2022, as the drafting  process was almost complete at that time. We will continue to intensively examine whether our economic activities  are covered by the delegated acts yet to be adopted on the remaining four  environmental objectives.

For estimates, assumptions and judgments  in connection with the aforementioned key performance indicators,  please refer to page 197 of the Annual Report 2021.  Operating expenses (OpEx) include direct non-capitalized costs that  relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-  term leases, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures  relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equip- ment. This includes research and development expenses recognized as  an expense in our income statement during the reporting period in  accordance with IAS 38 (see page 275 of our Annual Report 2021). Lease  expenses were determined in accordance with IFRS 16 and include  expenses for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets (see page  214 of our Annual Report 2021). Maintenance and repair, and any other  direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of  property, plant and equipment as well as building renovation measures  are determined and allocated appropriately.  Direct costs for training and similar expenses are not included in the  numerator and denominator, as Annex I to Art. 8 of the Delegated Act  lists these costs only for the numerator, which does not allow for a  mathematically meaningful calculation of the OpEx KPI.

In parallel, we also want to continuously  improve our energy efficiency. In line with our vision, the sites will  become    climate-positive in terms of their carbon balance when surplus  CO2-free energy that Henkel does not need for its own purposes is supplied  to third parties. Along the journey toward this goal, we are still pursuing  our target of making a 65-percent reduction in the carbon footprint of  our production sites by 2025 compared to the base year 2010. In addition  to the major opportunities presented by the accelerated transition to  climate-neutral solutions, we also see a number of challenges, including  changing framework conditions and accounting methods that differ  around the world, as well as the local availability of climate-neutral  technologies. \\u201c As market leader for adhe\\u00ad sives, sealants and functional  coatings, we are making  an important contribution  to climate protection by  becoming climate\\u00adpositive  and leveraging our technolo\\u00ad gies and solutions to enable  CO2 savings along the value  chain.\\u201d JAN-DIRK AURIS Member of the Management Board Adhesive Technologies Our climate change mitigation activities Climate change is one of the major global challenges of our time.  We are committed to the 1.5 degree target of the Paris Climate Agreement.  We take \\u2192 climate change and its impacts into account as part of our  sustainability and risk management approach, and across our entire  value chain. It is  relevant for us from two perspectives: One is the potential  impact of our business activities on the global greenhouse gas balance,  and the other is the potential impact of climate change on our business  activities. In the context of our \\u2192 sustainability strategy, we consider  our direct and indirect CO2 emissions and their potential impact on the  climate. We are starting by focusing on our own sites, which we can  influence directly. We plan to achieve a reduction in the carbon footprint  of our production. We will achieve this by continuously \\u2192 improving  our energy efficiency and by increasingly making use of power, especially  electricity, that is generated by \\u2192 renewable sources.  We are always exploring ways to achieve climate neutrality faster for  selected sites. Based on our progress in these areas and the experience  we have gained, we have decided to bring forward our ambition for 2040  by ten years: By 2030, we intend to achieve a \\u2192 climate-positive carbon  footprint for our production sites. To do this, we are planning to replace the fuels we need to generate thermal  energy at our sites with CO2-free alternatives such as biogas or biomass  by no later than 2030. We continue to strive towards our existing goal of  sourcing 100 percent of the electricity we purchase for production  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  60 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  In addition to our activities at our own sites, we want to leverage our  influence on areas of our value chain that are particularly relevant to  CO2 emissions. We determine this data using the recognized methods of  the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Analysis shows that the product  use phase has the greatest impact on our CO2 footprint. Our products  are used in millions of households and industrial processes every day.  Accordingly, our goal is to work with our customers, consumers and  suppliers to save 100 million metric tons of CO2 over the ten-year period  from 2016 to 2025. To achieve this, we have developed a CO2 savings  portfolio that can be used as a basis for quantifying the exact contributions  made by products to reducing emissions. We also want to reduce the  footprint of the raw materials and packaging that we use by 30 percent  by 2030 compared to a 2017 baseline. One component of this is our  packaging strategy, as CO2 emissions can be reduced by using recycled  material, for example.  In 2020, the    Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) confirmed that  our science-based emissions reduction targets, which we derived based  on our long-term goals, are consistent with the initiative\\u2019s criteria. Our  targets for Henkel\\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) are in line  with the reductions required to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  We have committed to reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions per metric  ton of product by 67 percent by 2030 compared to 2017, and we have  converted our existing climate targets with the reference year 2010  accordingly to the more current reference year 2017. Our    target for  value chain emissions (Scope 3) also meets SBTi\\u2019s criteria for ambitious  value chain targets, which means it is in line with best practice. By  2030, we aim to reduce our emissions from raw materials and packaging  that meet Scope 3.1 \\u201cGoods and Services\\u201d of the GHG Protocol by 30 per- cent per  metric ton of product compared to 2017.  The effects of climate change on potential risks and   opportunities When assessing the potential impact of climate change on our business  activities, we consider the entire value chain \\u2013 from the raw materials  we purchase through to the marketing of our products. We draw on the  findings of our comprehensive risk and opportunity assessment process.  We identify and assess climate-related risks based on the recommenda- tions of the    Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD). The recommendations made by the reporting department are  assigned to the core areas of governance, strategy and risk management  of a company. This framework addresses how an organization manages  climate- related risks and opportunities, how the actual and potential  impacts of climate- related risks and opportunities on the company\\u2019s  business are assessed, and how the organization identifies, assesses,  and manages climate- related risks if they are considered to be material. To this end, we identify relevant impacts in two major risk categories:  transition risks associated with the transition to a low-emission economy  and society; and physical risks, such as the increased probability of  extreme weather events in the future. In line with the timeframe of our  current sustainability strategy and our Group-wide risk management  approach, we are initially focusing on the period up to 2030. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  61 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  With respect to sourcing, the raw material palm (kernel) oil is particularly  interesting, as the yield of the plantations and consequently prices are  influenced by prevailing weather conditions. Our main focus is on   monitoring the El Ni\\u00f1o weather phenomenon and managing its impacts.  Based on the scenarios issued by the IPCC and IEA that we have applied,  we do not expect any climate changes in the period up to 2030 that  would lead to a significant long-term increase in the prices of our palm  (kernel) oil-based raw materials. We primarily based our analysis of possible climate-related production  losses on the new    IPCC report published in 2021. Henkel will continue  to develop its assessment of these risks in the future, even though  we  currently assume that the risk to our sites from intensified climate  events is low, based on the current interpretation of the climate scenarios.  Where relevant, we have put in place a system for managing weather and  other geohazards.  The transition risks also present opportunities for Henkel: to position  itself as a company with a proactive climate protection strategy, to  improve its own competitiveness by optimizing its production and raw  material base, and to create added value for customers and consumers  with  innovative solutions and strong brands. Henkel\\u2019s CO2 savings  portfolio provides examples of this.    More information about our  TCFD reporting is available on our website. To explore the potential impacts of climate change, one of the sources  we use is data from transition scenarios developed by the    International  Energy Agency (IEA) and from climate scenarios conducted by the     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The scenarios  are based on different assumptions of potential climate warming. We  have considered the following risks: The main transition risks for Henkel include the potential financial  impact of a significant increase in the price of CO2. By analyzing the CO2  price developments based on different climate scenarios, we have  identified potential risks both for production and along the value chain.  We have assessed the potential direct and indirect effects on the costs of  energy, products and services purchased by Henkel if the widely intro- duced price of CO2 rises. We did this in the context of other price factors  and possible feedback effects. We expect to help reduce potential long- term risks by implementing our medium and long-term climate change  mitigation targets. We have also examined the physical risks for Henkel. Our focus was on  the risks associated with our raw material sourcing and on direct risks to  our production from potential climate-related changes in the frequency  and intensity of weather events such as heavy rain, droughts or floods. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  62 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  conditions in the countries in question. Accordingly, we are continuously  reviewing our timetable and strategy for decarbonizing our production  sites. Our considerations also take into account the results of the  negotiations at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in 2021.  Driving the conversion to renewable energy We are focusing on a combination of the following three models to   transition to 100 percent renewables by 2030: on-site production, direct  purchases and virtual coverage. By 2030, we aim to replace the last  remaining fossil fuels that we use in our production to generate process  energy by switching to carbon-neutral alternatives such as biogas or bio- mass. We also aim to supply surplus carbon- neutral energy that Henkel  does not need for its own purposes to third parties \\u2013 thus becoming a  climate-positive company in our production. In doing so, we will avoid  emissions from our own activities, and also enable third parties to use  carbon-neutral energy. Since August 2021, the    Henkel Fragrance Center in Krefeld in the  Laundry & Home Care business unit in Germany has been operating on a  CO2-neutral basis, making it the first Henkel site to switch its production  completely to CO2-neutral energy. We have been operating a 17,000 square  meter solar plant at our largest Beauty Care site in Wassertr\\u00fcdingen,   Germany, since the beginning of 2021, generating 1,675 megawatt hours  (MWh) of green electricity per year. Combined with the conversion to  biogas, the  production facilities have been operated with 100 percent  renewable energy since August 2021. Significantly reducing the carbon footprint   in production Becoming climate-positive by 2030 In light of the need to reduce emissions and decarbonize the economy,  we pursue the ambition of converting our production sites to a    climate-  positive CO2 balance by 2030, which will make an active contribution  toward    climate protection.  The net carbon footprint of our production is around 475,000 metric  tons of CO2 and is attributable to the fuels we use ourselves (Scope 1) and  the energy purchased (Scope 2), in particular electricity. To date, we have  been able to achieve a reduction of 50 percent CO2 emissions per ton of  product (2021 vs. 2010). Our target is an overall reduction of 65 percent by  2025 (vs. 2010). We are continuously developing our climate strategy in the area of pro- duction, drawing on internal experts and our partner network. In 2021,  we hosted a number of strategic workshops in collaboration with external  partners to critically examine our ambitions, and to identify opportunities  and risks. The main factors to be taken into account in this context are the  continuously evolving energy markets, potential changes to the  legislative  framework, and technical innovations. For example, determining the  optimal supply strategy for each site requires intensive analysis of the  changing emissions trading systems and carbon markets. The  reason for  this is that we purchase electricity as well as thermal energy, and we  use energy sources that can be subject to rapidly changing framework  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  63 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Our production facility for detergents and cleaning products in D\\u00fcssel- dorf, Germany, is aiming to meet the important milestone of becoming  carbon neutral by the beginning of 2022. To achieve this goal, the site is  accelerating its shift to renewable energy sources, including the use of  biogas for various processes. While we have already been using 100 percent  renewable electricity for our laundry detergent production in D\\u00fcsseldorf-  Holthausen since 2020, we have now also been sourcing the thermal  energy required for liquid laundry detergent and dishwasher tab production  from renewable sources since July 2021. In our role as site operator at our  headquarters in D\\u00fcsseldorf-Holthausen, we provide electricity and heat  to third parties. Our power station uses fossil energies (such as natural  gas) and renewable energies (such as biogas). We separate the CO2  emissions caused by generating energy for external third parties from  the energy that we use for our own production activities at this site. We  use the term \\u201cnet emissions\\u201d when describing this situation. By the end of 2021, we had fully converted 21 countries to 100 percent  renewable electricity, and we managed to increase the proportion of our  electricity purchase that comes from renewable sources to 68 percent  during the entire year. We also have concrete plans to accelerate our  respective sourcing and continue to fully convert further countries to  green power in order to reduce the current use of fossil fuels.   Through a gradual conversion of the sites to renewable energy through  the use of the three models shown in the box on the right, we will be able  to meet the individual circumstances and the energy needs. 21 countries entirely transitioned   to 100 % renewable electricity Three models of conversion to renewable energy On-site production:   This model involves generating  green power at our sites through  wind turbines, solar cells or other  technologies. The infrastructure  is either funded by Henkel itself  or paid for by collaboration with  external partners.  Direct purchase: For this model, we purchase  green power straight from  the grid of a local energy   utility company, or as part of  a long-term Power Purchase  Agreement (PPA). Virtual coverage:   If the two options above cannot be  implemented at one of our sites,  green power requirements can be  covered virtually. For example, by  entering into long-term PPAs that  feed green power from sites into  the supply grid in an amount that   is equal to the amount consumed.

The Mexican  plant is one of our five largest Laundry & Home Care sites in the world.  This is our third such award. The other two were in 2020 for    Laundry &  Home Care\\u2019s two Lighthouse factories in D\\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, and \\u2013  as mentioned above \\u2013 Montorn\\u00e8s del Vall\\u00e8s, Spain. In addition, the Forum  named the Holthausen plant in D\\u00fcsseldorf a    \\u201cSustainability Lighthouse\\u201d  in 2021. We now operate one of the three most sustainable production  sites in the Global Lighthouse Network and three Industry 4.0 best  practice factories. This showcases our potential in using Fourth Industrial  Revolution (4IR) technologies in manufacturing for environmental  responsibility and sustainable business. This positions us as part of  a community of production sites that are leading the world in the   introduction and integration of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies  at the cutting edge.  One example of our achievements in this area is the decarbonization of  the energy-intensive spray drying of powder detergents. To this end, we  use our measured values to set up a \\u201cdigital twin\\u201d \\u2013 a cloud-based 3D  replica of the plant, where we simulated operations to arrive at optimal  process parameters for the facility. We are planning to scale up these  Industry 4.0 applications to further improve the sustainability perfor- mance of all of our spray tower sites.  Henkel uses smart factory tools to make greater use of methods for  improved planning, sourcing, manufacturing and logistics. Data-driven,  intelligent systems are used to control machines and optimize production  processes in real time \\u2013 including energy consumption. Our    factory  in Kurkumbh, India, was designed as a smart factory of this kind and  engineered using lean manufacturing concepts. This helps to optimize  the organization of material flows to increase productivity, minimize  waste and reduce emissions. Highly efficient equipment and digital  technology are used to optimize processes, and the plant has smart  systems for  ventilation, air conditioning and lighting. Solar panels,  covering an area of 7,000 square meters of the roof, generate more than  1,000,000 kilowatt hours of energy and save about 800 metric tons of  CO2 annually.  Increased energy efficiency Our business units continuously strive to increase energy efficiency in  our existing sites and are stepping up the use of renewable energy   systems. This effort entails regular upgrades, such as converting to LEDs  and expanding solar installations. In Bogot\\u00e1, Colombia, we installed a  closed-loop plumbing system to transport heated water for the production  of hair and body care products, reducing CO2 emissions by 33 metric tons  per year. Henkel Adhesive Technologies has also launched a multi-year  solar energy program. In China, for example, solar modules have been  installed at four production sites. The combined installed capacity totals  1.64 megawatts (MW). Together, the sites produce more than 1,700 MWh  of solar power.

Our approach to reducing our logistics footprint starts in the product  development stage. This is why we are optimizing our products and the  related packaging in terms of weight and volume, whenever it is  possible  to do so without compromising performance, convenience or stability.  More concentrated products and \\u2192 lighter packaging reduce transport  weight, which decreases the amount of fuel required during transport  and reduces the related emissions. Improving our logistics structures  also helps to reduce transport emissions. Our approach takes the location  of our production sites into account. For bulkier products, we reduce  transport distances and environmental impact by operating regional  production sites. For compact products, we leverage efficiencies  in production by manufacturing these products centrally whenever   possible. For transportation and logistics for finished goods, we focus  our efforts on three major drivers:  Sustainability from the very beginning We plan to integrate innovative and environmentally compatible tech- nologies into our new production facilities, starting from the initial  design. Our new    production facility in Songdo, South Korea, has  paved the way for energy-efficient production. This site uses solar panels  and energy- efficient equipment, as well as rainwater for water supply.  Biodiversity is also ensured by maintaining grassland around the site (start  of construction 08/2019). This site will be the future global production  center for the electronics business of Henkel Adhesive Technologies. The  facility received LEED Gold certification from the    US Green Building  Council in 2021 in recognition of its energy-efficient design. Innovative approaches for the purchase of sustainable electricity We continue to assess    virtual power purchase agreements (\\u201cVPPAs\\u201d)  for sites at which the electricity needs cannot be met through on-site  generation or direct procurement from renewables. We achieved this in  the US in 2021, with a new wind power project in Texas that is being  developed by a utility company.  Low-emission logistics and mobility Optimizing transport and logistics processes Our responsibility along the entire value chain also includes optimizing  our    transport and logistics processes in terms of environmental  compatibility and resource efficiency. We set ourselves the overall aim to  reduce the emissions from transporting our products by around 15 percent  between 2015 and 2025. We also aim to use renewable electricity at  Product transports per transport mode in 2021 Airplane  1 % Truck  63 % Rail  10 % Ship  26 % HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  66 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  individual factories and warehouses. We also make use of the \\u201cmega  warehouse\\u201d concept, where a small group of main distribution centers  store products until the required quantities are due for on-time delivery  to regional warehouses and retailers.   \\u2022 Optimizing transport: We continuously increase the capacity utili- zation of our cargo containers by expanding our pooling activities.  This includes the targeted consolidation of transport and storage of  similar product categories within Henkel, as well as combining  transport with other manufacturers. In addition, closely collaborating  with our customers further helps to optimize our processes. The  resulting  synergies in storage, consignment and transportation ensure  that more fully loaded trucks travel to our customers\\u2019 central warehouses.  We also rent pallets instead of buying them. This makes it more efficient  to collect them and improves the management of damaged pallets.  Where possible, we utilize reusable cardboard pallets instead of wooden  pallets. Due to their lighter weight, they are easier to handle and reduce  fuel consumption. We have recently continued to streamline our pallet  use, and we have implemented various solutions to reduce the overall  use of pallets and increase their reuse rate.  We leverage these three drivers through close collaboration with our   suppliers and customers to implement joint logistics projects. We also  use advanced digital solutions and alternative propulsion systems for  transport. When choosing our transport partners, we consider efficiency,  environmental compatibility and safety performance. Relevant criteria  are included in our tendering and decision-making processes for the  purchase of logistics services.  \\u2022 Expanding intermodal transport: Intermodal transport involves  using more than one mode of transportation. At Henkel, this means  more of our transports are being switched from road to rail. This process  begins with a truck carrying the goods to the nearest rail loading  ter minal. From there, the goods cover longer distances by train, before  a second truck collects the goods at the destination terminal and delivers  them to the customer. This allows us to make use of the lower CO2  footprint of rail transport compared to road transport, since a train  emits about one-third of the CO2 of a truck when transporting the same  weight of goods. For this reason, intermodal transport has become a key  driver for CO2 reduction in logistics at Henkel. Through our dedicated  tendering processes, we are adding further train routes in Europe to  support our shift toward intermodal transport. We stepped up these  efforts further in 2021. Since May 2021, detergents and cleaning  products produced at our site in Kru\\u0161evac, Serbia, have been trans- ported to Vienna by truck and from there to D\\u00fcsseldorf by rail. This  approach saved about 280 tons of CO2 in 2021. This project is an  important step for Henkel in expanding intermodal transport, because  the route was previously served exclusively by trucks. We have also  increased the share of intermodal transports on the Hungary\\u2013  D\\u00fcsseldorf route by 360 more transports per year.  \\u2022 Improving our warehouse network: We select the location of our  warehouses and distribution centers to optimize the routes between  our production sites and our customers. A \\u201cwall-to-wall production\\u201d  approach, where the warehouse is directly connected to the production  facility, minimizes transport from production to storage. Where this is  not in place, we achieve synergies by consolidating transport between  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  67 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Future mobility  Beyond the use of advanced digital tools, alternative propulsion types  also form part of our approach to optimizing transport and logistics. We  are testing the operational capability of vehicles powered by alternative  propulsion systems at our sites. At our headquarters in D\\u00fcsseldorf, we  have, for example, incorporated around 43 electric vehicles into the  internal fleet since 2012 to replace conventional vehicles with internal  combustion engines. In 2021, we also converted the first in-house vans  to purely electric vehicles. We have built a corresponding infrastructure  with over 120 charging stations in and around the industrial park, ten of  them in cooperation with the utility company Stadtwerke D\\u00fcsseldorf.  Our vehicle policy for electric and hybrid cars also gives our employees  in Germany the option of driving an electric or hybrid vehicle as a  company car.  In 2019, the first hydrogen-powered vehicle was added to the internal  fleet at our D\\u00fcsseldorf plant, and a hydrogen filling station was installed.  To promote hydrogen mobility, Henkel has been actively engaged over  the past few years in various initiatives and research projects, such as  \\u201cModellregion Wasserstoffmobilit\\u00e4t NRW D\\u00fcssel.Rhein.Wupper.\\u201d How- ever, hydrogen mobility solutions suitable for our logistics operations  are not currently available for mass production. For this reason, we are  exploring several alternatives for sustainable logistics that are ready to  contribute today. The deployment of conventional combustion engines that run on   Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), which is mainly composed of methane,  is one of the technologies that we are implementing into our business  operations as part of our journey toward more sustainable mobility.  Digital tools for improved logistics  Our transport management system systematically captures the CO2   emissions of our logistics operations and makes our transport planning  and implementation even more efficient across all business units and  countries. Higher truck capacity utilization and optimized routes play a   particularly important role in reducing transport kilometers, cutting fuel  consumption and saving CO2.  Our progress is presented using a digital tool that calculates the environ- mental impact of transportation for all modes of transport based on  the DIN EN 16258 standard. Inputs include actual distances based on GPS  data, country-specific emission factors, and data from the respective  modes of transportation. The combined application of both IT solutions enables us to foster trans- parency and data comparability across the entire industry, and helps us  to track progress toward our emissions reduction target. By the end of  2021, Henkel had achieved a reduction in transport-related emissions  of about 14 percent compared to 2015. Our logistics emissions have been  calculated using a new methodology developed by our service  provider  ETW since 2021. By recalculating the values for the previous year, we  intend to have in place a method for reliably tracking progress made  towards the target. Progress in the previous target period from 2015 to  2020 is not affected. \\u2013\\u200914\\u2009% lower transport-related CO2   emissions per ton of product* * Base year 2015 HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  68 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  CNG produces the least amount of CO2 of all types of fossil fuel combustion.  As a test, we have continuously operated CNG-powered trucks for delivery  runs on the route between Serbia and Austria since 2021. The use of a  CNG powered truck saves about 14 percent of CO2 emissions on this  route compared to a conventional diesel truck. Trucks powered by   liquefied natural gas (LNG) are another alternative mobility solution for  Henkel. Since 2020, two LNG-powered trucks have been traveling on our  supply routes from D\\u00fcsseldorf to B\\u00f6nen, Germany, and Barcelona, Spain.  The technology saves 20 percent of CO2 compared to conventional diesel  trucks. In 2021, the D\\u00fcsseldorf site logistics operations commissioned  another LNG truck, which will also be used on the D\\u00fcsseldorf\\u2013B\\u00f6nen  supply route. Alongside transport to locations outside of our company\\u2019s premises, we  also make use of alternative transport modes for internal deliveries at  our sites. In the context of future mobility, we also seek to reduce trans- port-related emissions by generating a holistic, modern and sustainable  concept to foster our staff\\u2019s mobility. The contribution of our products and technologies  to climate change mitigation  Leverage along the value chain Together with our customers, consumers and suppliers, we aim to  achieve reductions in CO2 emissions. This includes emissions from the  raw materials we use. We also want to help customers and consumers  reduce CO2 emissions that are generated when they use our products  (called Scope 3 emissions). In addition, we want our products and  technologies to help to avoid CO2 emissions from being generated (called  Scope 4 emissions).  Through our brands and technologies, we make products that are used  and applied in ways that are directly linked to the use of energy, such as  detergents, shower gels, or hotmelt adhesives. We want to enable the  efficient use of energy with innovations that cut energy consumption and  the related CO2 footprint. On top of this, we use targeted communications  activities to encourage responsible-minded behavior when our products  are being used. The importance of the use phase is also shown in the     Henkel footprint calculator. It shows that not only companies, but  also each individual can make a contribution to greater sustainability  through their behavior. The calculator enables users to calculate their  personal carbon footprint in just a few minutes. By answering simple  questions, they can quickly estimate how much CO2 they generate  through their own lifestyle in the areas of housing, food, mobility or  vacations and leisure activities.  The initiative    \\u201cBe smarter. Save water.\\u201d from Beauty Care is one example.  Launched in 2016, this initiative involves our Schauma, Fa and Theramed  brands, and it aims to raise consumer awareness about the responsible  use of water as an important resource. Using less hot water also results  in less CO2 emissions. More than 190,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions  could be saved each year if consumers of our products shortened their  shower times by an average of 15 percent. The initiative includes  information provided on the product packaging and a related website.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  69 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Lower water temperatures when washing clothes also help to reduce  energy use and CO2 emissions. Through continuous research and develop- ment partnerships, as well as significant investments in new formulations,  we enable our consumers to achieve excellent washing results when  using increasingly concentrated dosages at lower temperatures \\u2013 or even  when washing laundry in cold water. We raise awareness of the need to  save energy by placing the \\u201cbe sustainable \\u2013 wash cold\\u201d logo on our laundry  detergent packaging to draw consumers\\u2019 attention to this topic. The  potential for savings is enormous: if no water had to be heated for any  of the loads of laundry washed with our heavy-duty detergents, it would  be possible to avoid around 6.4 million metric tons of CO2 emissions  each year. Henkel\\u2019s CO2 savings portfolio In relation to the leverage points we have identified along our value  chain, we have set a target of saving 100 million metric tons of CO2  together with our customers, consumers and suppliers over the ten-year  period from 2016 to 2025. We have developed a CO2-savings portfolio 1 for  this purpose. The evaluation of the contributions in this portfolio is  based on a company-wide, standardized process that sets out the criteria  for the selection of the products and the calculation of CO2 emissions.  In the following pages, we have summarized some examples of our  products and technologies in the following six groups, which contribute  to \\u2192 energy and material efficiency. With regard to the products sold  between 2016 and 2021, we enabled our customers and consumers to  reduce CO2 emissions by more than 68 million metric tons. In the future,  we plan to evaluate additional applications and further expand the  portfolio of products that contribute to CO2 savings in the use phase. New product developments One aspect of product optimization in our Adhesive Technologies business  unit is the switch from solvent-based adhesives to water-based solutions.  Water-based adhesives generate lower emissions of volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs) and also help to save CO2 emissions. We have developed  an innovative water-based adhesive technology for sports shoes that  enables to reduce CO2 emissions significantly during the bonding process. The    N.A.E. brand of solid shower care products gently cleanses and   supports the skin\\u2019s natural moisture balance. Due to its concentrated   formula, the solid shower care product is as economical as three liquid  shower gels (200 ml each), with lower weight and volume. This results in  lower CO2 emissions during transport. The packaging is also made from  FSC-certified paper and is fully recyclable.  Another innovation in the consumer goods business is the Love Nature  brand. This is the first brand of the recently established company, Love  Nature GmbH. It is a wholly-owned Henkel subsidiary and belongs to the  Laundry & Home Care business unit. The new Love Nature detergents,  Universal Cactus Leaves and Color Cherry Blossom, are plant-based.  They have cleaning power at washing temperatures as low as 20 degrees  Celsius, which helps to save resources. As another product example, the  Love Nature bath cleaner can be applied either directly with a sponge or  with a spray attachment that is sold separately and can be reused. \\u201cMein  Sp\\u00fclmittel\\u201d and \\u201cMein Waschmittel\\u201d are also available for refilling at  Love Nature refill stations. 1 Further information can be found in the    methodology document for Scope 4. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  70 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Energy-saving building facades  Our thermal insulation composite systems for building facades help to cut  energy consumption by reducing the loss of heat. In addition, our \\u201ccool  roof\\u201d coatings, which reflect 87 percent more sunlight than conventional  roof coatings, reduce the consumption of energy because fewer air condi- tioning units are needed. The products sold in 2021 enabled our customers  to save around 6 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.  Repair and renovation  Our industrial coating products enable our customers to protect machinery  like pumps against wear and tear, and extend their lifetime. Machinery of  this kind is often operated continuously, which can cause abrasion and  corrosion \\u2013 leading to production downtime. With our coatings, customers  are able to increase operational efficiency by reducing energy consumption  or making it possible to use the machine for longer. The products sold in  2021 enabled our customers to save around 400,000 metric tons of CO2  emissions. Lightweight vehicle designs We support our industrial customers with solutions for lightweight auto- motive designs. This includes pretreatments for metal surfaces that make  it possible to combine steel and aluminum, as well as liquid soundproofing  and 3D reinforcement technologies. These solutions all contribute to  weight reduction in the chassis and increase fuel efficiency. The solutions  sold in 2021 saved around 3.4 million metric tons of CO2 emissions for our  customers. Intelligent material replacement  Our adhesive solutions make it easy to sustainably replace emission-  intensive materials. An example of this is our Loctite Threadlocker. Even a  small quantity of this product matches the performance of conventional  steel washers for securing screws. This saves a significant amount of steel,  which is an emission-intensive material. Another example is our Liofol  Purbond HB adhesives, which are used to manufacture wood composites  and replace CO2-intensive concrete construction. The products sold in  2021 enabled our customers to save around 620,000 metric tons of CO2  emissions.  More efficient renewable energy  Our electro-conductive adhesives enable manufacturers of photovoltaic  modules to increase the efficiency of solar panels. More solar cells can be  installed in each module, and the loss of conductivity within the module  can be reduced. This enables the modules to generate more renewable  energy. The products that we sold in 2021 helped our customers to save  around 1.7 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.  Consuming less hot water  We help consumers by providing products that can reduce energy con- sumption for warming up water, as well as the related CO2 emissions. With  our Laundry & Home Care products Colour Catcher laundry sheets and  Somat dishwasher cleaner, customers can reduce the number of washing  cycles. In addition, leave-in conditioners and dry shampoos from Beauty  Care do not require warm water for rinsing. The products sold in 2021  enabled consumers to save around 200,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

Reducing or completely eliminating packaging material, especially for  our consumer goods, is the best way to minimize waste and the related  negative environmental effects. Our goal is to reduce the amount of  packaging material we use to a minimum \\u2013 without compromising the   quality, performance or safety of our products. All of our    packaging is  designed to provide the level of performance consumers expect while  using the minimum amount of packaging and the most sustainable  materials possible.  At the same time, resource consumption can be reduced if materials are  kept within the cycles of the economy for as long as possible. As a result,  our mission is to include materials from sustainable sources into smart  designs to close the loop. To achieve this goal, our packaging engineers  work closely with partners along the entire value chain in the areas of  design methods, modern production technologies and sustainable  materials. In our Adhesive Technologies business unit, we also pursue the approach  of using our high-quality, innovative packaging adhesives to support  other companies in their implementation of a circular economy, for  example, by facilitating recyclability. We have also set the goal of helping  our industrial customers to make their products even more suitable for a   circular economy. To accomplish this, we are focusing on innovative  solutions that facilitate recycling and on the separation of materials to  make it possible to repair, reuse and refurbish products and product parts.  Henkel is also pursuing a variety of approaches to implement closed-loop  recycling in its own production processes. In this area, we emphasize  efficient waste management at our sites.

What we want to achieve with packaging Our goals for packaging by 2025 are:  \\u2022 100 percent of Henkel\\u2019s packaging will be designed for recyclability or  reusability. 1  \\u2022 We aim to reduce the amount of virgin plastics from fossil sources in  our consumer products by 50 percent. We will achieve this by increasing  the proportion of recycled plastic to more than 30 percent, by reducing  the plastic volume, and by increasingly using bio-based plastics.  \\u2022 We want to help prevent waste from entering the environment. In  order to achieve this, we are supporting waste collection and recycling  initiatives. We invest in innovative solutions and technologies to pro- mote closed-loop recycling, and we aim to enable contact 2 with more  than 2 billion consumers per year by providing targeted information  about recycling. Alongside this, we aim for 100 percent of the paper and cardboard we use  for packaging to be made of recycled material or, where virgin fiber is  required, to come from fresh fiber originating from sustainable forestry.  We also want to remove and avoid polyvinyl chlorides (PVC) and other  substances of potential concern.  Promoting the circular economy  Our strategy to promote the    circular economy for packaging is centered  around three pillars: 1. Intelligent packaging design and reduction of packaging  material Reducing packaging material by using smart solutions is the best way  to minimize waste and the related negative environmental effects. Inno- vative design is essential in replacing virgin materials with recycled or  renewable alternatives wherever possible, which makes it possible to use  more sustainable material in smaller quantities. We also continuously  test new product solutions that have an impact on packaging. This effort  involves, for example, offering concentrates or switching from a liquid  product to a compact powder format.  Our experts rethink packaging concepts and assess further ways of  developing reusable and refillable solutions that place a stronger focus  on durability. They are also optimizing transport packaging and related  logistics. Our aim is that 100 percent of Henkel\\u2019s packaging will be  recyclable or reusable by 2025. At the end of 2021, this share was around  86 percent.1 We base our understanding of the concept of recyclable or  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  73 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Our packaging targets for 2025 Our Strategy Our Ambition Our Objectives * Excluding products where ingredients or residue may affect recyclability or pollute recycling streams.

By consistently applying these types of design principles to support recy- cling, we aim to overcome the barriers to recycling that are specific to  each category of packaging \\u2013 such as flexible packaging, shrink-wrapping  and black packaging. At the same time, it is important that appropriate  systems for recycling packaging materials are in place. In order to quickly and reliably determine the recyclability of new packag- ing, starting from the product development phase, Henkel has developed  the software tool EasyD4R\\u00ae. This is based on public and recognized sets  of criteria, such as those from Plastics Recyclers Europe. It is used by  Henkel throughout the company. The tool\\u2019s effectiveness was confirmed  in an independent test conducted by the Fraunhofer Institute for Environ- mental, Safety and Energy Technology (UMSICHT). Henkel developed its  software tool    EasyD4R\\u00ae further in 2020. Alongside quickly and reliably  1  The reported recyclability value reflects the properties of the packaging, but not the recyclability in specific markets with differing waste collection and recovery systems.

This involved integrating design guidelines created by the University of  Applied Sciences, FH Campus Vienna, along with the German minimum  standard for packaging.   2. Use of material from sustainable sources Henkel constantly works on increasing the share of recycled content in  its packaging. We set the ambitious goal of expanding the share of recycled  plastic to more than 30 percent for all plastic packaging materials used  for our consumer goods products worldwide by 2025. At the end of 2021,  this share was around 18 percent. In addition, we will increasingly use bio-based plastic because it enables  more sustainable solutions. Provided they can deliver the same technical  performance as conventional polymers, they could offer a good alternative  and provide long-term benefits. We explicitly exclude sources of raw  materials that might be in competition with food. For this reason, we are  testing the use of second-generation bio-based feedstock material.  The most widely used packaging materials made from renewable raw  materials are paper and cardboard. It is our goal to obtain 100 percent  of the paper and cardboard that we use in our packaging from recycled  material or, where virgin fiber is required, from sustainable forestry  sources. A 2020 survey showed that our suppliers used 69 percent recycled  material in 2020. 86\\u2009% recyclable or reusable  material 18\\u2009% share of recyclate for  packaging Today, we only use PVC in a few exceptional cases for which we have  not yet found a workable alternative. Overall, materials containing PVC  currently make up less than 0.1 percent of our total global expenditure  on packaging. We continue to work toward our goal of fully removing  PVC from our packaging materials. 3. Closing the loop together We partner with organizations from along the packaging value chain to  drive progress in the infrastructure for recycling. Working in cooperation  with our retail partners, our aim is to help consumers use and dispose of  our products correctly, for example by placing special recycling symbols  on packaging. This targeted information about recycling will enable   contact with more than two billion consumers per year. Another option  to close the loop is to reuse packaging. We also want to maximize the  reusability of secondary and tertiary packaging that is typically used for  shelf displays or for logistical purposes. Refill packaging and reusable systems are also gaining importance  alongside recycling. In addition to new product forms and the use of  recyclable and recycled plastics in our packaging, we also use refillable  packaging and refill stations where consumers can fill laundry and   dishwashing detergents or shampoo into special bottles. When the  contents are used up, the packaging can be refilled again.

In stores of several  drugstore and supermarket chains, \\u201cMein Sp\\u00fclmittel\\u201d and \\u201cMein Wasch- mittel\\u201d can be filled and easily refilled again and again. In 2020, this made  Love Nature the first detergent and cleaning brand to offer this  service  across all retailers in Germany. In 2021, there were a total of 48 refill  stations all over Germany. In addition, the bottle bodies are made of  100 percent recycled plastic and can be fully recycled.  The Beauty Care business unit also uses refill stations. The Beauty Care  Professional brand    Authentic Beauty Concept offers refill stations in  49 selected hair salons in Europe, including Germany and Austria, as  well as in Central Asia. Consumers can also use these refill stations to  refill their favorite products again and again in a suitable bottle.  Henkel is developing and testing new logos for product packaging to  promote sustainable purchasing habits and communicate how to recycle  properly. The logos indicate the percentage of recycled material or the  recyclability of the packaging, and some also help to ensure that the  product is recycled properly. Henkel also states the proportion of  \\u2192 Social Plastic\\u00ae in its product packaging. In addition, Henkel is a part- ner of the    How2Recycle program in the United States to strengthen  consumer awareness about how packaging cycles can be closed. As part  of the  program, we create more transparency about different recycling  options using an explanatory logo on the product packaging. The program  is a project within the scope of the    Sustainable Packaging Coalition,  an association of industrial companies, research institutes and public  authorities that aims to increase the general understanding of sustain- ability related to packaging and smarter packaging solutions. Using the slogan    \\u201cBe smarter. Recycle.,\\u201d the Beauty Care business unit  provides information about the correct handling of waste and the   recyclability of various types of packaging. In this way, we want to raise  consumer awareness of the concept of a    circular economy. Our contribution to the circularity of industrial products  Our Adhesive Technologies business unit makes it possible to keep  high-quality materials in circulation and turn waste into valuable  resources. By combining our expertise in materials with our innovative  technologies, we provide solutions that play an important role in the  transition to a circular economy and are driving a rethink in industrial  design and production. Our approach to promoting a circular economy  is centered around the following factors.  \\u2022 Recyclability: Our easily recyclable or reusable packaging design  solutions deliver recyclability at the end of the value chain. We are  developing adhesives for this purpose, for example, which are optimized  for recycling PET bottles and substantially improve the recycling rate  and quality by ensuring that the bottle label can be removed cleanly.  We also offer our customers solutions for the innovative redesign  of products and packaging. One example of this is our novel    EPIX  coatings for the development of sustainable and safe food packaging  based on paper. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  76 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS   \\u2022 Debonding: A circular value chain depends on recognizing and con- serving the value of materials. Debonding makes it possible to repair,  reuse and recycle products and product parts, and to separate materials  that are not suitable for collective recycling. As such, this is an import- ant lever for extending the useful life of products and recovering the  value of materials at the end of a product\\u2019s life cycle. Our adhesive  solutions contribute to these efforts by facilitating product repair. Our     Teroson hotmelt solutions are one example. Using these solutions,  headlights can be opened up for lens component repair, such as for  replacing an LED module, without damaging the lens or housing.   At the end of the value chain, our technologies, such as adhesives that  enable material separation in multilayer flexible packaging, support  the separation of materials that cannot be recycled collectively.  \\u2022 Renewable carbon: Henkel has been a founding member of the     Renewable Carbon Initiative since 2020. This aims to promote  acceleration of the transition from fossil-based to renewable carbon for  all organic chemicals and materials. Henkel Adhesive Technologies is  also carrying out pioneering work with new solutions for adhesives,  sealants and functional coatings that replace fossil carbon-based raw  materials with renewable materials. This reduces the carbon footprint  of our products and supports our customers in reducing their emissions  along the value chain. In addition, we contribute to a circular economy  by reducing the consumption of resources.  We are committed to using recycled materials as a renewable carbon  source, both for our product packaging and as part of our product   formulas. For example, the packaging material of one of our    Pattex  insulating foams is made from 25 percent recycled steel, and 98 percent  post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic in the cap. Additionally, 16 percent  of the ingredients are derived from recycled material.  \\u2022 Bio-based adhesives: We have also developed a range of bio-based  adhesives. To this end, we are working with our suppliers to advance  the concept of mass balance. This is a transparent model for tracking  the amount of certified and non-certified material along the entire  production process. Because the principle of mass balance enables the  drop-in of renewable carbon-based raw materials into existing processes,  it is an important step for a gradual transition to the use of renewable  resources. In 2021, three production sites of our Adhesive Technologies  business unit were fully certified under    ISCC PLUS, a globally recog- nized certification system for mass balance.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  77 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Partnerships along the value chain A key partner on the journey toward better recycling of waste and estab- lishing a circular economy is the social enterprise    Plastic Bank, which  works to reduce plastic waste in nature, including in the world\\u2019s oceans,  while at the same time offering new opportunities to people who live in  poverty \\u2013 especially in countries where recycling infrastructure for waste  disposal is non-existent or inadequate. In 2017, Henkel became the first  major global consumer goods company to partner with Plastic Bank. In  2021, Henkel and Plastic Bank started to expand the recycling infrastructure  in Egypt, opening ten collection centers in the Cairo area. This commitment  will be steadily expanded over the next few years. By 2023, the goal is for  the partners to achieve an annual capacity for 5,000 metric tons of plastic.  Plastic Bank is building recycling ecosystems in countries that lack   adequate waste management infrastructure. Collectors receive compen- sation for the materials they collect, which helps them meet the basic  needs of their families \\u2013 including food, cooking fuel such as charcoal  for preparing daily meals, and paying for schooling or health insurance.  The plastic collected is reprocessed as Social Plastic\\u00ae, which can be used  again in products and packaging as part of a closed-loop supply chain.  Henkel and Plastic Bank aim to create around 1,000 jobs in Egypt over a  period of two years by building a long-term recycling infrastructure. This  will have a direct positive impact on more than 4,000 Egyptian citizens. Henkel already uses Social Plastic\\u00ae in a number of its packaging products.  Hair and body care brand Nature Box was the first cosmetics brand to use  Social Plastic\\u00ae as a packaging material for its entire bottle portfolio. All  shampoo bottle bodies are made of 100 percent Social Plastic\\u00ae. In our  Laundry & Home Care business unit, the    Pro Nature product range has  switched to PET bottles made from 100 percent recycled plastic, up to  50 percent of which is Social Plastic\\u00ae. The bottle body of limited edition  Pril dishwashing liquid, launched in 2021, is made from 100 percent  Social Plastic\\u00ae and the bottle cap is now made from 84 percent recycled  material. In 2021, 723 metric tons of Social Plastic\\u00ae were processed at  Henkel, making a total of more than 1,480 metric tons processed since the  partnership began in 2017. Henkel\\u2019s experts are engaged in several cross-industry initiatives to drive  innovation in packaging development and to find effective solutions that  can be developed on a large scale. Our membership in the    New Plastics  Economy (NPEC), an initiative of the    Ellen MacArthur Foundation  that brings together different stakeholders to shape the future of plastics  and create momentum for a circular economy, is an important example  of our engagement in this area. Other initiatives include the    Alliance  to End Plastic Waste (AEPW),    European Plastics Pact and    U.S. Plastics  Pact,    CEFLEX and the    Circular Economy Initiative Deutschland.  The    Plastic Waste Coalition of Action was formed from the    Consumer  Goods Forum (CGF) in 2020. In this coalition, Henkel is working with  35 other companies on the basis of Golden Design Rules to develop a  more circular approach to the design and processing of plastic packaging  in the consumer goods industry. In 2020, Henkel was also a founding  723 metric tons of Social Plastic\\u00ae  processed at Henkel 10 collection centers  in Egypt HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  78 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  member of the    UN Treaty on plastic pollution. Together with 28 other  major global companies, Henkel will endorse a business manifesto  against plastic pollution. We have also teamed up with different organizations that are working  on improving recycling infrastructure to enable a circular economy.  Appropriate systems for recycling packaging materials are not in place in  many areas, especially in developing countries. For example, Henkel has  been working with    TerraCycle in a number of countries since 2016.  This organization offers recycling solutions for materials that are difficult  to recycle. It is also important to work hand-in-hand with our retail   partners to promote a functioning circular economy. This includes  member ship in the Recyclate Forum.  In 2021, the new    Cospatox Consortium evolved from the Recyclate  Forum. It includes distributors, manufacturers, recyclers, packaging   producers, and other members. The abbreviation is short for Cosmetic  Packaging Toxicology. In this project, industrial companies are working  together to develop a standard for high-quality plastic recyclates for   cosmetics packaging, and detergents and cleaning products.  Innovations for the future  \\u2022 In 2019, Henkel and the packaging manufacturer Alpla jointly produced  bottle bodies based on chemically recycled plastic for the first time.  Plastic waste that is not recycled by mechanical recycling can be  returned to the cycle through chemical recycling. Chemical recycling  can complement mechanical recycling. By using chemical recycling,  material made from fossil resources can be replaced by recycled material  made from plastic waste. The pilot project using Perwoll bottles is part  of    BASF\\u2019s ChemCycling project.  \\u2022 For many years, black plastic packaging posed a challenge to the   recycling value chain due to the colorant that was previously used to  make it black. Together with its supplier Ampacet, a global masterbatch   producer, Henkel began working on an innovative solution for black  plastic packaging that is fully recyclable in 2019. The new packaging  material uses an alternative black colorant that is carbon-free, so that  bottles can be returned to the value chain after use. The    Cyclos-HTP  Institute, which specializes in classifying, assessing and certifying the  recyclability of packaging and products, has confirmed that Henkel\\u2019s  bottles, in black color and carbon-free, are fully detectable and sortable.

The  KeelClip\\u2122 replaces the outer packaging for beverage cans made from   single-use plastic with solutions made from recycled cardboard. Persil Eco Power Bars These compact detergent bars help to reduce packaging waste. The product  contains 97 percent less plastic packaging per wash load than for conven- tional liquid detergents. In addition, the packaging is made of recycled and  recyclable cardboard. The film used for the tabs is biodegradable and  100 percent water-soluble.  Nature Box as recyclable refills Selected shampoos and shower gels from our natural cosmetics brand  Nature Box (like the nourishing repair shampoo Avocado or the revitalizing  shower gel Pomegranate) have been available in refill packs in stores since  2021. The refill packaging can be recycled. Manufacturing these packages  requires around 74 percent less plastic than bottles of the same capacity.  \\u2022 One of the most pressing challenges on the journey to a circular economy  for packaging is the need to improve the sorting of consumer waste  through accurate identification. One particularly promising approach  here is to capture and decode digital watermarks using a high-resolution  camera mounted on the waste sorting system. Depending on the marking  that is picked up, the system can then sort the packaging waste into the  appropriate categories of material. This would lead to better and more  precisely sorted flows of waste, as well as higher quality recycled  material. Since September 2020, Henkel has been one of more than  85 companies and organizations in the new    HolyGrail 2.0 initiative,  which is a pioneering initiative for digital watermarks for better  recycling of packaging. Following the first HolyGrail project, which was  led by the    Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the next phase, HolyGrail  2.0, was implemented on a much larger scale and scope. This included  commissioning an industrial test facility to determine how effective  watermarking technology is in delivering more accurate  sorting of  packaging waste and higher quality recycling. It also involved conduct- ing a large-scale assessment of the business viability of this technology.  Henkel is cooperating in the tests with packaging for its Vernel and  Pattex products. The aim is to gain more insight into how digital  watermarking technology could improve the sorting of PET bottles  with perforated sleeves and PE cartridges for silicone sealant. Over  100,000 packaging samples and a total of 250 different packages were  successfully tested in 2021. The recognition rate was more than 97 per- cent. Henkel is using digital watermarking technology in a product  line for its fabric softener brand Vernel.

In January 2019, Henkel invested in  the    Circularity European Growth Fund I LP, an impact fund managed  by Circularity Capital. This investment of 5 million pounds sterling enables  Henkel to drive its venturing activities forward while also supporting the  development of a circular economy.  Henkel invested in the recycling start-up    Saperatec in 2019. The recycling  specialist has developed a new type of patented technology that can be  used, for example, to separate and recycle aluminum-containing flexible  composite packaging. In July 2020, Henkel became the first company in the world to issue a     \\u201cPlastic Waste Reduction Bond\\u201d. The bond is a private placement with  the Japanese insurance companies Dai-ichi Life and Dai-ichi Frontier Life  as anchor investors. The proceeds will be invested in projects participating  in Henkel\\u2019s activities to reduce plastic waste.  Reducing production waste We aim to reduce production waste and promote a circular economy in  our operations. We drive this process by systematically identifying  waste streams and creating closed-loop systems where possible. We are  focusing on increasing recycling at our sites and working closely with  our partners in the value chain \\u2013 suppliers, customers, and recycling and  disposal companies. Our initiatives are centered around three key areas:   \\u2022 Reducing material consumption and waste generation.  \\u2022 Reusing materials.  \\u2022 Recycling materials.  In line with our goal of reducing our environmental footprint, we intend  to reduce the total volume of waste* by 50 percent per metric ton of   product by 2025 compared to a 2010 baseline. We achieved a reduction  of 42 percent in 2021. We are also reaffirming our ambition to achieve  closed-loop management of waste materials in our production by 2030. A further goal is to stop disposing of production waste* in landfills at all  production sites, including for our industrial business, by 2030. Overall,  78 percent of our production sites had already achieved this target by  the end of 2021. These include the adhesives plants in \\u00c9pernon, France;  North Kansas City, USA; Bangpoo, Thailand; Zuhai, China; Quilicura,  Chile; Elgin, Scotland, and Montorn\\u00e8s del Vall\\u00e8s, Spain.

A digital tool is used to document waste flows, types of  waste and disposal/recycling paths, which is also the basis for our other  measures. We record more than 600 waste streams worldwide in the  Laundry & Home Care business unit alone, and we present this information  transparently to all relevant stakeholders. We integrate this data into our  \\u201cdigital backbone\\u201d so that company managers can analyze and compare  data on locations and development over time.  We see this as an essential mechanism for facilitating the exchange of  best practices and as a milestone in creating transparency worldwide. This  transparency also includes a detailed overview of the entire waste life  cycle \\u2013 from generation to disposal. The Adhesive Technologies business  unit also uses a system for the classification, compliance  testing,  reporting and control of waste streams for its production plants and  research centers. This makes it possible to identify differences between  sites that generate similar types of waste. We then develop  specific  improvement actions and share best practices throughout the company.  Raw material packaging accounts for a significant share of the total  amount of waste generated at our sites. For this reason, our Adhesive  Technologies business unit has launched an initiative to reuse materials.  In this way, we are striving to implement circular thinking and reduce  packaging waste in cooperation with our suppliers. In 2021, projects  under this initiative led to a reduction of \\u2013 4 percent compared to 2020.  The initiative will continue in 2022 and will be extended to all regions.  Raw material packaging frequently consists of drums and pallets, big  bags and other containers used to transport goods. We aim to actively  manage use cycles and reuse these materials. At our adhesives site in  Bogot\\u00e1, Colombia, we implemented a reverse logistics program with our  raw material suppliers. This program reuses the metal drums that are  used for transporting chemicals, and avoids sending empty drums to be  disposed of as hazardous waste. In Chile and Brazil, we recycled more  than 7,000 additional pallets through an initiative in 2021.  The Beauty Care site in Geneva, New York, has undertaken another   collaborative project with a waste management company to reuse  wastewater as cooling water. This initiative reduced the amount of  wastewater disposal by 2,000 metric tons from January to September  2021, and our partner avoided the use of fresh water. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  82 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  NATURAL RESOURCES Biodiversity and responsible resource management Growing consumption and resource scarcity due to an increasing global  population and accelerated economic activity are putting more and  more pressure on ecosystems. The negative effects are already being felt:  according to a report published by    IPBES (Intergovernmental Science-  Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services), human activities  are threatening nearly 1 million species with extinction. Conserving species  diversity and biodiversity is important to Henkel, as intact ecosystems  and soil biodiversity are essential as a basis for sustainable agriculture and  the use of raw materials in production. Our 2021 stakeholder survey  results showed that biodiversity is also becoming an increasingly  important issue for our partners and other stakeholders.  We follow current efforts to protect biodiversity and deforestation very  closely, such as the EU\\u2019s Deforestation Regulation. We continue to  develop our approach in line with the resulting expectations. This also  includes dialog and collaboration with external stakeholders, as well as  industry initiatives such as the European brand association    AIM. In  September 2020, we signed up to the    Business for Nature\\u2019s Call to Action  to urge governments to incorporate nature in their policymaking. We  also participated in the    Consumer Goods Forum initiative against  worldwide deforestation and for the protection of biodiversity. And we  are working with the development organization    Solidaridad to   support smallholders in the palm oil and palm kernel oil sector in projects  that promote climate-smart agricultural practices.  Our \\u2192 sustainability strategy aims to protect and restore biodiversity \\u2013  with a particular focus on forests, land and water. In addition to applying  these principles to the activities at our own sites, we also promote the  responsible management of raw materials and the use of renewable inputs.  In 2021, we started to identify the potential impacts on biodiversity of our  production sites by identifying and mapping their geographical location  and assessing their proximity to important biodiversity areas. This  will enable us to develop comprehensive measures and programs. We  are also participating in a research project by the international consultancy     Globe Scan, which is designed to better understand challenges in the  context of nature and biodiversity, and to identify solutions to protect and  restore nature. \\u201c Protecting natural   resources\\u00a0and biodiversity  is\\u00a0important to us \\u2013 as it  is\\u00a0to our customers and   consumers.

We are also working to further increase the proportion of  ingredients based on renewable raw materials in our cosmetic products  and to use fewer fossil resources, wherever this is possible and appropriate.  As an example, we have been using potato starch in our new Taft mousse  since 2021. Another example of our responsible use of raw materials is  the use of guar and guar derivatives as a key source of plant-based raw  materials. Guar is a nourishing ingredient that is used, for example, in  hair care products from our natural cosmetics brand    Nature Box.  Henkel\\u2019s Nature Box brand supports guar farmers in the desert region  of Bikaner in Rajasthan, India. They learn sustainable guar farming  methods and receive assistance in planting their own vegetable gardens.  Nature Box also supports sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil   production together with Solidaridad. Renewable raw materials are historically one of the major sources of raw  materials for laundry detergents and household cleaners. For example,  soap \\u2013 which has traditionally been used to wash laundry as well as for  personal hygiene \\u2013 has been made from vegetable or animal oils and fats.  Today, most laundry detergents and household cleaners consist of a large  number of ingredients, each with its own special function. Most bulk  ingredients of detergents and household cleaners are inorganic and  therefore cannot be replaced by ingredients based on renewable raw  materials. Surfactants are an important exception. They consist of a lipo- philic (fat-loving) part, which is obtained from vegetable or mineral oils,  and a hydrophilic (water-loving) part, which is usually based on mineral  oil or is inorganic. Surfactants like alkyl polyglycosides that are produced  only from renewable raw materials are the exception. To achieve the best  washing performance, we use a mixture of different surfactants. In more  than half of them, the lipophilic part is based on renewable raw materials.  A responsible approach to raw materials Use of nature-based raw materials  Henkel is committed to responsible management of raw materials, and  especially the conservation of natural resources and biodiversity. We  use ingredients based on renewable raw materials to optimize the overall  characteristics of our products, wherever this is compatible with environ- mental, economic and social considerations. Renewable raw materials  are already key ingredients in many of our products, such as detergents,  soaps, shampoos, glue sticks and wallpaper adhesives. We are also   committed to environmental and social considerations when purchasing  renewable raw materials.  Many of our consumer and industrial adhesives are based on nature-based  raw materials, such as plant-based oils and their derivatives, as well as  tree resin and carbohydrates like starch, sugar and cellulose. Our    Pritt  glue stick, which was relaunched in 2021, is formulated with 97 percent  natural ingredients (including water). We also pioneer new solutions  for adhesives, sealants and coatings that replace fossil raw materials  with materials made from biomass. For example, we have developed a  high-performance hotmelt adhesive made of over 80 percent 1 bio-based  materials and with a significantly reduced carbon footprint. We work  with our suppliers to ensure sustainable sourcing of natural resources. Nature-based raw materials are used in all product groups in cosmetics \\u2013  not only in our soaps, shampoos and shower gels, but also in styling  products. We refer to the use of individual nature-based active ingredients  or fragrances if these are associated with specific properties \\u2013 for example,  the care properties of shea butter and yogurt or the soothing effect of  1  Combination of direct bio-based and certified mass balance transfer raw materials based on internal analyses HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  84 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Responsible use of palm oil and palm kernel oil Palm oil, palm kernel oil and their derivatives are two of the most  important renewable raw materials we use to manufacture ingredients  for our laundry detergents, household cleaners and cosmetic products.  We use less than 0.2 percent of the palm oil and palm  kernel oil produced  worldwide. In particular, we use palm kernel oil as the basis for surfactants.  Palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the world and comes  from a highly efficient crop: for the same yield, oil palm requires about  three times less land than rapeseed and as much as six times less than  soybeans. Unfortunately, palm oil cultivation, when done unsustainably,  is often associated with large-scale deforestation of rainforests.  For this reason, our goal is to ensure that the ingredients for our products  are made from    sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil. With this in  mind, we work with the companies from which we source our raw  materials and with other partners to exert influence on the palm oil supply  chain, from smallholders to consumers. With this approach, we seek to  further develop our supply chains to ensure full NDPE (No Deforestation,  No Peat, No Exploitation) compliance, and to ensure that the palm oils  and palm kernel oils that go into our products are not associated with  the deforestation of primary or secondary rainforests. Our palm oil  strategy through 2025 comprises three areas:  This is the result of Henkel\\u2019s many years of experience with ingredients  based on plant-based oils. 43 percent 1 of the surfactants for Henkel\\u2019s  laundry detergents and household cleaners are now based on renewable  raw materials. The remaining share is accounted for by inorganic and  mineral-oil-based ingredients. Zero net deforestation as a goal Forests function as carbon sinks and are key to protecting biodiversity.  They also provide us with wood and other raw materials. We are committed  to sourcing our raw materials sustainably and not through deforestation.  Our goal is to prevent the deforestation of primary and secondary forests  with significant ecological value. These include peat lands and other  high-carbon stock areas. This is why under our    Responsible Sourcing  Policy we are committed to zero net deforestation, and expect our  suppliers to support this aim.  We have been partnering with the international, non-profit organization     Rainforest Alliance since 2021 to minimize nature-related risks in  our value chain. The goal is to continue to develop our due diligence  approach to preventing deforestation, as well as to draft a comprehensive  policy in this area. We are also partners of the    Tropical Forest Alliance,  a multi-stakeholder partnership platform hosted by the    World Economic  Forum (WEF). Their primary goal is to promote deforestation- free supply  chains for the production of palm oil and palm kernel oil, beef, soy,  paper and pulp.  1 Calculation based on data of 2019.

Establish full traceability and transparency of the palm oil and  palm kernel oil used in our products: From our activities, we have  learned that there is a need for further optimization with regard to  transparency and traceability, especially for palm-kernel-oil-based  derivatives, and that cross-industry initiatives are necessary to make  the achievement of the \\u201czero net deforestation\\u201d target verifiable. In  2021, we increased the traceability rate to the mill to 84 percent and  the traceability rate to the plantation to 42 percent by engaging with  our suppliers to map our joint palm-based supply chain.1 We did this  with the support of an external sustainability consultancy. As part of  our supplier management activities, we  collaborate intensively  with our strategic suppliers to ensure the procurement of sustain- able raw materials. We use the Sustainable Palm Index (SPI) to assess  the progress of our suppliers with respect to their level of supply chain  knowledge, sustainable sourcing practices and compliance with the  NDPE Principles. We once again used the SPI to create a compliance  profile of our major suppliers of palm-oil-based raw materials in 2021.  This tool helps us to identify potential improvements and define  action plans together with our suppliers.  42\\u2009% traceability of palm (kernel)  oil back to the plantation 84\\u2009% traceability of palm   (kernel) oil back to the mill 1.  Cover 100 percent of our demand with oils that are certified or  externally confirmed as responsibly sourced: We plan to continue  to expand the certification of our raw materials in accordance with     RSPO\\u2019s Mass Balance model. We are also aiming at certification  according to the RSPO\\u2019s Segregation model for the portion of palm oil  and palm kernel oil that is directly sourced. We have achieved con- siderable progress in this area in recent years with a wide range of  measures. In fiscal year 2021, we were able to source 93 percent of our  total demand for palm oil, palm kernel oil and its derivatives as certified  raw materials in line with the    RSPO\\u2019s Mass Balance supply chain  model. Derivatives account for the majority of the palm-based materials  used by Henkel. Despite this strong achievement, we still encounter a  lack of availability of RSPO-certified materials in some of the markets  where we operate and for a number of selected derivatives of palm-  kernel-oil-based raw materials used in small quantities. In these   circumstances, we maintain an intensive dialog with our suppliers to  look for solutions or we rely on the import of raw materials. These  challenges continued to be compounded in 2021 by shortages in RSPO  certification as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are   confident that we will make further progress in the years ahead, yet we  must acknowledge that full transition of our global supply chains to  sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil remains challenging. 1 The survey was conducted in 2021 based on the supplier data for 2020.

Many of our projects were successfully completed  in 2020 and 2021. Last year, we were engaged in projects in Colombia,  Nicaragua and Nigeria. Building on the very good collaboration with  Solidaridad, we have developed specific plans for the next few years to  expand the commitment further.  Our project in Nicaragua, which was successfully completed in 2021,  focused on creating a 100-percent-RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil  sector involving smallholders. The project has accompanied 173 farmers  on their journey to certification and led to the creation of the first associ- ation of palm oil producers in Nicaragua. This enables smallholder farm- ers to cooperate in the transition to the RSPO standard and generate RSPO  credits. There was also an average yield increase of at least 13 percent.     Solidaridad\\u2019s National Initiatives for Sustainable and Climate-Smart  Oil Palm Smallholders (NISCOPS) and the    IDH Sustainable Trade   Initiative contribute to the attainment of self-sufficiency in palm oil  production in Nigeria. This includes teaching climate-smart agricultural  practices as well as the sustainable intensification of farms. This improves  the productivity and livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Henkel\\u2019s com- mitment helped to increase the capacity of farmers in Akwa Ibom and  Cross River states. The initiative involves the technical upgrading of  two mills and the construction of tree nurseries to grow improved  varieties that will increase crop yields and prevent deforestation through  the planting of new trees. The nurseries will be accompanied by training  courses that teach sustainable land use practices and topics related to  forest conservation.  3.  Improve the livelihoods of smallholders and protection of nature:  We are building on the success of our collaborative projects with  smallholders and will continue strengthening our commitment to  integrate raw materials delivered by these smallholders into our  supply chain. Greater consideration is also given to ecological aspects  while supporting climate-friendly agriculture and a positive impact on  biodiversity. To date, around 36,400 smallholders have been reached  on some 340,000 hectares under cultivation.   Support for smallholder farmers Smallholders produce about 40 percent of the world\\u2019s palm oil, yet  their productivity and the quality of their products are much lower com- pared to large plantations. They often lack access to technical knowledge  and financial services that are crucial to improving their production.  Some farmers are also concerned that access to the palm oil market will  be limited if their harvests do not meet the criteria set out by the RSPO.  This is because many major buyers of palm oil have committed to buying  only oil products that are certified as sustainable. In collaboration with  the development organization    Solidaridad, Henkel is addressing these  challenges. We have partnered with Solidaridad on initiatives in Colombia, Ghana,  Honduras, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua and Nigeria since 2013. The  focus was on training in best practice approaches, including climate-  ~36,400 smallholders reached HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  87 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Reducing paper consumption, ending deforestation Demand for paper products is increasing worldwide. According to the     World Wildlife Fund (WWF), 13 to 15 percent of all wood consump- tion is used in the production of pulp, paper and packaging products. If  wood is sourced and produced in an unsustainable manner, it can lead  to deforestation in areas of high ecological value. We aim to source  100 percent of the paper and board material used in our packaging as  recycled material or \\u2013 where the use of virgin fiber is required \\u2013 from  sustainably managed forestries. All suppliers of paper-based packaging materials must confirm that  they are compliant with our procurement guidelines as part of our  onboarding process. We expect them to support our goal of net zero  deforestation. Creating more transparency in the supply chain is focus of  our cooperation with our suppliers of paper-based packaging. This  involves the traceability of the materials we buy, especially in the case  of suppliers that source virgin fibers from high-risk countries. In these  circumstances, we work together on measures to minimize risk.  We conducted a comprehensive survey of our main suppliers in the   corrugated board and printed paper sector in 2020. This approach pro- vided transparency on the business conduct of those tier one suppliers  which represent 93 percent of our spend in this area. The results showed  that 69 percent of our suppliers were using recycled material in 2020.  Around 86 percent of suppliers use at least one or more certification   systems.    FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certification was most  commonly cited, followed by    PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement  of Forest Certification) and    SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative). Other initiatives for sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil  We support the physical transformation toward the use of certified  products in the industry and the shift in the market toward certified  sustainable palm oil products. A multi-stakeholder approach is at the  core of our initiative for sustainable management of palm oil and palm  kernel oil. Through partnerships, projects and dialog, we engage with  key players and are expanding our contribution to sustainable practices  in the palm oil industry.  Henkel is a committed founding member of the    Forum for Sustainable  Palm Oil (FONAP) in Germany and is a member of several of its working  groups. This collaboration between companies, NGOs, associations and  political bodies is pursuing the goal of significantly increasing the pro- portion of  sustainably produced palm oil, while also improving existing  standards and certifications. We are also actively involved in the Round- table on Sustainable Palm Oil (   RSPO). The RSPO standard increasingly  includes compliance with human rights along the entire supply chain, in  addition to environmental aspects. In April 2021, our Global Supply  Chain organization was again successfully certified in line with the  RSPO\\u2019s supply chain standard. Henkel, along with other leading consumer goods manufacturers and  companies in the oleochemical industry, is a member of the cross-industry     Action for Sustainable Derivatives (ASD) initiative. The primary  objective of the initiative is to generate more transparency in the complex  value chain for palm derivatives.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  88 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Careful use of water as an important resource The Earth\\u2019s water resources are unequally distributed and are threatened  by climate change as well as increasing pollution and overuse. We  recognize the importance of using this resource responsibly, particularly  as healthy water ecosystems are key to protecting biodiversity. Water  plays an important role along our value chain. We use water for our  production processes and as an ingredient for our products, and many  of our products also require water in the use phase.  For this reason, reducing water usage during the production and use of  our products is an important aim for us. In order to identify suitable  approaches for improvements in this area, we have worked with various  stakeholders in recent years. In 2021, for example, we reassessed our  impact on water along the value chain with the support of external part- ners as part of our sustainability strategy development. This included  examining the water footprint of raw materials, our production processes  and the consumption of water during the use of our products, as well as  the treatment of wastewater. Water risk analysis The global availability of water is affected by regional and seasonal  scarcities. There are also differences in the availability and performance  of wastewater treatment facilities, as well as differences in the specific  environmental characteristics of individual water bodies. To identify  production sites that are located in water-stressed regions, in 2021 we  conducted water scarcity research on a global scale using the    World  Resource Institute\\u2019s (WRI)    Aqueduct\\u2122 tool. We took into account  qualitative, quantitative and regulatory risks for all sites, as well as water  risk forecasts for the year 2030. Each production site was assessed, taking  into account its precise geo-coordinates and nearby water basins and  watersheds.  We have been reporting our water consumption in hydrologically  stressed areas since 2020 and have reaffirmed our ambition to focus on  saving water in regions where water is in short supply. We conducted  workshops with partners on the topic of water in 2021 to reflect this  ambition. For example, at the    Forum for the Future, we reflected on  risks, opportunities and future scenarios to help us further develop our  global strategy. One of the main results is that we aim to achieve circular  water use at key manufacturing sites by 2030. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  89 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Saving water during production We set the goal of using 35 percent less water per ton of product by 2025.  By the end of 2021, Henkel had saved 28 percent.   To achieve our goal, each production site carefully examines all options  for reducing water consumption and avoiding wastewater. Wastewater  from industrial applications is disposed of properly in accordance with  legal requirements. Where applicable, Henkel provides pretreatment with  state-of-the-art technologies for removing contaminants.  We source a significant proportion of our water from local supply  networks. We also use water from other sources, such as rainwater or  groundwater, to reflect local conditions. For example, to save water, our  Laundry & Home Care business unit uses online metering systems and  our Digital Backbone to identify optimization potential and increased  water consumption. Additionally, we continuously review and optimize  the amount of water needed to clean production lines when changing  the product that is being manufactured on the line. In doing this, we take  into account specific characteristics of the product that is being manu- factured before and after the changeover.  \\u2013\\u200928\\u2009% water use* At our site in Vienna, Austria, we began replacing the well water used  for cooling with a central, closed-loop cooling system, which saves us  up to 5,000 cubic meter of fresh water per month. This site is our show- case project for the use of recycled water in production plants. At the     Humen site in China, an additional filter system was installed for the  discharge of wastewater in 2021. This system allows the treated water to  be reused in cooling towers, saving around 4,000 cubic meter of fresh  water each year. Water treatment is an important process for us because we need a certain  quality of water for our production. At our sites in Ferentino, Italy, and in  6th of October, Egypt, we have invested in our existing water treatment  plants so that we can treat wastewater directly on site. This is the first  step to being able to use the purified water again in future phases of the  project. We also commissioned a new water treatment facility at our site  in Jundia\\u00ed, Brazil, which processes rainwater for reuse in applications such  as irrigation or for flushing toilets. This will reduce water consumption  and the amount of wastewater produced by 1,000 cubic meter annually.  At our site in Ankara, Turkey, we have similarly launched a pilot project  to collect rainwater with the aim of saving up to 1,700 cubic meter of  water per year.  * Base year 2010 HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  90 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET CLIMATE CIRCULAR ECONOMY NATURAL RESOURCES THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Conserving resources together with our consumers We want to encourage the responsible use of our products to reduce water  consumption. Life cycle analyses have shown that more than 90 percent  of the water and energy consumption of our rinse-off products occurs  during use. That is why our Beauty Care business unit leverages its brands  to raise awareness among customers about sustainable product use. We  do this by providing information on the products and on a comprehen- sive website, and through supporting measures in sales outlets as part of  our    \\u201cBe smarter.\\u201d initiative to explain how consumers can help conserve  resources. The focus here is on the area of water and, in particular, the  energy- intensive provision of hot water. The \\u201cBe smarter.\\u201d initiative now  includes 28 brands and more than 100 countries. We are also developing  products that do not require the use of water. Our leave-in conditioners  and dry shampoos do not require water for rinsing, for example. Preventing water pollution from microplastics  We are committed to ensuring that our consumer products do not cause  any    microplastics to enter the environment. We understand micro- plastics to refer to solid, insoluble plastic particles that are five millimeters  or smaller and are not biodegradable. These can enter rivers and oceans  via wastewater and accumulate there permanently. Several years ago, we stopped using microbeads in cosmetics, detergents  and cleaning products, which were used as exfoliating or abrasive   particles in certain products. In addition, we have been dealing more  closely with solid synthetic plastics. These solid synthetic plastics are  used as opacifiers in consumer products to give them a creamy white  appearance. In our cosmetic products, the switch to opacifiers that have a natural  origin or are biodegradable was nearly completed in spring 2021. The  last remaining  cosmetic products will be switched by the end of the  first quarter of 2022. For our other consumer products we replaced  opacifiers with poor biodegradability with a newly developed opacifier  with improved biodegradability in the second quarter of 2021. We   continue to pursue the technical challenge of using only natural or   biodegradable opacifiers and eliminating solid synthetic plastics as  soon as a suitable alternative is available for this purpose. Certain types of perfume encapsulation are also under discussion because  they are considered as microplastics. These encapsulated perfume oils  are used in fabric softeners and certain detergents to create long-lasting  fragrances with significantly less perfume than would otherwise be  required. We are already working together with our technology partners  to replace all synthetic perfume encapsulations with biodegradable  materials by the end of 2022 at the latest. We have already achieved success in using soluble, biodegradable  materials for encapsulation in other areas; for example, in the shells of  our pre-dosed liquid detergent capsules and dishwasher detergent tabs,  which consist of soluble polyvinyl alcohol foil.  To prevent improper disposal of our plastic product packaging from  contributing to ocean pollution, we are striving for a    circular economy  for plastics that is similar to existing systems. We will continue to  increase the recyclability of our packaging, while also increasing the  percentage of recycled material in our packaging.

We also seek to engage and empower them to become  actively involved in sustainability in their work environment and in their  private lives.  This initiative builds on our Sustainability Ambassador Program, which  has trained more than 50,000 motivated employees at our sites around  the world since 2012. Alongside an eLearning program on our core global  learning platform, this approach was specifically implemented through  team training sessions, which were conducted worldwide in more than  30 different languages using standardized training materials. In addition  to discussing the fundamental principles of sustainability \\u2013 from concept  to key global challenges \\u2013 the training material also explains how Henkel  is responding to these challenges and implementing  sustainability.  \\u201c The success of our sus\\u00ad tainability transformation  greatly depends on our  employees.

This purpose unites all of our employees. In order to continue to be inter- nationally successful, we want to acquire, develop and retain the best   talents for Henkel. We offer an inspiring and challenging working envi- ronment with flexible, digital work and a value-oriented leadership  style. Our corporate culture is based on continuous open feedback and  on appreciation for outstanding performance \\u2013 both through attractive  compensation and through individual and long-term development  opportunities. We strengthen our global team by valuing diversity and  cultural backgrounds, interacting openly and constructively with each  other, and looking after the health and safety of our people. The role of  our employees is anchored in a central position in our newly launched  \\u2192 2030+ Sustainability Ambition Framework and is closely linked to  the pillar \\u201cThriving Communities\\u201d.   Commitment to sustainable development  Sustainability is one of our five    corporate values. It means that we strive  to create a balance between people, planet and profit. When it comes to  implementing our \\u2192 sustainability strategy, it is our people who make  the difference \\u2013 through their dedication, skills and knowledge. Because  of this, we want to foster our people\\u2019s commitment to sustainability.  And we have expanded our existing training offers to include a holistic  engagement program, which will be rolled out at the beginning of 2022.  52,450 employees HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  94 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  In addition, we want to enable our employees to engage in volunteer  projects and make their own contribution to the communities in which  we operate. For example, our \\u2192 \\u201cMIT Volunteering\\u201d (Make an Impact on  Tomorrow) initiative is designed to support our employees and pensioners  around the world in their volunteer work for charitable organizations. Employee development We promote the skills and knowledge of our employees to help them  achieve their full potential. Regular and open feedback about performance  and potential serves as a foundation for their development. This makes  it easier to define individual development measures that address both  the company\\u2019s needs and each employee\\u2019s potential. We focus on  \\u2192 digital learning opportunities and the development of digital skills  so that we can take full advantage of the opportunities offered by these  technologies.  Individual development planning through regular feedback To foster the targeted development of our employees, we make use  of regular development meetings and individual development plans.  This helps us to systematically identify and develop talents within the  company, and to plan internal succession.  With this knowledge, our employees can make an important contribution  to sustainability at our sites, and by engaging with our customers and  other partners within our business environment. Our \\u201cSay yes! to the future\\u201d initiative, for example, provides Henkel sales  representatives from all business units around the world with training in  sustainability topics that apply to sales, going beyond the content of the  Sustainability Ambassador program. They then apply this knowledge  in joint projects with our trade partners \\u2013 in logistics, for example, or by  promoting sustainable purchasing decisions. The \\u201c(Y)our move toward sustainability\\u201d initiative at Henkel, by compar- ison, focuses on water and energy consumption and the amount of waste  generated at our sites. It encourages employees to make a contribution  to sustainability in these areas, for example by avoiding unnecessary  printing, switching off lights or eating healthily. As part of another project, we offer employees the opportunity to visit  schools and teach children about sustainable action in their everyday  lives. This helps the next generation to understand how to use resources  efficiently from an early age. At the same time, the children multiply the  impact by imparting their knowledge and enthusiasm to others around  them. School visits are an important element of our commitment to  reaching schoolchildren through educational initiatives.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  95 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS   \\u2022 For our non-managerial employees, we use locally customized   evaluation and development systems. In many countries, supervisors  assess their employees on the basis of their achievements and hold  confidential feedback conversations with them. The meetings are  followed by specific development measures. These can include   training in the workplace, such as seminars and workshops, as well  as job enlargement, for example by taking on management tasks.   \\u2022 Our managers and selected non-managerial employees are assessed  every year in the globally standardized Talent Management Cycle. This  includes a performance evaluation and potential assessment as two  separate steps. To evaluate performance, managers and employees  agree on an individual role ambition at the beginning of a year, which  contributes to the fulfillment of the company\\u2019s strategic objectives.  This is re-validated in the middle of the year and then evaluated at the  end of the year.  The potential assessment is based on a self-assessment by the employees  and an evaluation conducted by their supervisors. The evaluation is  made on the basis of uniform principles and clearly defined criteria such  as expected leadership behavior. Supervisors then discuss the assessment  results with their employees in personal feedback meetings and, together,  they agree on individual development measures. In 2021, more than  1,500 managers were promoted. Henkel has been using a    digital feedback tool to complement the  assessment interviews since 2021. Employees can use this tool to receive  recognition and direct feedback from colleagues and superiors alike \\u2013  at any time. The objective is to promote a day-to-day culture of dynamic  and open feedback at Henkel. Career launch and lifelong learning programs Henkel helps many young people embark on a successful career. The  company offers 25 vocational training and five dual-study programs in  Germany. In the 2021 training year, 138 new trainees and students started  pursuing a professional qualification at Henkel. A total of 498 people  are participating in our vocational training programs at nine German  locations.  Lifelong learning is a core element of continuous development at our  company. Learning as part of everyday work, as well as through handling  a varied range of tasks, is particularly important for us. Henkel encourages  this by offering opportunities to take advantage of new roles both locally  and in other countries. We learn from supervisors, team members, and  other colleagues on a daily basis. For some years now, Henkel has been  using virtual services to train its employees worldwide, in addition  to conventional attendance-based formats. To do this, we use a global  learning platform that includes virtual sharing formats along with  eLearning, podcasts and videos. As all services on the Henkel Learning  Hub are cloud-based, they can be accessed at any time \\u2013 not only in the  office environment, but also on the road or at home.  In 2021, we continued to expand our training formats in line with our  Purposeful Growth agenda. We developed and digitalized new global and  regional learning programs. There was a particular focus on programs  relating to health and wellbeing. For the first time, we organized a global  25 vocational training and  five dual-study programs HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  96 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  developing our digital skills training portfolio and advancing the  training of our employees in skills that will be relevant in the future.   \\u2022 Digital learning formats also play an important role for us in making  training opportunities available flexibly worldwide. Where possible,  general in-person training courses are complemented by digital and  virtual services. As part of a partnership between Henkel and LinkedIn  Learning, all employees with PC access are able to choose from more  than 15,000 online courses in seven languages.  \\u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the digital trans- formation in the world of work, and has greatly expanded and rein- forced virtual collaboration. In this context, IT security has become  more important than ever. Therefore, Henkel has further expanded  its Group-wide cyber-awareness campaigns. To increase employee  awareness of cyber attacks, the company organized numerous events  virtual learning week in 2021 to further expand the learning culture at  Henkel and to offer employees a range of business insights in the areas  of sustainability, innovation, digitalization and culture. This event drew  more than 6,200 participants from all over the world together for four  days of learning. Through these and other digital formats, our employees  were able to learn together even during the time when attendance-based  training was limited due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the average  training time of our employees was around 2.3 days.  Expansion of digital training opportunities  \\u2022 We structure the learning content in a way that allows us to react more  quickly and individually to new requirements for knowledge within  the organization. The Henkel Learning Hub hosts all formal training  courses in one place. These include basic knowledge \\u2013 such as man- agement, process, and software training \\u2013 as well as content specific  to our business units and material related to improving soft skills.  Leadership skills represent a key element of the learning content.  The main aim is to train new competencies and skills that will provide  our managers with the best possible preparation for future challenges.  Based on our Leadership Commitments, we want to foster a global,  \\u2192 value-oriented leadership standard that takes account of different  regional and cultural considerations.   In addition, digital transformation represents a key element of the  learning content. Our    \\u201cDigital Upskilling\\u201d initiative is designed to  provide targeted support for employees in expanding their digital  skills. It is based on two pillars and an in-depth analysis of the status  quo: Anonymous online surveys are used to assess employees\\u2019 digital  skills. This includes both a playful quiz about digital general knowledge  ( Digital BaseFit) and an analysis of experts\\u2019 professional and specialist  skills (Digital ExpertFit).

For this reason, it is important to recognize  our people\\u2019s performance through appropriate, competitive remuneration  in line with the market. We use performance-based components of  compensation in order to reward individual contributions. In contrast  to the globally standardized remuneration system for our managers, the  compensation systems for our non-managerial employees are based  on local requirements and existing collective agreements. There is no   systematic difference between the compensation received by male  and female employees. In addition to fixed and performance-based  components of pay, our remuneration system also includes benefits in  kind and social security components.  Individual performance as a compensation criterion Our remuneration system has as its foundation an appropriate and  competitive level of basic pay, which all employees receive, respectively, in  accordance with local market conditions and the collective agreements  in place. It takes into account the demands of the job and the employee\\u2019s  individual performance and development potential. In addition to the  basic pay, we strive to reward the individual performance of our employees  with attractive incentives:   \\u2022 For our non-managerial employees, we use locally adapted compen- sation components to reward their performance and their contribution  to the company\\u2019s success. Depending on the nature of the job and  region, there are various bonus systems for employees, for example  in sales and production. These systems cover almost all of our non-  managerial employees worldwide.  and presentations on the subject of cyber security, specifically as part  of the worldwide Cyber Awareness Month in October 2021. Flexible working prioritized  At Henkel, we measure performance by results and not by presence.  This is why we have been promoting flexible working models for many  years. Based on a culture of trust, part-time work, flexible working hours,  new workplace concepts and mobile working are a natural part of our  work \\u2013 and not just since the COVID-19 pandemic. By signing our global     Work-Life Flexibility Charter in 2012, the Management Board has  been emphasizing the importance of this topic at Henkel for many years.  Our managers are instructed to put opportunities for flexible working  into practice and to support them actively.  The pandemic has hastened a number of developments at Henkel. This  situation has again highlighted how well virtual collaboration and  mobile working work, as well as how important it is to pull together as  a team. We leverage these experiences and insights to actively shape  and develop our corporate culture and working environment. We want  to create the    workplace of the future for our company and our  employees. Our sites and offices will at all times serve as places to work  together and exchange ideas with colleagues. At the same time, a future-  oriented working environment also offers employees more flexibility  and freedom to find an optimal balance between their professional lives  and their private lives. Henkel developed its \\u201cSmart Work\\u201d program in  2021 to address this issue. This comprehensive concept provides a global  framework for mobile working and highlights the potential for improving  how our office landscapes support collabo ration among our employees,  the improvements that can be made through our health program, the  additional opportunities offered by digitalization, and how we at Henkel  can become even more sustainable.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  98 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  We always assess the performance of our employees in the context  of our vision and corporate values. We are committed to leadership in   sustainability \\u2013 this is one of our five corporate values. Accordingly,   contributions to Henkel\\u2019s sustainability strategy and to its targets form  part of the annual \\u2192 performance assessment, which influences variable  compensation. Where specific aspects of our sustainability performance,  such as the reduction of energy use and waste volumes, fall within the  sphere of influence of the employee concerned and have a clear bearing  on business performance (as in the case of site managers), these are  included in the individual performance assessment. In addition, almost  every manager has to confirm compliance with the    Henkel standards  in writing during their annual review. These include our Code of Corporate  Sustainability, the SHE Standards, and Social Standards. Our employee share plan We believe it is important for our employees to share in the success of  our business. This improves motivation, as well as the strength of   identification with the organization. Since 2001, Henkel has offered a  voluntary employee share plan. For each euro invested in 2021 by an  employee (limited to 4 percent of salary up to a maximum of 4,992 euros  per year), Henkel added 33 eurocents. Around 12,700 employees in  58 countries purchased Henkel preferred shares under this program in  2021. At year-end, around 18,400 employees held a total of around  2.8 million shares in the program\\u2019s securities accounts, representing  1.6 percent of total preferred shares outstanding. The lock-up period for  newly acquired shares is three years.  \\u2022 For our managers, we use short-term variable remuneration compo- nents to reward individual contributions to the company\\u2019s success. The  Short Term Incentive (STI), which is paid out annually, takes into account  both our short-term financial targets and each person\\u2019s individual  performance. Some of our managers with direct responsibility for sales  are compensated through separate bonus arrangements that focus on  sales-related targets, instead of through the STI.   \\u2022 For top management, the annual STI is complemented by a Long Term  Incentive (LTI) plan covering a period of four years. The objective of the  LTI plan is to motivate and retain our top managers, and to help them  view their tasks from the perspective of their shareholders.  \\u2022 For Management Board members, we also use an annual bonus, as  well as a bonus related to the company\\u2019s long-term success as variable  compensation elements. For details, please refer to the description of  the compensation system and the 2021 remuneration report. Both  documents are available on our website at    www.henkel.com/ir.  The performance parameters of the annual variable remuneration  (STI) are the financial targets achieved in the relevant fiscal year, the  bonus, and the individual performance and targets of the Management  Board members, including individually agreed sustainability targets. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  99 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Corporate culture of open communication and  trust-based collaboration We are building an environment of trust in our company that is open to  ideas and innovations, and that enables decisions to be made. This is  only possible with a successful management culture. We are committed  to communicating openly with our employees and their representatives,  and to pursuing constructive dialog. Our goal is to inform them about  important issues early and to involve them in the process. As a result, we  are in a position to successfully face challenges and changes in society,  the economy and politics in a way that enables us to remain competitive  for the future. With our    Leadership Commitments we want to establish a    corporate  culture in which employees show entrepreneurial spirit and initiative,  think proactively, put team spirit into practice and take responsibility \\u2013  no matter whether they lead a team or not. Henkel\\u2019s dedicated Leadership  Commitments communication platform offers a range of workshop,  learning and reflection elements to promote sustainable cultural change  at Henkel and to help make the Leadership Commitments our cultural  norm.  To obtain a clear picture of the status quo of our corporate culture, and to  identify strengths and potential improvements, in 2020 we conducted a  comprehensive employee survey, the Organizational Health Index (OHI).  Around 10,000 employees worldwide were invited to take part in this  anonymous survey with the aim of providing open and honest feedback.  Based on the results, which indicate a good overall score for Henkel\\u2019s   corporate health, we have defined clear fields of action. A wide range of  Social security services and benefits  Our employees worldwide benefit from a high level of social insurance  provisions. In countries where no state social insurance system exists or  such a system covers only basic needs, we organize our own measures and  initiatives to supplement state health and pension insurance provisions.  In the USA, for example, we cover our employees almost completely with  private health insurance plans. In addition, in many countries where this  is usual market practice, Henkel provides company pension provision plans.  In cooperation with the Allianz Insurance Group, we have been offering  all of our employees in Germany the opportunity to have selected   preventive health check-ups as private patients, with a free choice of  doctor and without any contribution to the costs. We also offer \\u201cHenkel  CareFlex,\\u201d a supplementary company nursing care insurance policy  developed jointly with the Industrial Union for Mining, Chemicals and  Energy. In this way, approximately 9,000 employees and trainees in   Germany have a basic insurance for outpatient, inpatient and semi-  inpatient care. The insurance is available without a medical examination  and waiting period. In addition to the basic insurance, employees can  add the supplementary long-term care insurance and can also add family  members, such as partners, children, parents or parents-in-law. Where appropriate, we would like to give our employees the opportunity  to individually structure their fringe benefits to suit their personal life  situation. In some countries, for example, we offer flexible solutions that  allow employees to pick and choose their own fringe benefits and top them  up. Over the past year, our employees in China, for example, have received  a credit balance that they can spend flexibly on more than 30 different  benefits, including health, risk management and lifestyle options.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  100 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  In Germany, Henkel also involves employee representatives in many  decision-making processes beyond those for which worker participation  is a statutory requirement. The results of this decades-long, open and  constructive cooperation between employers and employee representa- tives include, for example, an improved \\u2192 work-life balance, flexible  working hours, \\u2192 accident prevention and health protection in the  workplace, \\u2192 company pension plans and retirement schemes, and  preventive healthcare.  Dealing with structural changes  Preserving jobs and dealing with necessary structural changes responsibly  are important to us. In order to secure the company\\u2019s competitiveness,  we continually adapt our structures to market conditions. If jobs are  affected by this, we enter into a solution-oriented dialog with employee  representatives before actions are taken. In doing so, we follow all  applicable codetermination legislation and apply the required procedures  for each action. To date, we have been able to manage necessary restruc- turing measures through socially compatible solutions while reconciling  interests. The actions involved range from special semi-retirement  models and early retirement, through to support with professional  reskilling and refocus. measures were developed in 2021, some of which have already been  implemented, to further drive cultural change at Henkel. These include a  360\\u00b0 feedback tool, the simplification of internal processes to facilitate  faster decision-making and to increase the scope for creativity and  innovation, and the introduction of our \\u201cSmart Work\\u201d concept.  The important role of our employee representatives Our various employee representative bodies play a key role. An in-depth  exchange of views and consultations with our management takes place  at the operational level, for example with the local works councils, as  well as across companies with the trade union. We provide our employee  representatives with information regularly and on a timely basis, and  give them as much detail as possible about topics such as the corporate  strategy, for example. In countries where no employee representation is  planned or established, social dialog with the respective management  serves as a voluntary and informal instrument for close exchange. This  enables us to improve communication with our employees, include their  perspectives early on, and jointly shape future-oriented issues. It also  helps Henkel to avoid conflicts of interest and strengthens employee  identification with the company. Employee representation plays a partic- ularly important role in Europe. In 1995, Henkel was one of the first  German companies to voluntarily set up a European Works Council  (EWC) to continue the successful cooperation between management  and employee representatives at the European level. Through the EWC,  Henkel informs the representatives of its European companies about  matters such as the economic situation, transnational initiatives of the  company such as restructuring or reorganization programs, safety,  health and the environment, and training and development programs.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  101 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  As part of the    ERT initiative (European Round Table for Industry),  we signed a pledge to promote diversity and inclusion together with  53 business leaders. We also support the initiative    \\u201cBusiness for  Inclusive Growth\\u201d (B4IG), a global business coalition for inclusive  growth that is supported by the OECD and aims to pool and strengthen  the commitment of private companies to reduce inequality related to  opportunity, gender and region. Our commitment to diversity and  inclusion has been recognized several times in recent years, including  Henkel\\u2019s recognition as a    \\u201cDiversity Leader 2021\\u201d by Statista and the  Financial Times. As in previous years, global and regional campaigns related to diversity  and inclusion topics were held at our sites in various regions throughout  the year. Examples of this include the   #ChooseToChallenge initiative  for the International Women\\u2019s Day and the Diversity Talk Series in the  Asia-Pacific region. To foster our values-based culture, we also offered  interactive videos on the topic of Unconscious Bias, and eLearning  modules that were accessed more than 7,500 times in total. A new  anti-harassment compliance training was also introduced in 2021. Diversity & Inclusion as factors for success   and innovation At Henkel,    diversity and inclusion are a business imperative and  form an integral part of our corporate culture. We are convinced that a  diversified workforce, as well as an open and appreciative corporate   culture, are important success factors in a globalized world. Different  perspectives, cultures and ways of thinking enable us to meet the needs  of our increasingly diverse markets and stakeholders with creative and  innovative products, services and solutions. Through a number of   programs and training courses, we strengthen the understanding and  appreciation of diversity while promoting an inclusive corporate culture.  Diversity at Henkel represents the variety of talents, attitudes, per- spectives, strengths, abilities and characteristics of our employees and  business partners that make us unique and contribute to creativity,  innovation and business success. It is the differences of individuals in  our company, such as experience, values, education, gender, sexual  orientation, origin or religious background, that make us strong and  successful. We want to create an inclusive working environment in  which every employee is valued and individual performance is recognized.  On principle, we also fill our job vacancies exclusively according to  ability, potential and performance. We do not tolerate discriminatory  behavior either when we hire new employees or in our daily interaction  with each other. With our Global Diversity & Inclusion policy, we have  promised to further strengthen diversity and the related appreciative  behavior at Henkel.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  102 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  We also have a number of support programs for women in our business  units and functions around the world. In the Beauty Care business  unit, for example, a global, internal network called RISE was created  to promote gender balance in management positions, for example,  through the participation of women in a mentoring program. The aim  of the    Women into Science and Engineering program, run by the  Adhesive Technologies business unit, is to connect women at various  management levels with managers in the technology and engineering  sector worldwide to enable the sharing of skills and knowledge. Even  outside our own company, we are seeking to counteract the under- representation of women in technical professions and driving forward  gender diversity in the start-up and technology sector. Our digital unit  and platform for open innovation and collaboration, Henkel dx Ventures,  hosted the    Xathon for the third time in 2021, an ideation hackathon  for 100 female founders.   \\u2022 Internationality and origin: With employees from a total of 124 coun- tries, cultural diversity is a part of everyday working life at our company.  An international workforce composed of people with  different cultural  backgrounds is important in a global company like Henkel, as it enables  us to develop an understanding of our markets. To address the challenges  of mixed teams, we offer intercultural training and workshops to raise  awareness of different value systems and their influence on daily actions.  Henkel also encourages international transfers within employees\\u2019  career paths. 38.1\\u2009% ratio of women in   management positions 124 nationalities Our diversity dimensions  At Henkel, we pursue a holistic Diversity & Inclusion approach. The many  dimensions that define us as individuals include our education, family  and relationships, strengths and abilities, and personal experiences.  And while we recognize that all of these individual attributes contribute  to our diversity, our strategic initiatives focus on the following core  dimensions of diversity:  \\u2022 Gender: Our goal is to continuously increase the ratio of women in  the company at all levels, and we have the ambition to achieve gender  parity across all management levels by 2025. The percentage of women  in management positions was around 38 percent in 2021, representing  a further increase on the previous year. To achieve these ambitious   targets, we strive to make it even easier for women to combine their  careers with their personal life plans. We support our employees by  offering them flexible working models. These models include mobile  working, part-time and \\u2192 flexible working hours, job sharing and   tandem models, or sabbaticals. Another way we help families balance  work and family life is by offering childcare and \\u2192 social services. At  the D\\u00fcsseldorf site, there are 240 childcare places in three company  daycare centers. Henkel also offers care places for 75 children at the  company daycare center in Bratislava, Slovakia. In Germany, Henkel  is a partner in the initiative \\u201cSuccess Factor Family\\u201d. Through this  program, the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, together with the  central associations of German business and the German Trade Union  Federation (DGB), are committed to more family-friendliness in the  German economy.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  103 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  With three models for semi-retirement, we want to actively shape the  demographic change at Henkel. This enables our employees at all sites  in Germany to leave work up to six years early, depending on the semi-  retirement model. This provides particularly important support for  employees in demanding shift work. At the same time, we encourage the  targeted training of qualified young people by having their experienced  colleagues in semi-retirement coach them in direct preparation for  the tasks in a specific role.   \\u2022 People with disabilities: At Henkel, we foster a culture of inclusion  that focuses on the skills and individual talents of people with   disabilities. In 2021, we marked the International Day of Persons with  Disabilities as an opportunity to raise awareness of the topic among  all employees. A specially developed toolkit provides important infor- mation on the topic of inclusion. Through targeted programs,  including in our emerging markets, we strive to offer everybody the  same opportunities while always focusing on a person\\u02bcs individual  strengths rather than their limitations. One representative example of  this approach is an integration program at our Global Business Solu- tions Center in Manila, Philippines, which takes a holistic approach to  integrating people with disabilities into the world of work.  \\u2022 Sexual orientation: Henkel strives to create a working environment  that is open to all people regardless of their sexual orientation or identity.  We have LGBTQ+ networks in several countries and raise awareness of  the topic through a range of events and activities. During Pride Month  2021, we displayed the rainbow flag behind our corporate logo on our  global social media channels to express our solidarity with the LGBTQ+  community, as well as our support for the LGBTQ+ community through  internal and external outreach on Coming Out Day. Since 2021, Henkel  has also been a member of    Out Leadership, a global LGBTQ+ business  network that offers insights and information on LGBTQ+ topic and key  tools for companies and employees to promote equality.  \\u2022 Generations: At Henkel, four generations \\u2013 Baby Boomers, Gen X, Y  and Z \\u2013 work together under the same roof. We encourage \\u2192 life-long  learning across all generations through appropriate training measures.  Specifically, we use mentoring and employee networks in different  business units and countries to promote knowledge transfer and an  exchange of perspectives between experienced and less experienced  employees. We also offer employees of all generations a wide range of  programs for \\u2192 maintaining physical and mental health. Our social  services also help to provide support to employees facing challenges at  different stages of their lives such as when they take on responsibility  for relatives in need of care.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  104 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Our approach to global health management In order to ensure holistic health care at all sites, we work continuously  to establish uniform principles. These now include the availability of  first responders, the offer of flu shots and participation in the global  health campaign, as well as conducting emergency medical drills and  occupational health screenings. To monitor these health protection  measures, we collect metrics worldwide, which are reported annually  by all Henkel sites. In addition, the sites report occupational diseases as  soon as they have been officially confirmed by the authorities.  The Henkel Health Procedure describes the minimum global standards  for protecting and promoting health. In the implementation of internal  guidelines, programs and legal requirements, regional managers for  health, workplace safety and security provide support for management  and employees. In several regions, locally employed physicians also  act as health managers to oversee the local implementation of health  programs in the local language, taking local requirements into account.  Each year, company physicians from all Henkel sites in Germany join  together to share experiences and exchange best practice. Several annual  exchange activities for our global occupational safety officers and our  regional health and safety managers also take place. The global Head  of Health Management in D\\u00fcsseldorf maintains weekly contact with  colleagues in the different regions and makes important findings available  to all sites worldwide. An annual survey of all Henkel sites on local health  programs and fulfilling requirements provides us with an overview of our  global health management. This is the foundation for global and regional  coordination activities for the further expansion of our programs. Maintain and improve health  We promote the health and vitality of our employees to help create an  agile, high-performance organization. To do so, we rely on globally uni- form health and safety standards, and provide health and preventive  care programs to guard against workplace risks and general health risks  that could lead to illness. The broad range of health services offered at  our sites has two aims: promoting our employees\\u2019 physical health (via  seminars for giving up smoking, health check-ups, AIDS prevention,  etc.), and maintaining their mental vitality (through stress management  and similar measures). We pick up on important social trends, such as  the demographic change, with our program for maintaining working  capacity. In addition to a number of regional and local programs, we  have been carrying out a major joint health campaign with all sites every  year. The aim here is to reach more than 90 percent of employees globally,  which is a key target of our sustainability strategy. \\u201cBack-Up Your Life\\u201d is the most recent of five global health campaigns to  date. In 2021, the activities targeted the physical and mental strengthening  of employees through a number of initiatives. The focus was on ergo- nomics and fitness in the workplace. More than 800 employees worldwide  have been trained as ErgoScouts, who act as ambassadors for this topic  within the company. A fitness week themed \\u201cSmart Work \\u2013 Smart Fitness\\u201d  rounded off the campaign with a diverse program for physical and mental  fitness and nutrition. Information about the campaign was shared on a  globally accessible platform and actively communicated to all channels.  With this approach, \\u201cBack-Up Your Life\\u201d was able to reach more than  90 percent of our employees.

In addition, there are tailored care packages for the early medical  treatment of health disorders. Our learning platform offers learning  paths on physical and mental health with short learning units. Also on  offer are online training courses, available globally, for managers to learn  how they can contribute to greater motivation and a better working  atmosphere combined with higher performance, while at the same time  reducing absences due to illness. We continued to expand our digital  formats for boosting mental health in 2021. Our initiatives to create  \\u2192 flexible working hours also aim to improve work-life balance and  reduce stress factors. In addition to providing individual psychological and social counseling,  our social services at all our German sites also offer assistance with  workplace integration management and the \\u2192 work-life balance, for  example in the search for childcare or in the case of relatives in need of  care. At all locations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, we also offer  preventive health training aimed at strengthening the individual\\u2019s own  personality, identifying existing resources and teaching helpful coping  strategies for dealing with daily challenges at work and in everyday life.  Continuous expansion of health programs New measures to address overall wellbeing and mental and physical  health were also identified in all regions in 2021. Our new digital MyCare  Hub, for example, raises awareness and increases uptake of all local and  global health and prevention services as a central platform for health  campaigns, ranging from vaccinations to our collaborations with sports  and fitness providers, which we have also expanded globally. We have  also further improved and expanded our Employee Assistance Program.  These services provide our employees with support in coping with pro- fessional and family problems, as well as help in the event of physical or  mental illness. Demography and Work 4.0 We launched a demography program at our headquarters in D\\u00fcsseldorf  in 2013 to promote long-term employability against the backdrop of  demographic change. This holistic concept includes a combination of  preventive occupational healthcare with a general medical check-up,  workability index, and employee surveys. This program is complemented  by the \\u201cTOP Check 4 Health\\u201d assessment for mental stress. In this process,  supervisors and employees systematically analyze work flows, work  organization and environment, and teamwork and leadership. Where  improvement is needed, they also initiate measures to address the  problem. This also includes specific suggestions and offers for improving  and maintaining the health and performance capabilities of participating  employees. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  106 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Increased occupational safety The COVID-19 pandemic: Prevention and crisis management  We do everything we can to ensure the safety of our employees, whether  they are on site or working from home. We have implemented compre- hensive measures to protect our employees and prevent the further spread  of COVID-19. These included the possibility of mobile working, modified  workflows, social distancing regulations, personal protective equipment,  and the provision of tests and hand disinfectants. Full-coverage COVID- 19 vaccinations were also a key contributor to protecting our employees  in 2021. The Henkel Crisis Management Committee (CSC) was tasked with global  responsibility for crisis management within the company. With the aid  of a clearly defined process, decisions made at global level to protect our  employees are cascaded down and implemented at country and regional  level, while local crisis teams take additional measures in line with local  COVID-19 requirements. In addition to regular newsletters about new  requirements, our employees can find information about all issues related  to COVID-19 on an internal company website. This includes a wide range  of tips for how to ensure safety in the workplace and while on the road,  as well as contact partners who are available to provide assistance, best  practice examples from around the world, and responses to frequently  asked questions.  In 2021, we conducted a global employee survey on the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic on the general and health needs of employees.  90 percent of the participants were satisfied to very satisfied with our  crisis management, including the safety and health measures on site.  \\u201cZero accidents\\u201d as a long-term goal Occupational safety within the company and along the value chain was a  top priority for us even before the COVID-19 pandemic. We remain focused  on our long-term objective of zero accidents and want to improve our  occupational safety by 60 percent by the end of 2025 compared to 2010.  We have anchored this overarching goal as a key performance indicator  in our new sustainability strategy. In 2021, we recorded 0.7 occupational  incidents per million hours worked by our employees. This is an improve- ment of 42 percent over the base year 2010. In 2021, there were no fatal  occupational accidents involving an employee of Henkel or an external  company working on behalf of a Henkel company at a Henkel site.  To achieve our goal, we invest in training to raise awareness and increase  technical safety standards. We regularly review whether our    Safety,  Health and Environment (SHE) standards are being strictly adhered to.  We are also committed to improving occupational safety at our subcon- tractors and that of other companies\\u2019 employees working at our sites.  Regular training courses are held at all sites to ensure that our employees  are able to identify and eliminate accident risks. We are increasingly  extending the programs already in place in certain areas to cover the entire  company. We also conduct global safety campaigns aimed at creating  even greater awareness of the most important safety issues among our  employees. 42\\u2009% safer per million hours worked* * Base year 2010 HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  107 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Measures for improved workplace protection and safety  In 2021, all three business units (Adhesive Technologies, Beauty Care and  Laundry & Home Care) continued their efforts to increase the engagement  and participation of our employees in safety programs. One of the   measures implemented for this purpose was a Safety Day held across  the business units, during which the employees at each site were briefed  on the common goal of zero accidents. Despite the limitations imposed  by COVID-19, the program was scheduled to run over the course of an  entire week, with the option of virtual participation. This allowed us to  reach as many participants as possible. The activities focused on raising  awareness of health and safety topics in a fun way. We also expanded  our Cultural and Behavior-Based Safety programs, the core elements of  which are open dialog about safe and risky practices in the workplace.  More than 350,000 such dialogs were conducted at our production facilities  in 2021. In our Laundry & Home Care business unit, we used a specially  developed app that enables employees to directly and easily report safety  concerns and analyze safety indicators. We also held a wide range of  training courses on health and occupational safety topics at our sites  over the course of the year. In addition to measures to foster a safety-oriented corporate culture, we  also rolled out a range of technical improvements at our sites in 2021. For  several years, Henkel has invested in technology pilot projects to increase  occupational safety related to the use of forklifts. Launched in 2021, the  Safety4DRIVE campaign focuses on reviewing traffic patterns and safety  equipment at both the Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care business  unit sites. We also modernized our forklift fleet and trained local teams  on implementing the forklift safety standard in the next few years. The  campaign will also be continued in our Adhesive Technologies business  unit in 2022. Another focus was on the prevention of trip, slip and fall accidents, which  are among the most frequent causes of accidents at Henkel. Beauty Care  worked out a systematic approach to root cause analysis for this purpose.  Laundry & Home Care held training sessions on identifying trip hazards  at all of its manufacturing facilities. Adhesive Technologies conducted a  trip, slip and fall campaign in Europe, challenging its sites to conduct a  critical self-assessment of all areas on their premises. This also involved  a risk assessment of any shortcomings identified as well as the preparation  of an appropriate action plan to correct these deficiencies and prevent this  type of accident. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  108 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS In addition to auditing and compliance processes designed to ensure  compliance with our codes and standards, we also recognize our respon- sibility for respecting human rights along the value chain through our  supplier management system. This approach supports our commitment  to the Forced Labor Resolution of the    Consumer Goods Forum (CGF).  Our  membership of \\u2192 Together for Sustainability \\u2013 Chemical Supply  Chains for a Better World (TfS) is a strong example of this approach in  action.  We follow ongoing human-rights-related developments very closely at  both international and national level, including the National Action Plans  for Business and Human Rights, as well as the    UK\\u2019s Modern Slavery Act.  We continue to develop our approach in line with the resulting expec- tations. This includes the creation of an internal cross-functional task  force on human rights due diligence in 2021. In addition, we are in con- tinuous dialog with stakeholders outside the company and are actively  involved in industry initiatives. For example, in 2020 we participated in  a webinar as part of the German chemical and pharmaceutical industry\\u2019s  sustainability initiative Chemie\\u00b3. This dealt with current developments  concerning human rights in the supply chain, as well as management  approaches for companies. Internally, we promote awareness of our  obligation to respect human rights by integrating relevant content into  eLearning courses and training sessions attended by our employees. In  2021, we placed a special focus on human rights due diligence training  in our purchasing activities. Applying due diligence at all levels  The way that companies act on their responsibility to    respect human  rights and exercise due diligence is the focus of increasing public dis- cussion and political debate.  Our commitment to respecting human rights  Henkel has a clear policy of doing business in an ethical and legal man- ner. This is inseparably linked with our commitment to respecting inter- nationally acknowledged human rights. As early as 1994, Henkel\\u2019s Mission  and Principles document emphasized that respecting social values and  standards is an integral part of our company policy. Since then, we have  developed and adapted a comprehensive set of    codes, standards and  processes to provide our employees, customers, suppliers, investors and  the communities we operate in with a clear definition of the ethical and  social values we uphold \\u2013 including human rights expectations.  In 2000, we also introduced our Code of Conduct, including a clear and  proactive commitment to support human rights: We expect our employees  to respect local customs, traditions and social values, and to respect  human rights for a free and fulfilling life. In 2003, we underscored our  commitment to supporting and respecting human rights by joining the     United Nations Global Compact. We still refer to this commitment  today as a fundamental element in our Code of Conduct and provide  details of it in our Code of Corporate Sustainability, as well as in our Social  Standards and SHE Standards.

We have formulated the     codes and standards in line with expectations that are relevant to our  specific business operations. We revise the documents on a regular  basis to ensure that we conduct our business in a way that reflects our  commitment to support and respect internationally proclaimed human  rights. Our most important documents include: Code of Conduct; Code  of Corporate Sustainability; Social Standards; Safety, Health and Environ- ment (SHE) Standards and the Responsible Sourcing Policy. An    over- view of human rights in the context of responsible business practices at  Henkel is available on our website.  Risk analysis  We have clear due diligence and compliance processes in place to iden- tify and assess social and human rights impacts, and ensure that \\u2013 if   necessary \\u2013 access to remedy is in place and available. These processes  include our Group-wide audit program, which assesses and improves  governance, processes and controls independently and objectively. It  also includes audits that form part of our supplier management system. Our approach to respecting human rights  Alongside legal requirements, our codes and standards provide a basis  for decision-making and engagement within our sphere of influence  worldwide. In this context, we adhere to international labor standards as  a minimum, and local statutes where these are more exacting. Our codes  and standards also reflect our commitment to the Universal Declaration  of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization\\u2019s Declaration on  Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Global Compact,  as well as the expectations set out in the UN Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights.  The Guiding Principles were adopted in 2011 and, through their \\u201cProtect,  Respect, Remedy\\u201d framework, contribute to clarity regarding the different  roles that states and companies play in relation to human rights. Within  their own sovereign territory, states are responsible for protecting  against human rights violations and ensuring access to the full range of  human rights. Companies are expected to respect human rights, comply  with national legislation, and establish reporting channels and provide  access to remedy in the event of human rights violations. These guiding  principles include key elements such as principles and policies, risk  analysis, effective measures, and reporting and complaints mechanisms,  which we have incorporated into our approach to respecting human rights. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  110 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Effective measures  Based on our risk analysis, we have identified two significant human  rights risks in our supply chain at present: raw materials based on palm  oil and palm kernel oil, and raw materials from regions associated with  military conflicts. We are closely monitoring these two areas with regard  to their potential impact on human rights.  In order to reduce risks in the palm oil industry, we have made a com- mitment to procure our palm-oil-based raw materials in line with the  principles and criteria of the    Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil  (RSPO). We also work closely with stakeholders along the value chain,  from our suppliers to the RSPO, NGOs and smallholder farmers, to pro- mote sustainable practices and respect for human rights.  To mitigate the risk associated with raw materials from regions associated  with military conflicts, we require our direct metal suppliers to provide  recognized documentation each year to prove that they do not source or  process metals from these types of critical sources. As a matter of principle, we maintain intensive dialog with our suppliers  to promote sustainable practices and respect for human rights along the  value chain. For example, we also work with partners from the entire  chemical industry as part of the TfS initiative. More extensive information  about this is available on our    website.  Within the scope of the risk analysis, we identify relevant human rights  risks by assessing individual cases according to the following four criteria:   \\u2022 Potentially significant negative impact on humans.   \\u2022 Systemic lack of protection by the government.   \\u2022 Conditions that potentially encourage repeated or systemic   non- compliance.   \\u2022 And influence or potential influence by Henkel (positive or negative).  Henkel considers that a relevant human rights risk exists if all four are  met. This allows us to make a clear distinction between an individual  case of non-compliance due to a single incident, and a human rights risk  that is relevant to our business activities. To do so, we analyze human- rights-related risks in our company and along our value chains. In our  global supply chains, for example, we use an early-warning system for  sustainability risks. This includes defining the risk potential in our pro- curement markets and evaluating value chains on a cross-industry basis.  In doing so, we focus on countries that international institutions have  classified as risk countries. Based on this, we define the riskiest markets  by combining this analysis of risk countries with issues of particular rel- evance to our supply chains at that time, and take appropriate measures.  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  111 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Reporting  We carry out regular audits at our production and administration sites,  and at our subcontractors and logistics centers, to verify compliance with  our codes and standards. This also includes relevant human rights issues.  All audit results, including the review of our SHE and Social Standards,  are reported directly to Henkel\\u2019s Management Board in the annual report  compiled by the Internal Audit team. In line with the criteria of our risk  analysis process, our comprehensive Group-wide audit program in 2021  did not reveal any indications of human rights violations related to  Henkel\\u2019s business operations. The identified risks related to raw materials  are addressed as part of our supply chain management approach.  Grievance mechanisms  Henkel employees, as well as workers at our suppliers or other people  affected, can report breaches of our codes and standards directly to the  responsible contact person within our company. Our compliance hotline  is operated by an independent external provider and is available globally.  In addition, an email can be sent anonymously to the Henkel Compliance  Office using a contact form. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  112 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Corporate citizenship firmly anchored in our  corporate culture    Corporate citizenship has been an integral part of our    corporate  culture ever since the company was established by Fritz Henkel in 1876  and is also clearly reflected in our corporate Purpose. Together with  our employees, pensioners, customers, consumers and charitable  organizations, we are committed to making a lasting contribution to  society worldwide, above and beyond our business activities.  Henkel\\u2019s commitment is based on three pillars: volunteer engagement by  our employees, partnerships with charitable organizations, and emergency  aid in the event of natural disasters. Our overarching goal was to reach  20 million people through our social engagement activities by 2025. We  exceeded this target in 2021, ahead of schedule. From 2010 through the  end of 2021, we reached more than 26 million people. This is particularly  attributable to our contribution to the fight against the global COVID-19  pandemic. In the past year, we supported a total of about 2,050 projects  and reached around 7.03 million people. Donations (of cash and products,  excluding additional time off work for employees) amounted to about  23.8 million euros during the reporting year.   7.03 m people reached 2,050 projects promoted We are committed to further expanding our community education pro- grams and volunteering. For 2030, we have set ourselves the new goal to  contribute to improving the lives of 30 million people (base year 2010)  worldwide.  Henkel\\u2019s social engagement is primarily intended to contribute to  securing the future viability of our society. We are facing enormous  challenges, but they are also creating a wide range of opportunities, for  example in the areas of sustainability, innovation and digitalization.  This is why the focus of our support is on education. This is reflected in  our own initiatives such as    Forscherwelt (Researchers\\u2019 World) and  our \\u2192 Sustainability Ambassador Program, and also applies to our   partnerships with non-profit organizations and our offers of voluntary  work. For example, we are committed to the further education of  \\u2192 smallholders as part of our commitment to sustainable palm oil, and to  maintaining long-standing cooperations with educational institutions.  Our Corporate Standard \\u201cDonations, Memberships and Sponsorships\\u201d  outlines how projects are selected. Corporate citizenship contributes  significantly to the \\u201cEducation\\u201d component in the \\u201cThriving Communities\\u201d  dimension of our new sustainability framework. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  113 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR  EMPLOYEES RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Example: Corporate volunteering In 2021, Henkel continued its commitment to achieving a viable circular  economy and preventing plastic waste from entering the environment.  As part of \\u201cTrashfighter,\\u201d our global employee initiative, we partnered  with the non-profit international environmental protection organization  \\u201cRhineCleanUp\\u201d. This organization conducts waste cleanup events,  especially on riverbanks, but also in other public areas. The aim is to  raise awareness of waste in the environment and of the value of recycling.  Example: Social partnerships  Since 2019, Henkel, in collaboration with the    Fritz Henkel Stiftung  foundation, has sponsored the non-profit programming school    \\u201cReDI  School of Digital Integration\\u201d. Local people interested in technology and  immigrants who do not have access to digital education or a professional  network are taught digital skills in professional training courses. The  organization also offers participants the chance to work with a start-up  and with the digital industry more broadly. The objective is to help them  gain a position in German society and in the labor market. We have also  been cooperating with the charity organizations    IntoUniversity since  2021. We offer young people the support they need to realize their potential  for the future. This includes a \\u201cfuture internship\\u201d in partnership with  Our three pillars     Voluntary commitment of employees    Since the foundation of the initiative \\u201cMIT Volunteering\\u201d  (Make an Impact on Tomorrow) in 1998, we have supported the     voluntary activities of Henkel employees and pensioners in  over 16,800 projects and more than 100 countries around the  world. At the same time, more and more employees and pen- sioners are joining forces to implement larger social projects.    Social partnerships     As part of our corporate engagement, we enter into social   partnerships in the communities where Henkel operates, in an  effort to support social initiatives and public institutions. The  main goal is to promote education in the areas of digitalization,  sustainability and innovation.   Emergency aid     Henkel takes a fast and unbureaucratic approach to providing  emergency aid after natural disasters around the world through  the Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation.

The non-profit educa- tional initiative Teach First Deutschland encourages and supports  young people to achieve more at school. At Teach First Deutschland,  university graduates help schools in disadvantaged communities. As  additional teachers, they help students to find their own path. Beyond  Germany, Henkel also supported the    Teach for All organization in  Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, India, Kenya, Latvia, Ukraine and the  USA in 2021. In addition, our brands, together with the Fritz Henkel Stiftung founda- tion, are also involved in partnerships with social initiatives and public  institutions around the world in line with our sustainability strategy: Schwarzkopf Million Chances initiative Since 2016, the Schwarzkopf Million Chances initiative has been sup- porting girls and women in becoming more self-confident and building  a successful future for themselves. The initiative supports aid projects  worldwide, often in cooperation with independent organizations such as  Plan International Deutschland e.V. in Colombia, Egypt and China. In  2021, a total of 30 projects reached around 5,600 girls and women world- wide. Since the initiative was launched, we have been able to provide  assistance to a total of around 136,000 people. The fourth Schwarzkopf  Million Chances Award was also presented in 2021, sponsored by the  Fritz Henkel Stiftung foundation. Four non-profit projects were awarded  prize money of 10,000 euros for their outstanding commitment. The umbrella of our Million Chances initiative also covers our long-term  initiative    Shaping Futures. Since 2010, Schwarzkopf Professional has  been working with non-profit organizations to offer young people the  opportunity to obtain training in basic hairdressing techniques and  establish livelihoods. The volunteer efforts of hairstylists and employees  have made it possible to train over 2,600 young people in more than  30 countries, including Cambodia, Colombia, India, Lebanon and South  Africa. #RethinkFashion initiative at Perwoll  #RethinkFashion is an initiative from our Perwoll brand. Since 2018, it  has encouraged a more conscious approach to clothing. This includes  proper care to prolong the life of textiles, as well as the upcycling of  clothing. Perwoll presented its own fashion collection at the Berlin  Fashion Week in 2021. All of the 20 or so exclusive fashion outfits were  designed and created in collaboration with students from the AMD  Academy of Fashion & Design in Germany. The \\u201cNOT NEW\\u201d collection  was created exclusively from second-hand clothing. Perwoll is using  this as a way of making a clear statement: It doesn\\u2019t always have to be  new. The goal is to encourage consumers to rethink their attitudes and  to highlight the problem of disposable fashion.

With its global    \\u201cWe Craft for Children\\u201d initiative, Henkel has  been involved for many years in a wide range of educational projects  worldwide in partnership with different non-profit organizations. In  2021, Pritt partnered with    Visions for Children e.V., a non-profit  organization that focuses on improving learning conditions and   educational quality in schools in crisis areas and war zones. A total  of 50,000 euros was donated to Visions for Children e.V. as part of a  fundraising craft campaign. Example: Emergency aid In 2021, forest fires destroyed entire towns in the USA. Hundreds of people  fled and were relocated as a result. We provided support through financial  donations to the American and Canadian Red Cross. To demonstrate  our solidarity and provide support for those affected by the catastrophic  flooding in Germany and Belgium in 2021, Henkel donated 1 million euros  in cash and product donations (hygiene, cleaning and personal care  products). Most of the funds were donated to Aktion Deutschland Hilft e.V.,  an alliance of respected German aid organizations that provides joint,  rapid and coordinated emergency aid to people affected by disasters.  The comprehensive    emergency aid package also included financial  assistance and paid time off for affected employees.

In line  with this, the published employee indicators also cover 99 percent of our  employees. The indicators we record throughout the company provide transparency  while helping us to identify potential improvements, manage  activities  and monitor achievements. We show the progress of each of our  indicators  over a five-year period. In this Sustainability Report, we focus on the  publication of our globally relevant core indicators. The figures in the  tables within this chapter have been rounded up or down. As a result,  the rounded figures in some of the rows in the tables may not add up to  the totals as indicated. Environmental indicators for our production operations  The production-related data for 2021 were determined at all 174 Henkel  sites in 56 countries. This means the data represent 100 percent of our   production volume. The data were validated centrally for year-end  reporting and verified at the sites within the framework of our internal  audit program. Any differences discovered or reported at a later date are  corrected retroactively in our reporting system. Since our production  structures are constantly changing \\u2013 due to the start- up of new sites or  closure of  existing sites, for example \\u2013 the number of sites contributing  data changes accordingly. To ensure the comparability of the annual  data, we also show their progress as an index relative to the volume  of production. Adjustment of reported indicators Acquisitions and divestments: Initial and historical data are only adjusted  in exceptional cases in which disruptive acquisitions or divestments do not  permit a meaningful comparison of timelines. Updates in methodology: Initial and historical data are corrected where  possible. The resulting changes are highlighted and commented on. Updates in data: Where target-relevant or necessary for clarity, changes  are highlighted and explained. Updates of individual or cumulative values  are made when greater than one percent of the value of the superordinate  indicator (for example, total energy consumption), including the subordinate  indicators (for example, bought-in energy consumption).

KGaA are repro- duced below.  Business activities  Henkel AG & Co. KGaA is operationally active in the three business units  Adhesive Technologies, Beauty Care, and Laundry & Home Care, as well  as being the parent company of the Henkel Group. As such, it is responsible for defining and pursuing Henkel\\u2019s corporate  objectives and also for the management, control, and monitoring of  Group-wide activities, including risk management and the allocation  of resources. As of year-end 2021, the number of people employed at  Henkel AG & Co. KGaA was around 8,500 employees. The operating business of Henkel AG & Co. KGaA represents only a por- tion of the business activity of the entire Henkel Group and is managed  across the Group by the business units. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  127 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Operational incidents and environmental violations Henkel openly reports operational incidents when the consequences include at least one of the following:  \\u2022 Endangerment of the neighborhood or the environment.  \\u2022 Tangible losses of more than 500,000 euros.  \\u2022 A high level of public reaction. Furthermore, Henkel transparently reports on environmental violations where the resulting fine exceeds 10,000 euros. The measures and corrective actions initiated as a result are also disclosed. Year Operational incidents Environmental violations 2021 There were no operational incidents in 2021. There were no environmental violations in 2021. 2020 A fire broke out in the shredder plant at the waste disposal center on the D\\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, site in  May 2020. It occurred during the shredding of plastic containers that had been emptied of residual   material. The site fire service was alerted by the automatic fire alarm system and by an employee.  Together with D\\u00fcsseldorf\\u2019s professional fire department, which was also alerted, it extinguished the  fire in a short period of time. No personal injuries were sustained. The firefighting water was properly  disposed of in consultation with the relevant authorities.  Measures initiated: The waste disposal process was examined and employees working in waste-generating  operations at the D\\u00fcsseldorf site were trained in proper waste disposal. In addition, the shredding   process was assessed to see how safety could be improved. The resulting recommendation is that any  new shredder should be designed with an extinguishing system in mind and implemented as such. In July 2020, a fatal accident involving a temporary employee occurred at our detergent factory in  Ibadan, Nigeria. The employee was fatally injured inside a soap mixing machine when he attempted to  access it during normal operation. The machine was immediately stopped with the emergency shut-off  switch. Family and authorities were notified promptly. The causal analysis revealed a failure of the  machine  safeguard. Measures initiated: Henkel was in close contact with the family of the victim and cooperated with the  Nigerian government in the accident investigation. All machinery at the Nigerian site was checked for   safety before operations were resumed. A safety inspection was also conducted on all machines at our  sites with similar production areas. There were no environmental violations in 2020. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  128 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Year Operational incidents Environmental violations Air contamination occurred due to an overpressure incident at our Laundry & Home Care production site  in St. Louis, USA, in May 2020. A raw material caused overpressure in the facility\\u2019s air duct system while  a truck was being unloaded. All the processes were shut down and repair work was started promptly. No  personal injuries occurred. Measures initiated: After the factory\\u2019s air ducts had been decontaminated and before operations were  resumed, all the containers at the sulfonation facility were inspected for possible damage. In addition,  Henkel took preventive measures at all sites worldwide with similar production processes, with the aim  of preventing similar incidents in the future. A fire occurred in March 2020 at our adhesives plant in Bopfingen, Germany, during production of a   hotmelt adhesive, causing extensive property damage. The building was evacuated once the fire alarm  had been set off and the facility had been shut down as an emergency measure. The fire service was able  to bring the fire under control after a short period of time. Further damage was prevented by the safety   equipment installed. The resulting extinguishing water was properly disposed of in coordination with the  responsible authorities. Measures initiated: An investigation team and a crisis management team were formed to establish the  cause of the fire, while coordinating the smooth resumption of production at a different site. The damaged  building is currently being rebuilt for another use. 2019 During the production of powder laundry detergent, a fire broke out inside the filtering system in the  spray-drying area in our laundry detergent factory in Ibadan, Nigeria, in August 2019. The installed  detectors instantly recognized the fire. Respective measures were immediately taken with internal and  external support, in accordance with the provisions of the local intervention plan. The fire was brought  under control within a short period of time. There was no damage to people or the environment. The  fire caused a brief interruption to operations. Measures initiated: After a comprehensive check of all safety-relevant systems at the entire site,   additional training and emergency exercises that involved the entire workforce at the plant were  carried  out. These will also be repeated regularly in the future. The comprehensiveness and suitability of the  safety concept was confirmed after an on-site audit by T\\u00dcV Nord. A deflagration occurred in our adhesives plant in Kurkumbh, India, in April 2019. Unfortunately, two  employees suffered burns as a result of the deflagration. They immediately received emergency medical  aid and were then transferred to a hospital where one employee died of his injuries during treatment. Measures initiated: Henkel started assisting the families and relations during the treatment of the  employees and continues to support the families. Immediately after the incident, safety reviews were  completed at each of our sites with similar production to ensure that operations could continue safely. There were no environmental violations in 2019. HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  129 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Year Operational incidents Environmental violations 2018 There were no operational incidents in 2018. There were no environmental violations in 2018. 2017 In January 2017, there was a product spillage on the site of our adhesives plant in D\\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.  During the production of an adhesive, an aqueous solvent was unintentionally added, triggering the   curing process of the adhesive. The resulting adhesive foam activated the pressure relief system, overflowed  out of the containment chamber and spilled onto a street within the site. The hardened foam was  mechanically removed from the street surface. The incident did not cause any significant interruption  to operations and there were no personal injuries or damage to the environment. Measures initiated: The design of the pressure relief system was examined and the alarm function was  tested. A measuring device was installed that continuously monitors the solvent to make sure it is free  of water. There were no environmental violations in 2017.

These are mainly based on data from RAINS 7.52. No CO2 offsets were taken into account when determining  the Scope 1 carbon dioxide emissions. The net volume of GHG emissions (Scope 1) is shown. The gross volume includes  electricity additionally generated and  sold to third parties. For site-specific reasons, this occurs primarily at our site in D\\u00fcsseldorf-Holthausen (Germany); gross  emissions at Henkel level total 597 thousand metric tons, and biogenic gross emissions at Henkel level total 25 thousand  metric tons. The published Scope 1 emissions include CO2 emissions from vehicles used at our production sites (e.g. forklifts) to a large  degree. CO2 emissions from vehicle fleets operated outside our sites are excluded. Direct GHG emissions resulting from   processes are currently not considered to be significant based on an analysis carried out in Germany. CO2 equivalents of other greenhouse gases are of minor importance in our business activities at present and are not  reported separately. 7, 8, 9 HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  143 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  Audited UNGC  Principles GRI 305-2 Energy indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 2) Sustainability Report 2021 (p. 119), Indicators / Environmental indicators / Our operational CO2 footprint (Scope 2) For the calculation of the Scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions from bought-in energy (electricity, steam and district heating),  we have been using the market-based method (Scope 2) since 2018. We previously used the location-based method  (Scope 2).  Information on gross volume and CO2 equivalents has not yet been provided in  itemized form, as the data basis required for  the calculation still has to be expanded. The CO2 emissions relate to our production sites that are under our direct operational control. These sites represent our core  activities. In the location-based method, country-specific emission factors were used for  calculating  carbon dioxide emissions;  based on this method, a Scope 2 emissions value of 305 thousand metric tons would have been determined for 2021.  For the market-based method (Scope 2), we do not calculate emissions for the  purchase of electricity from renewable  sources that meets internal quality criteria. For the remaining electricity, we calculate contract, provider or region-specific   emission factors, depending on the sites for which we have access to the figures.  They are updated each year. In the remaining cases, we use country-specific factors. For European countries, we use residual  factors if available. For all other countries, we use the factors that are most recently published by the  International Energy  Agency (IEA). 72 percent of the entire electricity purchase comes from renewable sources or falls under  supplier- specific  emission factors.  No CO2 offsets and no emissions certificate trading were taken into account when determining the Scope 2 carbon dioxide  emissions. 7, 8, 9 GRI 305-3 Other indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 3) Sustainability Report 2021 (p. 119), Indicators / Environmental indicators / Our operational CO2 footprint (Scope 3)    Document \\u201cHenkel GHG Reporting, Scope 3 Methodology\\u201c We are in active dialog with our suppliers in order to achieve our CO2 reduction target for our purchased goods and services  (raw materials / chemicals) and to improve the quality of the data.

In 2021, we replaced less than 20 % of secondary  data with quality-verified primary data in estimating Scope 3 emissions. This resulted in a single-digit reduction in raw  material footprint.

Using representative life cycle assessments, we regularly evaluate the raw materials we use across all product categories. In  selecting and using ingredients, we also follow  controversial discussions in the general public about the safety of chemical  ingredients in consumer products. These provide us with opportunities to continually conduct a critical review of the scientific  basis of our assessments.

Our engagement in this context relates solely to the disclosures  denoted with the symbol \\u201c \\u201d. Not subject to our assurance engagement are the external sources of doc- umentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Sustainability Report. Responsibilities of the Executive Directors  The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the selection  of the Sustainability Disclosures and Disclosures on Non-financial Report- ing to be evaluated as well as for the preparation of the Sustainability  Disclosures in accordance with the principles stated in the Sustainability  Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (hereinafter the  \\u201cGRI-Criteria\\u201d) and the Non-financial Report in accordance with \\u00a7\\u00a7 315c  in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB (\\u201cHandelsgesetzbuch\\u201d: \\u201cGerman  Commercial Code\\u201d) and Article 8 of REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18 June 2020  on establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and  amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the \\u201cEU Taxonomy  Regulation\\u201d) and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for  making their own interpretation of the wording and terms contained in  the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder,  as set out in section \\u201cSustainable Finance,\\u201d subsection \\u201cEU taxonomy\\u201d  of the Sustainability Report. This responsibility of Company\\u2019s executive directors includes the selection  and application of appropriate methods of non-financial reporting and  sustainability reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates  related to individual sustainability disclosures and non-financial  HENKEL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2021  154 FOREWORD COMPANY PROFILE STRATEGY TRUSTED PARTNER REGENERATIVE PLANET THRIVING COMMUNITIES INDICATORS INDICES SCOPE AND REFERENCE FRAMEWORK CREDITS  disclosures of the Group that are reasonable in the circumstances. Fur- thermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control  as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a Sustain- ability Report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud  or error. The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder  contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable inter- pretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been  published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed  their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated  Acts adopted thereunder in section \\u201cSustainable Finance,\\u201d subsection  \\u201cEU taxonomy\\u201d of the Sustainability Report. Company\\u2019s executive directors  have also stated in the section \\u201cSustainable Finance,\\u201d subsection  \\u201cEU Taxonomy\\u201d of the Sustainability Report that the interpretations of  the EU Commission, which were published on February 2, 2022 as \\u201cDraft  Commission notice on the interpretation of certain legal provisions of  the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of EU Taxonomy Regulation  on the reporting of eligible economic activities and assets\\u201d and which  are not yet legally binding, were not taken into account due to their  publication shortly before the finalization of the Non-financial Report.  They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to  the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted  differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to  uncertainties. Independence and Quality Control of the Audit Firm We have complied with the German professional provisions regarding  independence as well as other ethical requirements. Our audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional  standards \\u2013 in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors  and German Chartered Auditors (\\u201cBerufssatzung f\\u00fcr Wirtschaftspr\\u00fcfer  und vereidigte Buchpr\\u00fcfer\\u201d: \\u201cBS WP/vBP\\u201d) as well as the Standard on  Quality Control 1 published by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\\u00fcfer (Institute  of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements to quality control  for audit firms (IDW Qualit\\u00e4tssicherungsstandard 1: Anforderungen an  die Qualit\\u00e4tssicherung in der Wirtschaftspr\\u00fcferpraxis \\u2013 IDW QS 1) \\u2013  and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control  including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance  with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal  and regulatory requirements.

In a limited assurance engagement the assurance procedures are less  extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly  a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of  the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of the  assurance practitioner. In the course of our assurance engagement, we have, amongst other things,  performed the following assurance procedures and further activities:  \\u2022 Gain an understanding of the structure of the sustainability organization  and of the stakeholder engagement  \\u2022 Inquiries of executive directors and relevant employees involved in  the preparation of the Sustainability Report regarding the preparation  process, the internal control system relating to this process and  selected disclosures in the Sustainability Report  \\u2022 Identification of the likely risks of material misstatement of the   Sustainability Report  \\u2022 Analytical procedures on selected disclosures in the Sustainability  Report  \\u2022 Reconciliation of selected disclosures with corresponding data in the  consolidated financial statements and in the combined management  report  \\u2022 Evaluation of the presentation of the disclosures  \\u2022 Evaluation of the process to identify taxonomy-eligible economic  activities and the corresponding disclosures in the Sustainability  Report  \\u2022 Inquiries on the relevance of climate-risks In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the  EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret  undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal  terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their inter- pretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are  subject to uncertainties.
