All the employees of the HIRA are doing their best to ensure a healthier and happier life. In 2009, in a bid to fully guarantee necessary medical treatment while at the same time decreasing wasteful medical services, we boosted efficiency with an improved benefits criterion and raised the electronic review ratio to 45%.  We also drove forward intensive customer service management, achieving high customer satisfaction levels despite difficult conditions. Furthermore, we won Korea’s BSC Award, the most authoritative award in the management performance category.   Medical services are essential in guaranteeing the quality of people's lives and national economic development; thus, appropriate medical services should always be assured for all. However, the recent health care environment for medical services has grown ever more complicated and is rapidly changing compared with the past. Related agenda include low birthrates and an ageing population, an increasing number of chronic diseases, the public's increasing expectations regarding health care, the need to additionally secure insurance finance for expanding benefits and the surging quantity of medical reviews (amounting to some 1.3 billion cases).  These changes in the business environment and unexpected crises do not just pose threats to us, but present dynamic new opportunities for economic, environmental, and social harmony and growth. Thus, we are endeavoring to exploit the situation and achieve sustainable development.     The year 2010 marks both the 33rd anniversary of National Health Insurance and the 10th anniversary of the HIRA. The HIRA has thus far played a leading role in promoting national health and developing medical services by performing fair and rational review and assessment activities. Based on our ten years of achievements, we established the 2020 vision of, \" To improve the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of health care through reliable and fair health care review & assessment\" and in July 2010, declared our commitment to act, going forward into the next decade.   With our new vision and accumulated professional capacity to review and assess medical benefits, combined with a more lenient regulatory attitude, we are committed to fulfilling our duties as a partner in medical services and as a national health promoter. We will change our work paradigm focus from simply reducing workloads, to one that builds value and efficiency into our services. Furthermore, we will employ the SMART HIRA 2020 Strategy, to provide the best review and assessment services available. We will strive to minimize the impact of health care review and assessment work to the environment while continuing to create new health values. We recognize the serious nature of the impact of environmental changes on people's lives and health, and we will respond to climate change and business changes through systematic monitoring and analysis, thereby strengthening the national health care infrastructure.  We continue to support and fulfill the UN Global Compact's ten principles, to which we committed our signatures in 2008. We will thus implement sustainability management, fulfilling our responsibilities to our stakeholders, and other associated social and environmental aspects. We will also continue to uphold international standards for human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. A new year of change has begun at the HIRA. This change will have an impact not only on the public, medical personnel, medical care institutions, National Health Insurance Corporation, government, and other stakeholders, but also on future generations. It will bring about a new future of medical security never before experienced in this country.   People often say, \"Fast Alone, Far Together.\" We believe that \"going together\" is the basis for sustainable growth. Like a gyroscope maintaining its absolute direction, we are committed to promoting national health for the public and medical care institutions based on health care review and assessment that is both reliable and fair.  I hope that this sustainability report, only the second of its kind, will transparently disclose the HIRA's management activities and serve as a communication channel to all our stakeholders.  Thank you.

Review and Assessment Service Established in July 2000 for the integration of health insurance management systems and the accurate review of medical service fees, the HIRA performs its business tasks as a professional medical service agency. Our major stakeholders include the general public, medical service providers, the NHIC, and the government (Ministry of Health and Welfare). These stakeholders perform their duties as follows: Review of Medical Service Fees The HIRA fairly and objectively reviews whether or not the medical service fees claimed by hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and other medical institutions have been determined appropriately and effectively from the medical and pharmaceutical perspectives, and whether medical services have been provided in accordance with the National Health Act and its Enforcement Ordinances. We thus prevent errors, excessive medical services, and other improper expenditures in order to ensure that the insurance premiums paid by the public are properly  expended. In 2009, 1.3 billion medical service fee claims, amounting to 44.5 trillion won (health insurance and medical benefits), were reviewed. The HIRA will expand its use of information technologies to review the increasing number of claims promptly, scientifically and efficiently.  Quality Assessment of Medical Service Through the quality assessment of medical service, we evaluate the medical and pharmaceutical validity of examinations, surgeries, drug adminstration, tests and other medical benefits (medical services) provided to the public, as well as the cost-effectiveness thereof. We thereby prevent the erroneous or abusive use of medical services, improve effective medical service practices, and encourage economic medical service activities. We evaluated the quality of medical service beginning with five items in 2001. In 2009, we assessed 25 items and 126 indicators, including haemodialysis  and hospitalization with the nation's psychiatry departments.  Medical Expenses                                  (Unit: 100 billion won) Medical Service Claims (Unit: million cases) Medical Service Fee Review HIRA's Major Businesses  11 Healthcare benefit coverage verification service Under the services for Healthcare benefit coverage verification service, the patients can request whether the medical service fees charged to them by medical institutions fall into the non-benefit category (i.e. whether they are excluded from medical care benefits under the Health Insurance Act or the Medical Benefits Act); whether they have paid medical fees coverable by insurance; and whether they can get a refund on them from the relevant medical institutions. Under these services, 7.23 billion won were refunded to the beneficiaries in 2009. Since March 1, 2009, these services have been operated only by the HIRA to boost professionalism and efficiency; previously, they were jointly operated with the NHIC.  The services are provided via the internet homepage (www.hira.or.kr) or through written requests. For further information, please contact the homepage's Cyber Consultation Page or the Customer Service Center (1644- 2000).  Statistics on Healthcare benefit coverage verification service Provision of User-oriented Information on Medical Services To guarantee the public's right to know and to select medical institutions, we disclose  information on the results of quality assessments of medical care benefits, and on medical services. We provide information on 50 medical services,  including the treatment of gastric cancer and other major cancers and surgeries, as well as on special medical care institutions  that conduct haemodialysis, organ transplantation, and so forth and that operate intensive-care rooms.  We provide information on assessment results and medical services via diverse channels, including TV, radio, our Internet homepage/magazine/PR materials, and various meetings. To make this information more accessible to the general public, we are unifying our methods of information provision and improving public access to our homepage. We also serve as the national hub of health care statistics based on the world's largest national medical service information databases (130TB). We provide statistics for numerous studies and analyses for public purposes.  Disclosure of Assessment Results Development and medical Support for Government Policies We develop and operate practical benefits criteria. As such, we guarantee the provision of appropriate medical services to the public; assess whether to apply health insurance to new medical services, pharmaceuticals and treatment materials; and evaluate the economy of the prices. We thereby expand medical coverage, and operate the DUR service, which is designed to prevent drug accidents. we also undertake to develop, support and execute the government's policies. Furthermore, we prevent false and improper claims for medical service fees so as to protect the finance of health insurance, and strive to strengthen public trust by supporting the Ministry of Health and Welfare in its investigations of medical institutions. In this regard, in 2009, we investigated 954 medical institutions. We are also pushing to further implement incentive systems for voluntary reporting and other guidance-oriented policies.  2007 No. of confirmations(cases) Refund amount (million won) 2008 2009 2007 2008 2009 Year 15,569 24,876 43,958 15,172 8,983 7,232 Results Category  2007 2008 2009 Change (’09/ ’08) Areas of evaluation results disclosed  6 8 9 13% No. of evaluation results disclosed   13 17 18 6% No. of medical service information items provided  40 44 50 14% Public Satisfaction with the Provision of Medical Service Information Development and Support for Health Insurance Policies Survey conducted via the internet (September 2009)  12 2010 HIRA Sustainability Report Activities to prevent risks  The rapidly changing business environment and increasing uncertainties require us to further control diverse risk factors from the agency-wide perspective. We operate a warning system designed to effectively prevent and control risks. We use the audit information system to enhance audit efficiency. We also link risk control with internal audit activities  and obtain feedback from working departments so as to be able to always search and inspect risks. In this way, we manage risks closely between various departments.  Evaluation of Internal Compliance System  We regularly inspect and evaluate the internal compliance system. In 2009,  in particular,  in order to ensure the reliability of our review and assessment work, we audited the internal control status of the review system to identify problems and derive solutions to them. We thus improved the internal compliance system in connection with various issues such as  sorting out high-price billings, complementing the checking functions, and securing the effect of the rechecking functions. We also evaluated the internal accounting management system in order to identify the suitability of accounting treatment and enhance the reliability of financial statements; we evaluated 130 performance items in finance planning and results, finance management, finance execution, corporate card management, etc, thereby confirming that the appropriate compliance had been implemented.  Internal Audit We have shifted the focus of our annual comprehensive audit paradigm in a practicality- and performance-oriented direction so as to conduct a total audit on related working departments, shedding the audit of individual departments practiced so far. The comprehensive audit is annually conducted to enhance the effect of internal compliance through the audit system. We also implement the immunity system, a positive administrative system by which we do not hold related employees accountable for procedural faults or violations of regulations By this system we reduce the penalty if such mistakes are committed in the process of positively performing duties with integrity for the public good, thereby enhancing work efficiency and reducing unnecessary punishment.   Risk Management  We operate a agency-wide warning system designed to comprehensively control diverse risk factors. In this way, we support rational decision-making in the implementation of our strategies.  Risk Management Process Measures to Respond to Various Risks  Category Types of risk  Response to risk Operational risk Delaying work due to halted work systems •Resume work within 3 hours of a disaster's occurrence by operating the disaster recovery system Information risk  Store data in servers of national medical service information  •Operate a permanent working system for 24-hour-a-day all year round •Data are double-stored by both the HQs and the seven branches Cyber hacking  •Operate a 24-hour-a-day monitoring system through the total enterprise security management system Leakage of personal information  •Form an exclusive team to protect personal information •Inspect personal information protection, educate and publicize  Financial risk  Financial risk  •Develop internal electronic compliance solutions (accounting management system) •Manage business budget status in real time, using the Web  13 Sustainability Management System  We are creating a sustainable society by ensuring economic reliability and environmental health, and fulfilling our social responsibilities.  Sustainability Management: Vision and Strategy We established a sustainability management vision aimed at strengthening customer trust in our work based on sustainability management; to realize this vision, we are striving to achieve four goals, namely, healthy people, a clean environment, a hopeful society, and creative talent, in association with our mid-term management objectives (2011~2013).  Sustainability Management Implementation System Our sustainability management system is designed to protect national health via the review and assessment of medical services, and to serve as a public agency by practicing environmental management and green management as well as fulfilling other social responsibilities. We balance environmental management and corporate social responsibilities on the basis of employee value-oriented, people-respecting management.  As such, we aim to create new values and to win the public's staunch confidence.  Sustainability Management Organization  Since 2009, our Planning & Coordination Dept. (Creative Management Devision.) has been leading the sustainability management of HQs and branches in order to systematically conduct the relevant initiatives. The Planning Coordination Office is committed to reflecting the opinions of our stakeholders, namely, employees, customers, related institutes, the NHIC, communities, and the government. The Ethical Management Committee and the Green Management Committee, as advisory groups, help to define the overall direction for sustainability.

This report contained key issues related to the HIRA's vision, strategies and policies, the government's policies, direct and indirect economic effects, and social responsibility management. It also reflected local and international norms and laws related to the HIRA, meetings with external stakeholders, analysis of internal stakeholders' demands and surveys, benchmarking of leading agencies, and the last one year's worth of media reports related to the HIRA. These issues were prioritized and evaluated through the materiality matrix.

HIRA's Creative, Innovative Management  The year 2010 is very significant in that it marks the 33rd year of the implementation of national health insurance and the tenth anniversary of the HIRA; as such, in an effort to design the course of action for the next ten years on the basis of our past ten years of achievements, we declared the 2020 new vision of \"To improve the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of health care through reliable and fair health care review & assessment.\" Furthermore, in a bid to strengthen our profile as a medical service review and assessment agency and better serve our customers, we set five major strategic goals, 1) Sustain highly efficient and effective Review; 2) Maximize the outcome of healthcare through Assessment; 3) Aim for development of future oriented policy; 4) Reinforce customer-centered service quality; and 5) Transform into advanced management system. Creating Public Value  We review and assess medical services amounting to 1.3 billion claims and 44.7 trillion won annually (2009), thereby assisting national health promotion and economic development.  Surging medical expenses, whose rate of increase outstrips that of GDP, cause financial worries over health insurance benefits, and adversely affect economic growth potential. We are committed to offering high quality review and assessment services to ensure quality of medical services for the patients. We also create the socio-economic value of diverse stakeholders, such as medical-care institutions, the pharmaceutical industry, the NHIC, and the government. In 2009, we thus reduced medical service fees by 813.4 billion won.

Our BRMS (Business Rule Management System) allows us to efficiently and consistently handle the review volume, which surges by 10% each year, expanding our review and assessment capacity for medical-care institutions. The system, the optimal method for electronic inspection, is easy to maintain and improve. Ensuring sophisticated review process Improvement of the 6-sigma technique-based review process To enhance the quality and productivity of medical service fee review, we adopted the 6-sigma technique. In 2007, we drove ahead with the first-stage review quality improvement project. In  2008, we executed the second-stage review process improvement project: improvement of the automatic distribution system, refinement of review messages, improvement of the review reservation/closing process, and development of the reviewing screen for duplicate prescriptions. 6-Sigma Initiatives  Expansion of Electronic Review 6-sigma tasks Implementation overview Results Improve the automatic distribution system Changed the review volume allocation method from manual to electronic automation ·Automatic allocation ratio: 95% ·Curtailed working hours: 23,520 hours a year (curtailed 12.3) Refine review messages Improved the review message screen ·Reduced unnecessary messages (21.7% → 6.0%) ·Reduced the number of clicks for checking messages (curtailed 75 hours per review staffer) Improve the review reservation /closing process Dramatically improved the search for review reservation / closing screen Improved the claim statement serial number process  ·Reduced the number of clicks for reservation completion (19 → 15) ·Reduced the number of clicks for reservation closing (7 → 5) Develop the review screen for duplicate prescriptions Created the function to search pharmaceutical components  ·Curtailed review period  ·Made it easy to check duplicate prescriptions Improve the review reservation management system Improved the review reservation management screen and systemized the management  ·Curtailed the handling period for reserved claims (27.4 days → 12.1 days) ·Curtailed the no. of reservation steps (2 steps → 1 step) Improve the review adjustment description system Installed an automatic search function ·Curtailed the description period (13,110 days → 2,185 days) ·Increased adjustment notice rate (6.9% → 30.0%)  22 2010 HIRA Sustainability Report Development of the Review Knowledge Bank To review the appropriateness of medical services and medical service fees, comprehensive information is required, such as medical and pharmaceutical knowledge, review criteria, and accumulated review examples. To that end, we developed a knowledge and information review bank to improve our review quality. In 2009, we developed the information database in the Oriental medicine area and updated the disease information to provide fresh knowledge and information.   Provision of Knowledge and Information Improvement of Review Criteria and Disclosure of Review Information We improve the criteria review through evidence-based decision making using our professional human resources to enhance user acceptability. We expand communities with medical circles to encourage the use of appropriate medical services, and provide diverse review information for customers to guarantee their right to know. Five-year Plan for the Development of the Disease Information Database  Type of information Description Integrated search of review knowledge Comprehensively search information in each field  Review criteria under new notices Provide review criteria specified under new notices Multidisciplinary teams  Search interdisciplinary teams' institutes and provide their composition information  Information on diseases handled by Oriental medicine Link to and use external sites (Oriental medicine education materials, history of Oriental medicine, various symptoms, pharmaceutical materials, prescriptions, etc.) Information on diseases Outline of diseases, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, etc.  Test reference ranges  Major test items and test reference ranges Review work handbook  Provide the yearly updated handbooks for reviewing medical services and expenses  Definition of practices  Indications, medical treatment outline, and examples in relation with medical practices  Medical dictionary & Anatomy  Link to and use external sites  Review criteria   Notices, administrative interpretation, review guidelines, etc.  New therapeutics    Notices and items filed for new therapeutics   KFDA's drug information Information on various pharmaceutical drugs' efficacy, effects, use methods, and doses, provided by KFDA Drugs for cancers Types of drugs, committees, types of evaluation, etc. Prior application for cancers Classification of cancers, application period, admission period, etc.  Therapeutical material expenses Codes, classification and shapes of therapeutic materials Information on medical devices Description and practicality of medical devices, etc.   23 Inducement of Accurate Claims of Medical-care Benefits Expenses In 2009, we provided information and services tailored to medical care institutions, and standardized disease codes, lowering the disease code error rate to 1%. To encourage accurate claims of medical-care benefits expenses, we are pushing to minimize  claim errors as an area of improvement under the mid-term management goals.  Major Projects Autonomous Improvement System for Appropriate Medical Services We changed the existing comprehensive management system for insurance benefits suitability into an autonomous improvement system; thus, we conduct comprehensive information activities such as the increased provision of medical service information, and consultation and education services. The autonomous improvement system for appropriate Medical Service is a comprehensive consulting concept- based work management system designed to exploit our review, assessment and field investigation results, providing tailored total information for medical care institutions to allow them to examine and resolve their problems. We thus encourage medical care institutions to autonomously execute appropriate medical services and improve their treatment patterns, thereby improving the quality of national medical services.

The number of our medical care service quality assessment items was just five in 2001, but  increased to 25 in 2009, to include hemodialysis and psychiatry hospitalization. To strengthen quality management, we have continued to expand the area of medical treatment, the number of assessment indices, and the share ratio of medical expenses covered by assessment. Expansion of Assessment Items Expanded Disclosure of Assessment Results To guarantee the public the right to select better medical options based on  accurate information, we continue to disclose the results of our assessments of various medical institutions and the relevant medical service information. On our website, we disclose hospitals which prescribe and use fewer injections and antibiotics, and conduct campaigns designed to prevent the misuse and abuse of drugs. As such, we endeavor to guarantee medical service quality and the people's appropriate use of medical services. As a result, we continuously reduced the use of antibiotics and injections in 2009 as well.

Based on the assessment results, we implement Pilot incentive programs and total prescription reduction incentive programs.  Incentive Overview and Results of Incentive System Activated Support for Quality Improvement (QI) of Medical Care Institutions To allow medical care institutions to voluntarily recognize the need for improving medical service quality and take the corresponding improvement measures, we perform QI support activities. QI Education Category  pay for performance (P4P) demonstration project Project description Results •Providing incentives to excellent institutions: 21 institutions,  Provided 453 million won to 21 institutions  * Increased incentives and reduced incentives are being applied in 2010  •Target institutions : Tertiary care hospitals(43) •Target diseases/etc: caesarean delivery, acute myocardial infarction (2) •Grading: targets are classified into five grades based on the evaluation results •Change: Incentives are added to 1st-class institutions, and removed for 5th-class ones  Pilot incentive program for total prescription reduction •32.7% of the targets reduced their drug expenses (6.7 billion won) •Project period: July‘08 - June ’09 (1 year) •Target areas: Daegu, Gwangju, Daejeon, Suwon and Changwon •Target departments: seven including internal medicine and otorhinolaryngology  Category 2008 2009 2010 No. of sessions 2 4 4 Participants 60 160 200  26 2010 HIRA Sustainability Report Development and Support for Government Policies  We develop and support government to improve and enhance national health society.  Expanded Benefits Coverage for Appropriate Medical Services We have boosted benefits coverage for serious diseases, etc. and stepped up our support for government policies so as to reduce the public's medical expense charges. We have also improved the medical fee system, reflecting the changing medical environment, so as to efficiently use the national insurance finance. In 2009, we expanded benefits coverage of 12 of serious diseases areas, reducing the public's medical expenses by 357.7 billion won.   New Coverage Benefits Improvement of Benefits Criteria for Convenient Use of Medical Services  To positively guarantee necessary medical services while containing unnecessary medical services to the maximum extent, we are pushing to improve the benefits criteria for 189 review adjustment items and to disclose the review guidelines and examples, so as to maximize the guarantee of necessary medical services for the public. Improvement of Benefit Criterias Strengthening Benefits Coverage via the Rationalization of Pharmaceutical Drug Criteria  We pinpointed and improved impractical drug benefits criteria, enhancing public safety with regard to the use of drugs, and cutting unnecessary drug expenditure. In 2009, we expanded the drug benefits coverage for rare diseases, and as such we improved the benefits criteria for 268 items, further strengthening benefits coverage.

Outpatients charges: 30~60% → 10%) ·Established inflammation care fees for infected patients, etc. Expand the support for benefits policies  (169.8bn won in Oriental medicine and dental areas) ·Converted Oriental medicine physical therapies and dental caries into covered items Support policies for low-birth countermeasures, etc.  (119.1bn won in 17 areas) ·Activated vulnerable medical areas (increasing medical fees in diagnostic departments which residents avoid) ·Improved medical fees in areas where frequent complaints arise   Expanding the Drug Utilization Review Service (DUR) for the Prevention of Drug Accidents    We operate the Drug Utilization Review Service (DUR) in real time to monitor  the simultaneous prescription of drugs which may cause problems when taken all together.  Since April 2008, we have inspected whether drugs banned for co-medication and certain ages, as well banned drugs, are being included in prescriptions. In 2009, we expanded the pilot implementation of the DUR system; we thereby ensure the public's safe use of drugs, and contain the misuse and abuse of drugs.   Expanded Pilot Implementation of DUR Service Efficient Support for Field Investigations into Medical Care Institutions    We conduct investigations into whether medical care institutions' claims for medical expenses are legal and valid in order to retrieve inappropriate revenues and take administrative measures where applicable, supporting the MOHW's field investigations. On the basis of these field investigations, we identify medical care institutions' false and inappropriate claims to prevent the leakage of insurance finance and to protect patients' rights. Support for Policy Development for Health Insurance Benefits  We produce base data necessary for devising health insurance benefits policies, analyze the effect of coverage policy execution as well as medical expenditure trends. As such, we conduct research on the formulation of the MOWH's health insurance policy. By doing so, we promote national health and ensure the appropriateness of medical cost expenditure. We formed and deployed the Influenza A (H1N1) Countermeasure Situation Team to prevent the spread of the disease. With the disease alert level upgraded from \"watch\" to \"serious,\" we expanded the team into the Influenza A Countermeasure Support Center. The center, through various hub hospitals, identified in real time the number of general disease wards, serious disease wards, and isolated wards, as well as the ownership of ventilators and the treatment status of hospitalized patients. We also identified the status regarding the administering, distributing and stockpiling of antiviral agents, as well as patients with chronic diseases, etc. for vaccination, so as to provide the information to the government and relevant institutions. As such, we fully mobilized all our frontline human resources and functions so as to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of H1N1 flu, assisting and reinforcing the government's measures to block the spread of the disease early on.

Efficient Management  In line with the state's call for the advancement of public agencies, we are implementing  strategies and key tasks to increase our management efficiency each year, so as to become a highly productive and performance-oriented public agency.   Reorganizing Work Centering on Our Key Jobs  In February 2009, we pushed to reshuffle our organization. Under the initiative, we linked the follow-up review and preventive functions, and consistently executed our work centering on key jobs, such as the control of duplicated work related to the criteria for medical service fees and insurance benefits. We also outsourced simple and repetitive work, consultation services, driving and telephone exchange, call centers, and other function-oriented work to the private sector (curtailing 68 posts), customer achieving a slimmer organization and enhancing our efficiency. By furthering management advancement, we will curtail a further 178 employees by 2012.  Offsetting Manpower Expansion Factors by Scientizing Work and Boosting Efficiency    We are rationally reducing the workload and thus offsetting the review manpower expansion factors. To that end, we have applied the artificial intelligence-aided electronic review system more extensively in handling the medical service fee review volume, which increases by over 10% each year (curtailing 150 employees).  We are also striving to expand the DUR service, to refine the review methods, and to encourage medical care institutions to inspect their claims for medical service fees.  Advancement of Business Administration  We plan to further implement the performance-linked rewarding system to boost our management efficiency. We will expand the gap in performance-based annual salaries between employees from 20% in 2007 to 100% in 2010. In 2009, we revised the regulations for further linking performance evaluation to personnel affairs management; thus, we reflected the performance evaluation results to account for 10% of the total employee evaluation. We also lowered the first salary for university graduate employees by 11.14%. In 2010, we will implement the low-performer retirement program, under which we put the 1% lowest-performers on reeducation programs, along with retirement measures to be taken against lowest-performers who fail to improve.   Advancement of Labor-Management Relations We embrace a trustful management culture so as to facilitate labor-management communication, advance relations, and create a trustful win-win organizational culture. Under the agreement of the 2010 Labor-Management vision, we are practicing exemplary labor-management relations through dialogue and cooperation.  Enhance Management Efficiency  29 Advancement of Knowledge-based Management In June 2007, we opened the Ji (knowledge) zone website to share employees' best practices, experience and knowledge and systematically manage accumulated knowledge. Through the Ji zone system, which combines knowledge-based management and suggestion activities, we endeavor to use knowledge to the maximum extent, and share knowledge between employees and departments to promote knowledge-based management.   To enhance the quality of knowledge posted on the Ji zone system, the Knowledge Masters and the general manager-class suggestion evaluators fairly evaluate and manage the listed knowledge and suggestions on the basis of objective and multi-dimensional criteria. In particular, the number of suggestions for work improvement increased from 3,108 in 2007 to 3,634 in 2009, up by over 17%. Employees' participation rate increased from 67.5% in 2007 to 69.8% in 2009. We have stepped up the incentives available for excellent suggestions, such as the provision of career development and education opportunities, in addition to mileage-based financial rewards and prizes. In this way, we are able to secure excellent knowledge. For such knowledge-based achievements, we won the Maekyung-Booz Innovation Award hosted by the Maeil Business Newspaper. In 2010, we will formulate the ‘KM-Level Up 2012’ plan to devise and implement a three-year strategy for the advancement of knowledge-based management.  Development of Next-generation IT System  With the aim of implementing the optimized information system to provide customer-oriented information services, we provide high-quality IT services based on the top-notch information and communication infrastructure. The local largest-scale electronic medical service fee claim system (EDI) curtails the review period and simplifies the submission of various documents by enabling electronic claims for medical service fees and notifying the results electronically. In particular, the electronic claim method dramatically reduces the use of paper, cuts down the consumption of resources, and protects the environment. We earned international patents for the medical service fee claim system in Korea, Japan, and South Africa. We acquired quality certification (ISO 9001) for the whole information and communication area from ISO, enhancing our information services to the international level. Our EDI claim system is now being benchmarked internationally, so we have more than 10 visitations from the international community each year to observe our system.

KSA ��������������� �����������������  To create a happier society for humanity and nature, the HIRA is creating new values through green management, toward a greener, healthier future for next generations.  30  Clean Environment Disclosure on Management Approach Vision and Strategic Objectives In line with the government's plan to join the ranks of the world's five major green powers by 2050, the HIRA endeavors to implement three strategies and ten projects to create green health values along with sustained growth and welfare. The low-carbon, green growth vision is essential to ensuring sustainable growth and the development of not only manufacturing and energy companies, but also public agencies. We have made diverse efforts to lead this green paradigm.  We are committed to respecting human life and protecting nature to improve the quality of life and conserve the global environment, thereby leading sustainable development for humanity.  Major Issues �Support the creation of new green growth engines �Create a national health management infrastructure to cope with climate change �Strengthen environmental management (development of an energy-saving management system) *  These issues were determined in line with the Five-Year Plan for National Strategies for Green Growth and the HIRA's mid-term management strategies.  Responsible Organization  Implementation Policies Major Achievements •Declare green management : Share the vision across the company  •Related departments devise action plans : Promote green growth atmosphere and regularly check the progress  •Launch brainstorming-type team, green task force: Devise action plans according to selected themes  •Devise green management strategies : 3 strategies, 10 key targets, 30 projects  •GREEN HIRA COMMITTEE : comprises 16 external experts to provide consultation services.  31 Planning & Coordination Dept.

Laying the Foundations for Green Management  We devised green management strategies with the government's Five-Year Plan for National Green Growth Strategy, and are committed to creating green health values along with economic growth and welfare.   Environmentally-Conscious Workplace  With abnormal temperatures associated with global warming emerging as a global issue, greater attention has been focused on energy recently than at any other time. We recognize that energy consumption is the cause of global climate change and a growing shortage of resources; we have thus devised and are implementing systematic measures to reduce energy  consumption. Such efforts include the holding of Green HIRA Day and the installation of solar energy systems and LED lights at HQs. We are thus endeavoring to promote affirmative change for a better future.   Response to Environmentally-Related Diseases Associated with Climate Change The WHO began to publish official data on the impact of climate change on public health in 1990. It states that climate change is crucial. With the recent increase in environmentally-related diseases associated with climate change posing a threat to national health, we are responding to climate change by creating statistical databases about disease information. In October 2009, we developed statistical indices for three diseases, namely, allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopy. In the following month, we listed the indices in the third-quarter medical review and assessment statistical book.  Development and operation of an eco-friendly assessment information system In a bid to maximize the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our work, and realize a paperless working environment, we have developed an assessment information system designed to enable integrated management of the entire-assessment process. This system has allowed us to produce data to minimize the workload and to link the data with the result disclosure screen, enhancing customers' access to such information and minimizing inefficiency at work.  We are also minimizing the number of cases requiring more review data, and have activated data submission via the Web, thereby reducing the environmental influence derived from paperwork in an effort to support green growth activities.   Green HIRA Committee  33 Observance of Laws We observe the Basic Environmental Policy Act, Atmospheric Environment Conservation Act, Water Environment Conservation Act, and Natural Environment Conservation Act, among others. In the last three years, we have not violated any environmentally-related laws.  Saving Materials and Recycling Resources  We declared our commitment to green management in 2009 in a bid to ensure the well-being of humanity and conserve the global environment. Since then, we have continued with our efforts to that end. In October, we encouraged all our employees to take oath to participate in the 3Rs Campaign, namely, Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle, reducing waste and carbon emissions. We installed recyclable product collection boxes, and donated 1,008 mandatory recyclable electronic appliances (mobile phones,  MP3 players, cameras, wire phones, electronic dictionaries, etc.) to  the National Council of Green Consumers in Korea, thereby contributing to the recycling of resources. We also donated 494 used computers to digitally-challenged areas (Kopino, Cebu, the Philippines), helping to prevent environmental pollution resulted from waste electronics, and to recycle resources. We will continue to improve our systems and conduct eco-friendly campaigns to further promote the recycling of resources and protection of the environment.  Activating All Employees' Recycling of Resources   Since 2006, we have held Beautiful Bazaars to recycle resources and donate money to our needy neighbors. In 2009, we sold employees' used products at our HQs and branches, generating the sum of 15,057,350 won; we donated some of the money to patients with intractable diseases, and the remaining balance to the Beautiful Shop.  We also opened the Green Share Marketplace, a campaign involving public agencies, in an effort to promote the recycling of used products in line with the government's policy.  Community's Environmental Project In an effort to assist the community's environmental cleanup campaigns, we are participating in Seocho-gu office’s Seocho Green Zone project. Our family volunteer group continues to participate in campaigns to transform waste edible oils into eco-friendly soaps and donate them to welfare facilities and elderly people living alone. We also participate in campaigns to protect the natural environment around Mt. Cheonggye and prevent wildfires, cooperating with the communities in conserving the environment and ensuring a sustainable future.  Environmental Protection Activities We conduct diverse campaigns aimed at restoring the environment, which is essential to human health, to its natural state.  �HIRA's Green Management Vision We create green health values along with green growth and welfare.  � We put the following measures into practice to achieve our green management vision. First,      we focus on the creative development of our review and assessment work to create and contribute to green growth engines in the health care field.  Second, we save resources and energy in all our activities to protect the global environment and strengthen our environmental   competitiveness.  Third,     we build a joint network with customers to contribute to low-carbon, green growth.  Fourth,   we embrace green management and transparent and ethical management as our key values to develop into a  green HIRA trusted by the nation and society.  HIRA's Green Management Declaration  Volunteering to Make Eco-friendly Soap  34 2010 HIRA Sustainability Report Building of the e-office Environment  We have converted paper fax into Web fax, and introduced the electronic approval system, which enables us to manage and keep various documents electronically, while cutting down on printing paper and electrical costs. We have developed a paperless meeting operation system by installing beam projects in conference rooms, etc, creating a paperless meeting culture. Through the IT work management system, we manage work schedules, draft memo reports, and share meeting data, thus preventing the waste of unnecessary resources and enhancing work efficiency.  We have created a green office environment and conduct eco-friendly activities, such as minimizing electricity consumption and paper data production.   Campaigns for Saving Energy  We observed the Green HIRA Day on which we do not use cars or elevators. This allows us to effect an annual cut of 3,996� of gasoline and 8.5 tons of CO2. We have also installed solar power generators, LED lights, and bike stands, cutting greenhouse gas emissions amounting to 2.5 tons of CO2. Furthermore, we have cut the use of A4 paper by 63,000 sheets per year, fostering a paperless meeting culture. We have also implemented a hybrid car purchase policy, conducted a campaign in which we only drive  to and from work by car on alternate days, and installed bike stands. With these green campaigns, our employees helped save energy, cutting down on costs and curtailing diesel consumption by 4%.  Materials and Energy Saving Results (2009) Expansion of Eco-friendly Products We purchase good recycling (GR) products  that comply with the prescribed certification criteria as specified by the Notice of the Ministry of Knowledge Economy, helping to raise local industries' sustainability. GR marks are granted to those companies which are proven by product inspection and factory inspection by the National Institute of Technology and Quality to be equipped with systems capable of continuing to produce GR products.   We set the eco-friendly product purchase goal at 75% in 2008, and 80% in 2009, but we outperformed the initial figure by 13%, achieving an eco-friendly product purchase rate of 93%. We will continue to increase our eco-friendly purchases. Sustainable Use of Resources We consider not only quality and price but also the environmental factor in purchasing products, thereby practicing green responsibility.

Our major water supply source is tap water, and we do not use underground water or reused water. Thus, our water supply is not seriously restricted.  Used domestic water is treated by the local government's sewage treatment plant. Thus, the impact of our discharged wastewater on the final discharging areas, such as the destruction of biodiversity, is deemed to be minimal.  In 2009, our tap water consumption increased due to a rise in the workforce including the recruitment of new employees.  Disposal of Waste _ Most of our waste is domestic waste. In the process of providing our services, we do not create hazardous materials such as the types of wastes and product packaging waste specified in Basel Conventions I, II, III, and IV. Furthermore, we have all our domestic wastes managed by specialist firms, thereby minimizing environmental pollution. Our total waste for 2009 amounted to 11,120kg, and we began measuring the total volume of recyclable waste in January 2010.  Use of Energy _ In 2009, the volume of our carbon dioxide emissions increased by 6.67%, or city gas consumption by 15.15%, and our electrical consumption by 6.04%, from the previous year. This increase is attributable to a rise in the numbers of employees and electrical installations, and an unusually cold winter season.

We are thus endeavoring to practice the best-level customer satisfaction management so as to satisfy and impress customers. The customer satisfaction management work is led by the Client Support Dept., and is conducted by the HQs customer center, branches' customer centers, and Call Center by addressing customers' demands and complaints as the first priority. The Client Support Dept. not only conducts the external customer support, but also educates the internal employees about kind services. It also monitors employees' response to customers, pinpoints and improves inadequate telephone, response and hospitality services, and provides feedback on the results to employees.  Redefinition of Customers according to Customer Value Trends In accordance with the dictum that \"agencies that fail to win the hearts of customers cannot survive,\" we perform our work with the focus on the provision of high-quality review and assessment services. Our customer satisfaction management seeks to not only provide review and assessment services but also to provide a new value and meaning of health and happiness to customers. We have shed the existing fragmental definition of the customer, and redefined the customer concept in line with the fundamental value of medical service quality and the appropriateness of medical of costs, as the 1) value-producing customer, 2) value-delivering customer, 3) value-demanding customer, and 4) value-impacting customer. We thus seek to provide differentiated customer satisfaction services for all our customers. Customer Satisfaction Management System FAIR? FAIR means being consistently FRIENDLY to customers, providing ACCURATE review and assessment services, being INTERACTIVE with customers, and thus respecting customers and earning their RESPECT. Type of customer Category Types of customers Value- producing customers  •Employees, partnered firms  Value- delivering customers  •Medical care institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and importers and suppliers of drugs and therapeutical materials  Value- demanding customers   •General public (medical service users), research institutes  and researchers for  the medical industry  Value- impacting customers  •Government, National Assembly, The Board of Audit and Inspection, media agencies, NHIC, civic groups, social security agencies, expert groups, etc.   39 Practice of Customer Service Charter  In August 2005, we enacted the Customer Service Charter and declared customer satisfaction management to provide services from the perspective of customers and to improve work quality. We are endeavoring to better execute customer services through the faithful fulfillment of the Customer Service Charter, and to cater to customers' expectations. Notably, in May 2009, we materialized and specified implementation standards for key works such as review guidelines, when to disclose assessment results, and information on the progress of medical service confirmation services for the public. We are thus expanding and strengthening our customer-touching services.  In 2009, we strengthened the monitoring system for the observation of the Customer Service Charter by allowing the job to be undertaken by the Customer Service Dept.'s evaluation, aligned the implementation checklists with BSC quantitative goals, and developed an online ehecking system, thereby dramatically improving the Charter monitoring system.   Improvement of Customer Service Charter Inspection System As a result, the score of service standard implementation increased by 0.9 to 99.7 points from 2008, and is continuing to improve. We will ensure that the standards of the Customer Service Charter are met and observed.  The HIRA ensures the appropriateness of national medical services so as to help improve the quality of  medical services and promote national health. Also, all staff members of the HIRA pledge to practice customer satisfaction management to provide the best services to the public taking the following oath.  First,     we shall always listen to customer voices, and think and act from the perspective of the customers.  Second, we shall provide customers with prompt, fair, accurate and comfortalde services. Third,     we shall keep our promises to our customers, and protect their confidentiality.  Fourth, we shall disclose the necessary information to customers to the maximum extent, and thus implement transparent management.  Fifth,      we shall listen to customers' inconveniences and complaints so as to correct an error and improve our services.  To honor our pledge, we will establish exacting service implementation standards and fulfill them faithfully. Furthermore, we will fulfill all the social duties required of a public agency, and practice ethical management.  Customer Service Charter  History of Customer Service Charter   40 2010 HIRA Sustainability Report Evaluation of Cutomer Service Implementation We continue to survey and analyze customers' expectations of our services and evaluation results, which enables us to evaluate the results of service implementation with a view to further upgrade our service quality.  Our Happy Call system is designed to directly check and resolve customers' complaints and difficulties in 36 areas where the largest number of questions and petitions regarding our assessment arise.   External customers' reports on kind employees are increasing each year. We regularly monitor our customers' voices and reflect them in our work.  We monitor and evaluate employees' telephone hospitality services, the first contact with customers. The 2009 survey indicated that they were \"very satisfactory,\" showing a continually high level of service.  Public-service customer satisfaction surveys, organized by the government (MOSF), indicate a continued improvement. In 2009, in particular, our score entered the 80-point range for the first time. We use customer satisfaction survey results as a VOC channel to implement customer satisfaction management and improve our services for the public.

We receive VOCs from diverse channels, and analyze them to use the results in assessing the effects of policy implementation, resolving customers' complaints, improving related processes, devising strategies efficiently, and developing new businesses. We have developed a VOC- integrated management system to convert VOCs into a management resource, and to create a customer value-oriented management foundation.   In 2009, we collected and managed  320,000 VOCs through diverse online and offline channels; in particular, we operated customer centers and direct phone call reception systems, and saw the number of VOCs by phone surge to about 300,000, up 1,570% from a year earlier.

President Kang Yoon-goo urged participants to make more effort because employees' pride in the organization is pride in themselves, which leads to pride in their work, making employee satisfaction very important, and because high-ranking managers' kind consideration of employees greatly influences their satisfaction. He further asked them to transform the HIRA into an organization that satisfies both internal and external customers. Selected discussion results are now being implemented.

We pledge to provide a faster, more accurate, and kinder consultation so as to impress customers beyond satisfaction Frequent Consultation Request Types with Customer Center Operation of an Exclusive Consultation Center for Influenza A(H1N1) Vaccination _ To positively prevent the spread of Influenza A(H1N1), we opened an exclusive vaccination consultation center: Influenza A(H1N1) vaccination; Ask HIRA (1644-2111).  Operating of a permanent system to monitor medical service fee criteria to ensure convenient national medical services _ We set 2009 as the year for improving the benefits criteria for ensuring appropriate national medical services, and are now operating a system to monitor the benefits criteria via online and offline channels. In particular, under our policy of ensuring practical benefits criteria for appropriate medical services, on April 1, 2009, we opened an online benefits criteria inquiry center. This center aims to gather diverse field opinions to improve irrational benefits criteria. The center can be accessed at our homepage (www.hira.or.kr)  Targets  All employees  12 sessions  Description  Education about personal information protection and information security  Staffers personal information 15 sessions  Specialized education for information security staffers, and participation in various seminars  Employees of external company  3 sessions  Education about the protection of personal information and security information 43 Enhancement of CS Capabilities   Customer-tailored Education _ In order to share our vision and policy with our stakeholders, and to create a HIRA tailored to customers, we offer various specialized education courses to the public, medical care institutions and related institutes CS Education for Customer Satisfaction Management _ In order to realize our CS vision, we foster competitive CS specialists who are capable of playing a leading role in creating customer-oriented changes.  Efforts to Establish a Customer-oriented CS Culture _ In order to autonomously resolve problems in connection with customer requests, we operate CS CoPs  according to work types and customer contact points to promote a CS mindset among our employees, and strengthen voluntary CS action, thereby endeavoring to establish a customer-oriented culture. According to our company-wide CS master plans, we implement CS activity and practice measurement indices according to departments and reflect the results in the agency-wide BSC.  Protection of Customers’ Personal Information _ With the ever increasing number of cases of personal information leakage damage, the protection of personal information is further emphasized. We operate diverse systems to protect personal information, such as education about personal information protection and the distribution of guidebooks on information protection. As a result, in terms of our protection, information handling, and technical protection of personal information, the HIRA earned an excellent average of 91.7 points in the Ministry of Health and Welfare's checking and evaluation. As such, to date, we have not caused any accidents related to personal information.

Outline of Ethical Management Implementation We pledge to implement clean, transparent management to boost our stakeholders' confidence and trust in us, practicing the country's best ethical management. To that end, we practice transparent decision making, promote the culture of practicing ethical management autonomously, we are also building a crisis management system. We believe that ethical management is not only essential for sustainable development and enhanced competitiveness, but also serves as the criteria for all employees' behavior and values in their activities. In particular, the HIRA as a public agency not only fulfills its legal responsibilities but also reflects the ethical standards required by society in all its business activities to practice them with top priority. At the early ethical implementation stage, we endeavored to lay strong foundations, and to cultivate an ethical mindset among our employees. In 2004, we enacted the Employee Code of Conduct, paving the way for the full-swing implementation of ethical management.   Ethical Management Implementation System and Road Map  Implementation System of Ethical Management  Ethical management is undertaken by the Planning & Coordination Dept. which supports decisions on major policies, manages related plans, and coordinates major jobs. We operate the Ethical Management Committee as a review and advisory body to devise and coordinate ethical management policies: Consisting of a president, executive director of planning, and five external members, it reviews and resolves on ethical management plans, as well as on the revised and amended ethical regulations, and checks the progress and results of ethical management implementation. Furthermore, the Auditing Dept. is responsible for agency- wide anti-corruption and integrity work, while the PR Dept. comprehensively plans and manages social responsibility activities.  Implementation System of Ethical Management   45 Regulations related to Ethical Management In order to set the criteria for employees' behavior and judgment, we have established an ethical regulation system consisting of the Ethics Charter,  the Employee Code of Conduct, and ethical guidelines. The Ethics Charter embodies the basic spirit and norms of ethical management, and declares our employees' determination to practice it on behalf of our stakeholders. The Employee Code of Conduct defines employees' behavioral standards as regards practice of the Ethics Charter. The ethical guidelines specify the criteria and procedure for implementing the Ethics Charter and the Employee Code of Conduct.  Employees' Duty of Integrity _ We ensure that all employees fulfill the duty of integrity in accordance with the laws and enforcement ordinances, Employee Code of  Conduct, and other related regulations, to ensure they perform their work sincerely and fairly. In particular, to boost the transparency of management and thereby bolster ethical management, standing executives are required to sign a work integrity agreement.  Establishment of a Healthy Work Culture _ Our employees are banned from inviting people related to their work to their congratulatory and condolence events; they are also banned from giving and receiving money of over 50,000 won and goods equivalent to this amount on these occasions. Employees are also banned from playing golf with people related to their work; if otherwise unavoidable, employees should report such plans to the HIRA president.  Reporting of Violations and Guaranteeing the Security of Reporters _ We allow the reporting of employees' improper and corrupt practices to the HIRA president, Code of Conduct Chief, and the Anti- Corruption & Civil Rights Commission. The HIRA president may confirm the fact and impose punishment on the employees in question in accordance with the Disciplinary Regulation. We also ensure the confidentiality of reporters and the reported details; if the reporter is found to have breached the regulations, he or she may have their punishment reduced or exempted from it.   Transparency of Budget Execution _ To ensure the transparent use of our budgets, we disclose our expenditure execution results on our website every month. We also ban the personal use of corporate cards (clean cards), as well as the use of corporate cards for entertainment  establishments  which have nothing to do with the performance of our work.   Compliance with Laws and Regulations _ Our employees fully observe not only anti-corruption laws related to ethical management, the National Health Insurance Act and other related laws and regulations, but also our internal Ethics Charter and Code of Conduct. These efforts have thus far prevented the violation of laws in relation to corruption and bribes. Our employees do not donate money for improper political activities and other illegal activities.  Ethical Management Implementation System through Overall Management Improvement   46 2010 HIRA Sustainability Report Ethical Management Practice Program  We encourage employees to voluntarily participate in diverse ethical management activities through various online and offline programs such as employee ethical management education, the self-inspection program for promoting an ethical mindset, and the ethical management leadership system. In this way, we are striving to strengthen our frontline-oriented ethical management system.  Strengthening of Ethical Management Education _ We operate diverse, systematic ethical management education courses and programs to encourage employees to voluntarily participate in ethical management. All employees receive basic education on ethical management through cyber educational courses.  Self-Inspection of Ethical Management Mindset _ To foster employees' ethical mindset and conduct self- inspection, we allow employees to use a software program designed for solving ethical dilemmas and conducting self-inspection (Clean HIRA Day) once a month. Since 2008, we require all employees to participate in this program, dramatically enhancing the participation ratio to 97%.  Operation of Ethical Management Practice Leader System _ In order to encourage each department to voluntarily practice ethical management with a view to establishing ethical and transparent management, we designate ethical management leader in each department. The ethical management leaders have meetings with the top management so as to disseminate the top management's determination for ethical management to their departments. They also involve difficulties related to the practice of ethical management and address them.  Public Disclosure of Management Performance _ We positively disclose important management performance and information, and improve work processes so as to strengthen the transparency of our business. Through the public disclosure of our management performance on our website, and through Alio, the combined management disclosure system for public agencies, we disclose information on our management performance, and monitor our operations under related staffers' real names according to individual items, once-monthly-mutual inspection and notification, and the electronic system. We implement more detailed disclosure criteria than the combined disclosure criteria required of public agencies to disclose our management performance. We also implement additional disclosure items such as review results, the results of the handling of requests to identify the targets of medical benefits, and the results of supporting onsite investigations into medical care institutions.  Enhancement of Transparency of Contract Arrangement _ The work of arranging contracts, given its nature, requires many face-to-face contacts with clients, and is exposed to the risk of corruption, allowing it to be recognized as highly corruptible. To prevent corruption in this line of work, we operate the Integrity Agreement System, conduct contracts without face-to-face contact, and implement electronic procurement.  Category Description Integrity Agreement System  Require the submission of a written pledge to fulfill the Integrity Agreement when arranging contracts for all transactions including product purchase and construction works.  Contracts without face-to-face contacts In the case of contracts valued at over KRW 10 million, we only visit the client once; thereafter, we handle the contract work without further visitation and without face-to face contacts until completion of the project.  Electronic procurement contracts We observe the public bidding principle for contracts worth KRW 10 million or more through electronic procurement. Pre-disclosure system for contract projects  We disclose contract projects worth an estimated KRW 80 million or more in advance, ensuring transparency.

Specifically, we systematically evaluate ethical management plans and performance results, and utilize the results in educational courses as well as reflecting them in our improvement of the ethical management system.  Integrity Survey by the Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission _ In order to realize a high-integrity public agency through anti-corruption campaigns,  we participate in the integrity survey conducted by the ACRC each year. Our integrity survey score stood at 8.45 points in 2009, up 0.35 from the previous year. We also scored 8.05 points, a somewhat low score, in the first internal integrity survey for agencies under the control of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Based on these results, we are striving to improve our shortcomings and become a higher-integrity agency.  External Evaluation of Our Ethical Management Activities _ In order to diagnose our ethical management levels objectively, we participate in the survey program for Korean Business Ethics Index Sustainability Management. In the first year of participation, 2009, we obtained an \"AA\" rating, and we are aiming for the top rating \"AAA\" by improving those areas identified as vulnerable.  Our Evaluation of Ethical Management Performance _ We implement an ethical level diagnosis model (HIRA-EMX) designed to diagnose and evaluate employees' ethical management awareness levels and performance results with a view to pinpointing and improving vulnerable areas.   Diagnosis of Ethical Levels  2009 Survey on Ethical Management (targeting internal employees)  48 2010 HIRA Sustainability Report Social Responsibilities  In accordance with the philosophy of corporate social responsibility, namely, \"Participation through the practice of sharing, involvement in the community, and cultural activities, \"we pursue the vision of \"achieving a happier life and a happier society through sharing and participation.\"  Social Responsibility Vision and Implementation System We believe that we can achieve long-term sustainable development and growth by conducting a wide range of social responsibility activities. In 2006, we established an exclusive department for systematically conducting social responsibility activities, and we are now performing social responsibility activities in which employees all participate. In 2009, the president of HIRA was appointed as the head of HIRA's social volunteer service group, and the social responsibility committee was formed; thus, we are now fulfilling social responsibilities on a agency-wide basis. Currently, the PR division of the PR Dept., serving as the secretariat for social responsibility activities, controls 28 volunteer service clubs and organizes diverse sharing events.  HIRA's Corporate Social Responsibility Vision Mid- and Long-Term Business Portfolio for Corporate Social Responsibilities _ We are implementing diverse corporate social responsibility programs with the focus on five main themes, namely, medicine, the community, volunteer services, participation in  government policies, and cooperation with the government. The themes conform to the characteristics of the HIRA as a specialized medical service review and assessment agency and social trends. Through these programs, we perform our social responsibility campaigns and promote the beautiful culture of sharing.   HIRA's Corporate Social Responsibility Roadmap Mid-and Long-term Goals of Corporate Social Responsibilities  49 Social Responsibility Practice Programs  Social Responsibility Activities  Social Responsibility in the Medical Care Field _ We conduct corporate social responsibility campaigns in the medical field, such as the program to help patients with intractable diseases throuh, the With-U Campaign.   ·With-U Campaign for Supporting Medical Treatment Costs for Patients with Intractable Diseases  Since 2004, HIRA employees have conducted campaigns to help financially-compromised patients struggling with unusual or intractable diseases by raising money for HIRA'S matching grants. We started to raise money by donating small change from our salaries; since June 2007, the account size per employee has been expanded to KRW 3,000. In 2009, we donated a total of KRW 85.23 million to 16 patients. For the six years since 2004, we have been helping 64 patients struggling with leukemia and other unusual intractable diseases.   ·Support for Eyesight Recovery Operation Costs  Under an agreement concluded with the Korea Foundation for the Prevention of Blindness in December 2009, we continue campaigns to support the costs of eyesight recovery surgery for patients who are in danger of losing their vision but who cannot afford to undergo surgery.

Our female workforce, including nurses, accounts for 73% of all our employees. The recruitment rate of new female employees stands at 68%, making it far higher than the average female employment rate, and female managers or higher-ranking female employees account for 45% of our total management resources, a remarkably high percentage.  Male vs. Female (No. of employees, %) Respect for Employees’Human Rights We strive to create a gender equality working environment in order to positively utilize our female employees and enhance our competitiveness. We have many female employees due to the nature of our work; thus, we also operate a women's lounge and a nursing room in a new rented annex building to take good care of our female employees.  Also, in order to enhance employees' awareness of the importance of personal information and  take precautions in handling personal information, we regularly offer education about the prevention of intrusions upon personal information along with actual examples of information leakage, and continue to use a security system to monitor the handling of personal information.  Ban Employee Discrimination  We endeavor to create a working environment free from discrimination where humans rights are respected on the basis of the internal regulations, including collective negotiation agreements and working rules. We ensure that there is no discrimination with regard to work, promotion, welfare, basic salaries, and so on. We prohibit gender discrimination, and implement the same basic salaries in the same employee rankings regardless of gender. We also use a system to monitor and audit gender discrimination. In January 2009, in a bid to implement the �Act on the Prohibition of Discrimination against Disabled Persons, Remedy against Infringement of Their Right, etc�, we offered education on the two-dimensional bar-code system for blind people. In December, we provided lectures and survival OX quiz contests regarding the prevention of sexual harrassment in accordance with the Collective Negotiation Agreement, Article 30, �Ban on Sexual Harrassment and Violence in the Workplace�, and showed a play about the prevention of seual harrassment. These efforts helped us to prevent any cases of sexual harrassment from arising during 2007~09.

In 2009, women accounted for 69% of the total number of newly hired employees; as such, we are helping to stabilize female employment. In accordance with the HIRA's collective agreement, Article 29, we do not discriminate between males and females with regard to salaries and rewards, giving equal treatment to male and female employees alike; thus, we comply with ILO Convention NO.111 Discrimination (Employment and Occupation). We pay new employees 154% of the legally prescribed minimum salary, stabilizing their jobs and enhancing their satisfaction. Prevent Forced Labor and Child Labor We comply with the Labor Standards Act, ILO Convention No. 105 (Abolition of Forced Labour Convention) and the Labor Standards of the UN Global Compact's ten principles, as well as implementing collective agreements to prevent child labor and forced labor. HRD Vision 2012 It is imperative to foster talent to allow the HIRA to grow into a world-best review and assessment agency to ensure the appropriateness of medical services . Thus, we have established an ideal HIRA talent image and the HRD Vision 2012, as well as a master plan to foster talent. Our efforts to make talent equipped with professionalism and creativity include a capability-oriented HR fostering program, the promotion of a self- motivated permanent learning culture in which employees can both work and learn, a post-retirement life plan, and a fair and rational performance-based personnel affairs and rewards system. HIRA Talent Image Talent management lies behind every first-rate company's growth. Human beings are the most precious asset because they have vigor, life, intelligence, and morality. An organization is human, humans constitute an organization. To practice the \"talent first\" ideal, we foster professional talent, creative talent, innovative talent, and high-integrity talent as HIRA talent.

We are also  striving to establish a welfare system tailored to employee needs.  We have also integrated the management of welfare and consolidated the operation of a selective-based welfare system so as to enhance employees' satisfaction. We are pushing ahead with diverse systems and events to create a great workplace and a happy life for our employees. Mom and Dad's Workplace Experience, Family Volunteer Group, and other family-friendly campaigns will certainly enhance employees' concentration on work. Other welfare programs are also being implemented at present. Life Plan Program We have implemented a severance pay system, and, since 2007, we have operated an out-placement program for retired employees to assist them to design a second life plan and settle comfortably into post- retirement life. In 2009, we expanded employee training programs into three courses - self-revolution �, �, and �- organized by age; thus, we are now implementing the HIRA Life Plan Program, which will certainly help retirees to prepare properly for their future with confidence and pride adapt to society.  HIRA Life Plan Program Support for Employees' Club Activities   59 Family-friendly Programs  We operate family-friendly programs designed to conform to the characteristics of our workforce, namely, the fact that there is a greater number of females (73%) and married women (75.4%).

Win-Win Labor-Management Culture  We recognize the labor union as the representative of our employees and a key partner of our management, so we engage in sufficient consultation with the union regarding important decisions. Thus, we seek to promote win-win labor-management relations to satisfy employees and its creation ot value for stakeholders. In particular, we share important issues between labor and management, such as policy changes, vision, and mid- and long-term goals, through workshops, and labor-management consultation and discussions. We thus build mutual consensus to prevent disputes. Since the union was established in July 2000, these efforts have helped us to achieve successful collective wage negotiations without disputes.   We also complied with the government's wage guidelines to keep the total rate of increase on labor costs to within 1.7%. We simplified the remuneration system; converted 60% of the total 160% bonus into the basic salary, laying the foundations for the annual salary system. Thus, the basic salary rate increased from 70% in 2008 to 75% in 2009. We continued to expand the performance-based annual salary gap between employees; the gap increased from 30% in 2008 to 40% in 2009.   Union Overview The union of the HIRA was launched in 2000. The union HQs are  located at the main office, and there are seven branches nationwide.

Under a joint collective bargaining agreement (Article 58, Duty of Negotiation), we conduct labor- management negotiations according to the principles of trust, sincerity and stability, and guarantee freedom of association, not refusing the other party's requests for collective bargain without justifiable reason.

Curtailment of Collective Wage Negotiation Period   61 Prior Notice through Collective Negotiation  Regarding important agenda for employees, such as changes in working conditions and welfare benefits, and changes in the Articles of Association, we hold collective negotiations. In this respect, according to the joint collective bargaining agreement, Article 11 (Duty of Notice), the HIRA's management and union should immediately give prior notice to the other party.   Open Corporate Culture  We endeavor to promote an open culture whereby we respect each other and facilitate communication among employees and between departments. Each year we survey employee satisfaction and reflect the results in our management. We also operate the Open Discussion, as well as Word Suggestion, Ji Zone, and Junior Board, in order to allow employees to freely present their opinions. Work Accidents  Just one instance of a work accident has occurred since 2006; however, no single such accident was caused in 2009. We will continue with our efforts to create a safe workplace for all our employees.   Employee Counseling  We are making diverse efforts to help address employees' difficulties in working life.

Further, the report, in the Chapters on Healthy People and Hopeful Society, clearly defines its innovative strategies to realize the vision of \"To improve the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of health care through reliable and fair health care review & assessment\" ; the Chapter on Clean Environment confirms the HIRA's considerable endeavors on behalf of the environment, and, in this regard, if the next report specifies the HIRA's efforts to cope with diseases caused by and related to climate change, it will certainly be a future-oriented report. Lastly, the Chapter on Creative Talent confirms the HIRA's strategy for managing its internal stakeholders to create a healthy workplace.   The report constitutes a good expression of the HIRA's economic, social and environmental activities. However, if the report specified the organization's negative sides, its areas of improvement by field, and corresponding efforts, it would be a more balanced report.
