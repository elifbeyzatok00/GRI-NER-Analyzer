Letter from the Chairman For the eighth year running, I am pleased to present you with the Corporate Responsibility Report of Gas Natural. It focuses on our activities in economic, social and environmental issues and gives details of the strategies that have been implemented, the targets set, the actions taken and the most significant successes we have achieved. The year 2009 has been one of the most important of our more than 165 years in business. Despite the uncertainties of the situation, we have successfully completed our merger with Unión Fenosa and have become one of the top three utilities companies on the Iberian market and one of the most important energy groups in Latin America. The new group is present in 23 countries, with more than 20 million customers and close to 18 GW of installed electricity generating capacity. Our leadership on liquefied natural gas markets, as international third-party operators through our subsidiaries Stream and Unión Fenosa Gas, and on downstream allows us to operate on energy markets that are particularly globalised and highly competitive. Throughout the entire process, clear and truthful information was given to the regulatory bodies, financial markets, the media and sectors of the general public, as well as to the employees of both companies, in order to give a fair and accurate view of the real situation of the transaction at all times. The integration is moving forward satisfactorily. The creation of one common culture, which comprises the best practices and procedures of both companies, has had the best possible start: the mutual conviction of the idea that the business function must focus on the wellbeing of individuals and communities through the marketing of energy products and services that help improve life quality. Accordingly, we are convinced that our activities help build a more sustainable society and that they must be reported with rigour, objectiveness and transparency to all our stakeholders. For the drafting of this 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report, we have followed the recommendations and principles provided in the third version of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines issued by the Global Reporting Initiative. This document also includes the information required by the supplement on “electricity companies” published by the aforementioned institution. Accordingly, we believe that this report gives a fair view of our performance in corporate responsibility. The qualitative and quantitative information contained in this report has been reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Group's financial auditor. The report includes the focus and results of Gas Natural Group in the various areas of corporate responsibility. In environmental matters, the demanding procedures and tasks that have been carried out have helped avoid atmospheric emissions of around eight million tonnes of CO2, mainly as a result of the benefits in terms of electricity generation efficiency using combined cycles.  Letter from the Chairman. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 5 In R&D and innovation, we are also committed to efficiency through the development of new energy vectors and the search for new applications for natural gas, which has been consolidated as the cleanest fossil fuel on the basis of its notable contribution to reducing the effects of the climate change. In 2009, our efforts in sustainability were again recognised by the capitals markets. Accordingly, we were designated as leaders of our sector by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, a selective index of companies that are required to accredit advanced practices in corporate responsibility. Our presence on the FTSE4Good was also strengthened and we obtained the highest score among the Spanish utilities companies in the Carbon Disclosure Project, an initiative brought forward by the world’s main institutional investors to reward companies that stand out thanks to their commitment to the climate change. Within this framework, I would like to make special mention of our firm commitment to the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact. The commitment to results is one of the distinctive features of our business model, which is focused on providing our shareholders with a growing and sustained level of profitability. The Company’s net profits for 2009 were up 13.1% on the previous year, reaching the figure of 1,195 million euros. We also reached a consolidated Ebitda of 3,937 million euros, 53.5% up on 2008. This was mainly due to the incorporation of Unión Fenosa as from 30 April 2009. All this was achieved in a context of a reduction of the demand for energy and significant levels of volatility regarding energy prices and financial and exchange markets. I would also like to point out that, in 2009, the Board of Directors approved various amendments to the Company’s Code of Ethics to continue to improve its content in social and ethical terms according to the best international practices and to meet the regulatory requirements of the merger with Unión Fenosa. The milestones we have reached stand as the sound base on which we propose to overcome the new challenges facing our Group. Success will be the result of the devotion and effectiveness of all the individuals in the Group. Accordingly, I would like to give my special thanks to all our employees for the work they have carried out during a year as demanding as 2009. At the same time, I would like to encourage them to continue their progress, with renewed enthusiasm, in the exciting business project we have begun. I invite you to read this 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report. These pages contain the efforts of almost twenty thousand people who, on a daily basis and with all the energy in the world, help our Group to be more efficient, responsible and useful for society. Salvador Gabarró Chairman of the Board of Directors  Scope and focus of report This is the first Corporate Responsibility Report drafted by the Gas Natural Group since its merger with Unión Fenosa in 2009. As in previous years, its purpose is to provide truthful, reliable and balanced information about the Company’s performance in the main challenges of corporate responsibility and sustainable development. The report covers all the new Group’s activities as a global gas and electricity operator in the countries in which it is present. Accordingly, the information published includes the electricity distribution and generation operations, the gas supply, production, liquefaction, distribution, storage and regasification operations, the energy commercialisation operations and coal-mining operations.

Note: Besides these 23 countries, the Gas Natural Group has professional services, portfolio or holding companies in Holland, Ireland and Madagascar. The Gas Natural Group activities (at 31 December 2009)  The drafting of this report has followed the criteria provided by the AccountAbility AA1000 standard (2008) and the third edition of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines by the Global Reporting Initiative. This document also includes the information required by the GRI supplement corresponding to the utilities sector, which is of mandatory application as from 1 January 2010 for the companies in the sector that wish to obtain the highest qualification of A+ by the Global Reporting Initiative. The content of this report refers mainly to the year 2009. Depending on its relevance and availability, it also includes information on previous years so that readers can form an opinion on the Company's performance. The quantitative indicators show the Group's performance in the previous three years, except for those that were included for the first time in 2009 or 2008. This year, the merger with Unión Fenosa has meant significant efforts when compiling and presenting the information in a consistent and comparable way. Given the conditioning factors involved in the merger of both companies, which was completed in 2009, and in order to enable the understanding of the information by readers, this Corporate Responsibility Report occasionally presents the data in two different ways. In general, the 2009 information contains the information about the Group including Unión Fenosa as from 1 May 2009, the date that coincides with the consolidation of the financial magnitudes. In other cases, when the nature of the indicator so requires, the information is presented at 31 December. The past figures correspond to the data published in the previous reports of the Gas Natural Group. There are cases in which importance has been placed on the information being presented in a \"pro forma\" way so that readers can gain a better understanding of the evolution of the figures after the merger. The \"pro forma\" option offers the figure for 2009 as if both companies had been merged together since 1 January of said year. As far as possible, when this format is used, the past figure includes the global figure as if both companies had been merged together in 2008 and 2007. The \"pro forma\" presentation of the information is particularly significant in the chapters on \"The Environment\" and \"Health and Safety\". In both chapters, the option for consolidating the information as from 1 May 2009 could give a distorted image of the Company's performance by significantly increasing or reducing said indicators, where said variations do not occur as a result of management activities, but rather of the merger of both companies. As a result, despite the inclusion of the consolidated figure as from said date, the format that gives a fairer image of the Group's performance is the so-called \"pro forma\" format. With regard to environmental issues, at least the following activities are specified: management and support; exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons; liquefaction, transport and distribution of gas; transport and distribution of electricity and generation of commercial electricity in 2009, inherent to the Group's companies with global consolidation. In human resources, figures on staff and personnel expenses are reported, the latter being under consolidation criteria, for the countries in which the Group operates. The exception to the foregoing rule includes Angola, Oman and Portugal, countries in which the Group carries out its activities but has no employees or, if there are any employees, they belong to Spanish companies. Special mention must also be made of the fact that Holland had no staff at 31 December 2009. Information is provided for the other indicators in most cases and as far as possible for the countries in which the Group's management is centralised, which is why no information is provided about Kenya or South Africa. Process for Drafting this Report. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 7 The merger with Unión Fenosa has meant significant efforts when compiling and presenting the information in a consistent and comparable way.  Application of the AA1000 APS standard when drafting this report The purpose of the AA1000 APS standard is to provide organisations with a set of internationally recognised principles that can be freely accessed to situate and structure the way in which they assess, implement, administrate, govern and surrender their accounts in sustainability performance. The principles that govern this standard are as follows: • Inclusivity. This is defined as stakeholders' participation in the development and achievement of a strategic and responsible response from the Company in sustainable development. In relation to this principle, particular importance is placed on the information presented by the Gas Natural Group in this report on actions that lead to dialogue with its stakeholders. • Materiality. This refers to the need for determining the importance of matters related to corporate responsibility and sustainability for the Company and its stakeholders. One relevant issue is that which influences the decisions, actions and performance of an organisation or its stakeholders. The relevant issues for the Gas Natural Group are included in its Corporate Responsibility Policy that was put in place in 2008. This Corporate Responsibility Report is structured according to the relevant issues included in said policy. • Responsiveness. This principle refers to the Company's response to relevant issues related to corporate responsibility or sustainability. The capacity for response can be seen in the decision-taking processes, actions taken and performance, as well as in communications with stakeholders. Accordingly, this 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report includes the Group's main performance indicators. Throughout the report, the Company publishes its focus, response and performance in relevant issues. Principles for drafting this report In order to guarantee a balanced and reasonable presentation of the organisation’s record, the content to be included in the report should be determined. According to the Global Reporting Initiative's recommendations, this should take into account both the organisation’s experience and intentions and the interests of its stakeholders. • Materiality. Materiality is the threshold beyond which an issue or indicator becomes sufficiently important for it to be included in the report. In 2007, the Gas Natural Group performed a materiality study to identify the issues considered relevant. Said study applied the AccountAbility AA1000 standard to categorise and identify issues related to corporate responsibility and sustainable developments that are of particular relevance for the Gas Natural Group. In addition and for the drafting of this year's report, consideration has been given to the issues examined in the corporate responsibility reports of the Gas Natural Group and Unión Fenosa in 2008, the information required by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the FTSE4Good, and the issues included in the Global Reporting Initiative utilities supplement and the RepTrak analysis, a methodology used by the Gas Natural Group to gauge its reputation. The 8  Company believes that, in this way, all the issues that are of relevance in view of its characteristics and those of the sectors in which it operates have been included in this 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report. • Participation of stakeholders. The establishment of active dialogue with stakeholders is a fundamental principle of the Group's strategy. The Company has defined its stakeholders, identified its expectations and set actions to establish a two-way dialogue. This process is explained in the section “Dialogue with Interest Groups” and “Corporate Responsibility Governance”. • Sustainability context. The report offers a detailed analysis of the Company's performance in the context of the social, environmental and economic requirements of its social and market environments. The sections on strategy and contribution to development focus specifically on this area. • Exhaustiveness. The definition of the contents scheme with the participation of the persons responsible for the Company's main management areas guarantees consideration of the essential impacts and issues of the Gas Natural Group activity.

The consideration of the principles given hereunder guarantees that the information offers the appropriate guarantees of quality. • Balance: the report clearly shows the positive and negative aspects of the organisation's performance, which enables a reasonable valuation thereof. • Comparativeness: the information given in this report makes it possible to analyse the changes that have taken place in the organisation over time. Accordingly, as far as possible and bearing in mind the particularities that result from a merger such as that which involved the Group in 2009, the report includes information from previous years. • Accuracy: all the information in the report is accurate and given in sufficient detail for the Company's stakeholders to be able to value the Company's performance in an appropriate manner. • Frequency: the Gas Natural Group publishes its corporate responsibility reports annually, as soon as the information is available, so that the Company's stakeholders can take decisions based on the most recent information. • Clarity: the information is presented in a way that is understandable, accessible and useful. To enable its correct understanding, the use of technical terms is avoided. In addition, it uses graphs, diagrams, tables and indicators to describe the Company's most relevant impacts and make it easier to read the document. • Reliability: the figures given in this Corporate Responsibility Report have been checked by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The drafting of the report has taken into account the three principles required by the AccountAbility AA1000 standard in relation to relevance and materiality, accuracy and whether or not the information given responds to the stakeholders' concerns and requirements. 10 The drafting of this report has followed the Global Reporting Initiative recommendations to ensure the quality of the information that is being disclosed.  Verification The integrity, sound and truthful nature of the information given in this report are maintained by the policies and procedures included in the Gas Natural Group internal control systems and their purpose includes guaranteeing the correct presentation of the Company's information to third parties. In the said policies and in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative recommendations, the Gas Natural Group committees an annual external verification of the contents of the Corporate Responsibility Report. This review is made by an independent expert, PricewaterhouseCoopers, which reviews the adaptation of the contents of the Corporate Responsibility Report to the provisions laid down in the Global Reporting Initiative Guidelines and the AA1000 standard (2008). As a result of the said process, an independent review report is drawn up to include the goals and scope of the process, as well as the verification procedures used and the corresponding conclusions. After the assessment of the information included in the 2009 report, the independent expert has applied the level of assurance specified in the Independent Review Report. Queries and additional information In addition to this 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report, the Gas Natural Group has published the Annual Report, the Corporate Governance Report and the Audit and Control Committee Report, all pertaining to 2009. The Company also has a website (www.gasnatural.com) where anyone interested can consult up-to-date information about the Company.

The Gas Natural Group. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Reportv 19 As a result of the merger with Unión Fenosa, the Gas Natural Group is working hard to define a new strategic plan. The new plan will be subject to the complexity and uncertainty that currently affect the economic environment and by possible fluctuations in energy prices over the coming years. In this context and in view of the forecasts for the coming years, the Group is working on the definition of a robust, ambitious strategic plan to respond to the unknown entities that may arise on the economic, legislative and energy scenarios. The Group's new strategic plan is based on the targets set in the previous plan and on the strategic targets set by Unión Fenosa before it merged with the Group. It is based on the following concepts: • Promotion of the vertical integration of the Company's business, based on the establishment of new long-term supply agreements and participation in new upstream projects for primary energy supplies. • Promotion of the internationalisation process in the geographical and business areas that offer opportunities and in which the Group has a competitive edge. • Investment in R&D/i to foster the development of new electricity generation technologies or improve existing technologies. • Development of the Group's electricity and gas distribution activities in accordance with the energy policy defined in the geographical areas in which it operates with a permanent view to improving the energy efficiency of its operations. The deregulation of the electricity and gas markets requires the companies in the energy sector to increase their efficiency, meet the demands of their customers with an appropriate supply and develop a culture of innovation. The integration of Unión Fenosa in the Gas Natural Group will involve a significant increase in quality in said three areas. In order to meet the targets set in its Strategic Plan, the Company has various fundamental means of support: • The Gas Natural Group is a best-in-class operator in downstream, distribution and sale of energy. The long-standing experience of both companies in this area will make it possible for the Group to meet the targets it has set. • The high level of diversification and efficiency of the Company's generation facilities, which allows it to manage the natural resources of gas and coal it has available in a competitive way. • The Company's strong position in the liquefied natural gas business (LNG), which will be a key factor for accessing new markets and obtaining new supply sources. • The human resources of both companies, strengthened after the merger. In the coming years, Spain and Latin America will continue to be the Gas Natural Group main markets. However, their relative weight will be reduced since the greatest business opportunities and increases in demand will come from Asia from now on. In the future, the Group will continue to develop a competitive, diverse and environment-friendly energy mix that places great importance on renewable energies, which will be complemented with other sources of generation, such as the hydraulic projects that are currently being developed by the Group in line with the national energy policy, which also provide a safe supply. The Group will continue its search for more efficient, environment-friendly solutions. The Gas Natural Group is a best-in-class operator in downstream, distribution and sale of energy. Strategy of the Gas Natural Group  The companies in the energy sector are facing a challenge on two levels. On the one hand, they must be capable of satisfying the societies' growing demand for energy; on the other, they must do so more efficiently and in a more environment-friendly way. For both reasons, the search for safe, clean and reliable sources of energy is essential for the companies in the energy sector and, in particular, for the Gas Natural Group. At the present time, the Company has an electricity generation mix that is both reliable and safe. It is also capable of giving an appropriate response to the demand for energy of the societies in which it operates. The Group has a good number of thermal power plants that work with coal, gas or fuel oil, hydraulic power plants, wind farms, solar farms and nuclear power stations, which makes it an essential player for the safety and reliability of the supply in the areas in which it operates. The Gas Natural Group assumes these challenges in its awareness of the fact that its main contribution to development and well-being lies in supplying energy in a sustainable, efficient and safe way. A company that supplies clean energy Society applies growing environment- related pressure on energy companies. Although the gas and electricity distribution, generation and transport activities cannot be designed without a certain level of environmental impact, they can be minimised through the efficiency of processes and the installation of high-performance equipment. Accordingly, renewable energies are assuming an increasingly notable relevance in the energy mix. However, the generation of energy from fossil sources will remain predominant in the coming years. In this context, the advantages of natural gas in terms of efficiency give it an advantage over other fossil fuels. Owing to its chemical composition and properties, natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel. During combustion, it emits between 40 and 45% less CO2 than coal and between 20 and 30% less than oil. Furthermore, the NOX emissions caused by its combustion are very low in comparison with those of coal and oil, and the emissions of SOX and solid particles are almost zero. Contribution to Development At the present time, the Company has an electricity generation mix that is both reliable and safe. It is also capable of giving an appropriate response to the demand for energy of the societies in which it operates. CO2 produced in the combustion of fossil fuels (kg/GJ) Lignite 102 Fuel oil Gas oil Anthracite Natural gas 78.5 73.3 91.3 55.9 Source: IPCC-Eurogas.  The above characteristics make natural gas one of the best solutions as far as the climate change and other environmental problems are concerned, such as the acidification of atmospheres and acid rain and the particle or photochemical contamination of urban atmospheres. An efficient energy with a growing number of uses Natural gas offers a better energy balance than other fossil fuels. The efficiency of the combined-cycle power plants that work with gas exceeds that of conventional thermal power stations by 20%. The advantages of natural gas as far as efficiency is concerned produce positive environmental effects in terms of the reduction of emissions, since in order to achieve the same amount of energy, a lower quantity of natural gas has to be burned than other fossil fuels. Natural gas is one of the primary energies with the highest growth potential owing to its increased use in every sector, the progressive extension of the gas pipeline network and its use in processes for generating energy through combined cycles and co-generation, as well as its use as a fuel for transport. A company committed to efficiency and R&D/i In terms of efficiency, the Gas Natural Group has fostered the development of combined-cycle plants that use natural gas as a fuel. Its high efficiency makes natural gas the fossil fuel with the best energy performance. However, the need for a reliable supply means that other generation technologies must be made available. Accordingly, the Gas Natural Group has a complete R&D/i programme that includes investigations aimed at improving levels of performance and minimising the environmental impact of carbon- and fueloil-based generation. The Gas Natural Group. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 21 In 2009, the Gas Natural Group spent 15.39 million euros on R&D/i projects and activities. The Gas Natural Group also has a large electricity generation portfolio based on renewable energies. Although they are undergoing rapid growth, renewable energies do not offer the reliability required to satisfy all the energy demand at the present time. Nevertheless, the Gas Natural Group is committed to the generation of electricity using this type of source and to R&D and innovation in the development of cleaner technologies and the search for new solutions to integrate renewable energies with natural gas.

In 2009, the Gas Natural Group allocated 15.39 million euros to R&D/i activities and projects focused on achieving a more reliable energy supply compatible with sustainable development. In terms of energy efficiency, the activities were related to the creation of businesses devoted to energy services and related products. With regard to renewable energies, the projects focused on geothermal heat pumps and the combination of wind farms with the generation, storage and use of hydrogen. In the transmission and distribution of electricity, the projects focused mainly on the development of mobile substations and equipment and on the advanced management of electrical grids and the demand for electricity. In advanced generation technologies, the Company allocated resources to the research and development of technologies and equipment for capturing and storing CO2, as well as the area of ultra-supercritical coal power plants. In sustainability-related services, the most outstanding efforts were made in the development of advanced electrical equipment and technologies or improvements in combustion at coal power plants. A company committed to communities The Company generates wealth and employment in the countries in which it operates, which can be seen through the payment of salaries, taxes, investments and the creation of value along the energy chain. In addition, the Group takes part in social projects in line with its business whose purpose is to contribute to the development of the societies in which it is present. 22 Investment in R&D/i (millions of euros) 2.65 Advanced generation technologies. 0.82 0.52 3.7 Transmission and distribution of electricity.

The Group operates in countries in which the energy infrastructure is occasionally poor. For said reason, there are certain geographical areas in which the energy cover does not reach all the population. The Company works actively to serve the individuals, families and organisations located in areas for which it has been awarded a distribution or service licence. With regard to new investments and projects, the Gas Natural Group minimises the need for travel and the social and environmental impact that may be caused.

In order to avoid possible negative impacts caused by its activities on local populations, the Gas Natural Group uses the best technologies that are available, analysing all the technically viable options, establishing work meetings with representatives from public institutions and businesses and jointly studying the best options for the common interest. In this regard, special mention must be made of the fact that all individual travel was avoided in 2009 as a result of the Company's infrastructures development projects.  The Gas Natural Group. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 25 Energía Social Energía Social is the only electricity commercialisation business in Colombia and was created exclusively to provide its services in low-income areas, where electricity grids are not standardised. This initiative of the Gas Natural Group was launched in 2004 and aims to create a sustainable management model for the sale of energy to communities with rudimentary electricity grids. Energía Social applies a business model that is innovative and adapted to the populations it serves through the standardisation of the grids, the modification of the metering processes and the adaptation of the charges to its customers' needs through the creation of SMEs that attend underprivileged quarters. It is the result of working closely with the Colombian public administration to offer access to underprivileged collectives. Energía Social objectives focus on various strategic areas: the promotion of projects through the standardisation of electricity, increasing payment collection and bringing the company closer to the community. Energía Social has successfully reached a high level of proximity as far as customers are concerned through social action and advertising. This has meant that many areas of Colombia have a safe and reliable supply of electricity that is in line with their requirements. At the present time, more than 40,000 Colombian families have electricity thanks to this initiative. As reward for its work, Energía Social has received many acknowledgements, such as the European Marketplace for CSR in the category of Innovation, awarded by CSR Europe, and it is among the eight most successful examples of corporate responsibility in Latin America. Both awards were received in 2006.

Customer orientation  At the Gas Natural Group, corporate responsibility comprises the actions taken to establish relationships of trust with stakeholders. At the Gas Natural Group, corporate responsibility comprises the actions taken to establish relationships of trust with stakeholders and meet their expectations in a coherent and balanced way. The Company believes that an appropriate relationship with the environment constitutes a top-priority strategic issue that is essential for generating value in the long term. Historically, the commitment to society, sustainability and corporate responsibility has been one of the Company's signs of identity. This was also the case of Unión Fenosa, the company with which the Gas Natural Group completed a merger in 2009. The resulting new Group assumes the Corporate Responsibility Policy passed by the Board of Directors of Gas Natural SDG in 2008. The policy formalises the Company's standpoint and commitments to its stakeholders, taking the Company's Mission, Vision and Values as its base and in keeping with its strategic priorities. The Corporate Responsibility Policy is the expression of a management system that includes the entire Group and contains the seven commitments assumed by the Company in said area. These commitments are: • Customer orientation. • Commitment to results. • The environment. • Interest in people. • Health and safety • Social responsibility. • Integrity. The contents of this 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report have been structured in accordance with the above commitments. The Group has developed a control panel for monitoring the Corporate Responsibility Policy, reporting on its level of fulfilment and setting the corresponding targets. Reports on selected indicators are given in the various chapters of this Corporate Responsibility Report. The indicators refer to all the corporate responsibility matters the Company considers to be of material importance. They go back three years and make it possible to inform the various bodies of government and management about the results of the actions that are carried out, detect areas for improvement and set new targets. With regard to the publication of the Corporate Responsibility Report, special mention must be made of the fact that, internally, it corresponds to the Corporate Reputation Committee and to the Code of Ethics Committee. Its external publication can be seen in the publication of reports, the presentation of information on a variety of media and the Company's participation in work groups and forums. 32 Strategic management of corporate responsibility in the Gas Natural Group Mission, Vision and Values Leader in efficiency Strategic Plan Corporate Responsibility Policy Customer orientation Commitment to results Respect for the environment Interest in people Health and safety Social responsibility Integrity Performance monitoring and setting of improvement targets Reporting and communications plan  33 Governing bodies The commitment to society, sustainability and corporate responsibility form part of the Gas Natural Group strategy. The supervision of the Company's performance in this area falls ultimately to the Board of Directors, as provided in the recommendations of the Unified Code of Good Governance and the Board Regulations. In addition, the Company has a Corporate Reputation Committee and a Code of Ethics Committee that carry out important work in the Group in relation to the promotion and implementation of initiatives related to corporate responsibility. Corporate Reputation Committee Made up of representatives of some of the departments involved in the development of corporate reputation and responsibility initiatives. It is chaired by the Communications Department and Chairman’s Office. The Corporate Reputation Committee is responsible for developing corporate responsibility policies and procedures, coordinating the Company's reports in the area and supervising the external audit of the corresponding public information. It reports to the Management Committee, which, in turn, reports to the Board of Directors.

RepTrak carries out a measurement of the emotional reputation (RepTrak Pulse) according to the esteem, admiration, trust and impressions generated by the Gas Natural Group in society. It also assesses several attributes grouped together in seven dimensions: government, work, innovation, supply, finance, leadership and citizenship, which constitute the rational analysis of the Company's reputation (RepTrak Index). The model enables continuous assessment and, as a result, the implementation of specific measures aimed at improving the Company in the key areas of reputation. The Group started to use this tool in 2007. Since 2008, the RepTrak results are presented to the Board of Directors on a regular basis.

The customer is the Company's raison d'être, standing at the focal point of its business strategy. The Company uses its human and material resources to ensure customer satisfaction and works to continually improve its operations and processes in order to adapt to the specific needs of its different kinds of customers. One of the main objectives in the process of integrating Unión Fenosa in the Gas Natural Group is to identify and implement the two companies’ best practices in this field. The context for all of this is a strong culture of customer orientation, reaching beyond the Company towards suppliers, contractors and collaborating companies. The Gas Natural Group has implemented procedures and tools which enable it to know its customers’ needs precisely, and has communication channels designed to efficiently resolve its petitions and incidents. Customer Orientation Introduction This section presents both the Group's position and the principles included in its Corporate Responsibility Policy. Principals, main indicators and relevant actions This section deals with the indicators chosen by the Company to report on the putting into practice of the commitments in question, together with the actions carried out and targets set for the following financial year.  Corporate Responsibility and the Gas Natural Group. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 39 Effective communication with customers It is essential to communicate effectively with customers in order to detect and anticipate their requirements. The communication channels set up by the Gas Natural Group focus on attending customers, finding out their requirements, listening to and attending their claims. Basically, their object is to create relations of trust between the Company and its customers. In 2009, the Group began a process for the integration of practices and procedures, using the basis of the best practices in the two companies prior to the merger. The following are some of the main actions carried out in the field of communication in 2009: • Communication, according to its rate or market, of new developments which could affect customers due to legislative or regulatory changes. • Communication on matters relating to safety in gas use. Customers were sent two notifications in this regard, together with bills. In the Gas Centres, DVDs were handed out with advice in this field. • Notifying customers about matters relating to energy efficiency, saving, and the best use of gas and electricity installations. In the context of promoting energy efficiency, other initiatives were also carried out, of which we may highlight the following: • Signing of agreements with consumer associations to cooperate in user training, information and awareness campaigns in the fields of saving and energy efficiency. • Launch of “Gesto Natural” (natural gesture), a space on the Company’s website displaying energy efficiency initiatives, and which also includes simulators helping to achieve greater energy saving at home. • Incorporation of new guides and channels for the home and SMEs in the Energy Efficiency Channel. • Launch of Efiquest, an online space for exchanging and disseminating information on energy saving. With the customers who took part in the initiative, the Company managed to raise around 60,000 euros, which were donated to an NGO for an environmental recovery scheme. In 2009, with the aim of improving the quality of customer care, and as a result of the merger process, the Company carried out an in-depth analysis of the geographical structure and location of the Customer Service Centres. As a result of this initiative, there will be substantial improvements in customer care in the years to come. Furthermore, the Gas Natural Group carries out initiatives to address the barriers of language, culture and handicaps so as to be able to safely access and use energy and attend customers. For example, the Group offers some of its customers in Argentina, Spain and Mexico the possibility of receiving bills in Braille. In countries such as Spain, it is also common to use other languages other than Spanish when communicating with customers. 52 In 2009, with the aim of improving the quality of customer care, and as a result of the merger process, the Company carried out an in-depth analysis of the geographical structure and location of the Customer Service Centres. Corporate Governance One of Gas Natural Group priorities is to guarantee the efficiency and transparency of the governing bodies. Accordingly, the Company has adapted its procedures in this field to the good corporate governance recommendations of listed companies. The Gas Natural Group practices in corporate governance are described in detail in various annual reports, which are sent to the General Meeting of Shareholders for its knowledge or approval. The documentation prepared by the Gas Natural Group in relation to its corporate governance practices has the object of providing information on the most relevant rules and procedures implemented in the field, and to disclose the criteria used as a base for decision- taking. The General Meeting of Shareholders, the highest decision-taking body in the Company takes part in the development of corporate governance practices, as does the Board of Directors and its Committees: the Executive Committee, the Appointments and Remuneration Committee and the Audit and Control Committee. The Management Committee also plays a relevant role from the viewpoint of management. In 2009, the aforesaid governing bodies met as follows: • Board of Directors: twelve meetings. • Executive Committee: seven meetings. • Appointments and Remuneration Committee: eleven meetings. • Audit and Control Committee: five meetings. • Management Committee: monthly meetings. The Board of Directors, its Committees, and the Management Committee operated as expected during 2009, fully exercising their competencies without interference and in full observance of current legislation and the applicable standards, such us the Regulations for the Organisation and Operation of the Board of Directors and its Committees.

Note: the total and specific emissions of the charts have been calculated using pro forma figures to reflect the real trend of this indicator over the last three years. Narcea desulphuration project The Narcea desulphuration plant came into operation in 2009, adding to the desulphuration plant in La Robla, set up the previous year. The purpose of this plant is to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions, attaining performance levels in excess of 95%. This project has involved an investment of 67 million euros. It works as follows: the combustion gases from the electrostatic precipitator enter an open crushing tower in which a milk of lime is recirculated using recirculation pumps, retaining the sulphur dioxide and particles of the gases. The gases that have already been washed are sent to a heat exchanger, passing through a drip remover that retains the humidity carried by the gas. The air required for oxidation is injected through the absorber, using blowers that inject small bubbles. The contact surface between the air in the milk is increased using agitators. The amount of milk that feeds the absorber is controlled depending on the quantity of sulphur dioxide in the combustion gases. This value is calculated using the flow and the content of sulphur dioxide of the combustion gas, and is adjusted by the pH of the milk inside the absorber. The gypsum in suspension formed in the absorber is extracted directly to a full drying system, comprising band and hydrocyclone filters. The gypsum in suspension obtained as a by-product of the band filters is sent on a moving belt to the storage building. By the same token, and also with regard to 2007, emissions of solid particles were down 77% as a result of installing new control systems for the electrostatic precipitators, the SO3 injection systems at the power plants in Anllares and Narcea and the desulphuration systems installed. The substantial improvement of environmental figures has been helped by including new combined-cycle power plants to the production mix of the Group, which already accounts for 58% of the total. In this regard, we must remember that gas combustion does not produce emissions of sulphur oxide and particles and that nitrogen oxide emissions are extremely low. This, tied to improvements at the coal power plants, has led to a reduction of specific emissions of SO2, NOX and particles by 94%, 50% and 80% respectively, compared with 2007. No substances that damage the ozone layer are emitted at the Gas Natural Group installations.

Proposed actions for 2009 Actions taken 2009 Actions planned 2010 Level of compliance: High Medium Low  Customer satisfaction through service quality For the Gas Natural Group, the customer is the focal point of its business. Accordingly, in 2009, as in previous years, the Company carried out numerous actions and projects designed to improve the satisfaction of its customers and their perception of the Company. The main objective in 2009 was for the integration of Unión Fenosa in the Gas Natural Group to take place without any significant incidents in the service given to customers and the quality of processes. The global satisfaction index with the Gas Natural Group, measured for gas customers, amounted to 85.5% in 2009, an increase of 1.2 points which widens the gap against its competitors. Before the integration, the two companies had different mechanisms for measuring the satisfaction of their customers. For this reason, with the objective of offering homogenous, comparable satisfaction indices, the Company is making an effort to include its electricity customers in the model which the Gas Natural Group used prior to the integration. In the wholesale segment, counting both gas and electricity customers, 62% of customers were satisfied or very satisfied, according to the results of a satisfaction survey carried out in 2009 Of the many initiatives to improve service quality to the customer carried out in 2009, we may highlight the project developed in Servigas to improve emergency resolution times, which has helped to raise the customer satisfaction index by over two points. In Italy, improvements were implemented to reduce new service contracting times and make bills easier to read. The virtual office was set up on the Group’s website, allowing customers to consult important questions regarding their contracts. In Latin America, actions were carried out to improve customer care, applying new technologies to improve the service given and to simplify tasks. In Colombia, this enabled several improvements to be made, including the bill design and the complaint resolution process. In Mexico, measures were implemented, such as Internet bill printing, installation of prepayment meters and remote reading for industrial customers. Furthermore, payment methods were improved and extended (as they were in Guatemala) to create greater convenience for customers. In Brazil, working groups were created to analyse the main reasons for claims, to improve their resolution and prevent further incidents. In Argentina, two diagnosis projects were carried out focused on improving processes such as reading, billing or measurement control. Lastly, in Guatemala projects were developed to improve, inter alia, fraud control, while remote metering was implemented for a certain customer segment in order to improve service quality. In terms of the quality of electrical service, the Gas Natural Group considerably improved its TIEPI (Equivalent Time Interruption of Installed Power) in Spain, bringing it down from 1.30 hours in 2008 to 0.98 in 2009. The 2009 figure gives an electrical supply reliability of 99.988%. Club Unión Fenosa, the customer loyalty programme, celebrated 11 years of existence in 2009. The main object of the Club is to improve relations with customers through strengthening bonds and making exclusive offers. 44  Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 45 Number of customers (in thousands) Pro forma figures.

Strengthening customer orientation in Servigas One of the Gas Natural Group main priorities is to offer customers quality services which can meet their expectations. Servigas is a service for the maintenance of gas natural installations and equipment, with over 1.4 million customers in Spain. In May and June 2009, as part of the “Servigas Customer Satisfaction” project, a series of quality workshops were carried out for over 1,400 dispatchers and technicians who manage and perform the maintenance corresponding to this type of contract in customers' homes. For that purpose, a prior study was carried out in which over 2,000 customers took part, with the aim of identifying which service attributes were considered to be most relevant. In this context, 39 meetings were performed in which the main objective was to reinforce technicians’ comprehension of the attitudinal factors which were most of a priority for customers. These workshops were also used to strengthen other aspects relating to safety and applicable laws. The final result was that in the second half of 2009, customers' perception of Servigas has improved, to satisfaction levels of over 90%.  48 The organisation's commitment to its quality objectives During 2009, the Group continued with its commitment towards training, consolidating continuous improvement and customer satisfaction as part of the Company's quality culture. In addition to continuous training to raise employees’ awareness about quality, 12 training initiatives were carried out design to reinforce the skills of the persons responsible for the processes for the identification and selection of Lean Six Sigma initiatives, and specific training programmes for experts. More than 40 projects were carried out as part of the training, helping to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Company's different processes. Progress in quality management In 2009, significant progress was made in the integration of the quality management of the Group's business model. The object of the systems developed is to assist the process management, based on indicators, customer orientation and continuous improvement. All certifications for quality and environmental systems certified in accordance with the ISO 9001 and ISO 140001 standards in previous years were renewed after the pertinent audits were performed by authorised certification agencies. Furthermore, new installations and services, such as the Besós and San Roque power plants and the Gas Natural Soluciones energy services sale process, obtained the aforesaid certifications during 2009. The quality certification for the regulated electrical business was also completed with the incorporation of the MV/LV Network and Energy Control processes. As far as the integration of the quality, environmental and prevention of occupational risk management systems is concerned, in 2009 works began for the preparation of a new documentary framework to support the three systems and enable management to be optimised, costs to be minimised and efficiency to be increased. In Spain, the Group renewed the “Madrid Excelente” brand, having exceeded the standards of management excellence required. In the international arena, Electricaribe (Colombia) and Red Unión Fenosa (Moldova) certified their quality management system for commercial processes. In Brazil and Argentina, the certifications of its respective laboratories were maintained according to the ISO 17025 standard, and in 2009 temperature tests were included. The laboratory in Panama was certified in accordance with this standard. Corporate image (%) 85.4 85.7 83.6 84 84.3 82.9 64.7 82 70.2 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 2009 2008 2007 Latin America. Spain. Italy. In December 2009, the Quality Network met for the first time since the integration of Unión Fenosa in the Gas Natural Group. The network is made up of quality coordinators in the different business and is a critical element for disseminating the quality model and working towards meeting the targets set. Within the Energy Industries Committee of the Spanish Quality Association (AEC), Gas Natural took part in a benchmarking study of leading Spanish companies to ascertain the level of maturity in implementing improvement programmes and to be able to know the best practices in this field. It also played an active role in the Six Sigma Committee of the Spanish Quality Association, and in the CERPER) Certification Committee. Representatives of the Gas Natural Group also form part of the Governing Board of AENOR, of the Governing Committee of Club Excelencia en Gestión and the Executive Committee of Fundibeq: Latin American Quality Foundation. % Total responses good or very good image.

The values of the study for 2008 and 2007 differ from those published in the two previous years, given that a change of scale has been performed to homogenise with the domestic customer satisfaction studies. In 2007 and 2008 the scale was: highly satisfied-satisfied-somewhat satisfied-dissatisfied-very dissatisfied, and the satisfaction index was calculated by adding together the first three categories. In the 2009, the scale replaced the “somewhat satisfied” category with “neutral”, and the satisfaction index was calculated by adding together highly satisfied and satisfied customers, without including neutral positions. % Total responses from highly satisfied and satisfied. Note: Measured only for gas customers.  Implication of the value chain in the commitment to quality During 2009, the implementation of the Q-Model continued in Spain, allowing the management of the quality of the services provided by suppliers and the reduction of the no-quality costs resulting from suppliers' actions. This system has its own control panel to help with the diagnosis and direct monitoring of the costs and targets that are set. In short, the Q-model allows for greater efficiency in supplier management and an increase in the service quality provided to customers. Information on no-quality is used as a decision-taking parameter in assigning workloads. This all makes it possible to know which suppliers are more efficient, to provide incentives for them and to provide a better service. In addition to measuring suppliers’ performance, it is also important to anticipate and establish preventive measures. This was one of the areas for improvement in the international sphere in 2009. A plan for the implementation and consolidation of the authorisation model for suppliers and products was established in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Italy, the object of which was to help to select the best suppliers and the most appropriate products for the most critical activities in this business. After an initial authorisation process, suppliers must overcome a series of periodical assessments. 50 Argentina Brazil Colombia Spain Italy Mexico Total Variation % 08-09 Gas activity sales (GWh) 68,046 42,661 16,076 229,545 3,494 42,829 402,651 (16.36) Network renewal (km) 4.76 49.83 2.90 21 – 35.65 114 (16.56) Distribution network (km) 22,736 5,932 17,451 50,697 5,645 16,196 118,658 2.92 Increase with regard to 31/12/2008 (km) 376 51 399 2,119 124 293 3,362 (39.23) Regulatory inspections – – 475,163 1,390,086 – – 1,865,249 7.00 Network overhauled (km) 12,668 5,067 4,819 25,240 3,380 15,864 67,038 11.69 Renewal of connections (km) 13,215 1,833 106 3,507 258 4,504 23,423 (8.11) Note: Measured only for gas customers. General customer indicators The first quality meeting took place in Brazil; a team of internal auditors in this field was established. Meetings were held regularly with subcontracted companies in order to discuss results and opportunities for improvement. Thanks to these steps taken to improve customer service, non-conformities detected fell by over 90%. Supply of range of products and services adapted to customers' requirements After the integration process, the Gas Natural Group stands by its objective of being the market leader in terms of the range of offers, offering its customers a sufficiently broad spectrum so that they can contract that which best suits their needs. In this regard, 2009 saw the launch of Dual Plan, a joint gas and electricity plan added to the existing prices: • Mini Gas, for low-consumption users. • Basic Gas, for consumers without heating. • Optimum Gas, for customers with heating. • Family Gas, for homes with high gas consumption. • Business Gas, for small businesses with high consumption.

Length of electrical transmission and distribution lines (aerial and underground) by regulatory regime (km)(*) Following the integration process, the Gas Natural Group stands by its objective of being the market leader in terms of the range of offers. In 2009, special attention was paid to the Online Saving Plan rate, which enables customers to enjoy discounts in their bills if they receive all their notifications from the Company electronically. This plan helps to reduce the consumption of paper; the environmental impact is minimised and it is more convenient for customers. In 2009, the Gas Natural Group also promoted the installation of natural gas in homes which were without this service, offering six months free of charge or 100 euros of consumption free of charge in certain installations. In this context of promotion and development of natural gas, the Company gave over 1,500 customers and integrated energy management service. In 2009, Gas Natural Soluciones, which carries out these types of services, secured the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 quality and environmental certifications, respectively. In 2009, significant progress was also made in the implementation of natural gas as vehicle fuel. Particularly noteworthy in this regard is the awarding of the Municipal Transport Company (EMT) of Madrid contract for the supply of vehicular natural gas to 500 Madrid buses during 2010.  Effective communication with customers It is essential to communicate effectively with customers in order to detect and anticipate their requirements. The communication channels set up by the Gas Natural Group focus on attending customers, finding out their requirements, listening to and attending their claims. Basically, their object is to create relations of trust between the Company and its customers. In 2009, the Group began a process for the integration of practices and procedures, using the basis of the best practices in the two companies prior to the merger. The following are some of the main actions carried out in the field of communication in 2009: • Communication, according to its rate or market, of new developments which could affect customers due to legislative or regulatory changes. • Communication on matters relating to safety in gas use. Customers were sent two notifications in this regard, together with bills. In the Gas Centres, DVDs were handed out with advice in this field. • Notifying customers about matters relating to energy efficiency, saving, and the best use of gas and electricity installations. In the context of promoting energy efficiency, other initiatives were also carried out, of which we may highlight the following: • Signing of agreements with consumer associations to cooperate in user training, information and awareness campaigns in the fields of saving and energy efficiency. • Launch of “Gesto Natural” (natural gesture), a space on the Company’s website displaying energy efficiency initiatives, and which also includes simulators helping to achieve greater energy saving at home. • Incorporation of new guides and channels for the home and SMEs in the Energy Efficiency Channel. • Launch of Efiquest, an online space for exchanging and disseminating information on energy saving. With the customers who took part in the initiative, the Company managed to raise around 60,000 euros, which were donated to an NGO for an environmental recovery scheme. In 2009, with the aim of improving the quality of customer care, and as a result of the merger process, the Company carried out an in-depth analysis of the geographical structure and location of the Customer Service Centres. As a result of this initiative, there will be substantial improvements in customer care in the years to come. Furthermore, the Gas Natural Group carries out initiatives to address the barriers of language, culture and handicaps so as to be able to safely access and use energy and attend customers. For example, the Group offers some of its customers in Argentina, Spain and Mexico the possibility of receiving bills in Braille. In countries such as Spain, it is also common to use other languages other than Spanish when communicating with customers. 52 In 2009, with the aim of improving the quality of customer care, and as a result of the merger process, the Company carried out an in-depth analysis of the geographical structure and location of the Customer Service Centres.  Self-regulation in communication practices The Gas Natural Group is a member of Autocontrol, a non-profit association that manages the Spanish advertising self-regulation system. The Autocontrol controversy resolution system has been recognised by the European Commission owing to the fact that it observes and fulfils the principles of independence, transparency, contradiction, effectiveness, legality, freedom of choice and right to representation by the consumer, as laid down in Recommendation 98/257/EC. Last year, the Company became a member of the Advertising Self- Regulation Code for Environmental Arguments. This code, which was drawn up by the Ministry of the Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs and Autocontrol (the Association for the self-regulation of commercial communication), has the object of establishing a set of rules for the development, execution and dissemination of advertising messages including environmental arguments or references. The companies which have subscribed to this code undertake to use advertising messages including environmental arguments responsibly and truthfully. Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 53 As a result of the full liberalisation in the low voltage sector (domestics and SMEs), whereby users are allowed to choose the electrical commercialisation company, the Gas Natural Group and five state consumer associations agreed to draw up a code of good working practices for the commercial network guaranteeing respect for users' rights. The code defines the behaviour which is to be expected of the sales network, and develops a flexible system for resolving claims. The Gas Natural Group believes that this initiative generates confidence among consumers because it develops an innovative cooperation system with the consumer associations which represent them. The Group also signed other agreements on a regional scale in different autonomous regions, all of which with the ultimate objective of improving the service given to customers. Code of good practices with consumer associations  Long-term relations of trust with suppliers It is vital to establish commercial relationships which are lasting, stable and trustworthy with suppliers in order to guarantee quality in the service offered by the Gas Natural Group to its customers. Consequently, the Company promotes a policy for contracting suppliers which wish to work with the Company on a long-term basis, providing the requirements established are satisfied. In Spain, the Company called a tender for contracting piping activities, for Community Receiver Installation (IRC) and for the maintenance of polyethylene and steel networks in order to ensure the carrying out of services over a maximum of five years. In Moldova, contracts were made for the supply of electrical distribution materials, and for the piping of new electrical networks and maintenance thereof. A tender process was also opened for contracting electrical line wiring and maintenance services in Spain, Panama and Guatemala, which will allow new stable contracts to be established with the companies awarded the tender. In 2009, a clause was added to the Code of Ethics of the Gas Natural Group in the general conditions for contracting works and services. In the general conditions, the Group emphasises the need to comply with environmental standards regarding noises, spillages, electromagnetic fields and any other element which could disturb environmental conditions. 54 Consolidation since 1 May 2009 Pro forma figures 2009 2009 2008 Argentina 1,684,506 1,684,506 1,353,053 Brazil 725,898 725,898 874,306 Colombia 5,334,920 6,674,813 6,865,264 Spain(1) 13,344,473 15,257,763 – Guatemala 1,013,031 1,450,561 1,561,524 Italy 426,916 426,916 432,559 Mexico 1,405,935 1,364,957 1,105,245 Nicaragua 1,957,624 3,258,197 6,281,635 Panama 464,090 720,681 885,902 Total 26,357,393 31,564,292 19,359,488(1) (1) Full data are not available for Unión Fenosa for 2008.

Training on the value chain The Gas Natural Group believes that training suppliers helps to improve their performance, increases the quality of products and services and reduces costs. In Spain in 2009, 14 training programmes were carried out through the Energy Training Centre of the Gas Natural Foundation designed for employees of suppliers, contractors and collaborating companies. 301 courses and 52,297 hours of training were given overall, with the participation of 4,610 individuals. Also in Spain in 2009, the Gas Natural Group collaborated with the certification company CONAIF-SEDIGAS Certificación S.L. to examine agents specialising in apparatus maintenance and repair. Establishment of objective selection mechanisms The process for selecting the Gas Natural Group suppliers is governed by the following principles: • Effectiveness. • Efficiency. • Flexibility. • Equal opportunities. • Transparency. The Group's Awarding and Contracting General Standards are based on the above-mentioned five principles and, together with the General Standards for the Quality of Suppliers, are designed to select the most appropriate suppliers for each type of activity, with the ultimate aim of maximising the quality offered to the final customer. Before contracting a supplier, the Gas Natural Group has a preliminary step consisting of three compulsory requirements: • Observance of the quality and environmental standards established by the Company. • Compliance with the Occupational Risk Prevention Act. • Preparation of an Occupational Health and Safety Plan in all the work and services envisaged in the laws in force. 56 Bearing in mind the current deregulated market, with virtually identical prices and products, Gas Natural Comercializadora aimed to set itself apart with the “Natural Commitment” programme, which has the object of interacting with customers more efficiently, putting an emphasis on the quality of care and service, and offering value added implying considerable differences with regard to services offered by other companies in the sector. As well as keeping in permanent and personal contact with customers through the sales managers, the programme seeks to share with these customers its concern about environmental problems, such as the loss of forest masses in Galicia caused by forest fires in the summer of 2006. Gas Natural Comercializadora presented a website in which videos are used to give information on certain aspects of forests in general, and about Galician forests in particular. In return for the time taken by users in finding out about these matters, the Gas Natural Group, in partnership with the Accionatura Foundation, undertook to plant trees of an autochthonous Galician species. As a result of this initiative, around 5,000 trees were planted, making up an equivalent surface area of 10 hectares. The object of this initiative was not simply to plant trees, but to make an effective contribution towards environmental protection. After the project was completed, each collaborator was sent a certificate stamped by the Xunta de Galicia Regional Government and the Accionatura Foundation, indicating the tree species planted and their exact location. Over the next few years, regular monitoring will be carried out to ensure that the trees planted have properly rooted. Natural commitment, personal commitment  Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 57 In order to ensure that the selection process is carried out with the best guarantees, and that the requirements demanded of suppliers are strictly satisfied, the Gas Natural Group takes part in the RePro Platform, a system for publishing, classifying and authorising suppliers. In 2009, the application for assigning gas network and connection construction works in the Group began to operate, completing the development of the Asigna Project. This application optimises the compliance with the awarded works volumes by controlling suppliers’ workloads, taking into account the suppliers’ performance and capacity, inter alia. In Spain, the use of the Q-Model was consolidated, which is designed to manage and assess the quality of the services provided by gas distribution suppliers, thereby reducing possible no-quality costs resulting from suppliers' actions. This system was implemented in 2009 in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Italy, in order to assure quality in important activities and help to improve suppliers’ quality management systems.

In accordance with the commitments that have been established and in order to contribute to the development of the local communities and countries in which it operates, the Gas Natural Group encourages the contracting of local suppliers.  The guarantee of a regular gas and electricity supply is essential for providing a quality service and for fulfilling the Group's social function. Supply safety and diversity The guarantee of a regular gas and electricity supply is essential for providing a quality service and for fulfilling the Group's social function. Suppliers play an essential role in the gas distribution service. They are responsible for supplying gas in a stable and continuous way. The Group has a large portfolio of top-level suppliers which ensure that customers are supplied with gas with a high degree of reliability. The natural gas can be supplied either in gaseous state, via gas pipelines, or through liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers. During 2009, gas was procured at approximately the same proportion from both sources thereby achieving an optimised supply mix from the standpoint of sensitivity to interruption risks, with the object of ensuring continuous supply. Relations with suppliers are built around stable, long-term contracts. Accordingly, the Group guarantees a regular gas supply and suppliers can have a continuous flow of income, which is essential for completing the large investments required in the energy sector. The Gas Natural Group is aware that a good relationship with its suppliers has a direct impact on the quality of the service offered to customers, and therefore keeps in regular contact with its suppliers with the aim of establishing improvement measures. All the contracts signed by the Gas Natural Group adapt to the provisions laid down in the System Technical Management Rules. These rules are published by the Ministry of Industry and Energy and constitute a mandatory framework for all the players on the Spanish gas market. The Gas Natural Group has its own resources for generating electricity using various sources: combined cycles, hydraulic power plants, nuclear power plants, wind farms and other renewable and thermal sources. Because of this variety of production sources, the Group is able to ensure the reliability of the electrical supply it offers its customers. In developing its portfolio of new generation projects, the Group works in conjunction with national, autonomous and local authorities in Spain to keep the pool of installed power within the established limits, thus assuring efficient coverage of electrical demand, and collaborates in the development of social initiatives and demands through agreements with local authorities in the areas in which 58 Diversification in the sources of the supply (%) 3 2 Others (LNG).(1) Libya. 20 10 Nigeria.

In this regard, particularly noteworthy is the work carried out by the Company in collaboration with the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade in order to define and draw up the document which is currently in force on the Planning of Electricity and Gas Sectors. Furthermore, the Company cooperates closely and coordinates with the responsible authorities in markets where it develops new capacity projects through tender calls or public- private partnerships. All with the object of ensuring that installed capacity complies with long-term demand requirements. In certain countries in which the Gas Natural Group operates, electricity access programmes are also included, such as those promoted by Electricaribe for the normalisation of electrical installations in urban areas with deficiencies. In the predicted short- and mid-term energy scenario, the increase in power shall depend on environmental awareness, and this should trigger strong development of clean energies. Renewable development will mean it is necessary to complement the generation mix with other sources. The Group thus has a broad portfolio of generation projects in different phases of development and in different technologies: the Malaga and Barcelona combined cycles are in the final start-up phase, and will begin to operate commercially during 2010; while a number of hydraulic projects (extensions of existing power plants, pumping sets, etc.) and renewable projects, inter alia, are in the licenses phase. What is more, in order to ensure the correct correlation between supply and demand in each and every one of the markets in which it operates, it is continuously in contact with different authorities and institutions in the energy sector. The objective is to keep the pool of installed power within the established limits in order to ensure that the demand for electricity in Spain is efficiently covered at all times. The Company continuously controls and monitors real demand on the market, through the Electrical Control Centre. This information is used first of all to carry out short-term action in both generation and distribution. In the mid-term, the information is used to optimise production and consumption and for the annual (and several-year) planning of new generation and distribution investments. Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 59  The Gas Natural Group is committed to the creation of value for all its stakeholders. It believes that their participation in tenders, collaboration and cooperation are essential for attaining the business targets set in the Company's strategy. Pursuing the terms of the agreement signed on 30 July 2008, on 26 February 2009 the Gas Natural Group acquired the rest of its stake in Unión Fenosa from ACS, reaching 50% ownership in that company. As a consequence, it prepared the corresponding takeover bid, reaching 95.2% of the share capital. The General Meetings of Shareholders of Gas Natural and Unión Fenosa held on 26 and 29 June 2009, respectively, approved the merger by absorption of Unión Fenosa, S.A. and Unión Fenosa Generación, S.A. by Gas Natural SDG, S.A., by means of the dissolution without liquidation of the companies absorbed and the block transfer of all its assets to Gas Natural SDG S.A. The merger finalised in September 2009 and is the culmination of a takeover process that commenced in July 2008. It represents securing the goal to integrate the gas and electricity business lines into a single company with in-depth experience in the energy sector, able to compete efficiently in markets subject to a process of growing integration, globalisation and increased competition. The integration procedure continues to progress as planned. Throughout the Company, the Group has put in place the organisational structure that responds to the strategic priority of achieving successful integration of the companies, ensuring: the transfer of best practices between business and geographical areas; maximisation of the energy management margin overall; active management of the financial structure and driving the risk management and management control processes; maximising the ROA of regulated gas and electricity business lines, and the comprehensive management of gas and electricity customers, in line with the commitment to create value for its shareholders. The Group seeks to reach growing, sustained profitability, taking the principles of responsibility, efficiency and transparency as its initial starting point. This commitment has led it to assume outstanding practices in information transparency, establishing advanced communication channels so that the markets can form a complete, objective and truthful image of the Company's perspectives and performance at all times. The Group's business model is based on guaranteeing sustained growth from strict social and environmental criteria and has been recognised by the main socially responsible investment indices. In 2009, the Gas Natural Group was elected leader in its sector - gas distribution - by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Accordingly, the Company has successfully gained the trust of investors who understand that advanced practices in corporate responsibility constitute a good indicator of a company's governance and management quality. Commitment to Results  Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 61 The focus on results is one of the commitments laid down in the Gas Natural Group Corporate Responsibility Policy and is based on the following principles: • Working to consistently obtain profitability levels that are in keeping with market expectations. • Applying best practices in terms of informational transparency at all times, establishing channels of communication with the markets and with other stakeholders in order to strengthen its credibility and reputation.

Proposed actions for 2009 Actions taken 2009 Actions planned 2010 Level of compliance: High Medium Low  Focus on growing and sustained profitability Providing growing and sustained profitability is one of the Company’s main objectives. In 2009, the Gas Natural Group continued its consolidation and expansion process in Spain and abroad. Growth was mainly driven through the merger with Unión Fenosa, which enabled the electricity generation and distribution business lines to be developed. Net profit of 2009 was up 13.1% year-on-year, at 1,195 million euros. And this in the context of reduced energy demand and high levels of volatility, both concerning energy prices as well as the currency and financial markets. Since 30 April 2009, Unión Fenosa has been consolidated using the global integration method. As a consequence, the consolidated statement of income includes operations by the foregoing company since that date. Elsewhere, the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2009 contains assets and liabilities of Unión Fenosa that are not included on the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2008. The merger with Unión Fenosa finalised on 7 September 2009, after the shares for Unión Fenosa shareholders that were swapped were accepted for trading. This company then ceased to be listed on the Madrid Continuous Market. Consolidated Ebitda for the year totalled 3,937 million euros, up 53.5% year-on-year. Growth is largely due to the incorporation of Unión Fenosa since 30 April 2009. In pro forma terms, viz., if we consider the contribution from Unión Fenosa since 1 January and harmonising the contribution in the event of divestitures, Ebitda would have been 4,816 million euros, as against 4,800 for the previous year. Despite the drop in energy demand and the drastic decrease of electricity prices in Spain, growth of the regulated activities as well as levels of efficiency achieved in management of the global portfolio has enabled us to maintain operating profits in line with those of the previous year. Within the foregoing context, the profits achieved reflect the Group’s underlying business model, based on a proper balance between the regulated and deregulated businesses in the gas and electricity markets. Investments totalled 15,696 million euros and included the financial investment in the purchase of 80.5% in Unión Fenosa. The material investments for the year total 1,767 million euros, up 65.4% year-on-year, as a result of including Unión Fenosa’s investments, mainly in generation and distribution of electricity. On the stock market, the Gas Natural Group closed the year with a share price of 15,085 euros. This is an 8.2% fall with regard to the close of the previous year, in terms adapted through the share capital increase with preferential subscription rights that took place in March 2009. The Company allocated 730 million euros to the payout of dividends in 2009, 10% up on the previous year. These figures imply a payout of 61% and a profitability of 5%, taking the close at 31 December 2009 as a reference. For its part, capitalisation totalled 13,905 million euros, which makes the Gas Natural Group one of the largest Spanish companies in terms of capitalisation and one of the safest, soundest and most attractive securities of the financial markets of Spain and Latin America. 62 Shareholders and investors (%)(*) 14 3 Spanish institutional investors.

The new shares were issued at a par value of 1 euro plus an issue premium of 6.82 euros, totalling an issue rate of 7.82 euros per share and a total cash amount of 3,502 million euros. The share capital increase doubled the number of outstanding shares, totalling 895,552,056. To successfully support the placing of shares, the Company carried out intensive dissemination during the share subscription period. Two teams took part, one headed by the CEO and the other by the CFO, meeting a total of 118 investors in the main financial markets of Europe (London, Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Geneva, Amsterdam, Madrid and Barcelona) and the USA (New York and Boston). Share capital increase According to the Top 250 ranking of the biggest energy companies in the world, drawn up by the Platts agency, the Gas Natural Group is now the biggest worldwide company in the gas sector. The ranking highlights the financial results of the biggest energy companies around the globe based on the value of their assets, revenue, profit and return on invested capital, according to figures given by Capital IQ Compustat from Standard & Poor’s. In the 2009 publication, the Gas Natural Group was ranked 54th, up 16 places over 2008. With regard to companies in Europe, Africa and Asia, the Group is in 26th position. However, in the gas utilities sector, the Company is number one as a result of excellent financial results. The Gas Natural Group is currently the leader in gas and electricity vertical integration in Spain and Latin America, as well as the biggest global operator of LNG in the Atlantic basin. Following the merger with Unión Fenosa, the Company is present in 23 countries, where it has over 20 million customers and installed electricity power in excess of 17 GW. These figures, together with those provided by indices such as Platts, give an idea of Gas Natural Group robustness as a company and of its commitment to create value. According to the Platts agency, the Gas Natural Group is the leading worldwide company in the gas sector  Communication channels adapted to the needs of shareholders and investors The commitment that Gas Natural Group has with the market, shareholders and investors is based on informational transparency. Accordingly, with a view to offering its shareholders and investors the best service, the Company has laid down specific communication procedures. The following are worthy of special mention: • Investor relations. The Group provides the same information to institutional and minority investors, guaranteeing the principles of equality and the simultaneous publication of information. The Shareholder Assistance Office provides continuous service to minority shareholders. It was particularly busy in 2009 as a result of the merger with Unión Fenosa. • Communication programme with institutional investors and financial analysts. The purpose of this programme is to generate relations of trust between the Company and the aforementioned collectives, providing rigorous and transparent information on the Group's situation and outlook. • Corporate website. It contains the documentation required by the Transparency Act and the corresponding consolidating legislation. The Company also makes important efforts to strengthen other communication channels with its investors and shareholders: • Meetings all over the world to provide information on company forecasts or on relevant events that could affect the Company or its sector. • Participation in conferences and seminars of interest. • Regular sending of information of interest to the analysts and investors that monitor the Group more closely. Two shareholder identification studies were also carried out in 2009 to discover the typical investor in the Group and focus actions on attracting investors that were more appropriate as a result of their characteristics or their investment criteria.

This is a trend in the markets that is becoming stronger with every passing day. Investors demand that listed companies have attributes related to integrity, responsibility or transparency, because they understand that these represent indicators of good quality in corporate governance and management practices. These investors understand that investing in companies that take these values seriously can provide an additional premium of sustained profitability over time. In 2009, the Gas Natural Group maintained its presence on the socially responsible investment indices with the best reputation on the international scenario: Dow Jones Sustainability Index and FTSE4Good. The Company's presence on these indices represents external recognition that has been validated by the market concerning corporate good practices in social, environmental and ethnical issues. 66 On the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, in 2009 the Gas Natural Group led the gas distribution sector with a score of 83 points, up 9% on 2008. Of particular note is the fact that the Company is not only leader in terms of its outright score, but also in economic and environmental aspects. We must also highlight the outstanding qualification received in the areas of risk and crisis management, management of price risks, operating eco-efficiency and corporate reporting, among others. The Company was also included in the selective DJSI STOXX European index, the only company in its sector to receive this recognition. For the eighth year running, the Gas Natural Group was included in the FTSE4Good Index, which represents further recognition of its advanced management practices in social, environmental and ethical issues. By the same token, for the second year running the Company was included on the selective FTSE4Good Ibex, which recognises those Spanish listed companies that perform best in issues concerning corporate responsibility. It is worth underlining the Company's presence on the KLD Climate Change 100 Index, which comprises the 100 companies which, in the founders' opinion, show greater potential for contributing to the short-term and long-term reduction of the causes behind the climate change. Here, we should mention that the Gas Natural Group was the highest ranked Spanish company from the utilities sector in the Carbon Disclosure Project Global 500 report for 2009. The presence of Gas Natural Group on the selective investment indices regarding corporate responsibility is proof of the Company's efforts in area of sustainability and informational transparency. It also represents additional outside recognition that confirms the excellent progress of the Company's activities in this field.

The Gas Natural Group combines its business goals with protecting the environment and the proper management of stakeholders’ expectations in this issue. The Group's environmental policy is adapted to its businesses, activities and processes, and is based on the Company's commitment to sustainable development. The Environment The Company's environmental management is continually improved through raising awareness coupled with the efforts of employees. Of particular distinction in 2009 was the integration of environmental criteria in the value chain, improving eco-efficiency in processes, driving innovation, using the best technologies and contributing to the mitigation of climate change. All of this has taken place within a context marked by the integration of Unión Fenosa assets into the Gas Natural Group. Senior management is responsible for overseeing the environmental effort. The Quality, Health & Safety, Environment and General Services Department is responsible for defining the guidelines, policies, management models, environmental plans and schemes required to ensure compliance with the regulations and operational control of environmental issues. Coordination in this field is carried out through the Management Committee, made up of senior managers from the divisions and business areas; the Environment Committee, made up of environmental managers from units or installations, and taskforces.  Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 69 The environment is one of the commitments laid down in the Gas Natural Group Corporate Responsibility Policy and is based on the following principles: • Combating climate change by minimising the impact of its activities. • Incorporating environmental criteria into its business management to achieve maximum efficiency. • Ensuring that the applicable procedures are known and complied with all along the value chain. • Preserving biodiversity in the locations where it operates. • Promoting continuous improvement by assessing the Environmental Management System and reporting internally and externally on its efforts.

Proposed actions for 2009 Actions taken 2009 Actions planned 2010 Level of compliance: High Medium Low  Environmental management Environmental planning Environmental planning is carried out within the framework of the Company's policy and strategy. Every year, plans and schemes are put in place that include the aims and goals quantified by the Group’s units and companies. Set-up of environmental management systems The environmental management model of the Gas Natural Group is based on the UNE-EN ISO 14001 standard. The processes and activities at installations are governed by manuals and procedures that lay down guidelines concerning the organisation, planning, responsibilities and control of environmental issues. Environmental certification pursuant to the UNE-EN ISO 14001 standard encompasses Gas Natural SDG S.A., the Group's parent company, eleven gas distribution companies in Spain and three commercialisation companies: Metragaz, Gas Natural México and Gas Natural Soluciones. At the close of 2009, a total of 17,017 MW of electricity generation was certified, equivalent to 95% of the Group’s total installed power. With regard to electricity distribution, the Group was able to certify environmental aspects of the management of projects, works and maintenance in the transportation and distribution of electricity in Spain and distribution and commercialisation of electricity in Panama. Moreover, the installations of Unión Fenosa Gas, the production of liquefied natural gas at the Damietta plant (Egypt), the regasification plant at Sagunto, the professional services company O&M Energy, the engineering services of Socoin and the main work centres of the Company have all been certified. The Company has set up an environmental management system at the combined-cycle plant in Puerto Rico and in electricity distribution in Guatemala. Electricity distribution in Colombia, Nicaragua and Moldova are also at an advanced stage of set-up. Furthermore, the coal power plants, the Sabón power station, the combined- cycles plants of Palos de la Frontera and Nueva Generadora del Sur and the Hydroelectric Sector of Tambre-Ulla in Galicia are still registered with the EMAS European system, making the Gas Natural Group a leading company in the energy sector in terms of the number of centres verified in accordance with this demanding environmental standard. Tools to optimise environmental management The Group has developed management tools to help operational control of environmental issues, management of activities and integration of businesses. In 2009, the NorMA application was set up in Spain, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Panama, Guatemala, Moldova, Kenya, Egypt, Costa Rica, Mexico and Colombia. This enables identification and assessment of compliance with the legal requirements that affect activities. The system enables those in charge of businesses and units to be aware of the environmental requirements within the scope of their powers. This will be set up in the remaining countries in 2010. 70 Integration of environmental criteria • Specifications of supplies and products • Control of suppliers • Assessment of indirect environmental aspects Prevention of pollution • Operating control. • Risk assessment. • Risk minimalisation.

Environmental planning  Also in 2009, for the purpose of collecting environmental information, a new system of indicators was set up that will allow all environmental data and data on the Group's corporate responsibility to be integrated. The methodology developed by the Gas Natural Group to assess environmental issues, called environmental units (UMAS), characterises the environmental aspect in accordance with certain categories of impact and turns this into a dimensionless value. Both the UMAS tool as well as the environmental information system were developed for all of the Group's processes and countries. Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 71 In 2009, the Gas Natural Group began to develop a new system of indicators. This is a tool that enables the Group to monitor its corporate social responsibility, therefore including those criteria related to the Company's environmental performance. Also in 2009, development of environmental indicators was completed for all of the Group's businesses, processes and activities, using the operating criteria and environmental relations as the baseline. The tool measures the Group's environmental conduct and any departures from the environmental indicators. These are measured, analysed and followed up in order to see how they evolve over time. The indicators are presented in both absolute terms as well as by units of production. Given the growing volume of environmental information, the coming-into-operation of the indicators system enables compliance with some relevant goals concerning the management of information in this sphere: • Enter, store and calculate environmental information and evolution of the Group. • Set up a chain of authorisations that enables control of entry, validation and consolidation of data. • Decentralise the management process of environmental information. • Integrate previously scattered information into a single system. A new system of indicators The Gas Natural Group has systems to minimise and prevent the impact its activities and installations have on the environment. Elsewhere, the OCEN-MA tool enables optimisation of environmental variables in the generation processes, enabling compliance with the legal regulations and centralising information. All this helps optimise operation of the power stations. The Group also makes use of the Environmental Distribution System (SMD). This is a geographic information system on the environment where the electricity distribution installations are located. It enables, inter alia, analysis of the impact in designing lines and positioning new electricity substations and to apply corrective measures. The SMD information was updated in 2009 for the purpose of adding new protected zones and incorporating new mapping and environmental monitoring at the works and operation stage.  Assessment of environmental risks The Gas Natural Group has systems to minimise and prevent the impact its activities and installations have on the environment. The assessment of environmental issues in potential emergency situations involves two factors: the frequency with which situations occur and the serious nature of the consequences. The product of both is the risk, which allows the assessment and structuring of potential environmental issues. The Environmental Risks Assessment System (SERA) allows environmental risks of distribution facilities to be assessed (substations, power transformation centres and storage facilities) and to propose preventive and corrective measures appropriate for each risk. Similarly, the Group has an Aviary Fauna Risks Control System (CRA) which in 2009 added seasonal monitoring to nine major electricity lines. The system allows the Company to record environmental information close to the overhead cables, including a full description of the aviary and fauna species in each area. It also keeps a log of any incidents that have occurred and been documented over each section of lines. The emergency plans and their corresponding procedures identify and lay down the response to potential accident and emergency situations, in order to prevent and reduce their environmental impact. There were two emergency situations in 2009: a fire at a power transformer at the hydraulic power plant in Velle and a minor oil spill at the hydraulic power plant in Puente Nuevo. There was no significant environmental impact in either case. Environmental awareness and training Environmental training is vital as it enables the Group to comply with its commitment to preventing pollution and to ongoing improvement. In 2009, 8,116 employees received a total of 33,732 hours of environmental training, which focused on general aspects of the environment, environmental legislation, contamination of soils and groundwater, as well as knowledge of environmental auditing and other management tools. The Group also carries out efforts to increase environmental sensitivity of the society overall. It has set up different agreements with environmental and educational associations and institutions. Elsewhere, the Gas Natural Foundation organises seminars and other activities to raise environmental awareness. Assessment of compliance with legal requirements In 2009, three fines were applied in Spain totalling the amount of 28,110 euros. The Group has another three disciplinary proceedings against which it has appealed and which are pending decision. On an international scale, no fines or disciplinary proceedings were registered. In 2009, sound emissions were measured and controlled to check the legal compliance of operational installations and to answer complaints and claims. The most relevant step taken to reduce noise levels was to redesign 72  and homogenise the constructive elements of each type of the natural gas regulation and measurement stations. Measurements of electromagnetic fields were also taken to respond to requests submitted by individuals and public organisations. All of the results show values below those recommended by the European Union. We must also point out that Spain continued the certification process of non- conducting oil of high and medium voltage transformers for the “Authorised Control Organisation”, to comply with Royal Decree 228/2006 which establishes measures for removal or management of PCBs and devices that contain these. Environmental costs Environmental actions carried out by the Gas Natural Group cost 133.80 million euros in 2009. Of this, 109.43 million corresponds to investments, while the remaining 24.37 million was spent on environmental management costs. The significant increase of investments and expenditure over 2008 was a consequence of incorporating the Unión Fenosa assets into the Gas Natural Group. The key environmental investments were: • Environmental adaptation of the Meirama boiler for the use of low- sulphur content fuel (Fausto project). • The desulphuration plant for combustion gases, improved performance of the electrostatic precipitator and the changeover of low-NOX burners at transformer III of the Narcea power plant and installation of an induced-draught cooling tower for transformer II; • The wet desulphuration plant and the changeover of low-NOX burners in transformer II of the power plant in La Robla; • Repowering of the hydraulic power plants in Albarellos and Tambre and replacement of the turbine blades of transformers I, II and III of the power plant in Belesar; • Environmental improvements to the combined-cycle power plant in Sabón; • Adaptation of the waste tip at the power plant in Anllares; • Improvements to the cooling systems and water treatment systems; • Optimisation of performance of thermal power plants, and • Redesign and uniforming of the construction elements of each kind of regulation and measurement station (ERMs) to decrease noise levels at source and renew pipes and connections at the national and international gas distribution companies of the Group to avoid methane emissions.

With regard to environmental expenditure, we must make special mention of the allocations required to dismantle nuclear power stations. In this regard, the Gas Natural Group assumes the legal and economic undertakings to dismantle these installations in the event it ceases its activities. Every year the Group reviews the costs to be assumed during the period between definitive stoppage of the power station and its transfer to Enresa for dismantling and abandonment of the programmed activity. These costs are estimated on the basis of the existing contract between Enresa and the electricity companies. In order to pay the dismantling costs of nuclear power stations, at 31 December 2009 the Gas Natural Group had an allocation totalling 57.4 million euros. Environmental parameters In 2009, most of the environmental indicators of the Gas Natural Group increased in absolute value terms, as a consequence of incorporating the Unión Fenosa assets. However, improvements have taken to place at all of the Group’s installations to significantly reduce the environmental criteria. To enable the reader to compare figures, as far as possible this report provides the pro forma figures as a result of integrating the information from the Gas Natural Group and from Unión Fenosa into a single figure for the years reported. These are the values that really show the environmental status of the different business lines and reveal the efforts made by the Gas Natural Group to reduce its environmental impact and without any distortions through the integration process. Reduction of emissions In 2009, total emissions of SO2 were down 94% compared with 2007. This was due to the low generation of coal power plants, to using coal with a lower content of sulphur and to the performance of the wet desulphuration plants at La Robla and Narcea power stations. Elsewhere, total emissions of NOX were down 48% compared with 2007, through lower generation with coal, using low- NOX burners and to optimisation of combustion processes. 74 Breakdown of environmental expenditure (%) 12 Waste management. 16.9 5.6 Water management.

Note: the total and specific emissions of the charts have been calculated using pro forma figures to reflect the real trend of this indicator over the last three years. Narcea desulphuration project The Narcea desulphuration plant came into operation in 2009, adding to the desulphuration plant in La Robla, set up the previous year. The purpose of this plant is to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions, attaining performance levels in excess of 95%. This project has involved an investment of 67 million euros. It works as follows: the combustion gases from the electrostatic precipitator enter an open crushing tower in which a milk of lime is recirculated using recirculation pumps, retaining the sulphur dioxide and particles of the gases. The gases that have already been washed are sent to a heat exchanger, passing through a drip remover that retains the humidity carried by the gas. The air required for oxidation is injected through the absorber, using blowers that inject small bubbles. The contact surface between the air in the milk is increased using agitators. The amount of milk that feeds the absorber is controlled depending on the quantity of sulphur dioxide in the combustion gases. This value is calculated using the flow and the content of sulphur dioxide of the combustion gas, and is adjusted by the pH of the milk inside the absorber. The gypsum in suspension formed in the absorber is extracted directly to a full drying system, comprising band and hydrocyclone filters. The gypsum in suspension obtained as a by-product of the band filters is sent on a moving belt to the storage building. By the same token, and also with regard to 2007, emissions of solid particles were down 77% as a result of installing new control systems for the electrostatic precipitators, the SO3 injection systems at the power plants in Anllares and Narcea and the desulphuration systems installed. The substantial improvement of environmental figures has been helped by including new combined-cycle power plants to the production mix of the Group, which already accounts for 58% of the total. In this regard, we must remember that gas combustion does not produce emissions of sulphur oxide and particles and that nitrogen oxide emissions are extremely low. This, tied to improvements at the coal power plants, has led to a reduction of specific emissions of SO2, NOX and particles by 94%, 50% and 80% respectively, compared with 2007. No substances that damage the ozone layer are emitted at the Gas Natural Group installations.  Management and reduction of waste The Gas Natural Group appropriately segregates stores and manages its waste. Management is always geared at minimisation of waste generated, both the amount as well as the hazardous nature, prioritising recycling and reuse over other management options and energy recovery as a preference over dumping. Waste is managed in accordance with the current regulations in each country. All installations have the corresponding authorisations for producers of hazardous waste, which enable registration, stocktaking, storage and management. The waste as a result of the Group's activities can be classified as urban, non-hazardous and hazardous. Urban waste, such as paper, cardboard, organic and glassware, is mainly generated at work centres. Most installations recycle paper and the remaining waste is managed through the municipal refuse collection services. Ashes and cinders generated at those plants that use coal as fuel along with the gypsum in suspension produced at the desulphuration plants account for most non-hazardous waste. Rubble from the work is also relevant, and this is produced during earth movements linked to works for the gas distribution network and maintenance tasks. The production of ashes was down 71% in 2009 compared with 2008, due to lower electricity generation using coal and also to the coals used. The amount of recycled ashes also increased significantly, reaching 82% of the total generated. Most hazardous waste generated in the processes comes from transformer insulation oils and lubricants from rotating machines, muds from the treatment of waters and fuels and hydrocarbons with water. In 2009, a total of 10,813 tonnes of hazardous waste was managed, with a notable increase over the previous year. The increase was mainly due to the chemical washing of the boiler at the power station in Meirama and to management of hydrocarbon- contaminated terrain. As part of the Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Elimination Plan, 279 tonnes were managed, inventories were taken, and PCBs were withdrawn and properly stored in the international area, thus considerably reducing the risk of pollution in installations due to spillages of this waste. Furthermore, 34 hazardous waste minimisation programmes were carried out in thermal and hydraulic power plants, wind farms and electrical distribution. 76 Consolidation Pro forma Type since 1 May 2009 figures Treatment method Rubble 895,314 895,663 Landfill Ashes 115,757 173,635 Recycled Gypsum in suspension 27,269 40,904 Landfill and recycled Cinders 22,761 34,141 Landfill Muds from treatment plant and sewage 8,811 12,843 Landfill and recycled Scrap 4,036 5,969 Recycled Vegetable waste 1,456 2,184 Landfill Urban-attributable waste 733 990 Landfill Paper and cardboard 682 720 Recycled Deposits 373 560 Landfill Wood 399 527 Recycled and energy recovery Porcelain, glassware and ceramics 264 396 Energy recovery Computers 128 179 Recycled Plastics 157 172 Recycled Rockwool 67 88 Landfill Toner, cartridges and CDs 11 16 Recycled Glass 2 2 Recycled Others 1,922 2,673 Recycled and landfill Total 1,080,130 1,171,662 Non-hazardous waste managed (ttonnes)  Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 77 Consolidation Pro forma Tipo since 1 May 2009 figures Treatment method Hydrocarbon-contaminated terrains 2,296 3,441 Landfill Chemical washing waters 1,810 2,715 Recycled and landfill Hydrocarbons plus water 1,550 2,292 Recycled Used oil 646 893 Recycled and energy recovery PCB and transformers with PCB 186 279 Incineration Asbestos 72 108 Landfill Electric and electronic waste 64 92 Recycled Solid waste contaminated with hydrocarbons 57 81 Incineration Absorbent, isolating and filtering materials 61 78 Energy recovery and landfill Empty contaminated packaging 39 51 Landfill Batteries and accumulators 30 40 Recycled Muds from treatment of water/wastewater 19 29 Landfill Muds from oil and fuels 19 25 Incineration Aqueous solutions 15 16 Recycled THT filters 8 8 Recycled Non-halogenated solvents 5 7 Recycled Fluorescent lights 4 6 Recycled Laboratory waste 3 4 Incineración Paint and varnish 3 3 Recycled Bio sanitary waste 2 2 Recycled Others 459 643 Energy recovery Total 7,348 10,813 Hazardous waste managed (tonnes) Generation and recycling of ashes (tonnes) Ash recycled.

The excellent performance of the treatment plant equipment and systems in 2009 has enabled the installations to comply with the spillage authorisations. The capture of water from Gas Natural Group installations in 2009 reached 1,361 Hm3. 97% of water captured comes from the sea. Consumption of water was 4.4% of the volume captured. Based on studies performed, the capture of water has not caused significant impacts on the aquatic ecosystems. 82% of water consumption at the Gas Natural Group is due to evaporation of the cooling towers at the thermal power plants, while the remainder is divided between consumption during the water-steam cycle and ancillary services. Of particular note is the recovery of water from urban waste water in cities close to the power plants of Hermosillo and Naco-Nogales in Mexico and Ecoeléctrica in Puerto Rico, as well as the recovery of wastewaters with slurry at the cogeneration plants. Streamlining consumption of energy and material resources The major consumption of resources refers to fuels and, to a lesser extent, chemical products. A total of 1.78 million tonnes of coal and 0.44 million tonnes of fuel-oil were consumed in 2009. 59% of this is from imported coal, with a low sulphur content and very environmentally friendly. Coal consumption, both national and imports, dropped 49% for domestic coal and 39% for imported coal in 2009. 78 Consolidation since 1 May 2009 Pro forma figures Surface water captured (sea) 969.79 1,315.08 Surface water captured (rest) 25.10 33.62 Groundwater captured 3.70 4.98 Wastewater used, from another organisation 2.76 4.15 Water captured from the supply network 1.87 2.72 Rainwater collected and stored 0.63 0.94 Total volume of water captured from the environment 1,003.86 1,361.49 Water capture by source (Hm3) Consolidation since 1 May 2009 Pro forma figures Consumption of cooling water 43.31 48.98 Consumption of water in water/steam cycle 3.86 4.77 Consumption of water in other processes 2.60 3.48 Consumption of water in ancillary services 1.54 2.27 Consumption of water in buildings 0.36 0.46 Total water consumption 51.67 59.96 Water consumption (Hm3) Consolidation since 1 May 2009 Pro forma figures Water dumped into the sea(*) 721.97 1,064.81 Water dumped into rivers 9.38 13.03 Water dumped in the public network 0.42 0.50 Water dumped in septic tanks 0,02 0.02 Total volume dumped 731.78 1,078.35 (*) Part of the sea water captured and used for cooling in the open cycle was not considered as dumped.

Other significant consumption is through the odorisers used in transportation and distribution of natural gas, the insulating oils from the transformers and the lubricant used in the rotating machines and pumps, and the lime added to the absorbers of the desulphuration plants. Paper consumption at Company work centres totalled 403 tonnes, 34 tonnes of which was recycled paper. The initiative to reduce paper consumption include the use of digital media, sending electronic information to customers and suppliers, as well as recommendations to employees to lower the amount of documents and emails that are printed. Climate change The Gas Natural Group shares social concerns for the climate change and has an active policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Company seeks sustainable development in the short-, medium- and long-term, and rational use of energy is essential for this. The Company also believes that decisions taken in this regard by the competent institutions must be assessed using a balanced equilibrium between the social, environmental and economic aspects. The Group’s strategy and policy as far as energy is concerned is in line with objectives for the security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability. Future energy scenarios will be shaped by energy efficiency and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Company also believes it is necessary to design a post-Kyoto framework, dispelling uncertainties and focusing on investment on clean and sustainable energies and towards technologies for the capture and storage of CO2, within a balanced mix of energy, providing us with a sufficient guarantee of supply to meet the expected demand. In this context, natural gas will play a critical role, both in the transition towards an economy which is less coal- intensive, and because of the role it will have in the global energy balance in the future. Natural gas is the fossil fuel with the lowest emissions into the atmosphere, both greenhouse gases as well as other polluting substances. With natural gas, electricity generation, industry, the tertiary sector, housing and also the transport sector are able to use a fuel with higher environmental quality,  which can also be easily combined with the different types of renewable energies. Reductions of greenhouse gases of the Group will be carried out through the three core focal points: improving eco-efficiency, carbon management and raising society’s awareness. The Company's specific aims in this area are as follows: • Reduce specific emissions of CO2 from electricity generation. • Reduce overall emissions of CO2 from coal power plants. • Minimise emissions of GHG in developing countries using CDM projects. • Avoid GHG emission through saving and efficiency in the end use of energy. • Reduce CH4 at transportation and distribution installations of natural gas. In order to comply with its undertakings, the Group's strategy is based on proper management of fossil fuels, on renewable resources, on energy saving and efficiency, on sustainable mobility, on management of coal markets and, finally, on schemes to manage demand. Evidence of the commitment of the Gas Natural Group in this area is shown through its presence on the programme titled “Caring for Climate: the Business Leadership Platform”, a platform of companies taking part in the UN Global Compact, whose goal is to fight against the effects of climate change by improving efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2009, the Gas Natural Group was also the highest ranked Spanish utility company in the Carbon Disclosure Project, an initiative backed by institutional investors from around the world to distinguish the best performing companies in areas of mitigating climate change. Similarly, prior to being integrated in the Gas Natural Group, Unión Fenosa was the only Spanish company included on the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index, which distinguishes the top 50 companies in the Carbon Disclosure Project. Promoting energies that are less polluting, along with the best technologies The use of less carbon-intensive energy sources and the best technologies in combustion of fossil fuels are two basic ways to reduce emissions of CO2. The combined cycles of gas currently represent the most efficient technology to produce electricity from fossil fuels. Performance is up to 20% better than the rest of alternative technologies. The Gas Natural Group is one of the major combined-cycle operators in the world. It has 11,379 MW of installed power, with new cycles under construction in Spain and Mexico. Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 81 Gas Natural Group shares social concerns for the climate change and has an active policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  With regard to eco-efficiency of the Gas Natural Group, of particular note is the use of coal with higher calorific power, improved performance of the thermal power plants, the set-up of a performance supervision system at the coal power plants and development of a project to optimise combustion. Similarly, the Company is studying the inclusion of biomass at the coal power plants to replace up to 15% of the coal burned in the so-called co-combustion process. This initiative could avoid the emission of up to one million tonnes of CO2. The Gas Natural Group calculates its CO2 footprint through an inventory, control and check of greenhouse gas emissions from its activities in all countries where it has a presence. Total emissions of the Group in 2009 reached 25.76 million tonnes of CO2 eq, with an energy mix emission factor of 337 gCO2/kWh, down 7% on the previous year. Emissions from the Group’s coal power plants fell 77% in 2009 compared with 2007, falling from 13.49 million tonnes of CO2 in 2007 to 3.06 in 2009. Specific emissions from the thermal power plants dropped 24%, from 539 tCO2/GWh in 2007 to 411 in 2009. 82 Consolidation since 1 May Pro forma figures 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Cogeneration 165,561 74,231 56,121 170,504 74,231 56,121 Specific emissions (gCO2/kWh) 429 558 561 394 558 561 Combined-cycle power plants 16,086,789 10,824,683 6,553,228 19,294,115 20,643,134 14,987,529 Specific emissions (gCO2/kWh) 371 354 368 369 357 365 Coal power plants 2,042,867 0 0 3,064,301 6,999,585 13,492,002 Specific emissions (gCO2/kWh) 981 – – 981 1,011 1,110 Fuel-oil power plants 714,840 0 0 1,072,260 1,156,120 968,965 Specific emissions (gCO2/kWh) 669 – – 669 684 681 Total electricity-thermal generation 19,010,057 10,898,914 6,609,349 23,601,181 28,873,070 29,504,617 Group thermal mix emission factor (gCO2/kWh) 406 355 369 411 433 539 Group emission factor (gCO2/kWh) 342 347 353 337 362 437 Emissions of CO2 from electricity generation (tCO2) Emission factor (g/kWh) Group emission factor.

To comply with the obligations stemming from the Spanish National Plan for Assignment, the Gas Natural Group ensures coverage of the deficit of emissions by carrying out projects within the sphere of Clean Development Mechanisms and Joint Applications, participation in carbon funds and the purchase of emission rights on secondary markets. In 2009, the Gas Natural Group prevented the emission into the atmosphere of more than 7.5 million tonnes of CO2. The calculation includes, inter alia, activities surrounding energy management, transformation of industrial and residential installations from coal and fuel-oil to natural gas, the development of CDM projects, the use of vehicles that run on natural gas, and video conferences.

Besides, the Group co-leads the CENIT CO2 Project. The Group also backs electricity generation using renewable sources. In 2009, 6,509 GWh was generated at the 2,845 MW of conventional hydraulic energy installed, 281.5 GWh at the 90.7 MW of installed power at mini- hydraulic power plants, 1,616 GWh at the 801 MW of installed wind power, and 474 GWh was produced at cogeneration plants. The mini-hydraulic power plant of Los Molinos de Bolarque, the Ecological Channel of Frieira, the wind farms of San Gil, Loma Gorda, Peña I, Peña II, Coto Codesas, Picazo, Espina, Valdelacasa and the slurry treatment and electricity generation plant in Almazán all came into commercial operation. Similarly, with regard to the Group's activity in developing cleaner technologies and the search for new solutions to integrate renewable energies with natural gas, we should highlight the following initiatives: • The first experimental reduction and storage of hydrogen plant in Europe, to study the appropriateness of this vector as a means of storing energy in gas form. • The first solar cooling plant in Europe with twin-effect technology, which enables better use to be made of solar energy to provide cooling for air- conditioning systems. • The SPHERA Project to obtain hydrogen from renewable resources or through procedures that do not involve emissions of CO2 and the use of these in electricity generation. 84 The Gas Natural Group channels its demand management programmes through actions to improve energy efficiency developed by its Energy Efficiency Centre. Since 2004, the Company has worked on developing different actions to promote energy-saving and efficiency geared at corporations, SMEs and domestic customers. In the residential sector, the Company invests in campaigns to disseminate and raise awareness so that the consumer can build a new culture of energy management. The following actions are of particular note: • Energy Efficiency Indices. Studies to find out energy conduct in homes and at SMEs. • Training and dissemination campaigns, including the Efficient Home, the Virtual Forest and the preparation of educational guides. • An exclusive website for energy efficiency issues. • Participation at exhibitions, courses and seminars. • Advertising campaigns on radio and TV. With regard to campaigns targeted at the consumer in 2009, the main activities were: the Efiquest Internet campaign to raise awareness and training; the training programme at centres for the elderly, together with the City Council of Madrid; the energy efficiency campaign for employees with an electricity agreement; the set-up of geothermal heat pumps in family homes and, finally, the fifth publication of the Energy Efficiency Index in Spanish households. Elsewhere, the following activities were carried out at the Company: • Energy advice programmes (pre- diagnosis, diagnosis and energy analysis for corporate users and companies. • Development of products and management of subsidies for energy saving and efficiency projects. • Development of online tools for companies to find out the most efficient habits. • Participation in national and international R&D/i projects. • Creation of collaboration ties with universities, technological centres, business associations and consumer associations to promote energy efficiency. In 2009, the main actions carried out at the Company were as follows: the energy efficiency Master Plan at CRTVE; the Master Plan at Prisons, the Master Plan at Telefónica; the energy efficiency campaign in the hotel sector; the fifth publication of the Energy Efficiency Index at SMEs; the Street Lighting Renewal Plan, which includes energy audits in municipalities and on university campuses. Demand management at the Gas Natural Group  Reduction of methane emissions on networks Methane emissions occur in gas exploration, transport and distribution operations. In 2009, these totalled 1,381,866 million tonnes of CO2 eq, 481,685 million of which occurred in Spain. Overall, the specific emissions of methane reached 0.82 kg CO2 eq/GJ of gas administered. The use of better materials and the establishment of a comprehensive pipe monitoring and renewal plan have allowed the Company to reduce its emissions of CH4 per unit and network length by 36% in comparison with 2003. Reduction of emissions through clean development mechanism projects The Gas Natural Group is also committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through clean development mechanisms (CDM), one of the most flexible mechanisms established by the Kyoto Protocol. The Company takes part in several carbon funds: Spanish Carbon Fund, Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund, Natsource Carbon Asset Pool and Community Development Carbon Fund, with investment of nearly 60 million euros. We must also add the bilateral procurement of emission rights from the primary projects of different sectors. To date, the Gas Natural Group has registered eight CDM projects with the United Nations: the hydraulic plants of Los Algarrobos, Macho de Monte and Dolega in Panama, that of La Joya in Costa Rica and that of Amaime in Colombia; the use of biogas for energy at the Doña Juana Landfill in Bogotá (Colombia); the Sombrilla Project in Bogotá (Colombia), to replace fuel-oil with natural gas at eight industrial plants, and the Quimvale Project in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), in which fuel-oil has been replaced with natural gas in a calcium carbonate industry. Other CDM projects driven by the Company are at different stages of validation. Developed in countries such as Colombia, Guatemala, Brazil, Mexico and Panama, they are based on generation using renewable sources, the set-up of cogeneration systems, the reduction of emissions in gas networks and replacement of fuels. Energy saving and efficiency The Gas Natural Group also promotes rational and sustainable consumption of energy among its customers. The Group's web page has a “Gesto Natural” section that offers energy saving and efficiency tips in the home. Furthermore, the Company focused on the development of specific solutions for the use of natural gas as a fuel in the airport sector and progress in its implementation in the fishing industry, as well as high efficiency poly-generation in the tertiary sector. Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 85 Sustainability and biodiversity The Gas Natural Group includes the undertaking to preserve biodiversity in its environmental management systems. This means it performs a great many actions targeted at knowledge of ecosystems and habitats surrounding its installations. It also drives restoration and compensation projects when the environmental impact cannot be completely avoided. Moreover, the Group collaborates with different social organisations to support their initiatives in the defence of nature.  Study of ecosystems To characterise the environment and study the environmental impact of the installations, the Group carries out studies of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in those areas around the electricity power plants. All studies performed in 2009 were satisfactory. In this context, in those lands surrounding the coal and fuel-oil installations, the Group carries out studies every two years on the forestry mass to find out its status and the impact of air pollution. The methodology used is based on European regulations and on publications produced by the International Cooperative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of the Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP-Forests). 86 The Gas Natural Group performs a great many actions targeted at knowledge of ecosystems and habitats surrounding its installations.

Integration with the environment and environmental restoration The Gas Natural Group carries out environmental impact studies and surveillance programmes which ensure compliance with preventive measures and minimise the possible impacts of projects and processes which are not subject to environmental impact assessments. In 2009, the Group also played an active role in various initiatives geared at improving biodiversity, such as reforesting, recovering endangered flora and fauna and archaeological activities. Similarly, for the purpose of promoting and collaborating in the preservation of biodiversity in the region, the electricity lines have been adapted to the Royal Decree governing Protection of Birdlife, together with the regional environmental authorities. Last year there were six incidents that caused minor spillages. They were all cleaned up and properly managed and there was no environmental impact. Environmental impact studies To avoid possible adverse effects, the Gas Natural Group carries out environmental impact studies for its projects. Public participation in the procedures to approve these projects is ensured through national and regional legislation in each country where the Company carries out projects. 88 Initiative Results Initiatives for reducing the environmental impact of activities, products and services Initiatives relating to the use of materials Removal of dosage of sulphuric acid at the Sagunto cooling towers.

Environmental impact The Gas Natural Group ensures that the activities of generation, transportation, distribution and commercialisation of electricity and gas is compatible with protecting the environment and the life quality of the public. To this end, it seeks new focuses that enable it to keep the balance between the value of natural resources used and the wealth generated by the business. The Group developed an environmental management tool, called environmental units (UMAS). This tool quantifies the environmental aspects over time using the life-cycle analysis methodology and the different stages given in the 90 Impact classification UMAS Generation of hazardous waste 3,186 Acidification of the atmosphere 314 Global warming 182 Toxicological impacts: affecting the air 152 Generation of non-hazardous waste 135 Noise pollution 119 Winter smog 59 Water quality 35 Collision with birds 31 Consumption of abiotic resources: water resources 26 Eutrophication: affecting aquatic ecosystems 19 Photochemical smog 9 Consumption of abiotic resources: other resources 2 Consumption of abiotic resources: energy resources 1 Total UMAS 4,270 Note: The environmental impact corresponds to the environmental aspects of installations considered as the totality of each installation, without considering the consolidation percentage. Quantification of the environmental impact in UMAS international ISO 14040 standards. This enables the UMAS methodology to quantify the evolution of atmospheric emissions, consumption, resources, waste, water quality, noise and the impact on birdlife, inter alia. The methodology characterises the environmental aspect in accordance with certain classifications of impact (acidification, winter smog, waste generation, global warming, water quality, eutrophication, photochemical smog, etc.) and gives the environmental impacts a dimensionless value (UMAS) regardless of their nature. The environmental impact of the Gas Natural Group installation measured in UMAS has reduced in recent years, due mainly to the coming-into-operation of the low-NOx burners and equipment to remove sulphur, to improved environmental quality of the fuels used, and to improvements in the combustion processes and in the electrostatic precipitators of particles.  Involvement of suppliers and customers The environmental commitments of the Gas Natural Group are not restricted to an internal scope, but extend to the value chain. 84% of its main distribution works and infrastructure contractors, and 100% of works inspection services and suppliers have voluntarily joined the Good Environmental Practices in Distribution Network Construction. In addition, the Company tries to raise customers’ awareness of the importance of responsible and rational use of energy. In this regard, together with the Gas Natural Foundation and wholesale and retail commercialisation businesses, it carries out campaigns, sponsors events and provides training under the Gesto Natural initiative. This has led the Company to establish cooperation agreements with many regional and local institutions. Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 91  The Gas Natural Group project involves 19,803 individuals in over 20 countries. Roughly half of these carry out their activity outside Spain, clear evidence of the strong international vocation and the richness and diversity of the Company. The Group’s human resource strategy is based on its Mission, Vision and Value statement, more specifically the following: • Fostering an environment of respect in the workplace, focused on employees’ training and professional development. • Encouraging a plurality of opinions, outlooks, cultures, ages and genders. The integration procedure has brought with it the need to analyse the previous human resource management of both companies, identifying the practices most suitable to the needs of the new Group and capitalising on the best ones. The human resources function needs to be flexible, adaptable and with the ability to drive changes. It must also constantly offer the possibility of a rapid response in line with business needs and priorities. During 2009, a human resources model has been consolidated based on management units which define the human resources policies and models, and on the figure of the business partner as the strategic business advisor in the implementation and adaptation of policies and models in the businesses and countries. The scope of information reported in this part is described in the “Process for Drafting this Report” section. Interest in People  Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 93 Interest in people is one of the commitments laid down in the Gas Natural Group Corporate Responsibility Policy, and is based on the following principles: • Providing employees with professional development opportunities commensurate with their skills. • Fostering a motivational working environment, where employees are treated with respect and their initiatives are considered in responsible fashion. • Encouraging clear targets, efficient leadership, competitive compensations and acknowledging the targets met. • Providing conditions which are conducive to a fair balance between professional and personal life within a framework of equality and dialogue.

Instead, the integration plans for new staff members of the Gas Natural Group and Unión Fenosa were analysed, to propose a new integrated integration plan.  Equal opportunity, diversity and social integration as levers for growth The commitment that Gas Natural Group has with its employees encompasses equal opportunities, diversity and the offer of an attractive and stimulating professional career. The Company rejects discrimination on any grounds, specifically those based on age, gender, religion, race, sexual orientation, nationality or disability. This commitment covers the selection and promotion processes, which are based on the assessment of the individual's skills, the analysis of the requirements that apply to the position and individual performance levels. In 2009, the Company laid the foundations for the creation of an Equal Opportunities Committee, due to be set up in the first quarter of 2010. The Equal Opportunities Committee will draw up the Equality Plan for Group Companies in Spain. The commitment to equal opportunities and social integration goes beyond compliance with legislation. The Group encourages recruitment of disabled persons, offering a work environment that enables them to develop under equal conditions. One of operating principles of the Gas Natural Group is to comply strictly with the legal requirements of each country in which Group companies are present. In Spain, the minimum target is for 2% of the workforce to be represented by disabled persons. It resorts to alternative measures with suppliers that employee disabled individuals and directly contracts individuals with some kind of disability. On the international stage, the percentage of disabled persons reaches 3.7% of the workforce, above the minimum legal requirements in Brazil. In Italy this rate is 4.71%. In other Group subsidiaries, efforts are also being made to promote the integration of disabled individuals. In Spain, cooperation agreements have been established with the Adecco Foundation. Moreover, the Company donated 6,000 euros to the Catalan Downs Syndrome Foundation (FCSD). In 2009, it signed an agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia Regional Government to encourage the employment of women affected by gender violence and at the risk of social exclusion. The Company undertook to employ candidates introduced by the ministry, under the agreed conditions and profiles. One person was employed in 2009. The Gas Natural Group believes that local roots and awareness of the particularities of each territory are critical for the Company's success. That is why it encourages direct recruitment of local employees and managers. 94 Staff rate.

Temporary contracts: Contracts for a specific term. Note: Data for Spain.  Recognition of trade union representation in the workplace The Gas Natural Group scrupulously respects the right to freedom of association and trade union representation. All the Company’s subsidiaries have union representatives who are freely elected. In this regard, we must highlight the following: • At the end of 2009, 38 organisations were represented at the Company in all spheres of operation, eight in Spain and 30 in international business. • In Spain there were 465 union representatives in 2009. In Spain, and without prejudice to the provisions laid down in current legislation, collective bargaining agreements specify the means of communication and information between the Company and union representatives, through the corresponding work commissions and committees. Within this framework of communication, cooperation and understanding with union representatives, the so-called Guarantee Agreement was signed on 15 December 2009. This regulates the workers’ rights and obligations as a result of the merger of Unión Fenosa with the Gas Natural Group. The collective bargaining negotiations of Gas Natural Comercial, Gas Natural Informática, Gas Natural Servicios and Gas Natural Soluciones also concluded in 2009, as did the employment agreement for Petroleum Oil & Gas España. The Company’s general policy in this regard is to use the collective negotiation process with the workers’ representatives to harmonise and make uniform the working conditions of employees at different Group companies. Some of the collective bargaining agreements to which Group companies are subject establish periods of notice for possible organisational changes that are longer than required in law.

There are no members in Australia, Costa Rica, Chile, Egypt, France, Ireland, Madagascar, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. as the governing agreement, the notice period ranges from ten to 15 business days. In Spain, companies that have an Intercentres Committee provide preliminary notification within ten business days in order to set up new services on a rotating shift system as well as changes concerning working hours or shift timetables and schedules. Similarly, within the Group's international sphere there are several peculiarities in the system of providing notice of organisational changes established in the Italy and Guatemala agreements that go beyond the strict legal regulations to which the Company is bound. Remuneration policy Proper remuneration is vital in guaranteeing employee satisfaction and to hold on to talent. The Gas Natural Group remuneration policy is governed by equality on an internal scale and competitiveness from the market point of view. The governing criteria are as follows: • For employees included in the union agreement, the remuneration is established in accordance with the professional group and subgroup, as laid down in the current agreements. • For managers and employees not included in the agreement, it is established on an individual basis in line with the remuneration policy approved by the Board of Directors Appointments and Remuneration Committee. In order to assess the competitive nature of the remuneration policy, the Group carries out frequent comparison studies and applies a policy based on real and forecast CPI increases, on corporate profits and forecast salary increases. Furthermore, in Spain there is a variable remuneration policy that is applied to approximately 53% of Group employees. It is based on the fulfilment of the Company's targets and on the assessment of each employee's individual performance. (*) Equivalent to the number of times the local minimum salary of the country is contained in the Group's standard minimum salary.  Promotion of flexibility policies for employees Employment flexibility is one of the factors that enables proper reconciliation between private and professional life. Beyond what is established legally, the Company allows employees to enjoy additional benefits in this regard. Depending on each agreement, employees have the possibility of working a continuous timetable on Fridays and in the summertime, while certain other groups of employees can manage their own timetables. Furthermore, under this system the legal entitlements to reduce the number of daily hours worked and the time limit thereof are extended. The Gas Natural Group flexibility policy includes breast-feeding permits, and in certain cases the periods counted for accumulating hours are extended. Similarly, women employees can avoid travel that involves moving away from their home during pregnancy or breastfeeding. In addition, employees who are looking after families under special circumstances can apply for the Group policies that enable them to work closer to home. Services adapted to employee requirements Among the social benefits for Group employees in some countries where the Company is present, under different names, different contents, in accordance with spheres and agreements, are the following: • Family allowance for the birth of a child, marriage, aid for nurseries and crèches or for disabled children. • Medical care policies and services (hospitalisation, care, allowances, ophthalmology assessment and dentistry plan). • Financial benefits in cases of temporary invalidity. • Financial assistance for meals (breakfast and lunch vouchers, allowances for meals and expenses, etc.). • Study aid for employees and scholarship grants for their children, school subsidisation and scholarship fund. 100 13,430 Split workday 5,262 5,243 2,239 Shift work 723 615 235 Continuous workday 284 256 610 Flexible workday 461 492 264 Reduced workday 112 93 2007. 2008. 2009. Breakdown of staff by type of workday  • Defined contribution pension plans. • Loans, advances and credit and insurance facilities to employees and their families. • Electricity or natural gas consumption allowances. 2009 also saw the integration of all pension plans of Group companies in Spain, under the so-called “Gas Natural Group Joint Promotion Plan”. Generation of employee commitment and involvement The Management by Objectives (MbO), applied at the Gas Natural Group, and Performance Management (PM), employed at Unión Fenosa, are two management systems used by the Group to involve employees in achieving business targets. Common criteria were defined in 2009 to apply both models in the assessment of individuals, to favour and speed up the integration process of the Company and involve employees in achieving the targets of the new Group. Communication and training activities were carried out regarding the models and their common application criteria, and new systems were developed enabling both models to be managed in a single system. A work environment survey took place at the end of 2008, and the results of this were given in 2009. After analysing the results, an action plan was drawn up on the priority areas identified, which included actions that apply to the Group as well as specific actions for different companies. Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 101 In 2009, the results and the Action Plan were communicated in response to the work environment survey undertaken throughout the Group in October 2008. The survey results pointed to three key areas for action, on which the Action Plan was based: • Management (bottom-up and top-down communication). • Internal relations (cross-sectional cooperation). • Development and recognition (opportunities for professional training and development). Based on an analysis of the results and defining these three priority areas for action, employees were notified of the actions to be applied throughout the Gas Natural Group. In addition, the actions were complemented in each country using plans that focused on those issues of particular local relevance. We should point out that because the implementation of the Action Plan coincided with the integration process, the approved actions were applied to all Group employees, thereby also acting as a mechanism for integration. Almost 80% of employees took part in the survey and the degree of compliance of the actions included in the plan was close to 100%. 2009 Action Plan.

The Group's training plans are updated regularly to bring them into line with the needs of each business and, just as importantly, each person. Following a decade of work, in 2009 the Corporate University of the Gas Natural Group commenced a new stage of professional and personal training and growth for all Group employees. This has been consolidated as a basic strategic tool in building the corporate culture, which also enables us to facilitate changes and unify policies, processes and styles. The main aim of the Corporate University is to cater to the Group's training needs at all levels and spheres of the organisation. The training process is carried out in three different stages: identification of training needs as a consequence of business activities; design of training programmes and management of knowledge, and measurement of results achieved to ensure quality and set up ongoing improvement plans. The Corporate University forms part of different international networks of business training centres, such as the European Foundation for Management Development or the Global Council of Corporate Universities, organisations with which it shares best practices. In addition, the Corporate University has an alliance network with academic institutions, both in Spain as well as the rest of the world. 104 Argentina Brazil Colombia Spain Guatemala Italy Morocco Mexico Nicaragua Panama Republic of Moldova 26.1 Argentina Brazil Colombia Spain Guatemala Italy Morocco Mexico Nicaragua Panama Republic of Moldova 5.7 1.5 40.7 30.3 9.5 17.5 35.9 13.6 9.5 6.7 6.2 9.6 7.8 5.1 22.6 15.6 18.5 9.7 22.4 1.7 3.3 16.8 2.0 3.8 3.9 7.9 14.3 2.0 5.9 2.2 1.0 1.2 7.7 7.3 8.2 18.9 20.8 26.5 33.0 51.7 15.0 32.3 13.0 32.6 30.0 7.3 16.7 18.0 12.1 3.5 14.9 Operators.

The Gas Natural Group has the tools, adapted to different profiles, to supervise the development of its employees’ professional careers. The Professional Development Programme (PDP) and the Competence Management Model are tools for employees included in the agreement. The Management by Objectives (MbO) has been designed for those not included. It is important to note that 100% of the Group employees have these applications at their disposal and they are assessed using tools targeted at helping their professional development. These programmes have the same objectives of favouring mobility and allowing vacancies to be covered through internal promotion. In 2009, the Management Committee approved a new Internal Mobility Procedure for the Gas Natural Group which promotes and facilitates the voluntary movement of employees between units in order to help in the development of their professional careers, talent management and improve transversality. This new procedure offers information on available vacancies and offers employees the possibility of choosing those that interest them. The procedure guarantees confidentiality, so that employees are free to take those decisions that concern their professional careers. Talent management Talent is the basis for the HR Development Model of the Gas Natural Group. The Company has a Talent Management Programme to identify human and intellectual capital and to introduce measures to attract it, retain it and develop it, helping to improve professional performance. There are two talent management systems at the Gas Natural Group: • Executive Talent, which applies to the Group’s executive team and which enables strategic planning of senior posts to be aligned with the Company's strategy and values. • Professional Talent, applicable to intermediate positions, specialists and operators. Its purpose is to develop talent among those employees not subject to the so-called Executive Talent, looking for suitable profiles to take on greater responsibility. 106 Staff promoted (%)(*) Argentina 4.27 Brazil Colombia Spain France Guatemala Italy Morocco Mexico Nicaragua Panama Puerto Rico Republic of Moldova 3.60 1.06 17.60 11.60 5.18 6.60 6.07 18.90 43.43 6.12 10.00 4.35 7.29 23.00 3.17 36.99 3.70 8.41 4.76 6.10 6.68 6.99 5.54 6.31 5.00 5.00 9.98 2007. 2008. 2009. (*) Staff promoted: individuals promoted/total staff.  In 2009, 3,051 individuals took part in the Talent Management Programme through the two systems mentioned. The Succession Planning tool, created to manage coverage of the executive team by identifying persons to take over vacant positions, was a key component in 2009 for coverage of the organisational structure following the integration of Unión Fenosa into the Gas Natural Group. Also in 2009, as part of the BEST Programme (Grants for Students with Talent), 32 civil engineering students carried out their end-of-course project as part of their collaboration with the Group. Moreover, through the Young Specialist Programme, the Group has also kept an active presence at 33 professional training centres in Spain. The programme enabled 75 students from 14 regions to carry out their work experience at operating units of the Gas Natural Group. The STAR programme continued in 2009. The purpose of this programme is to identify, develop and invest in individuals with the ability and potential to take up key posts in the Group's businesses. 195 employees took part in the programme. Individual monitoring took place which enabled the Individual Development Plans to be drawn up. Establishment of formal channels for the management of knowledge The Gas Natural Group targets many human and material resources at the management of knowledge. The Company promotes and encourages teamwork. This allows better use of skills, knowledge and resources of the staff. The training centres are the meeting point and the means used to transfer knowledge and reinforce the Company's corporate culture. In Spain, these include the Puente Nuevo Campus (Ávila), the Puente Princesa Training Centre (Madrid) and the centres in Barcelona and Bens (A Coruña). Outside Spain, the Group has academic centres in nine countries. The Group also provides an online training platform providing easy, quick and flexible access to training content. The first gas business course was given in 2009 using this platform, and was attended by 2,131 individuals. The Corporate University’s annual plan includes the training programmes identified by each business, the cross- sectional programmes and training in management and administration skills. As part of the training plans, particular mention should be given to the training in corporate procedures, which received 29,749 attendees and was given over 357,590 course hours. This deals with the cross-sectional knowledge required to achieve business targets. Elsewhere, the integration sessions were attended by over 1,500 company professionals. Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 107  108 The “Our Energy” in-house communication campaign was launched for the purpose of promoting a positive image of our Group among employees of the merged companies. It was also aimed at helping to decrease the uncertainty that the merger process could have generated among workers. To sum up, it was geared at showing the integration as an exciting project, and help employees decide to stay with the Company. The campaign reinforced the idea that individuals are behind great achievements, and that employees are the real stars in the integration process. The campaign came out with its own graphic identity, with logos and colours expressly designed and which were adapted to each application and to the different items of communication employed. Employees from both companies were involved in all these. Two types of actions were set up during the campaign. The former, relational and horizontal, with an open interactive platform for participation by employees, which provided information on the development of integration through different informative deluges; the latter, direct and top-down, in which information was transmitted through managers and team leaders using cascade communications, with over 1,500 meetings held, and off-site events, which featured over 1,000 attendees. The campaign started with a launch advert that provided access to the “Our Energy” platform and which evolved with new channels and sections in line with the integration process. By the same token, direct communication continued as another of the fundamental pillars of in-house communication, with the holding of the 1st Executive Meeting of the new Group and of Latin America and the set-up of Breakfasts with the Directors. On the day of the campaign launch, the platform received 50,000 hits. By the end of 2009, “Our Energy” had already exceeded one and a half million page hits and is currently one of the main channels of in-house communication for the new Gas Natural Group. “Our Energy”, in-house communication campaign Special mention must be made of the Leadership School, with 9,188 participants and a total of 111,083 course hours given in 2009. The aim of this school is to improve the leadership capacity of individuals and teams, and offers the business tools required to develop skills to satisfy the Company's plans and facilitate change and integration. Of particular note was the third edition in Spain – and the second one internationally – of the Executive Development Programme, targeted at individuals with high potential. Mention should also be made of the personnel management programme and the ninth edition of the Management Development Programme. 2009 saw the launch of the “Our Energy” platform as the channel of integration in the merger and a key component for the exchange of information between all individuals of the Group and in every country. The platform shares space with the two intranets of both companies, which provide more local content and enable a gradual transition to the new environment. Communication mechanisms for immediate, transparent and participatory dialogue One of the basic communication targets in 2009 was for employees to be aware of the integration process, explaining what was expected of them and getting them involved in this process. Eight informative bulletins were published on the “Our Energy” platform and more than 600 pages of relevant information. These also included interviews with the CEO and eight general managers. The platform also includes mechanisms that enable employees to take part and openly give their opinion. More than 100 questions were put forward and over 20,000 answers given.  By the same token, other initiatives continued such as the NaturalNet noticeboard or the opinion channel. Sounding boards were also put in place in order to get an accurate diagnosis of the impact that the merger had on employees, and this helped the Company to understand employees’ feelings with regard to the merger. Three opinion studies were carried out, involving over 30 focus groups and three surveys carried out with our employees, as well as interviews with executives. With regard to the Group's newsletter, two new issues of the single newsletter were launched following the merger, with a print run of 20,000 copies in four languages. Elsewhere, the Sports Club was consolidated as an activity to encourage cohesion between Group employees. There were more than 1,600 sign-ups in 2009. To ensure that in-house communication is in line with the strategic aims and with the objectives and interests of the different group areas and businesses, three in-house communication committees were set up in 2009 as cross-sectional workgroups: the Corporate Committee, the Operations Committee and the International Committee. These define the global strategy of in-house communication, check coherence with the Group strategy and validate the corporate channels and contents, inter alia.

Indicators of the new “Our Energy” in-house communication platform”(*)  During the integration process of the new Group, the main challenge as far as health and safety is concerned is to design and implement, in all fields, a prevention service which might be able to meet the expectations created and so make the new Group one of the front runners worldwide in terms of health and safety. The merger process also offers another opportunity −to take advantage of the experience and best practices in both companies, to strengthen the Group’s commitment towards a culture of prevention and to integrate and optimise resources. The point of departure is two leading companies, which, before the merger process, already had consolidated targets in terms of risk prevention and safeguarding safety. Thanks to the individual commitment by all its employees and the role played by suppliers, contractors and collaborating companies, the Gas Natural Group is well on its way towards building the desired culture of prevention, and is moving closer towards its ultimate target of achieving a zero accident rate. Health and Safety Health and safety is one of the strategic pillars for the Gas Natural Group focus in corporate responsibility. The Company is committed towards becoming a reference point in the health and safety protection of its employees, and also of its suppliers, contractors and collaborating companies.  Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 111 Health and safety is one of the commitments laid down in the Gas Natural Group Corporate Responsibility Policy and is based on the following principles: • Guaranteeing safety is everyone’s responsibility. • Proper training and information are key elements of prevention. • Integrating preventive actions into all activities and decisions to ensure continuous improvement. • Rejecting any conduct that may create an unsafe, intimidating or offensive working environment.

Proposed actions for 2009 Actions taken 2009 Actions planned 2010 Level of compliance: High Medium Low  Provision of a safe and healthy working environment One of Gas Natural Group main commitments is towards achieving the most demanding standards in terms of industrial safety and prevention of occupational risks. Before the merger process, both the Gas Natural Group and Unión Fenosa had consolidated their procedures, practices and targets in this field. Now the main challenge of the new Group is to focus its efforts on designing an integrated occupational risk prevention system covering the good practices previously developed by the two companies. The system will have to be adapted to the needs arising from the new dimension of the Group’s businesses, and become an action protocol in the international field. The design of the integrated risk prevention system has already begun, with the integration of the human teams, the reform of the organisational model required for the merger, the analysis and adaptation of the different basic processes and the detection of possible synergies also associated with the two companies' integration process. According to forecasts, the system will be implemented and operational during 2010. With these actions, the Group aims to construct a differential culture of prevention which can enable it to reach the highest safety standards, with the involvement of the entire organisation and its suppliers, contractors and collaborating companies. One of the Gas Natural Group priorities in its new business scenario is to consolidate results in the field of industrial safety and occupational risk prevention which could make it a point of reference in this field. The Group's actions in health and safety are governed by the following principles: • Strict compliance with the legislation in force in each country. • Consideration of occupational safety and prevention as a collective responsibility. • Information and training understood to be basic pillars for continuous improvement. • Furnishing all the Group's companies with a specific structure for fostering and strengthening a culture in prevention. • Extension of the Group's principles to suppliers, contractors and collaborating companies • Commitment to building, operating and maintaining industrial installations under the premise of risk prevention. • Achieving the target of zero accident rate in all the Company's activities. • Collaboration, coordination and transparent exchange of information as a basic principle for action. • Analysing the incidents and accidents that occur in order to draw conclusions and promote action plans. • Giving out clear messages to customers and users on safety and the correct use of energy. In 2009, the Group successfully implemented its accident website, through which 100% of accidents can be investigated using the model established by the Company. After the merger process, the information deriving from Unión Fenosa is being added to the system. By this means, a single application can be used to investigate any accidents arising in the entire Group. 112 One of the Gas Natural Group priorities in its new business scenario is to consolidate results in the field of industrial safety and occupational risk prevention which could make it a point of reference in this field.  Efforts are constantly being made to integrate prevention in the Group’s relations with contractors. This is mainly carried out through the disclosure of information, meetings and the Group’s supervisory tasks. In 2009, a guide was published entitled Gestión de la prevención en las obras de construcción (Prevention Management in Construction Sites). The aim of this guide is to clarify concepts and responsibilities in works management by the Company’s staff and to improve coordination with suppliers, contractors and collaborating companies. Preventive action The Group's preventive action is fundamental for ensuring the health and safety of its workers during their activities. It is based on the Occupational Risk Prevention Plans and on the identification and regular assessment of the risks in the various activities, as well as the regular control of working conditions. Risk assessment in Spain is updated twice a year, and whenever changes are detected which could give rise to modifications in working conditions or jobs, beyond the compulsory updating and review established by laws applicable. In 2009, a total number of 8,375 preventive actions were carried out in Spain. The Group thus complied with the targets set, particularly with the efforts made in controlling working conditions. As far as actions carried out internationally are concerned, it is important to note that the internal requirements of the Group’s safety regulations go beyond those legally established in countries in which the Company operates. In any event, as a result of the merger the Company is taking steps to homogenise criteria for classifying the different activities associated with risk prevention. The objective is also to consolidate international activity in 2010. Training and information Training and information are vital for developing the Gas Natural Group prevention policy, and are the most efficient way for raising employees' awareness about health and safety matters. The Group provides substantial resources and offers training in this field to all employees (adapted to the different functions). Furthermore, the merger process with Unión Fenosa has given the new Group an important catalogue of courses and cutting-edge installations for corporate training.

Spain The courses are carried out by the Joint Risk Prevention Service and are focused on efficient theoretical and practical training of employees. These are some of the health and safety courses carried out in 2009: • Basic occupational risk prevention course, developed as set out in Royal Decree 39/1997, improved and adapted with specific contents in accordance with the risks identified for Group employees. • Training courses for new incorporations in Unión Fenosa Distribución and Unión Fenosa Generación. Contents are didactic; the aim is to establish a solid base of knowledge for new members of staff joining the Company. • Technical introduction course for prevention and protection techniques in explosive atmospheres, designed to reduce the risks which could arise in handling fuels and other hazardous substances on Company premises. Furthermore, training modules were prepared suitable for the use of new technologies and for online training methodology (e-learning).  Employees were also provided with other training courses which are useful for a first approach to health and safety matters, and also as a reminder. Fire prevention and extinguishing, evacuation, occupational risk prevention in the office, safety when working with ladders or accident analysis were some of the training programmes offered. For each job position, the Group has established a certain type of health and safety training, which is updated when necessary. In 2009, 68.9% of employees in Spain took part in training activities in this field. As a result of the integration process, 514 training activities were carried out, compared with 830 the previous year. However, the number of training hours per employee was unchanged, at 9.36. The target is to maintain these same rates in 2010. The Gas Natural Group requests by contract, that all its contractors should certify that its employees have received specific safety and prevention training for the works commissioned. Furthermore, the monitoring of these collaborating companies has shown that 44% of these employees have renewed or updated this training in 2009. It is also important to highlight the training received by the Group’s safety staff in the Company’s human rights policies and procedures which are relevant for its activity. In 2009, 67.15% of these employees received this kind of training, making a total of 1,248 hours. 114 Consolidation since 1 May Pro forma figures 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 % attendees over total staff 51.6 61.91 47.7 68.9 99 86 No. of training actions completed 367 337 243 514 830 655 Training hours per employee 4.21 5.2 3.3 9.36 9.6 7.3 Safety training (gas and electricity).

Gas Natural Group. International activities The Gas Natural Group requires that all its contractors certify that its employees have received specific safety and prevention training for the works commissioned.  Continuous monitoring and data recording These basic prevention are essential for prevention, as they allow us to analyse and assess results and enable areas of improvement to be identified. Before the merger, the Gas Natural Group and Unión Fenosa had specific programmes for the management and homogenisation of health-monitoring and occupational risk prevention information. They also had internal procedures for unifying criteria for the collection of data and investigating accidents in accordance with the recommendations of the International Labour Organisation and the European occupational risk prevention statistics drawn up by Eurostat. In 2010, one of the Group’s tasks will be to unify the two tools within the convergence process initiated through the merger. The results obtained in this area are included in control reports on a regular basis. In addition, the Company prepares a quarterly health and safety report, which is presented to the Directors. During 2010, the Group expects to add all the countries where Unión Fenosa operates to the Group’s specific occupational accident website. By this means, the Group will be able to build a single repository to record and display the results on investigation of occupational accidents occurring in each country in which the Company operates. The accident rate at the Gas Natural Group increased slightly in 2009, so the target that was set was not reached. Results were affected by the efforts made by the Company to ensure that any accidents were notified, greater international coordination in managing information and by the improvements in the data registration system. For 2010, the Gas Natural Group remains committed to offering its employees a safe working environment and thus renews its target of reducing the accident rate by 5% against that recorded in 2009. For that purpose, specific operating plans shall be implemented for departments with the worst accident rates, and an integrated occupational risk system shall be unified and implemented.

In 2009, this undertaking was materialised through the following initiatives: • Development of out two courses within the Occupational Risk Prevention Classroom for collaborating companies. The former addressed the identification of risks in electrical power plants. The latter addressed safe action procedures in carrying out discharges and the general operating regime. • Preparation and dissemination of a guide entitled Gestión de la prevención en las obras de construcción (Prevention Management in Building Sites), providing in-depth explanations of the roles to be carried out by each figure taking part in the process: developer, project management, safety coordinator, contractor and subcontractor. • Consolidation, in Unión Fenosa, of control of compliance with the risk prevention regulations in contractors and collaborators, in accordance with the procedures of the OHSAS 18001 prevention management system. 472 contracts and subcontracts, employing a total of 4,776 persons, were supervised. These companies notified a total of 59 accidents, with two mortalities. In 2009, the number of companies registered on the prevention with contractors website rose to 493. Approximately 98% of those which have contracts in force regularly collaborate in exchanging information. 120 accidents were notified in 2009 with a result of 1,619 days of sick leave, which is an improvement against the previous year. This maintains a frequency rate of 26.87, a figure which is below the general index published by the National Institute of Safety and Hygiene at Work (INSHT) for the energy, gas and water production and distribution sector. Without considering data from Unión Fenosa, none of the contractors of the Gas Natural Group registered any mortalities. In Spain, the Group counted a total of 668,752 days worked by the Company’s contractors and subcontractors taking part in construction or maintenance activities. Participation of workers' representatives For a culture of prevention to be consolidated in the Gas Natural Group, all employees need to take part, and particularly the employees’ representatives, given that they are the communication channel between these employees and the Company management. 116 Accidents requiring Frequency Seriousness Incident medical leave Days lost Mortalities rate index rate C D C D C D C D C D C D Argentina 20 20 375 375 0 0 17.73 17.73 0.33 0.33 34.90 34.90 Brazil 2 2 2 2 0 0 1.72 1.72 0.00 0.00 4.14 4.14 Colombia 53 83 327 745 0 0 10.46 11.35 0.06 0.10 27.35 29.97 Spain 84 110 3,375 4,891 0 0 7.08 7.43 0.28 0.33 12.03 12.82 Guatemala 7 8 57 63 1 1 6.40 4.81 0.005 0.04 12.28 9.18 Italy 3 3 69 69 0 0 4.31 4.31 0.10 0.10 8.42 8.42 Kenya 0 1 0 28 0 0 0.00 4.05 0.00 0.11 0.00 10.10 Madagascar 1 3 78 88 0 0 12.69 24.83 0.99 0.73 28.85 57.69 Mexico 19 20 154 172 0 0 10.41 10.32 0.08 0.09 21.34 21.60 Nicaragua 47 74 1,129 1,644 0 0 35.07 36.02 0.84 0.88 68.05 70.48 Panama 1 1 7 7 0 0 1.50 0.88 0.01 0.01 3.32 2.22 Dom.

Accident indicators by country  The workers' representatives take part through the Health and Safety Committees, which constitute the most important bodies for consultation and participation in the Company's risk prevention policy. After several collective agreements have been signed, one of these committees currently exists in the Group. It is a joint committee and meets every quarter. It represents Gas Natural SDG S.A., the ten companies of the Gas Natural Group that distribute gas in Spain, Gas Natural Comercial S.L. and Gas Natural Informática S.A. The committee represents 92.75% of the employees in Spain. Special mention must also be made of the role played by the 88 prevention representatives in the Group's companies in Spain. Unión Fenosa has one Central Committee; 41 joint Local Committees, which meet every quarter; and three Technical Committees advising the Central Committee in terms of generation, distribution and health monitoring. They represent 100% of the employees. 83 prevention delegates also carry out their duties. All the Group's collective agreements expressly regulate health and safety issues. Occupational health The Health Monitoring Area is responsible for defining and directing the policies to be carried out in the field of integral health, and those designed to prevent ergonomic and psycho-social risks in the persons making up the Company. Its objective is therefore to guarantee the physical, psychological and social well-being in all the working environments of the companies and geographical fields of the Group. Throughout 2009, with the object of strengthening a culture of prevention, the Group continued with the campaigns and initiatives aimed at fostering employee participation in issues related to health and safety. Particularly noteworthy were the two new consultations made on psycho-social risk and job satisfaction factors, in which 1,466 employees took part.The results enabled the Company to prevent possible conflicts, to be familiar with the areas which are of most concern to employees, and to propose measures to improve them. Furthermore, in order to comply with the planning set out in the agreement with the external prevention service, 40 ergonomic studies were performed regarding work centres, corresponding to the four-year plan. Special mention must also be made of the implementation of the Contingency Plan for the prevention, monitoring and control of risk associated with swine flu. From the outset, the Group took the measures required to minimise the impact of the illness and complied with the protocols established by the public authorities. The Company also set up a committee which in its weekly meetings carried out the executive analysis of the situation and prepared reports which were submitted to the Company management. Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 117 Throughout 2009, with the object of strenghtening a culture of prevention, the Group continued with the campaigns and initiatives aimed at fostering employee participation in issues related to health and safety. 2009 2008 2007 Prevention and/or early detection campaigns 43,461 12,621 10,205 Vaccination campaigns 8,158 2,392 2,006 Checkups 14,277 5,122 5,208 Medical assistance 28,178 14,652 17,290 Participants in occupational health campaigns Obesity 17.78 Prevention of cancerous diseases Diabetes Cardiovascular risk Others 20.03 48.18 58.70 23.68 Staff taking part in prevention campaigns (%)  • Taking part in the Governor Board of BEQUINOR, National Consumer Goods and Industrial Safety Association, which gives information, documentation, support and advisory services to Spanish companies interested in the standardisation and safety of its industrial activities and products. • Taking part in the working groups of the Technology Platform on Industrial Safety (PESI). • Carrying out of courses, conferences and cooperation activities on safety for administration and other public service organisations, such as the firemen's service, rescue service and 112. • Development and implementation of specific technological projects to improve safety in fire protection on the Group's premises. During 2009, 320 activities were carried out relating to the design and implementation of emergency and self-protection plans. These activities include the review of plans and the carrying out of tests, which are followed by concluding reports. We may also highlight the specific training received by emergency teams to guarantee that they are properly prepared in the event of occurrences taking place. Lastly, as a result of the contact with the electrical distribution assets of the Gas Natural Group in Latin America, and in accordance with the records of the companies in Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Panama, we are sorry to report that 164 accidents unfortunately took place among the public, 41 of which involved deaths. At the date of completion of this report, we are only aware of four legal proceedings against the Company for any of these causes, none of which have had a final ruling. No accidents of this kind took place in the Republic of Moldova. 118 The Gas Natural Group, in accordance with its objective of safeguarding the health of all its workers, and in order to minimise the drawbacks which could affect its normal rendering of services, developed a Contingency Plan for the prevention, monitoring and control of swine flu. From the outset, the Company thus took all the necessary measures to prevent this illness from spreading, complying with the protocols established by public bodies. In June, it was predicted that if no preventive measures were taken, swine flu could become pandemic. Consequently, all the Company's medical services began to work to control any employees suffering from symptoms of swine flu. Other Company departments were also involved in the process, and decisions were taken geared towards controlling the situation in the event of worse outlook regarding swine flu. We may summarise these actions as follows: • Preparing an action procedure to be followed by medical services to attend any infected patients. • Creation of the Swine Flu Crisis Committee, responsible for providing information on the evolution of the pandemic and the measures adopted at every moment, also assessing the relevant actions which should be implemented. • Configuration of the Flu Pandemic Business Continuity Plan, defining the actions to be put into practice in the event of the threat of flu pandemic or should the worst predictions come true. • Drawing up of weekly reports regarding the situation, submitted to the Company management. • Installation of information panels in common areas of the buildings, soap dispensers and handing out of 1,342 individual prevention kits. Staff taking part in prevention campaigns Measures for guaranteeing industrial safety Gas Natural Group aims to reach the highest standards of safety in its installations and products, preventing any possible risks which could affect persons or the environment. For this reason, it set up an innovative Industrial Technical Safety Unit in 2007. This unit determines the safety criteria, analyses the incidents and risks and supervises the compliance and execution of its conclusions and recommendations. Therefore, it takes certain steps, of which we may highlight: applying the latest technological developments, adopting the most appropriate safety measures, disseminating the best practices in use of energy and cooperating in training the agents which could be involved in the value chain. In this context, these are some of the initiatives carried out: • Carrying out of a specific project for defining a new operational risk mapping model. The first major risks study was carried out in a big Group installation, the Maghreb gas pipeline, in order to prevent impacts on people, goods or the environment.  Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 119 In 2009, the Gas Natural Group, faithful to its commitment to make the concepts “Management of Operating Processes” and “Safety in Installations” one and the same, and developed a pilot project called the Maghreb Gas Pipeline Industrial Safety Risks Map. This application will enable the Company to identify and quantify technical risks in the operating installations and assess their possible impact. The project was based on the risks associated with operating the installations. These are taken to be those risks which could have an impact on people, on the environment, on goods, or which could have social consequences. The main objective of this project is to provide the Group with a solid application which could offer quantitative and scalable information with an warning system based on the following premises: • Generation of strategic indicators to give information which is relevant for management (guidelines and targets) • Setting up operating indicators for monitoring processes and activities identified. • Establishing a repetitive process of enrichment in each cycle to provide the appropriate know how for optimum risk management. The purpose of the application was to measure the level of risk using a regular self-assessment process; facilitating decision-taking for the implementation of improvements geared towards their reduction; guaranteeing a consistent level of control and management of the Group’s operating risks; and, lastly, enabling internal and external benchmarking in similar installations. The model implemented is based on the development of three components enabling risks to be identified and measured: state-of-the-art, general risks and risks for the environment. After the implementation of the pilot project, the Company has concluded that the application is suitable for measuring technical risks, that its correct development depends on the business units taking part, that the Industrial Safety Risks Map is a unique and innovative product and a fundamental part of the management model for operating risks, and that, lastly, it can easily be adapted to the different operating infrastructures of the Gas Natural Group. Thanks to initiatives like this, the Gas Natural Group is able to have the most advanced risk management systems, which in the end is beneficial for all its stakeholders. In coming years, the Company intends to implement this new risk management and control system in other significant plants. Maghreb Gas Pipeline Industrial Safety Risks Map Cooperation with institutions Another one of the Group’s priorities is its cooperation with other institutions in order to guarantee the safety of people and goods –something which is required to comply with the extremely high expectations deposited in the Company as it is a public service– by its stakeholders. An important line of action for the Group is the training and information to bodies safeguarding citizens’ safety. This contributes towards simplifying the coordination necessary in those cases where different emergency teams take part and helps public bodies to know the most appropriate methodology of action in energy supply installations. In 2009, cooperation with institutions was carried out through: • Collaboration agreements for cooperation and coordination with Emergency Services (112) in the autonomous regions of Madrid, Castilla y León, Valencia, Aragon, La Rioja, Cantabria and Catalonia, as well as one with the City Council of Barcelona. • Specific courses for intervention by members of the public emergency services in accidents in electrical and gas installations. These courses were given by firemen from the different autonomous regions. • Participation in congresses, forums or seminars for professionals working in emergency and rescue services. • Cooperation with the Galician Occupational Health and Safety Institute (ISSGA) in two technical seminars. One concerning the prevention of electrical risk and gas piping. The other on training in clearing, cutting and pruning, in which information was given on electrical risk and on preventing forest fires. 200 people and 30 contractor companies took part in the latter seminar. • Cooperation with the Ibero-American Social Security Organisation (OISS) and with the University of Alcalá de Henares in a seminar for students of the 9th Master in Prevention of Occupational Risks.  It is becoming increasingly more common for the Company’s social actions to seek a strategic and global approach, reinforcing the Group’s activity and providing structural improvements in the societies in which it operates. Furthermore, it should not be overlooked that the Company also exercises its social responsibility when it contributes to supplying the energy required by society in an efficient, sustainable and safe manner. It is important to bear in mind that the Company’s capacity to invest and innovate generates positive effects which go beyond the Group’s frontiers and which are beneficial for society overall. Social Responsibility One of the basic pillars of the Gas Natural Group actions in social responsibility is its commitment to well-being, generating wealth and developing communities in which to carry out its activities. The Gas Natural Group helps to satisfy social needs which have not been covered, through its own initiatives and also those developed in partnership with recognised social institutions and organisations. The Group has procedures which enable it to identify the main areas which must be addressed and thus to prioritise its action.  Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 121 Social responsibility is one of the commitments laid down in the Gas Natural Group Corporate Responsibility Policy and is based on the following principles • Positive integration in the society of the countries where it carries out its activities, respecting the culture, rules and setting. • Generation of value by conducting its business and by forging alliances with local communities, particularly in those countries where it has a presence. • Promotion of the education, training, cultural wealth and inclusion of the most disadvantaged groups through social investment.

Proposed actions for 2009 Actions taken 2009 Actions planned 2010 Level of compliance: High Medium Low  Positive integration in society Gas Natural merger with Unión Fenosa has turned the Group into one of the leading international companies in the energy sector. This position also gives it greater action capacity and impact when contributing to the social development of the places it operates. To put this into practice, within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and the principles of the UN Global Compact, the Company develops initiatives aimed at improving the living conditions of underprivileged collectives. In addition, the Company is aware of the importance of education for social cohesion and progress. Universal primary education is one of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is of critical importance for progress in issues such as equal opportunities and gender equality. Accordingly, the Gas Natural Group allocates part of its resources and efforts to supporting and fostering educational and cultural initiatives. In recent years, issues related to the climate change and sustainable development have been included in the Company's social agenda. The Group considers its social investment programmes within the framework of its business development strategy. The aim is to generate a higher level of commitment by the Company to the society of which it forms a part. Given its priority, the Group has tools for measuring the reputational impact of the social programmes it develops. In this regard, as in previous years, in 2009 it continued to use the London Benchmarking Group methodology (LBG), which offers an overall view of social investment and enables a comparison of the results obtained with those of other companies. In 2009, the Company also carried out a study of the factors measuring the return on social investments in order to improve the management of initiatives developed in the community. As far as sponsorship is concerned, during 2010 the Group plans to develop a methodology to allow it to analyse the impacts of its activities in this field. 122 28.4 Business-related iniatiatives. 54.7 16.9 Specific contribution.

Educational initiatives Rational energy use and sustainable development continued to be two of the main values fostered by the Gas Natural Group in its educational activities for young people. Particularly noteworthy are the initiatives carried out in the framework of the “Natural Gas and the Environment” programme, as well as the “Natural Gas, the 21st Century Energy” online activity. The former provided training for a total number of 72,646 students in Spain, who attended conferences given by specialists in this filed. The online activity involved the participation of 977 school groups. In Spain, the Company became one of the governors of the Princep de Girona Foundation, which promotes the professional, academic and research training of young people. As part of the agreement signed in 2008 by Gas Natural Italia with the City Council of Reggio Calabria, an event was organised in 2009 to promote culture and education. 638 students in a situation of social risk were thus able to take part in a photographic competition on the relationship between individuals, the city and the environment. In Latin America, programmes geared towards fostering a culture of energy efficiency continued. Various initiatives were carried out. For example, teachers were given educational material highlighting the environmental advantages of natural gas and useful information on how to use it properly. The actions that were taken involved the participation of 164,683 schoolchildren. In Colombia, the Group supported the Empresarios por la Educación Foundation in Colombia with a grants fund for primary school children at risk from social exclusion.

This cooperation was the result of historical agreements which the Foundation had with both the Gas Natural Group and Unión Fenosa. The Gas Natural Group has cooperated with the Carolina Foundation since 2004 in the sponsorship of six grants for the post-graduate course in Journalism by the EFE Agency. The programme, which is designed for Latin American university graduates, has a classes phase and then a period of work experience in national or international delegations of the EFE Agency. In turn, Unión Fenosa has cooperated with the Foundation since 2005 by offering six grants specialising in the management of electrical generation and distribution businesses. This programme, which is organised by the Spanish Energy Club and the Corporate University, has a theoretical-practical approach, combining training sessions with an individualised practice session programme supervised by directors and experts in this field. The Foundation’s objectives include helping to extend graduates' studies and the specialisation and updating of knowledge for postgraduates, teachers, researchers, artists and professionals from Latin America. Support for the Carolina Foundation  Social action focused on underprivileged groups The Gas Natural Group fosters projects that help reduce social inequality and integrate social collectives that are at risk of exclusion. In Spain, the Group has established several cooperation agreements with organisations, such as Femarec, for the insertion of disadvantaged collectives in the workplace. It also has a cooperation agreement with the PAX Foundation, an association which provides help to children who have been victims of antipersonnel mines. Furthermore, in 2009 the Group cooperated with the Codespa Foundation in their international cooperation projects. In Argentina, Gas Natural BAN continued to cooperate with the Musicium College for the integration of disabled children. In Mexico, the Group cooperates with associations such as UNICEF and the Un Kilo de Ayuda Foundation in disseminating its initiatives through an insert placed in customer bills. By this means, the Group provides a direct link between customers and social associations. For more details on the social action programmes in the Gas Natural Group's Latin American subsidiaries, please consult the corporate responsibility reports available atwww.gasnatural.com. Promotion of health and research Since 2007, the Gas Natural Group has cooperated with the Andalusia Technology Corporation (CTA), of which it is a founding member. This institution manages the Advanced Technology Renewable Energies Centre (CTAER). The Group also supports the Higher Council for Scientific Research (CSIC) in the “Doñana Biological Station” programme, which focuses on research in the area of conservation genetics. The support given to these kinds of projects shows the Group’s strong commitment towards keeping ahead of the field in R&D/i. The Group's commitment to research also focuses on improving the life quality of sick people and their relatives. In 2006, the Group took part in the incorporation of the ProCNIC Foundation, together with the Ministry of Health and other Spanish companies. This organisation, which is directed by Valentín Fuster, investigates the leading cause of deaths worldwide − cardiovascular illness. In 2009, the Company extended its commitment up to 2020, in order to guarantee the development of its projects. In Latin America, for the ninth year running, the Group took part in the annual activities for collecting funds carried out by the Mexican Red Cross. In Argentina, it continued cooperating with FUNDALAM (Foundation for Nursing and Maternity) to promote mother-baby health. The Company also cooperated with several local institutions and associations geared towards promoting health, of which we may highlight the Hospital de Niños Ricardo Gutiérrez Corporation Association and the Pedriatría en la Red paediatric network. For further details of programmes in the Group’s Latin American subsidiaries geared towards research and conserving health, please see the Corporate Responsibility Reports available at www.gasnatural.com. 124 The Group's commitment to research also focuses on improving the life quality of sick people and their relatives.  Corporate volunteers and employee participation Employees are a key part of the Gas Natural Group focus on corporate responsibility. Their efforts help to make the Company's commitment to the society and the communities in which it operates a reality. An example of this is Solidarity Day, an initiative created and managed by employees, who give up one day of their yearly salary for the execution of a social project in a certain country. In return, the Company covers the funds donated by employees and also bears the expenses for the management of the programme. Since it was founded in 1997, the Solidarity Day Association has raised over 2 million euros used for social projects in over 11 countries; through it over 2,000 people make a commitment towards solidarity. In 2009, an amount of over 290,000 euros was raised, a sum which enabled four educational projects to be set up in Colombia, allowing over 400 youths from an economically disadvantaged environment and high academic ability to go to university. In Argentina, with the support of the Gas Natural Foundation, the Group continued with its corporate volunteer plan started up in 2002.The programme offers employees the possibility of collaborating with community initiatives and social projects. In 2009, the Foundation financed eight projects, instrumented through cooperation agreements with social organisations and connected with improving living conditions, overcoming poverty and community development. Since 2005, the Group has also had a Corporate Volunteers Programme in Mexico, supporting disadvantaged collectives. Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 125 Solidarity Day came about over ten years ago, at the same time as the Group’s international expansion, through an initiative taken by employees of Unión Fenosa. At that time, employees travelling to the new countries in which the company operated saw at first hand the living conditions and social problems in some of these places. What they saw sparked a feeling of solidarity, which in turn led to the creation of an association which could help to improve living conditions in some of the places in which the company acted. Solidarity Day focuses its projects on aid for child and youth development; the idea is that educational projects, professional training and employment are the best ways to help in a country’s development. One of the essential parts of the project is that the employees do not only promote the “Solidarity Day” initiative, but that they are also responsible for managing and administrating it. The Group takes part through funding and contributing other resources. In terms of funding, the company doubles the amount collected by the employees. And as for other resources, it assumes the management expenses, so that the amount contributed by donations is used in its entirety for the selected project with the lowest possible management cost. Solidarity Day  Promotion of music Promotion of musical culture is one of the cultural sponsorship initiatives carried out by the Gas Natural Group. In 2009, the Company participated in a variety of initiatives with the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra and Catalonia National Orchestra in Tarragona, Girona and Lleida, as well as with the Murcia and Galicia Symphony Orchestras. The Group also sponsored musical cycles and seasons in different Spanish cities. Among others, special mention must be given to the collaboration with the Gran Teatre del Liceu (Barcelona) and the Teatro Real (Madrid). The Company also financed the Granada International Festival of Music and Dance, and the Porta Ferrada International Festival (Girona). In Latin America, the subsidiaries of the Gas Natural Group also took part in promoting music. Numerous activities were carried out in 2009, of which we may highlight the sponsoring of the 7th Vale do Café festival in Brazil, and the “CEG. Our Voice” programme, which was focused on musical training for Group's employees. For further information relating to this subject, please consult the “Sponsorship and Social Action” section of the Gas Natural Group corporate website, at www.gasnatural.com. Fostering cultural enrichment An important part of the Group’s cultural investment is carried out through the Contemporary Art Museum (MACUF). This museum, which was opened in A Coruña ten years ago, reflects the Group’s interest in fostering and disseminating artistic creation in any of its forms. The MACUF puts on exhibitions and drama, and carries out educational and leisure activities. In 2009 it received over 33,000 visits, compared with around 9,000 in 2005. And the museum’s website received over 140,000 visits in 2009, compared with 38,000 in 2006. In 2009, MACUF put on several exhibitions, of which we may highlight: “Genocidio, paisaje y memoria” (Genocide, Scenery and Memory) by Simon Norfol, “La sombra habitada” (The Inhabited Shadow) by José Luis Raimond; the thesis exhibition “Antes de ayer y pasado mañana o lo que es la pintura hoy” (Before Yesterday and After Tomorrow or What Painting is Today), and “Tan cerca, tan lejos” (So Near, so Far), a selection of Galician artists of the 1930s. All these were accompanied by the permanent exhibition from the museum’s archive and the works of the three artists selected for the MACUF artistic creation grants, one of the museum’s distinguishing features. In 2009, over 6,400 students from 80 educational centres took part in the activities for dissemination of contemporary art organised by the museum. MACUF does not only engage in art-related activities; it also takes part in activities to promote healthy leisure and to enhance the social integration of persons with any form of handicap. In 2009, it extended these initiatives to other centres in Galicia through an agreement with the provincial delegation of A Coruña. 126 An important part of the Group’s cultural investment is carried out through the Contemporary Art Museum (MACUF).  As part of its commitment towards culture, the Gas Natural Group continued to publish books on the cultural and natural heritage of the countries in which it operates. In 2009, it published the book México. Ciudad de Luna (Mexico. City of the Moon). In 2009, the Group also cooperated with the Malaga International Film Festival, with the Royal Association of the Queen Sofia National Art Gallery and Museum, and with Casa de América in the “Nubes de un cielo que nunca cambia” (Clouds in a Sky which Never Changes) exhibition. We can also highlight the support given to the Santiago de Compostela Xacobeo Board, in the programme of cultural activities for the Xacobeo 2010 Holy Year which will take place along the St. James’s Way. Its Latin American subsidiaries also allocated part of their investments to promoting culture. Also worthy of note are the sponsorship of the “Hay Festival” literary award in Colombia and the agreement with the Cidade Viva Cultural Institute in Brazil for the sponsorship of the Rio Socio-cultural Award 2009. Initiatives in keeping with business In 2009, the Gas Natural Group continued to develop numerous projects to fight against energy poverty and grant access to basic services by the collectives most in need. The basic philosophy behind these programmes is to create a new social management model in which residents, local collectives, non-profit organisations and enterprises join forces to build a system to access energy in low-income bracket communities. One of these projects is Social Energy, a commercialisation company which since 2004 has provided disadvantaged areas on the Caribbean coast of Colombia with secure access to electricity; these areas are formed by human settlements caused by the armed conflict in the country. Since it was set up, this initiative has carried out 27 electrical normalisation projects, has another 35 under execution, while a further 178 are still to be launched. Together they have provided jobs for 1,000 skilled persons and have allowed 40,000 households to have safe access to electricity. The Cuartel V and Raquira projects are another two initiatives carried out in this field. The former is designed to supply natural gas to an underprivileged area of the province of Buenos Aires. The latter consists of replacing coal with natural gas as a fuel to be used in the furnaces of the pottery industry in this Colombian town. With this change, the industry has become more productive, thereby making the local business community more competitive. In Mexico, the Group developed the “Impulse for your Business” programme, focused on the training and certification of installers of natural gas, electricity and water. Over its first year, the project secured qualifications for 128 professionals in accordance with Mexican laws. Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 127 In 2009, the Gas Natural Group continued to develop numerous projects to fight against energy poverty and grant access to basic services by the collectives most in need.

The Gas Natural Group forms part of the governing bodies of both associations. The Company also formed part of the Club de Excelencia en Sostenibilidad and the Global Compact Foundation. Furthermore, from the time the Company was founded, it is one of the members of the Corporate Reputation Forum (fRC), which promotes the measuring and improvement of assessing reputation and corporate social responsibility. The Gas Natural Foundation In 2009, the Gas Natural Foundation continued to extend the scope of its activities, launching new lines of action and consolidating those already in existence. In this respect, it has intensified its activities in the environment and strengthened its lines of action in training, and in the protection and diffusion of cultural heritage. In the international arena, the new programmes initiated by the Foundation in Colombia and Mexico have continued. The Foundation's main action areas in Spain include the following: • Energy and environmental management seminars. • Cooperation agreements with the governments of the Autonomous Regions. • Environmental information publications. • Training courses in the Energy Training Centre. • Activities in the Gas Museum and History Centre. 128  In Colombia, the Foundation continued with the four programmes begun the previous year: the “Young Scientists” programme, a project for converting natural gas vehicles; a training and certification programme for natural gas inspectors and domestic gas repair workers; and, lastly, a programme for promoting the business of contractors and installation firms. In Mexico, the Foundation continued to support the “Impulse for your Business” programme, started up in 2008. There was also a lot of activity in the Energy Training Centre, where 137 people were given training. A research project is also being developed regarding the potential use and the environmental factors for the use of natural gas as a fuel in the Valle de México and Monterrey. Furthermore, in partnership with the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the Foundation published a book entitled Innovación y empresa: Estudios históricos de México, España y América Latina (Innovation and Enterprise: Historical Studies of Mexico, Spain and Latin America). In Argentina, the Foundation continued its support for the \"First Export” programme. Launched in 2001, it aims to help Argentinian SMEs develop their capacity for exports. Since it was launched, the programme has advised 7,407 companies and offered training to 20,016 professionals. In Algeria, in partnership with the IDEC/Pompeu Fabra University, the Algerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CACI) and the National Youth Employment Agency (ANSEJ), a seminar was carried out on “Creating Businesses: From the Idea to the Project”, designed for the Algerian business community, and in which over one hundred people took part. In Brazil, the Foundation continued to carry out training courses in partnership with the Viva Rio NGO. These courses are intended for youths and adults living in the communities of Cantagalo, Pavao and Pavaozinho, in southern Rio de Janeiro.

In Morocco, the Foundation forms part of the Board of the Princesse Lalla Meryem Institute for autistic children in Tangiers. The Foundation also continued with the programme started the previous year of training in natural gas for future engineers of the National School of Applied Sciences (ENSAT). All actions carried out in 2009 are described in the Activities Report of the Gas Natural Foundation. Up-to-date information on its activities and publications is also available at the Foundation’s website, www.fundaciongasnatural.org  The Gas Natural Group defines integrity as the policies, procedures and tools that are in place for ensuring that its activities and those of its employees are carried out in accordance with legislation and the internal and external regulations, standards and procedures applicable in all its areas of operation. In the Gas Natural Group, integrity also refers to the set of instruments which the Company has provided to guide its employees towards behaviour that is in keeping with the stipulations of its Code of Ethics, and with its Mission, Vision and Values. The Group's actions in the area of integrity are ultimately aimed at establishing a framework for action that encourages all individuals to carry out their professional responsibilities on the basis of integrity, responsibility and transparency. The ultimate responsibility for conveying and ensuring the Group's commitment towards integrity lies with the governing bodies, which are responsible for fostering the development of rules and procedures and the implementation of good working practices. The Code of Ethics and the procedures established for disclosing and safeguarding thereof, are basic elements in the framework of the Group’s integrity, and play a significant role in ensuring that the integration between the Gas Natural Group and Unión Fenosa is successful. Cultural cohesion is a critical factor to be able to fully harness the synergies and opportunities of the merger. This integration, in which the Code of Ethics plays a critical role, is based on values which are shared and consolidated within the commitment towards integrity, responsibility and transparency. Integrity  Corporate Responsibility Commitments. 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report 131 Integrity is one of the commitments laid down in the Gas Natural Group Corporate Responsibility Policy and is based on the following principles: • Rejection of corruption and bribery in our business dealings and establishment of measures to prevent and combat them. • Provision of support for the principles of the UN Global Compact, as well as the principles of the OECD for corporate governance. • Respect of all aspects of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration of the ILO regarding basic rights in the workplace.

Accordingly, the Company has adapted its procedures in this field to the good corporate governance recommendations of listed companies. The Gas Natural Group practices in corporate governance are described in detail in various annual reports, which are sent to the General Meeting of Shareholders for its knowledge or approval. The documentation prepared by the Gas Natural Group in relation to its corporate governance practices has the object of providing information on the most relevant rules and procedures implemented in the field, and to disclose the criteria used as a base for decision- taking. The General Meeting of Shareholders, the highest decision-taking body in the Company takes part in the development of corporate governance practices, as does the Board of Directors and its Committees: the Executive Committee, the Appointments and Remuneration Committee and the Audit and Control Committee. The Management Committee also plays a relevant role from the viewpoint of management. In 2009, the aforesaid governing bodies met as follows: • Board of Directors: twelve meetings. • Executive Committee: seven meetings. • Appointments and Remuneration Committee: eleven meetings. • Audit and Control Committee: five meetings. • Management Committee: monthly meetings. The Board of Directors, its Committees, and the Management Committee operated as expected during 2009, fully exercising their competencies without interference and in full observance of current legislation and the applicable standards, such us the Regulations for the Organisation and Operation of the Board of Directors and its Committees.

Remuneration of the Board of Directors (in thousands of euros)  Code of Ethics The Code of Ethics of the Gas Natural Group, and the adhesion to external initiatives such as the UN Global Compact, reflect the Company’s formal commitment with an integral, responsible and transparent way of acting. The Code of Ethics lays down the action guidelines for the Group’s employees and determines what behaviour is expected in matters relating to corruption and bribery, respect for people, professional development, equal opportunities, occupational health and safety, and caring for the environment, inter alia. It also sets out the guidelines for relations between the Group's employees and the collaborating institutions or enterprises. It is essential to disseminate the Code of Ethics so that it can be complied with. For that purpose, the Code of Ethics Committee was incorporated in 2005. Its main function is to ensure the dissemination, knowledge of and compliance with the code. This Committee is chaired by the Internal Audit Department and has a representative from Labour Relations, Investor Relations, Corporate Reputation and Customer Service. The Secretary of the Committee is part of the HR Department. Furthermore, to guarantee the compliance with the code, the Company has local committees in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, Nicaragua and Moldova, with a similar structure to that of the Code of Ethics Committee and with the specific purpose of reproducing in each country the functions which the Committee has assigned in Spain. One of the main tasks assigned to the Code of Ethics Committee is to supervise the operation of the query and notification procedure. This channel has been enabled so that the Group’s employees can resolve their doubts regarding the application of the code or inform the Committee, in any anonymous and confidential way, of any conducts which are not in keeping with the principles set out therein. All communications received are confidential and are treated in accordance with the stipulations of the Protection of Personal Data Act, Law 15/1999. Notifications concerning fraud, auditing or faults in accounting or internal control processes are likewise sent directly to the Audit and Control Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. In 2009, 56% of the notifications received were related to alleged fraud, none of which had any significant impact. The Code of Ethics is available in nine languages, and has a specific area on the corporate Intranet, where practical information is provided on various matters related to it, as well as on the query and notification procedure. The Code of Ethics Committee issues quarterly reports to the Audit and Control Committee and the Management Committee, and it reviews the reports drawn up by the local committees. In 2009, the Committee held ten working meetings, and the local committees held 15. Communications received from employees were analysed in the aforesaid sessions, among others. 134 To guarantee compliance with the code, the Company has established local committees in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, Nicaragua and Moldova.  In 2009, the Committee did not receive any notification disclosing incidents taking place in the Group related with labour or child exploitation or in relation to the rights of local communities. 14% of the notifications received by the Code of Ethics Committee were related to the principle of respect for people, and they were all solved appropriately. No notification was related to any form of discrimination. The Committee has a several-year work plan for developing actions whose main aim is to extend the Code of Ethics. The activities considered in 2009 included the following: • Update of the Code of Ethics of the Gas Natural Group. • Dissemination of the Code of Ethics to all employees of the new Group arising from the integration of the Gas Natural Group and Unión Fenosa. • Training and information activities aimed at Company employees. • External dissemination actions (participation in events and press releases). • Activities for extending the code to suppliers in Spain and abroad. • Review of the security of the processes related to the Gas Natural Group query and notification procedure. It is important to note that Code of Ethics Committee proposed several updates to the contents of the code, which were finally approved by the Board of Directors. Indeed, the Code of Ethics was modified by agreement of the Board of Directors in the resolutions of 27 February and 19 May 2009, adapting it to the new commitments acquired since 2005 on Good Governance and Corporate Responsibility, also incorporating the best international practices in ethical and social issues and complying with the regulatory demands arising from the integration of Gas Natural Group and Unión Fenosa.

In 2009, the process for the distribution of the Code of Ethics among the Group's suppliers and collaborating companies came to an end. The main aim of this initiative was to provide information on the commitments assumed by the Company and notify the existence of the notification and query procedure, which can also be used by the aforesaid collectives if they detect any anomaly or inappropriate conduct in their relationship with the Group. In 2010, there are plans to introduce an area on the website to enable suppliers to access contents relating to the Code of Ethics and the query and notification procedure. Risk Management System Because of its activities, and the context in which they are carried out, the Gas Natural Group is subject to a variety of inherent risk factors. In order to minimise risks associated with its business, the Company has developed mechanisms so that these risks can be identified, characterised, and determined with the greatest possible amount of detail. Likewise, over the last few years it has made considerable progress in the overall management and control of the most relevant risks, gaining in-depth knowledge of the said risks in both the daily management of the various businesses and in the strategic planning and reflection processes. One of the key concepts to the Company's risk management is the concept of risk profile, understood as the level of exposure to the uncertainty resulting from the joint effect of the various categories of risk classified by the Gas Natural Group. 136 The new company arising from the merger between the Gas Natural Group and Unión Fenosa shares the ethical values which already formed part of the culture of the two companies. The commitment towards ethical conduct is a key factor for the success of the companies which aspire to create value in a sustained way over the course of time. Values such as integrity, responsibility and transparency are essential factors in order to earn the confidence of the markets and society, and therefore to be successful in business. A few years ago, the Gas Natural Group materialised its commitment to integrity, transparency and responsibility with the publication and approval of a Code of Ethics which sets out the guidelines for action and the behaviour expected of all its employees. Furthermore, it created a Code of Ethics Committee, whose object, inter alia, is to disseminate and disclose the code and ensure that it is complied with. These commitments shall continue to be valid and shall be used as a guide for the behaviour for all employees in the Gas Natural Group. The Code of Ethics is available in nine languages, and has a specific space in the corporate Intranet, in which practical information is offered on different issues thereof. It can also be accessed through the website, which offers relevant information on the merger between the two companies. During 2009, the Code of Ethics was reviewed in order to adapt it to the Company’s new situation and the expectations of society and of its stakeholders, thus ensuring that it is in keeping with current demands in terms of integrity, responsibility and transparency. A new company, shared values In 2009, the process for the distribution of the Code of Ethics among the Group's suppliers and collaborating companies came to an end. Several new features have been introduced in the Code of Ethics; particularly noteworthy are the inclusion of new sections related to corruption, bribes and money laundering. After being updated, the code gives special attention to questions relating to the prevention of conflicts of interest or with their meaning in the relationship with suppliers, contractors and collaborating companies. Likewise, it underlines the need for all the Company employees to cooperate in order to prevent bad practices from arising.  The identification, characterisation and measurement of the most relevant risks provide knowledge about the Group's overall risk profile at all times. This knowledge makes it possible to determine the maximum exposure to the risk that is accepted, managing it through the allocation of limits by risk category and in global terms to establish the global target risk profile. Monitoring and assessing risk exposure in an integrated approach, and controlling overall exposure to it, allows efficiency in decision-making to be underpinned, making it possible to optimise the risk-return binomial. The Risk Committee, the development of standards led by the General Risk Standard, the Corporate Risk Map and the Risk Measurement System enable the continuous improvement of the process for identifying, characterising and determining the Gas Natural Group risk profile. The function of the Risk Committee is to determine and review the Group's target risk profile, guaranteeing its congruence with the Company's strategic positioning and assuring third-party interests. It is also responsible for ensuring that the entire organisation understands and accepts its responsibility in identifying, appraising and managing the most significant risks.

It is updated and implemented by the Risk Committee. The purpose of the Risk Measurement System is to quantify, on the basis of probability and recurrence, the risk position assumed at a global level, and in each relevant business with regard to risk factors related to exchange rates and raw materials for energy. It is a dynamic information instrument that shows the Gas Natural Group level of exposure to different risk categories. The Financial-Economic Department, together with the Internal Audit Department, and the business units, are responsible for preparing and updating the aforesaid map. Its content is discussed by the Management Committee. The conclusions are presented to the Risk Committee, the Audit and Control Committee and, where applicable, the Board of Directors. After the measuring process, a risk map is drawn up and updated at least once a year. During 2009, as a result of the integration of Unión Fenosa in the Gas Natural Group, a limited version of the Corporate Risk Map has been carried out, designed to characterise and quantify the most relevant risks.  The purpose of this map is to anticipate the impact of the integration in the Risk Profile of the Gas Natural Group, with the aim of identifying what the new factors should be which should be used to determine efficient risk management in the light of the new reality of the Company. The identification and characterisation of the risks take into account the characteristics of the position at risk, the impact variables, the potential quantitative and qualitative severity, the probability of occurrence and the degree of management and control. The various risks are characterised in absolute and relative terms and illustrated in graph format. The Risk Measurement System was devised as a support tool for the business units and guarantee that they have an optimum level of independence in decision making, while simultaneously ensuring that the level of risk taken on by the Group and per business unit is in keeping with the risk profile established by the governing bodies. The measurement system used by the Company also makes it possible to identify the existence of natural cover among the various business units, thereby guaranteeing efficiency in economic terms and regarding risk in decision-making and safeguarding the interests of the concurrent stakeholders. Thanks to the flexibility of the system, the Group has been able to quickly incorporate the risk position deriving from the businesses contributed by Unión Fenosa, thus allowing the Group to quantify on a recurrent basis the probable exposure to risk, capturing the complementarities of the businesses arising from the integration. Based on the results obtained, a set of policies has been put forward which have helped to expedite the integration and understanding of the businesses from the standpoint of risk. We can also highlight the initiatives carried out in the field of Credit Risk and Insurable Operational Risk, designed 138 Corporate Risk Map Group/Business risk positions Group/Business results volatility Level of management Severity (Meur) Very high. High. Average. Low. Very low. Risk impact severity  to assess the integrated exposure to risk and the homogenisation of the new Group’s management policy. The following should be noted, in particular: • Credit risk. The credit rating of the commercial portfolio contributed by Unión Fenosa was reviewed using the statistical models for measuring credit quality used by the Gas Natural Group, expediting the knowledge of the risk profile of the integrated commercial portfolio and thus helping in the process of homogenising the admission, billing and collection policies. • Insurable operational risk. The insurable operational exposure of the two companies was analysed, studying the main heterogeneities. Following this analysis, it was integrated in a single insurance programme, and after the merger between the two companies, an operational risk management policy was set out for the whole Gas Natural Group. Internal Audit For the Gas Natural Group, the internal audit is an independent and objective assessment tool. Internal Audit Department depends directly on the Audit and Control Committee, reporting in turn to the Board of Directors, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The main purpose of the internal audit function is to supervise and carry out the continuous assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control system, providing a systematic and stringent approach for process monitoring and improvement and for the assessment of operational risks and controls relating thereto. The Internal Audit Department has established a methodology for assessment of the operational risks based on the Conceptual Framework of the COSO Report (Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission), and taking as a point of departure the type of risks defined in the Corporate Risk Map. By this means the Group complies with international recommendations in terms of corporate governance. The Audit Department assumes responsibility for verifying compliance with the policies, standards and controls put in place by senior management in order to assess the operational risks of the processes and prevent and identify internal control weaknesses, including those that are related to ethical issues such as fraud, corruption and bribes. Depending on the results obtained, action plans are then designed focused on implementing corrective measures. In 2009, 186 internal audit projects were developed, 26 of which corresponded to the review of processes associated with the main operational risks of the general corporate and business departments in the Gas Natural Group. In addition, given its organisational position of independence and transverse nature, the Internal Audit Department takes part in or leads the relevant projects from the point of view of compliance with internal codes of conduct, and chairs the Code of Ethics Committee. Non-compliances and fines In 2009, the Gas Natural Group did not register any kind of administrative sanction or fine, either nationally or internationally, due to (i) breaches of laws or voluntary codes relating to the impact of its products and services on its customers’ health and safety, (ii) respecting privacy and leaking of its customers' personal data (iii) breach of the laws and regulations (administrative sanction or fine being taken to be those which are final given that all administrative and legal appeals have been exhausted, and which do not exceed 60,000 euros). Nevertheless, it is important to note the rulings by the National Competition Commission (CNC) of April 2009 for the breaching of Defence of Competition Act, Law 15/2007, which imposes fines on the leading electrical companies, including the Gas Natural Group, for 5 million euros. The Company has lodged an appeal against this ruling. The above information offered in this 2009 Corporate Responsibility Report is based on the lists available in the Gas Natural Group Legal Services Department. It is worth highlighting that all the Gas Natural Group activities are in keeping with current local legislation. The Company places particular emphasis on the appropriate and transparent provision of the information on the products and services it provides.
