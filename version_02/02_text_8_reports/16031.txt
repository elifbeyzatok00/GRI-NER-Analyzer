2011 Sustainability Progress Report  FOOD Together, we can   feed the world. One in seven people on earth  goes to bed hungry each night.  Ensuring that enough healthy,  nutritious food is available for  people everywhere is one of the  most critical challenges facing  humanity. We commit 60% of our  R&D dollars to ensuring that the  worlds growing population has  enough food. ENERGY Together, we can  build a secure energy future. By 2035, global demand for energy  will increase by 36%. DuPont is  uniquely positioned to address  the rising demand for secure,  environmentally sustainable and  affordable energy sources. With a  growing population, we will need  to use our existing resources more  responsibly and find new and cleaner  energy sources.  PROTECTION Together, we can  protect what matters most. A growing global population places  increased pressure on people and  the environment. And as the world  develops, humanity places greater  value on both life and earth. One  of our greatest challenges in the  coming decades will be adequately  protecting humanity and the world  we share.  DuPont science is driving inclusive innovation to help solve the worlds greatest challenges.  Our sustainability goals are tied to business growth in areas of agriculture and nutrition, safety and protection, materials,  chemicals, electronics and communications, and energy. As the worlds population approaches nine billion by 2050, we  face unprecedented challenges to sustainably address the basic human needs of food, energy, and protection. So we  are building alliances around the world. Thats how we work best: alongside others, applying our vast range of scientific  expertise and knowledge to complex problems. We think of this way of working as a collaboratory.  Welcome to  The Global Collaboratory  2  I  The Global Collaboratory   DuPonts vision is to be the worlds most dynamic science company,  creating sustainable solutions essential to a better, safer, healthier life  for people everywhere. As often as we repeat these words, we remind  ourselves that they are more than an inspirational goal — they inform our  everyday reality and are part of the way we do business at DuPont. In support of that vision, we are currently focused on developing  sustainable solutions for three global challenges: feeding the world,  decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels, and protecting people  and the environment. These challenges line up with DuPonts unique  scientific strengths. They offer outstanding business opportunities for our Company and will test our  ability to deliver solutions that are both innovative and sustainable. In 2010, we spent $1.7 billion in  research and development. About 85 percent of our R&D resources went to support science related to  these three megatrends. But innovation is not the only measure of success. Ultimate success  depends on solutions that are sustainable. Sustainability is part of  how we operate at DuPont, and it is embedded in our science-driven  innovation. Since 1990, we have reduced our absolute energy use by  6% while increasing production 40%. We currently source 6.5% of  our global energy requirements from renewable sources. In 2010, we  generated revenue of $1.6 billion from products that help our customers  or the final consumer reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Much of  the increase was from revenue growth in key areas like photovoltaics  and from engineering polymers used in light weighting of vehicles. We  estimate that these products have reduced greenhouse gas emissions  in our supply chains by over 6.5 million metric tons from 2007 to 2010.  In 2011, we completed the acquisition of Danisco, a company with a shared commitment to  sustainability. We look forward to providing results from our joined efforts in this progress report in the  years to come. We believe that the global companies that succeed in responding successfully and sustainably to 21st  century challenges will be those that master the art of collaboration. We are building alliances with  customers, companies, governments, NGOs, visionaries, thought leaders, and others around the world  in an effort to address needs sustainably at the local level. Weve adopted a new model that we call  inclusive innovation — solving problems by designing solutions in cooperation with those who will  benefit directly from the product. We welcome others to join us in this endeavor as we uncover unmet  needs and respond to them. Our objective is to improve the lives of people everywhere, and together,  we can accomplish what no one can do alone. Ellen Kullman  Chair of the Board &  Chief Executive Officer In 2010, we spent  $1.7 billion in  research and  development. About  85 percent of our  R&D resources went  to support science  related to these  three megatrends.  Chief Executive Officer Message  I  3   In 1987, the Bruntland commission gave us its now classic definition of  sustainable development: Development that meets the needs of the  present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet  their own needs. We launched our sustainability work soon after the  Bruntland report issued and sustainability continues to be a driving force  in our growth strategy.  Energy efficiency is a major focus for DuPont. In May, we brought the site  energy champions together to celebrate achieving our 2010 energy goal.  Through the hard work of hundreds of DuPont employees around the world, we surpassed our hold total  energy flat goal — using 6% less energy than we did in 1990. We also launched a new energy goal — by  2020 we will reduce non-renewable energy use by 10% per adjusted dollar revenue compared to a 2010  baseline. We are committed to continue to seek energy efficiency and renewable energy projects that  meet our criteria of having business and environmental benefits.  In 2010, DuPont enjoyed a rebound from the economic downturn  in 2009. Since DuPont measures and reports in absolute numbers,  the rebound is reflected in a 2009 to 2010 increase in many of the  areas that we track for our footprint reduction goals. With many  manufacturing sites idled for part of 2009, our overall energy,  and water usage, as well as our greenhouse gas emissions, were  significantly lower than 2010 when we were operating at full capacity.  We are developing the projects necessary to assure that we meet or  exceed each of our footprint reduction goals by 2015.  While reducing our footprint is important, our focus is on the activities  in the market place and driving accomplishment of our market facing  goals. We continue to increase our investment in R&D that will bring  products to the market that facilitates our customers or consumers  reducing their impacts. As these research programs move toward  commercialization, we see DuPont having an expanded role to provide sustainable solutions to our  customers around the world. Making the direct link between our customers and the markets we serve is  the key to truly integrating sustainability as a growth strategy.  I am excited about the acquisition of Danisco, a company that, like DuPont, has a deep commitment  to sustainable growth. It provides us a great opportunity to leverage the science and innovation of  both companies to speed the delivery of more sustainable products to a broader set of customers and  markets. As a combined organization, we can only strengthen our leadership in sustainability.  Linda J. Fisher  Vice President of DuPont Safety,   Health, & Environment  and Chief Sustainability Officer We also launched a  new energy goal — by  2020 we will reduce  non-renewable  energy use by 10%  per adjusted dollar  revenue compared to  a 2010 baseline. 4  I  Chief Sustainability Officer Message  MARKET-FACING FOOTPRINT ENERGY Avoided over $6 billion in  energy expenditures from 1990  to 2010 while growing the  Company by 40%.

Borel Executive Vice President Agriculture  Nutrition & Health EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES ARE AHEAD  to achieve a sustainable future. Global population will  exceed 9 billion by 2050 — or about 150,000 more people  on the planet every day — with much of the growth in Africa  and Asia. This translates into critical challenges to feed  the world, reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and keep  people and the environment safe in a sustainable way. We  devote about 85 percent of our R&D resources to tackle  these challenges. The challenge of feeding the growing global population becomes more  daunting every day. Ensuring more nutritious food is available is a complex  issue on a scale never experienced before, and further complicated by  environmental challenges. But, DuPont  — and its collaborators across  the food chain — are optimistic, as scientific innovations have already  significantly enhanced the quality and quantity of food production.  New technology is a critical component to ensure sustainable agriculture  and DuPont is applying science-powered innovation to deliver solutions.  Were working with farmers around the world to deliver a unique  combination of seeds, crop protection products, services and management  advice that will increase yields on the same amount of land, even in the  worlds most challenging environments.  We are developing solutions that are culturally acceptable and that can  provide nutritional benefits to help combat over nutrition while preventing  under nourishment. Our Danisco and Solae businesses provide more  sustainable ingredients to help food companies make food safer, healthier  and great tasting. Statistics indicate that 30% of all food that is grown is lost to waste. Our  food packaging solutions can play an important role in preserving the  quality and nutritional value of food.  Global food security is bigger than one company, organization or  government can tackle alone. If we work together along the full food supply  chain, we can tackle this challenge. Solutions must be implementable at a  local level. Our focus is on supporting public-private partnerships designed  to improve access to healthy, affordable food for everybody.  6  I  Thought Leadership  Together, we can accomplish   what no one can do alone. PROTECTION Mark P. Vergnano Executive Vice President Safety & Protection  Electronics & Communications  Performance Chemicals   ENERGY Thomas M. Connelly, Jr. Executive Vice President &  Chief Innovation Officer Industrial Biosciences  Performance Coatings  Performance Materials  The increasing complexity of industrialization, demographic and  geographic shifts in the global workforce and the unprecedented scale  of urban growth, particularly in the developing world — these all present  daunting protection challenges today. These shifts bring environmental  and social changes. It can also be positive if we recognize the value of  long-term sustainable solutions.  For DuPont, this presents a fundamental challenge — to adequately protect  humanity and the world we share in a sustainable manner.  To address these challenges, we must work collaboratively with our  partners on an impactful scale to deliver scientific innovations that provide  protection for people at work, home and all areas in between.  Working with academics, governments, other companies and  organizations, we are developing a vast range of materials, products and  services that protect life and the environment. From life-saving body and  car armor to next generation refrigerants that have a significantly lower  global warming potential, were working on products and services that  protect. Our Safety & Protection business produces the worlds leading  brands — DuPont Kevlar, Nomex, and Tyvek  — which help protect  millions of industrial workers, firefighters, law enforcement, military  personnel and emergency first responders. Our global consulting services  and technology delivery business, DuPont Sustainable Solutions, provides  expertise, and proven methodologies and training to empower clients in  many market sectors to improve employee, contractor and process safety,  reduce incidents, and enhance operational performance. I believe we can, along with our partners, provide transformative  technologies and products to address the global protection challenge.  Our drive toward market-driven science and innovation saves lives and  optimizes sustainable business operations. We have to work right now to gain grid parity for a variety of renewable  energy sources. Solar, wind, hydro, and biofuels — we must transform  these energy sources from the margins to the mainstream.  With a growing population, we will need to find new energy sources and  ways to use our existing resources more responsibly. We are working  with our partners to take what we know of microbiology, fermentation,  polymer science and electrochemistry to help the world transition from  fossil fuels to more sustainable alternatives.  We are focused on second generation biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol  from non-food feedstocks like corn stover and switch grass. In our  Butamax partnership, we are working on biobutanol which has higher  energy density and can be essentially a drop-in fuel for our existing  transportation fuel infrastructure. Solar power offers the unique potential to power the world, with ample  energy to meet the needs of future generations, in a very sustainable  way. In most of the world, solar energy costs have to drop by about  half for solar electricity to be competitive with the electricity you get off  the grid today. DuPont is committed to bringing solar energy into the  mainstream by reducing the cost of current photovoltaic systems by at  least 50 percent.  To meet the growing demand for hybrid and electric vehicles, DuPont  recently introduced the first battery separator that boosts the  performance and safety of lithium ion batteries allowing drivers to travel  farther on a single charge.  Whether its building a more efficient solar panel, biofuel or more fuel- efficient car components, science and innovation are going to be key to  fueling new industries and cleaner economies.  Thought Leadership  I  7  EVERY INNOVATION Jaime Cristancho Product Stewardship Leader  DuPont Crop Protection One of the most important contributions  is to work with our customers on  sustainable agricultural practices in many  countries of the MACC Region (Mexico,  Andean Countries, Central America,  and Caribbean). We have implemented  a Product Stewardship Program that  teaches growers and distributors how  to use our products in a safe and  environmentally responsible way. So  far, we have reached more than 20,000  growers in at least six countries in the last  year, making a real difference in terms of  the way we support the food production  process to attend to the global demand. Robin Jenkins Chemical Engineer  Life Cycle Assessment I conduct Life Cycle Assessments for DuPont  Danisco Cellulosic Ethanol, LLC, a wholly  owned subsidiary of DuPont focused on  the sustainable production of cellulosic  ethanol. As we commercialize this new,  large-scale industry, it is critical that we  aim to reduce the environmental footprint  across our supply chain and sustain future  generations while reducing dependence  on fossil fuels. To help accomplish this,  I represent DuPont on the Council on  Sustainable Biomass Production (CSBP),  one of the leading groups in bioenergy  sustainability standardization. It is  rewarding to work with diverse stakeholders  to develop voluntary sustainability  standards for biomass and bioenergy  production in the United States. Current  membership includes bioenergy and  biomass producers, academic institutions,  non-governmental organizations, and  government agencies. We have developed  a draft standard for agriculture, which  includes sustainability principles ranging  from air emissions and soil quality to  biodiversity and socio-economic well-being.  Mark Scialdone Organic Chemist  DuPont Central Research & Development  Insect-borne disease threatens human  and animal populations across the globe.  The use of effective insect repellents that  are safe is an important part of a strategy  to minimize bites from disease-carrying  insects. Our team in DuPont has developed  a safe and effective insect repellent active  ingredient that is derived from nature. This  material, Refined Oil of Nepeta cataria  (commonly known as catmint) is now a  registered insect repellent with the U.S.  EPA. Topically applied formulations of this  repellent have been demonstrated to be  effective in deterring biting insects such  as mosquitoes that are carriers for yellow  fever and malaria. DuPont technology has  made this repellent possible and promises  to make safer the lives of those where these  diseases are prevalent. and collaboration is driven by our global and their disciplined execution to operate responsibly, perform with excellence and Here are six portraits of individuals who are making a difference  8  I  Inclusive Innovation and Collaboration  Robin Czyzewicz Mechanical Field Engineer  DuPont Packaging and Industrial Polymers Reducing dependence on fossil fuels  can benefit the environment and help  fight soaring energy prices. Photovoltaic  power generation is a technology that  can help, especially as solar modules  get more affordable and reliable. That is  why it is inspiring to be a team member  working on developing DuPont ionomer  encapsulants. One of the biggest  challenges is the harsh environment that  solar modules endure such as rain, hail  and snow loads. Encapsulants protect the  modules active elements and are key to  manufacturing efficiency and module life.  I develop mechanical measurement and  modeling techniques to simulate module  strength in real applications. It is real  applications that matter, so I collaborate  with customers to demonstrate the unique  properties of our encapsulants that enable  modules to be more reliable and have  lower installation costs.  Gabriela Burgos Ph.D. Chemical Engineer,  Technical Marketing Manager   DuPont Titanium Technologies I lead a terrific team of scientists and sales  and marketing experts from Mexico, Brazil  and the United States to demonstrate the  sustainable value that DuPont Ti-Pure,  a titanium dioxide white pigment, brings  to roofing applications. We call it the Cool  Roofing Project. The white pigment has  intrinsic high solar reflectance and reduces  heat absorption into buildings to improve  comfort and reduce the average energy  consumption. For our customers, cool roofs  promote sustainable construction and  contribute toward regulatory targets for  the mitigation of CO2 emissions. Currently,  we have a pilot for the Mexican and  Brazilian housing market to quantify the  environmental benefits and help improve  the long-term performance of our product. Monica Patterson Senior Marketing Manager  Technology Launch   Pioneer Hi-Bred  Drought causes global crop losses at  $13 billion annually. Continual maize  improvements and conserving valuable  resources are requisites for long-term  sustainable production. I represent a  team of collaborators who helped develop  Optimum AQUAmax hybrids, bringing  to market new hybrids and practices  that improve yield potential under  stressful growing conditions. To develop  and bring this to market, our experts  included breeders, molecular biologists,  agronomists, environmental modelers, and  others. We work directly with growers and  universities to test, deliver these hybrids  to market, and learn from one another. As  a result, growers have choices and rural  prosperity, and more effectively utilize the  valuable natural resources needed to grow  a crop.  network of 60,000 employees capture new opportunities for sustainable growth  Inclusive Innovation and Collaboration  I  9   GOAL 100 0 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 PRODUCTS 1000 PRODUCTS 2007 PRODUCTS 2008 PRODUCTS 2009 PRODUCTS 2010 2015 MARKET-FACING GOALS GOAL: Double investment to $640 million in R&D programs with direct, quantifiable environmental   benefits for our customers and consumers.

To qualify, programs provide a clear  superior benefit in one or more categories while being at least on par with the incumbent product in all other  categories qualified for inclusion.  	 Climate	Change 	 Energy	Use 	 Pollution 	 Material	Use 	 Waste 	 Disposal 	 Ecosystems	and	Biodiversity 	 Water 	 Toxicological	Risk 	 Use	of	Non-Depletable	Resources Better Protection For Those   Who Protect Us Those who protect us from harm,  military and law enforcement, need  protection themselves. Bullet-resistant  vests and helmets have been around  for decades, but for them to be  protective and effective, they must be  lightweight and flexible enough for  use in a stressful environment, where  speed and mobility may mean the  difference between life and death. Recent collaborations with military and  law enforcement agencies have helped  DuPont produce its latest technology—  Kevlar XP for Hard Armor, now  available for military helmets. This  patent-pending technology offers  20% higher ballistic performance in  helmets and tactical plates, with less  weight. That lightens the load of a U.S.  Military Advanced Combat Helmet by  a full half-pound, without sacrificing  specified performance. Providing products that better protect  the lives of those who protect us has  always been a top priority at DuPont.  DuPont is currently constructing a new  $500 million DuPont Kevlar fiber  facility near Charleston, South Carolina   to meet the needs of first responders  and the men and women in our  military who put themselves in harms  way for us back home.  10  I  Performance Data Goal In Action 928 304 245 322 570 660 667 126  Photovoltaic Solutions The generation and storage of  renewable energy will be the fastest  growing sector in the energy market  for the next 20 years. DuPont is a  critical player in the solar industry, and  DuPont materials continue to set new  photovoltaic (PV) industry standards  around the world. With more than 30  years of experience in PV materials  development, applications know-how,  manufacturing expertise and global  market access, our broad and growing  portfolio of solutions is key to both  crystalline silicon and thin film solar  cells and modules. We have invested  hundreds of millions of dollars across  all businesses in PV, including $295  million for a multi-phased DuPont  Tedlar capacity expansion to more  than double the capacity for Tedlar  PV2001 film. We collaborate with cell and module  manufacturers, equipment suppliers,  academic institutions, industry  associations and government entities  around the world. We have expanded  our global capabilities for product  R&D, testing and application support  closer to customers in every region.   Our PV materials increase the lifetime  and efficiency of solar cells and  modules, reducing overall system  costs. Bringing the cost of solar energy  down in line with other forms of power  generation encourages faster and  broader adoption of solar energy and  it helps reduce the dependence on  fossil fuel.  2015 MARKET-FACING GOALS GOAL: Increase annual revenue by at least $2 billion from products that create energy efficiency and/or  significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We estimate these products will contribute at least   40 million tons of additional CO2 equivalent reductions by our customers and consumers. PROGRESS: Grew to $1.6 billion in revenue.

The facility strives to reduce  waste and improve performance  toward sustainable solutions. Teaming up with GE Power and Water,  a company DuPont partners with for  making its production even more  sustainable, the Dordrecht facility  decreased water consumption and  improved the operational efficiency for  a cooling tower that was a key water  input for the DuPont Delrin acetal  resin production process.   This resulted in a reduction of annual  intake of freshwater by 100,000 cubic  meters, which is equivalent to the  amount consumed by 700 average  Dutch households per year.   The effort had other positive results:  in safety, by cutting additive deliveries  from 130 to 15 per year; in operational  costs; and for the environment, fewer  deliveries reduced CO2 emissions.  Footprint goals are not linked to production volumes within DuPont. Since 1990, production volumes have grown  by approximately 40 percent, while water consumption, emissions and energy use have been driven down.  GOAL: Since 1990, DuPont has reduced global greenhouse gas emissions measured as CO2 equivalents   by 72 percent. Further reduce at least 15 percent from a base year of 2004.  PROGRESS: Reduced 10.5 percent since 2004. GOAL: Reduce water consumption by at least 30 percent at global sites that are located where the  renewable freshwater supply is either scarce or stressed as determined by the United Nations analysis of  river basins globally. For all other sites, we will hold water consumption flat on an absolute basis through  the year 2015, offsetting any increased demand from production volume growth through conservation,  reuse and recycle practices. PROGRESS: Reduced 16 percent at sites in water scarce and stressed areas and 9 percent   at all DuPont sites since the baseline.

Recently the  site made the decision to eliminate  the use of methylene chloride to lower  risk and reduce annual emissions.  Site engineers identified a substitute  material, Dynalene HC-30, that could  be used without changing equipment.  A team was formed to implement the  change. The methylene chloride in the  process was drained and shipped off- site for recycling.  The new material, Dynalene, has  superior heat transfer characteristics  that have allowed the cooling system  to operate warmer, resulting in  significant annual energy savings.  The conversion from methylene  chloride to Dynalene was not  inexpensive and required considerable  effort, but everyone involved is proud  that the site was able to eliminate  a hazardous material, while also  reducing emissions and lowering  energy costs.

Winners were selected by the ACCs  Energy Team, comprised of member  representatives, academics and experts  in the field of energy efficiency. As a result  of this initiative, the site saved 540,000  million BTU of energy, enough to power  3,800 homes. More than 67 million BTU  per hour fuel savings have been achieved  by developing this new burner system.  In addition, the change reduced CO2  emissions by 31,000 tons per year.  Sabine River Works is the largest DuPont  site in Texas and makes high performance  ethylene copolymers used for packaging,  automotive components, construction  materials and many everyday items. It  employs over 800 people. DuPont successfully met the goal of holding total energy flat with 1990 levels and further reduced by 6 percent  below flat. This effort avoided over $6 billion in energy expenditures from 1990 to 2010 while we grew the  Company by over 40 percent. We did not meet the 2010 goal for global renewable energy use. This was due to the global recession and  balancing the economic and environmental costs and benefits. To continue to encourage renewable energy  options, DuPont has made our new energy reduction commitment for non-renewable energy.  The new energy goal is to reduce non-renewable energy use by 10 percent per adjusted dollar revenue by 2020  compared to a baseline of 2010. We have set a milestone of 3 percent reduction by 2015. GOAL: Hold total energy flat with 1990 levels. PROGRESS: Reduced 6 percent since baseline. GOAL: Obtain 10 percent of energy from renewable sources at a cost that is competitive with the best  available fossil fuels. PROGRESS: 6.5 percent from renewable sources.

Since 2001, the business has set aggressive  energy reduction goals and consistently invested  resources in saving energy. Today we use almost  30% less energy to make a pound of pigment  than in 1990. Achieving these outstanding results was  accomplished by each site working to improve  energy use day-by-day and implementing energy  savings projects.  Key Projects 	At	the	New	Johnsonville,	Tennessee	site,	waste	 heat is now used to preheat process water.  With direct contact heat transfer, the site  saved 2.4% of its annual energy consumption  and 26,000 tons of CO2 in the first year.  	The	DeLisle,	Mississippi	site	uses	landfill	gas	 from a local municipal landfill to make steam  resulting in annual energy savings of 480,000  million BTUs and 28,000 pounds of CO2.  	At	the	Edge	Moor,	Delaware	site,	a	project	 team has minimized the additional energy  required to operate a new facility and  maximized the efficiency of the facility  through process integration and heat  recovery. By installing high efficiency burners  and using waste heat for pre-heat, the site  saves 2% of its annual energy use and avoids  3,500 tons of CO2 emissions annually.  Projects like these are just part of the story.  Each site sets energy reduction goals, monitors  key performance indicators for energy, and  makes energy and carbon footprint reduction a  part of business decisions. Energy reductions  are possible because everyone in the titanium  dioxide business is part of achieving the goal.
