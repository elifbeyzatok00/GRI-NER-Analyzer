The second wave of the global financial crisis put  our obligations and activities into the context of a considerably more  complex and more sensitive financial environment. Still, we can be  relatively satisfied with the results achieved in the given framework, with  an obligation to continue with an even more successful work, as well as to  persevere with our institutional policies.  Accordingly, it was the strengthening of institutional capacities, social  responsibility and transparency of work that represented strategic  priorities for the National Bank of Serbia in the past year.  In order to project the real picture about our activities, we continually  work on improving the communication within the institution, as well as  with the general public. By improving the communication with the general  public and by truly understanding the problems and needs of the society,  we contribute to an open dialogue among all interested stakeholders. In  that way, we wish to strengthen confidence that represents one of the key  resources for an institution such as the National Bank of Serbia, which  carries out its activity in the interest of the society as a whole.  Decades of duration and tradition of this institution oblige us to  measure our social responsibility not only by our professionalism,  preservation of independence and credibility of the institution and our  relationship with employees, but also by the National Bank of Serbia's  impact in spreading and promotion of social values.  In the area of social responsibility, the Financial Services Consumer  Protection Law was adopted at the proposal of the National Bank of Serbia.  The aim of this Law is to protect citizens in financial transactions, reach the  standards of the European Union in this area and further strengthen the  confidence in the country's financial system.  The establishment of the Financial Stability Department and the work  of the Centre for Financial System Development provided a further  contribution to the development of the financial market. In order to ensure  efficient, stable and healthy financial markets that provide quality financial  services, it is necessary that we support financial education for all financial  market participants. We will continue with financial education of the wider  public (school age children and the general citizenry) and participants in  the financial system (citizens as loan users, entrepreneurs, farmers and  businesspeople).   We are currently in the process of implementing the National Bank of  Serbia's Financial Education Strategy, which aims to improve activities in  the area, as well as to ensure adequate ways of informing pupils, students,  2  citizens, entrepreneurs and businesspeople so that they get the  In addition, in 2011 we implemented numerous humanitarian  information that is important for them not only at this moment, but in the  activities and are very proud of high employee participation.

The National Bank of Serbia is independent and autonomous  in executing its functions as regulated by the Law on the National  Bank of Serbia and other legislation, and is accountable for its  work to the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia.   The primary objective of the National Bank of Serbia is to  achieve and maintain price stability. Aside from that, without  prejudice to the fulfilment of its primary objective, the National  Bank of Serbia also contributes to the safeguarding and  strengthening of the stability of the financial system. The National Bank of Serbia has the following functions:  determining and implementing monetary and foreign  exchange policies;  managing foreign exchange reserves;  establishing and implementing activities and measures  coming under its remit, relating to the preservation and  strengthening of financial stability;   granting and revoking operating licences, supervising  bank solvency and legality of operations and performing  other activities in line with the law governing banks;   granting  and  revoking  operating  licenses  and/or  authorisations  to  insurance  companies,  supervising  these companies and performing other activities in line  with the law governing insurance;   granting and revoking operating licences to voluntary  pension fund management companies, supervising these  companies and performing other activities in line with the  law governing voluntary pension funds;   granting and revoking operating licenses to financial  leasing companies, supervising these companies and  performing other activities in line with law governing  leasing operations;  issuing banknotes and coins and managing cash flows;    regulating, controlling and promoting uninterrupted  functioning of the payment system;  performing statutory tasks for the Republic of Serbia or  tasks established by treaties, without affecting thereby  its autonomy and independence.

The  report includes activities carried out in the field of social  responsibility and explains the approach that our institution has in  terms of social responsibility. At the same time, it follows the  tendencies of modern corporate governance according to which  social responsibility becomes an integral part of every institution,  company or organisation. Also, the publication of this report  testifies to the continuous efforts on improving National Bank of  Serbia's communication with the general public.  In accordance with its strategy for 2011, the National Bank of  Serbia sought to contribute to the strengthening of social  responsibility. By implementing activities that have positive effects  on the protection of financial service consumers, the National  Bank of Serbia gave its contribution to the improvement of the  financial system and the development of the financial market.  This contribution is reflected in the adoption of the Financial  Services Consumer Protection Law whose main aim is to protect  citizens in financial transactions. Additional institutional support to the development of financial  education was provided by forming a new department for  educating users of financial services within the Centre for Financial  Consumer Protection and Education.  The strengthening of social responsibility and work on the  development of institutional capacities continued by forming new  independent organisational units: - the Financial Stability Department, - the Corporate Liaisons Office, - the Chief Economists Office, and  - the Compliance and Operational Risk Control. As one of the most prominent institutions in the country, the  National Bank of Serbia wants to serve as a role model and to  encourage similar behaviour by other institutions, companies and  organisations in Serbia, especially those in the financial sector. Strategic and operational priorities for the National Bank of  Serbia in 2012 will be focused on the following:  - development of the financial stability sector, - improving the management of foreign exchange reserves, - strengthening the capacity of supervision, - improving the organisational structure, - improving control of operational risk (IT resources,  protection of data secrecy, disaster recovery), - establishing the system of budgeting in the National  Bank of Serbia.

Global  Compact requires from its members to adopt, support and  promote the ten universal principles in the protection of human  and labour rights, environmental protection and the fight against  corruption. During the four years of work in Serbia, the number of  members increased to 80. Apart from large companies, members  are also representatives of small and medium-sized companies,  non-governmental organisations (NGOs), business associations,  academic institutions, cities and trade unions.  In 2011, together with other working group members, the  National Bank of Serbia actively participated in the working group  for corporate social responsibility in banking and finance, social  inclusion, education and development of the corporate social  responsibility, environment and support in emergency situations.  As chair of the working group for corporate social responsibility  in banking and finance, the National Bank of Serbia, together with  other  members  of  the  working  group  worked  on  the  implementation of two projects in the field of financial education,  which is a primary objective of this group.  Within the project of cooperation with secondary schools with  an educational profile banking, the students from those schools  were provided with: - one-week/two-week  practice for third/fourth  grade  students in branches of banks members;  - visit to the National Bank of Serbias Visitor Centre,  thematic lectures for students and teachers;  - participation of representatives of banks members in the  final high-school exam,  - participation in professional seminars of the Academy for  Banking and Finance for teachers of this educational profile.  The cooperation was formalised by signing a cooperation  protocol between the Association of Economic Schools, Law and  Administration Schools, Schools of Commerce and Catering and  Tourism Schools in the Republic of Serbia and the Global Compact  in Serbia and will be continued in 2012.  Free-of-charge  workshops  for  citizens  under  the  title  Managing Personal Finances are the result of cooperation of the  Global Compact in Serbia and the Croatian Banking Association.  Following the positive experiences of Croatia, members of the  working group decided to organise and launch free-of-charge  interactive workshops for citizens on planning and managing   10 personal finances in Serbia.

The Ten Principles: Application: Planned Activities:    Occupational Health and Safety  The National Bank of Serbia passed an Act on risk assessment  at place of work and in the working environment as well as a  Decision on determining salary increases for higher risk jobs.   Also, a procedure has been initiated at the Republican Pension  and Disability Insurance Fund for determining the workplaces, i.e.  jobs (the driver of a special vehicle in the General Affairs  Department whose capacity is seven and more tons) whose years  of insurance are calculated with an extended duration.  The equipment for personal safety of employees (clothes,  shoes, gloves, goggles, masks) was procured and the conditions  of the working environment in the buildings during the summer  period were examined. Most of the working equipment was examined and tested, and  the employees at the workplaces with an increased risk are  regularly sent for periodic medical examinations. A number of  employees  who work  with  equipment with  a screen (on  computers) for at least four hours a day were sent to an  ophthalmic examination. In addition to adopting the Plan for training of employees for  safe and healthy work in the National Bank of Serbia, training of  employees for safe and healthy work began in some of the branch  offices of the National Bank of Serbia, and in others it was fully  implemented. When it comes to activities in the field of occupational health and  safety of employees at the Institute for Manufacturing Banknotes  and Coins, by recording the organisation of work, technological and  business processes and resources of work in the organisational units  of the Institute for Manufacturing Banknotes and Coins and their  comparison with the actual situation, 113 elementary, relatively  independent, corporate and technological processes were identified.  The circumstances that may endanger occupational safety and  health (an increased risk) are grouped in 28 working positions where  technology and work processes are performed by 122 employees. In accordance with the regulations in the field of occupational  safety and health, in cooperation with direct supervisors,  (theoretical and practical) training of 110 employees in the  Institute for Manufacturing Banknotes and Coins was conducted.  The training was carried out during the working hours and was  recorded in the prescribed form. The examination of the working environment in the Institute  for Manufacturing Banknotes and Coins buildings was carried out  in the summer period to measure chemical and physical hazards  (other than ionizing radiation), microclimate and brightness. The  examination was performed by the Institute for Occupational  Safety and Health from Novi Sad and MD Project Institute from  Ni. Based on technical findings of the performed examinations of  the working environment, measures to eliminate or reduce the  risks and hazards to the health of employees were proposed and  then implemented. Under the current acts, working tools and personal protection  equipment  (overalls,  coats,  shoes,  gloves,  masks)  were  distributed to organisational units.

Also, by  setting up a special organisational unit for financial education,  activities aimed at informing and educating financial service  consumers intensified.  In order to improve the existing mechanisms of financial  service consumer protection, the National Bank of Serbia  proposed the Financial Services Consumer Protection Law, which  came into force on 4 June 2011, to be applied as of 5 December of  the same year. The law primarily aims to ensure good business  practices of financial institutions and their fair attitude towards the  consumers, which includes in particular: precisely and clearly  defined terms of the agreement concerning the rights and  obligations of citizens, the obligation of the financial institution to  provide the citizens prior to the establishment of contractual  relationship or prior to the agreement signing with full, clear,  unambiguous and understandable information about the financial  service that they wish to use and the conditions under which such  service is offered.  A survey was conducted for the needs of the National Bank of  Serbia on the conditions under which the financial services are  offered on the market – current accounts and loans. The aim of  that  survey  was  to  objectively  analyse  transparency,  completeness and availability of information in relation to the  financial products offered, with a special overview of the level of  consumers awareness and adherence to the National Bank of  Serbias regulations. The survey was conducted by the company  for market, public opinion and media research TNS Medium  Gallup. Complaint Procedures Throughout 2011, the Consumer Protection Centre received a  total of 1,885 complaints and early complaints against operations  of financial institutions, i.e. 30% more than in the previous year.  Financial service consumers submitted 1,122 complaints  against financial institutions' operations, which indicates a 5.25%  increase compared to 2010. Of that number, majority of  complaints, 76%, referred to banks, which was expected given  that banks make up the largest part of the financial market. Of 855  complaints related to banks' operations, the majority concerned  loans (53.1%), current accounts (20.4%) and payment cards  (17.1%).  A total of 237 complaints relating to the work of insurance  companies were sent, which is 30% more when compared to the  previous year. The complaints were mainly related to the amount  of the offered damage compensations, untimely payment of  damages and the refusal of payment of the undisputed amount.

Cultural Heritage Georg Weifert – a Visionary  and Enthusiast The publication Georg Weifert – a Visionary and Enthusiast  (1850-1937), a personal and business illustrated biography,  authored by Saa Ili, Sonja Jerkovi and Vladimir Bulaji from the  Archives of the National Bank of Serbia, was presented in Vrac,  Panevo, Poarevac, Bor and Belgrade in 2011.  The promotions attracted adequate media coverage, on more  than 20 web-portals with a few dozen pages, in newspapers and in  electronic media. The number of visitors was satisfactory, with the  largest visitor turnout in the hall of the public library in Bor and in  the social hall of the National Bank of Serbia, where there were not  enough seats for all guests.  As a reminder, the above publication was published by the  National Bank of Serbia in 2010, to mark the 160th anniversary of  birth of the famous Governor Georg Weifert. The intention was not  just to present the story about Weifert's life, nor to show  numerous illustrations that should make closer to people the  space and time spoken of, but rather to affirm the values that  Weifert nurtured and left as a legacy – his diligent work, curiosity  and research spirit, responsibility, charity and philanthropy. As part of the activities relating to the presentation of the  archives material of the National Bank of Serbia, the Archives also  hosted the exhibition Capital Employed – Securities in the  Financial Market of Serbia in the 19th and the First Half of the 20th  Century, which was officially opened in the exhibition space at 12  Kralja Petra Street on 7 April. The exhibition presented over 100  original artefacts, featuring for the first time the temporary share  of the Privileged National Bank of the Kingdom of Serbia from  1884 and the permanent share from 1913. On this occasion the National Bank of Serbia again showed its  social responsibility, primarily through education of youth, who  have had the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the  richness of securities that circulated in the territory of today's  Serbia until the beginning of the Second World War. From 7 April  until 30 September the exhibits were seen by 12,409 visitors. 25  Donations  In  2011,  the  National  Bank  of  Serbia  allocated  RSD  1,081,000.00 in donations and RSD 83,333.34 for humanitarian  purposes, which makes a total of RSD 1,164,333.34.

Adaptation and Revitalisation of an Electric Power  Block, Gas Emission Control and New Wastewater  Technology  in  the  Institute  for  Manufacturing  Banknotes and Coins – Topider During 2011, before the agreed-on deadline, a very important  project was completed – adaptation and revitalisation of an  electric power block. The realisation also included complete  renovation of the electric power block, which was built three  decades ago. The electric power block was designed to meet the highest  technical standards in terms of rationalisation of energy costs and  to ensure state-of-the-art user friendliness. Some of the solutions  were applied in this part of Europe for the first time. Adaptation of the electric power block included: - replacement of 10 kV plant in substation; introduction of  automated switch of power supply in the 10 kV plant in substation,   - adaptation of billing metering on 10 kV in substation, - replacement of power transformers, - replacement of 0.4 kV busbar disposition,  - replacement of 0.4 kV plant in substation, - adaptation of sub-distributor 0.4 kV, - adaptation–revitalisation of spare 0.4 kV supply and  introduction of switching state and measuring value monitoring. The adaptation and revitalisation contributed to complete  protection of an operator while manipulating with equipment,  whether by special constructive solutions or suitable data access –  via subsidiary Touch Screen Panel and monitoring centre  responsible for presenting and archiving electrical values, turned- on state of switch-disconnectors and switches, load of cables,  power factor and state of accordions, which is of greatest  importance for maintenance or improvement of work conditions  and security in an electric power block.  Gas Emission Control  In order to preserve and protect environment in compliance  with the adopted regulations, gas emission from the boiler room in  the Institute for Manufacturing Banknotes and Coins was  measured twice in 2011 and reports were made accordingly. Due to the usage of crude oil fuel type NSG-S (with reduced  content of sulphur) and regular maintenance of boilers, including  the adjustment of combustion parameters on boiler burners, all  the measuring results were within the prescribed limits.  New Wastewater Treatment Technology  New technologies provide a modern and by all means  advanced approach to the production of our products and  accompanying tools, software management of the process,  omission of manual work in some work phases, as well as  reduction of the use of natural resources.
