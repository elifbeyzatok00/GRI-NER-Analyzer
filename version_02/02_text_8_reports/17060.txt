We have established a comprehensive framework to support our evolution  towards becoming a sustainable organization, which will allow us to leverage the  skills, creativity and energy of our employees and other stakeholders. the  development of a comprehensive strategy with priorities, targets and supporting  programs is ongoing and the focus will be on Continuous improvement (Ci) in all  aspects of our business.  sustainability is not the responsibility of a select few. We aim to have all of our  employees make sustainability a part of their daily work. sustainability is  becoming part of our corporate Dna and impacts every area of the Company.  the strategic vision, direction and goals are set by management. We have  established a reporting structure to gather information and report on progress  at regular intervals to our internal and external stakeholders. We have also  created a sustainability department to guide and provide resources. this  department is based primarily on the existing talents of colleagues within the  Company and is supplemented as required by outside resources.  as part of our organizational framework, we have also established a number of  cross-divisional teams in procurement and supply chain, logistics, engineering  and other functional areas. these teams focus on the development of innovative  solutions to reduce water usage and energy consumption and incorporate  alternative energy resources into our production processes. our management philosophy supports an interconnection between all three  dimensions of sustainability: social, environmental and economic. this can be  summed up as delivering sustainable profits for our shareholders while making  responsible choices for the environment and society.  To achieve this, we use a five-pillar framework to prioritize and categorize our  sustainability efforts. the pillars are: employee success, partner relationships,  Community Strength, Environmental Stewardship and Sustainable Profit. ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL ECONOMIC  Employee Success  Partner Relationships  Community Strength  Sustainable Profit  Environmental Stewardship SunOpta Organizational Framework Cross-Divisional Teams Grains and Foods Group Ingredients Group Fruit Group International Foods Group Corporate Sustainability   Department CEO and Senior Management Committee  Chairman and Board of Directors  Group Presidents Responsible Reporting  We have used global best practices including Food trade sustainability  leadership association (Ftsla) and Gri standards to help guide the  development of our first annual report. While at this time we are not in  a position to declare any application levels under Gri, going forward  we are striving to increase our alignment towards Gri and Ftsla. INTRODUCTION 4 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life 5 Introduction   We will strive to set realistic  but challenging goals, which  will help guide us towards our  overall vision of sustainability.  sustainability is a continuous journey with a goal of meeting the needs of todays  generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their  own needs. after many years of being heavily engaged in sustainability and  Continuous improvement (Ci) initiatives, we formalized our efforts into an  operating philosophy that we call the sunopta Way. this is our strategy for  becoming a sustainable organization. To date we have realized significant cost  improvements and in doing so eliminated wastes and optimized our processes.  Another initiative under the SunOpta Way strategy was to complete our first  company-wide Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory and track our global water  impact. this data has allowed us to better understand our impact on the  environment and begin to develop reduction goals and targets. this has also  enabled us to develop this first CSR Report, providing us with a detailed  understanding of the current state of our business as it relates to our vision of  becoming a sustainable organization. in the spirit of Ci, we will continue to focus on the areas that are critical to the  overall sustainability of our organization and stakeholders. We have selected  areas in each of our five platforms that we believe will have the greatest impact.  one of our overarching objectives will be continuing to embed sustainability in  our culture through the sunopta Way program. ongoing employee training  and development, combined with the introduction of an employee satisfaction  survey, will help to make our employees more successful.  Continued implementation of our supplier partner code of conduct across the  corporation will enhance our relationships with our supply partners.  the launch of a formal employee volunteer program will increase our community  involvement and help strengthen the communities that we operate in. to keep  us on track towards becoming a restorative company, we will continue to focus  on water conservation and re-use and reducing our GHG footprint through  energy conservation and renewable energy. an aggressive waste diversion goal  for our facilities will be a strong focus.  Continuing to focus on building sustainable and predictable vertically-integrated  business models and shareholder return remains an ongoing commitment.  We will strive to set realistic but challenging goals, which will help guide us  towards our overall vision of sustainability.  We believe dialogue is a critical component of sustainability and will be reaching  out to our stakeholders to discuss the impacts, risks and opportunities  surrounding sustainability. Where We are today  Where We are Going  Sustainability is a continuous journey with a  goal of meeting the needs of todays generation  without compromising the ability of future  generations to meet their own needs. INTRODUCTION 6 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life 7 Introduction   our sustainability efforts aim to pursue perfection and interconnection between all three dimensions of sustainability: social, environmental and economic.   To achieve this we are focused on five sustainability platforms that we believe will positively impact our people, planet and profit.  employee success:  Creating long lasting careers for our employees  We believe the success of our company is based on the dedication, commitment  and strengths of our people. We aim to be the employer of choice for all of our  employees, which is why we are thoroughly invested in training and promoting  from within, dedicated to promoting health and safety in all of our locations and  committed to diversity and being an equal opportunity employer for all. partner relationships:  Developing long lasting relationships with our partners  We are committed to developing long lasting, mutually beneficial relationships  with those we choose to do business with. We believe that our customers,  growers, suppliers, employees and other stakeholders are integral to the success  of our sustainability efforts, which is why we encourage them to follow a strict  code of ethics that respect our planet and its people.  Community strength:  Advancing communities and social progress  We are committed to contributing to the improvement of all of the communities  that we operate in worldwide. We promote sustainable agricultural and  commercial practices, participate in philanthropic initiatives and promote  volunteerism amongst our employees by offering them three paid days off per  year to participate in volunteer activities. sunoptas approach to sustainability  environmental stewardship: Becoming an environmentally restorative company  We believe that the success of our organization is directly linked to the health of  the planet and its resources. Environmental stewardship means first  understanding the impact of our actions on the health of the environment and  continually working to reduce these impacts.  Sustainable Profit:  Growing profits steadily and predictably  it is our vision to be the recognized global leader in natural and organic food  products that drive sustainable well-being. We believe that by doing what is  right for our people, planet, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders,  superior returns will be generated for all of our shareholders.

Over the past number of years we have invested in extensive training programs to develop the skills of our  team members. Training is ongoing and is continually adapted to the evolving needs of the Company and  our people. We want to develop leaders from within the Organization and create long term, fulfilling careers.  We also believe it is key to create a corporate culture and framework that encourages engagement where  everyone can openly contribute ideas and look for ways to continuously improve. Our goal is to be the  employer of choice for all of our employees. Employer of Choice We want to provide and foster long lasting careers for our employees. We firmly believe in providing training, development, fair  compensation and benefits package for our full time employees. These include:  Comprehensive health    care insurance;   Disability insurance;  Life insurance;  Retirement and investment plans;  Employee assistance program;  Tuition reimbursement;  Internal scholarship program;  Employee stock purchase plan    (ESPP); and   More Graduates of SunOptas FLL Program 2012 SunOpTa EmplOyEE SuCCESS GOalS: 	Conduct employee satisfaction survey.

SOCIAL 10 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life 11 Social  |  Employee Success  Social  |  Employee Success The SunOpta Way: Building a Sustainable Organization The SunOpta Way is our operating philosophy. It provides the framework to  create a culture that focuses on our triple bottom line of people, planet and profit.  The focus of The SunOpta Way is to align all SunOpta operations to a common  vision, accelerate improvement initiatives to achieve the vision, sustain the  improvements that are made and provide a focus for the long term growth of all  SunOpta operations.  a number of programs have been established to support The SunOpta Way,  including:   Training and Development  performance management   mentoring   Continuing Education Staff training at SunOptas Buena Park facility Training and Development We recognize and value highly skilled and motivated employees. We  encourage our employees to participate in life-long learning for both  professional and personal growth. These are some of the many diverse  training programs being offered by SunOpta:   Front Line Leadership (FLL)   leadership and management Training   process Excellence through people (pEp)   lean and Green  Performance Management Our performance management program requires our various  divisions to report to senior management quarterly on their progress  towards advancing their CI initiatives.  SunOpta Mentoring  Our leaders who participate in the Fll program are assigned a  SunOpta mentor. The mentors responsibilities are to coach and  support our leaders throughout the program and enhance the impact  of learning within our company.  Continuing Education  a tuition reimbursement program is available to encourage and assist  employees to continue their education in academic areas beneficial to  both the employee and SunOpta.  We also offer an environmental bursary program, the Jeremy Kendall  Environmental and Social Responsibility awards, for the children of  SunOpta employees. Bursaries are awarded annually to individuals  who are interested in and actively contributing to the community and  issues of social and environmental sustainability. at SunOpta we  recognize the value of a good education in the pursuit of a career and  are investing in the next generation. The SunOpta Way SOCIAL 13 12 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life  Three SunOpta facilities have achieved   more than five years without a single lost   time incident. Employee Diversity SunOpta has approximately 1,900 full and part-time employees  worldwide representing a wide range of experiences, cultures  and diversities. We work to maintain positive and professional  relationships with all of our employees worldwide. Our  expansion as a global company has brought a dynamic range of  thought processes and talent to our organization. It is essential  to our success that we continue to seek and source creative  and innovative individuals for future sustainability and growth.

We strive for zero accidents in the workplace and have implemented a company- wide safety program designed to address physical, behavioral and compliance  elements of a best-in-class safety program. Safety is both an individual and team  responsibility.  We are committed to improving safety by investing in our people, processes and  facilities. a cross-functional corporate safety committee meets on a monthly basis  to discuss best practices between facilities and business units. Employees receive  monthly safety training, including specialized emergency response training. We  keep our employees well-informed about workplace safety issues with a monthly  safety newsletter that also emphasizes wellness, fitness and home safety tips.

Sustainability requires a permanent  and evolving effort and cannot be achieved without mutually successful and long lasting relationships with  stakeholder partners who are equally committed to sustainability. We have developed codes of conduct to  govern our relationships and work closely with our partners to have a positive impact on the constituents  we serve. Customer of Choice With rising commodity prices, an increasing reliance on suppliers for cost savings, product innovation ideas and supply availability,  SunOpta understands that building long term relationships is just as important with our suppliers as it is with our customers. moving beyond traditional supplier relationship management to become the Customer of Choice is not only the right thing to  do, we believe it is the smart thing to do. The value of this comes in many forms, such as successful programs to leverage supplier  cost improvements, avoiding supply disruptions and getting first access to breakthrough product or service innovations that  will ultimately benefit our customers and other stakeholders.

Since 2009,  SunOpta has purchased over 2,600 metric tons of organic sugar  and cocoa, providing over uS $288,000 in premiums to farmers  involved in fair trade programs. Japan-United States Soybean Friendship Aid Program  In april 2011, we donated money to help the victims of Japans  devastating earthquake and tsunami. The donated funds went  towards the u.S. Soybean Export Councils Japan-united States Soybean  Friendship aid program. The program raised $30,000 in total, which was passed  onto the Red Cross. The Red Cross then utilized this money for earthquake and  tsunami relief. Selet Hulling PLC: Addis Ababa, Ethiopia  In December 2007, Tradin Organics, a division of SunOptas International Foods  Group, partnered with Kaleb Service Farmers house, an Ethiopian company, to  create Selet hulling plC, a joint venture to source and produce organic sesame  seeds for worldwide distribution.  Selets facilities were completed in December 2009. They comply with  international standards for food manufacturing.  Selet hulling works to improve the livelihood of Ethiopians by sourcing sesame  seeds from local farm cooperatives made up of over 1,500 Ethiopian families in  humera, Ethiopia. These seeds are pesticide free, certified organic, kosher and  processed in an ISO 2200 certified facility.  This project is having a very positive impact on local development in Ethiopia as it  results in higher income for farmers, added employment in the area and improved  well being for over 1,500 families.  By purchasing sesame seeds from Selet, it is our goal that Tradin Organics will be  able to provide a platform for sustainable agriculture in Ethiopia, which will result  in better incomes for farmers and their families as well as provide needed support  for local schools and other community infrastructure.  Since 2009, we have purchased  over 2,600 metric tons of   organic sugar and cocoa,   providing over US $288,000   in premiums to farmers. Social  |  Partner Relationships Supplier Partner Code of Conduct  We believe in and adhere to standards of ethical conduct in all of our  business operations, even beyond the strict requirements of the law.  SunOpta selects its agents, contractors, distributors, suppliers and  consultants based on their abilities to perform the required work  competently and comply with the SunOpta Supplier Partners Code of  Conduct.  In accordance with SunOptas Code of Conduct, supplier partners must be  prepared to provide information regarding their social policies and be  audited by a SunOpta employee or an authorized third party representative.  Our program implementation is based on the risk of supplier non- compliance to fundamental social principles and considers the geographic  location of the suppliers and also the supply chain risk of non-conformance  to these ethical standards by our business partners.  By purchasing sesame seeds from Selet, it is our  goal that Tradin Organics will be able to provide a  platform for sustainable agriculture in Ethiopia. SunOptas Ethiopian coffee co-op supply partner SOCIAL 19 18 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life  Food Trade Sustainability Leadership Association We are an active member of the FTSla, a non-profit trade association dedicated  to helping the organic food trade adopt leading edge environmentally sound and  socially just practices. It is grounded in solid principles and practical experience in  agriculture, organics, science, business, social issues, policy and sustainability  frameworks.  The FTSla unites businesses and allied partners across the supply chain to raise  the bar in organic food operations and across the organic food industry. as a  member of the FTSla, we are required to report on an 11 point framework  articulating our progress in sustainability.  nate morr, SunOptas Director of Global Sustainability,   has been Board president of the FTSla for the last four years. Organic Trade Association The Organic Trade association (OTa), founded in 1985, is the membership-based  business association for organic agriculture and products in north america. OTa  is the leading voice for the organic trade, representing over 6,500 organic  businesses. Its members include growers, shippers, processors, certifiers,  farmers associations, distributors, importers, exporters, consultants, retailers  and others. OTas Board of Directors is democratically elected by its members.  OTas mission is to promote and protect the growth of organic trade to benefit the  environment, farmers, the public and the economy. SunOpta and its affiliated companies have a long supportive  history with the OTa.  SunOpta has been a sponsoring  member of OTa since 2004 and several of the companies  that SunOpta has acquired have been members of OTa  since its inception in 1985. Social  |  Partner Relationships SunOptas Grower Incentive Program focuses  on contributing to sustainable farming practices  that give back to the earth more than we take. Grower Relationships  We understand the role that growers play in our companys success,  and appreciate that it is in large part because of our grower partners  that we have progressed to become one of the natural and organic food  industrys largest producers, suppliers and developers of ingredients  and private label retail products.  One particular example that showcases how SunOpta supports local  farmers is the Grains and Foods Groups enhanced Grower Incentive  program. The program encourages producers to increase non-GmO  crop production and convert their current acreage into organic  production.  The Grower Incentive programs goal is to support sustainable  agriculture practices that nurture natural food production and  processing. It allows SunOpta to focus on educating growers and  empowering them to improve their yield and financial return while  contributing to sustainable farming practices that give back to the earth  more than we take from it. SOCIAL 21 20 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life  Community Strength:  Advancing communities and social progress  SunOpta is committed to contributing to the improvement of our communities by promoting sustainable  agricultural and commercial practices as well as giving back through philanthropic initiatives, volunteerism  and other activities. We believe that to achieve this, the most effective approach is to work in partnership  with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders to leverage our combined resources and promote  social activities across the world.  We are working to develop the communities in the areas where we operate and are focused on opportunities  to promote childrens health, nutrition and education. We also believe that local community residents need  to be involved in these endeavors in order for them to be successful long term. We have a number of  initiatives to help the thousands of growers who supply us with products from across the world. By paying  fair prices for their products and working with them to improve their farming practices we can generate  greater benefits for their families, communities and the environment and, in doing so, make these  communities and activities sustainable.  We are working to develop the communities in the areas  where we operate and are focused on opportunities to  promote childrens health, nutrition and education. Social  |  Community Strength SunOptas Ethiopian coffee co-op supply partner SOCIAL 22 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life 23  Social  |  Community Strength Giving Back - One Prosper  We have also recently begun an association with One prosper, an organization  whose mission is to improve the lives of malnourished children in India through  sustainable agriculture. One prosper provides poor women smallholder farmers  with drip irrigation kits along with organic fertilizers and crop aids.  Three-quarters of the worlds poorest people get their food and income by  farming small plots of land, so if we can make smallholder farming more productive  and more profitable, we can have a massive impact on hunger, nutrition and  poverty. Drip irrigation also allows farmers to grow value-added crops and two  crops per year instead of one. Drip irrigation kits are gravity-fed, which eliminates  the need for diesel-powered irrigation pumps. Drip irrigation is also a beneficial  water conservation approach that ensures less stress on the water table.  at SunOpta, we believe that in order to better the world as a whole, we must first  focus on improving the local communities that we operate in individually. We have  a wide reach across the world with offices and operations in 11 countries and use  this as a platform to better the local areas that we reside in. We encourage each of  our companys operating groups to give back through volunteerism, philanthropic  efforts and supporting local charities. We hope that in doing this we can advance  our local communities and encourage social progress worldwide. Our Trabocca coffee operations recently  completed a project with Whole Foods to invest  20,000 euros to pave roads and add drying  beds for the grower cooperative involved. Giving Back - Ethiopia We currently have several active programs in Ethiopia. Our Trabocca coffee  operations, which are part of our International Foods Group, recently completed  a project in partnership with Whole Foods to invest 20,000 euros to pave roads  and add drying beds for the grower cooperative involved. Trabocca is also working  with a number of other customers to fund a school for other coffee grower  cooperatives in Ethiopia.  Our Selet sesame seed operation in Ethiopia is working with cooperatives  compromised of thousands of farmers to improve farming methods and improve  yields and farmer income. We also have a program providing these farmers with  solar panels to run small appliances. This reduces the need to burn scrub brush to  cook food; a real environmental issue which leads to soil erosion. We are also  providing partial funding for two schools in the sesame growing regions.  We believe it is important for the community to be actively involved in each of  these initiatives and local community residents are actively involved in realizing  the project. Visit our website for a video on some of our initiatives in Ethiopia if  you are interested in learning more.  It is our objective is to fund a number of similar projects in other parts of the world  where we do business. Over time, as the local economic benefits generated are  increased, we believe we can make a difference in the quality of life in these  communities. If we can make smallholder farming more  productive and more profitable, we can   have a massive impact on hunger, nutrition   and poverty. SOCIAL 25 24 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life  mIREya ESTRElla SunOptas Moorhead Minnesota Employees Spread Holiday Cheer  with the Salvation Army  Four years ago, employees at SunOptas moorhead minnesota facility decided to  forgo their annual office holiday party and instead raise money for struggling  families in need. They aligned their efforts with the local Salvation army, who  assist with the distribution of aid to Moorhead area families each  year. Today, the Group remains passionate about and committed to  this office holiday tradition. Their goal is to provide hope and the  financial means to keep families together, both during the holiday  season and throughout the year. Wounded Warrior Project  We are a proud sponsor of the Wounded Warrior project,   a non-profit, nonpartisan organization, that provides programs  and services to injured u.S. service members and their families.  The mission of the Wounded Warrior project is to honor and  empower wounded warriors and their vision is to foster the  most successful, well-adjusted generation of wounded warriors  in u.S. history. Social  |  Community Strength Employee Volunteer Spotlight: Becky Starr Becky Starr, Western Region Sales manager, SunOpta Grains and Foods Group,  is a dedicated volunteer with the Sacramento Food Bank and Family Services  mother-Baby program, whose goal is to create stronger, healthier families. It  offers classes to low-income moms to help them learn about parenting skills,  community services, breastfeeding, cloth diapering, nutrition and more. If a mom  attends one class per month she is eligible to receive a bag of formula, baby food,  15 articles of baby clothing and other important products. Becky began volunteering with the mother-Baby program in 2008 and has since  helped check women in for the class, packed grocery bags with appropriate foods  and organized clothes every monday evening when she is not travelling for work. It is through the dedication of employees like Becky that the communities we  operate in are improved, which is why we are committed to promoting  volunteerism and philanthropic efforts. Supporting Employee Volunteerism  Consistent with our vision of becoming a sustainable organization, we want to  give all SunOpta employees the opportunity to give back to the community by  volunteering with the approved charities, events or fundraisers of their choice.  We encourage, but do not require, all employees to take up to three paid days off  per year to volunteer with a community or charitable organization.  Charities approved by our company include national organizations such as the  american Cancer Society, unICEF and habitat for humanity. They also include  local charities, such as meals on Wheels, women and animal shelters, beach clean- ups, schools, hospitals, senior care, walk-a-thons, fundraisers, youth development,  sports programs and more, which are all important to our communities.  SunOptas Community Enrichment Program  SunOpta is currently developing a community enrichment  program that will focus on childrens health and nutrition. The  program will involve SunOptas supply partners, customers  and non-governmental organizations.

We have a vision of becoming an  environmentally restorative company whose activities actually have a positive impact on the health of our  planet. Our approach is to use our sustainability framework to engage all of our employees in this effort.  We have established PEP, Lean/Green teams and champions in all of our divisions. Their focus is to eliminate  waste in all its forms. We believe this is the most effective way to reduce our environmental impact.

Lean manufacturing principles are most often applied to improve products,  services or processes, but we are using this proven thinking to drive environmental  stewardship throughout the organization.  Lean and Green builds on traditional Lean thinking that is practiced by thousands  of organizations around the world. While traditional Lean thinking has focused on  eliminating the seven Lean Wastes and building value for the customer, Lean and  Green expands this thinking to include elimination of the seven Green Wastes:  Energy, Water, materials, Garbage, Transportation, Emissions and Biodiversity.  as part of our Lean and Green program our colleagues are receiving ongoing on- site training, coaching and support on the Lean and Green process. The results  are promising; our champions and their teams are continually identifying  opportunities and implementing initiatives that are bringing us closer to our vision  of becoming environmentally restorative. While we still have many challenges  ahead of us, we have been making progress. Over the past few years the work  completed through SunOpta Lean and Green teams have resulted in some  impressive achievements to date. Read on to find out some of the major  accomplishments to date. The Seven Green Wastes  Lean and Green expands on traditional thinking to include elimination of the seven Green Wastes:  Emissions, Energy, Water, Materials, Garbage, Transportation and Biodiversity.  LeanandGrEEn 30 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life 31 Environmental  |  Environmental Stewardship  |  Lean and Green  Emissions waste results from discharging pollutants into the  atmosphere, causing negative environmental impacts. Eliminating  airborne pollutants that are discharged directly from our facilities  will move us toward our vision of becoming a sustainable  organization.  Understanding our Footprint  We are committed to understanding and reducing our carbon footprint. in 2011,  we completed our first company-wide GHG Inventory using 2008 as our base  year for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. This inventory, completed according to  the Greenhouse Gas Protocols Corporate Standard, is proving to be a valuable  tool in helping us better understand our organizations GhG impact.  in addition to calculating our footprint, we established a Quality management  System using the internationally recognized iSO 14064 Standard as a guidance  tool and engaged our internal audit team to help ensure the accuracy of the data.  The Quality management System provides strict policies, procedures and  guidelines needed to ensure a relevant, complete, consistent, accurate and  transparent inventory year after year. We are currently analyzing the data and  developing our company-wide strategy to achieve our reduction goal and bring us  closer to our vision of becoming a sustainable organization. SunOptas Cambridge, Minnesota Biogas Energy Recovery Project  in march 2010, SunOptas ingredients Group completed the installation of a  state-of-the-art biogas energy recovery system at their Cambridge, minnesota  oat fiber facility. Prior to the installation of this new system, biogas produced by  the facilitys former waste treatment system was released into the atmosphere,  presenting an untapped source of energy and an environmental risk. This project  will help SunOpta continue its efforts towards becoming an increasingly  sustainable organization that yields environmental and financial benefits.

The collected methane gas is then filtered, compressed and conditioned,  which converts it into pipeline quality natural gas. The gas is then used to power a  boiler that supports the facilitys hot water and heating needs. As a result of this project the Facilitys use of natural gas has been reduced by  40%, or 1,755 tons of carbon dioxide. That is equal to taking 312 cars off the road  or unplugging 193 homes from the grid for a year! 32 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life 33 Environmental  |  Environmental Stewardship  |  Emissions  GHG Scope Definition Scope 1:  Direct GHG Emissions: GHG Emissions coming directly from SunOpta owned or controlled assets.

GreeN House GAs Protocol 34 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life 35 Environmental  |  Environmental Stewardship  |  Emissions  With an eye on renewable energy, we are currently implementing energy best  practices across our facilities. The focus is on energy conservation, management  and the use of energy efficient technologies.  One of the SunOpta Fruit Group divisions, Pacific Fruit Processors (PFP), located  in Southgate, California, has completed several projects to improve productivity  while reducing the amount of energy used. Conservation related to electricity  usage in the plant has resulted in a savings of approximately 146,000 kWh. This is  equivalent to taking ten average sized homes off the grid for one year. PFP has  also been working with Parallel Products, north americas leader in unsellable  beverage destruction and recycling, since February 2004 to convert liquid waste  into fuel grade ethanol. Since this partnership began, approximately 10.5 million  pounds of liquid waste, or 2.1 million pounds of sugar solids, have been converted  into fuel grade ethanol. Energy waste results from using excessive amounts of energy  supplied by sources that have a negative environmental impact.  SunOpta is working to minimize energy use across all of our facilities  and moving towards self-harvested renewable energy where we  will harvest energy for free from sources that have no negative  impact on the environment.  At SunOpta, energy use accounts for a significant portion of our carbon footprint,  providing one of the largest opportunities for improvement. across all of our  facilities reducing energy consumption is one of the most meaningful measures  we can immediately take to reduce our footprint while adding value for our  shareholders.

We are focused on  minimizing the amount of water used within our facilities and moving  towards a closed-loop system where we can clean our own water  and use it over and over again.  As a major manufacturer and processor of natural and organic foods and  beverages, we are a major user of water. While we cannot reduce the amount of  water that goes into our products, we can reduce the amount of water that is used  for sanitation and processing.  100,000,000 50,000,000 0 2008 2009 2010 Grains and Food Group Ingredients Group Fruit Group International Foods Group 250,000,000 200,000,000 150,000,000 Water in  Gallons 190,025,221 219,376,475 203,327,475 195,650,510 215,931,418 208,778,469 31,248,703 19,814,302 21,249,154 Years SunOptas Total Water Use SunOpta CEO Water Mandate Founding Signatory  We recognize that water is one of the most important resources to both the planet and our business.

Material waste comes from a global design flaw where virgin raw  materials are designed to end up in the landfill. We are working to  minimize the amount of materials we use in the first place and  moving towards a cradle-to-cradle model where the materials we  do use flow in a closed-loop system. In doing this, materials will  come from recycled or renewable materials and can either be  recycled, re-used or composted at the end of their life. One of our biggest sources of material waste comes from the packaging of our  incoming raw materials and our outgoing finished goods. Currently our efforts are  focused on minimizing the amount of packaging coming into our facility and  materials we use to package our products while increasing the use of recycled and  recyclable materials. We are making strides in moving towards our goal of closing  the materials loop while continuing to ensure a high degree of food safety.  Cedar Rapids Filter Bag Reduction  An initiative at our Cedar Rapids Fiber facility identified that the disposable filter  bags used during our drying process were utilizing excessive amounts of filters  and generating large amounts of waste that ended up in the landfill. The continued  focus of the local operations team identified a reusable teflan filter that  dramatically reduces the amount of waste generated by the process. This  innovation realized an environmental benefit and a cost savings of $425,500 for  the year. This continues to reinforce the positive relationship between  sustainability and profitability. ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALS South Gates Landfill Reduction SunOptas facility in South Gate, California purchased approximately 300 reusable  stainless steel totes in 2011, to carry bulk fruit prep back and forth to customers.  These containers were purchased to replace one-way disposable plastic bags in  box cartons. Each tote will eliminate 3,200 bags and boxes from the landfill, plus  reduce the need of 80 wooden pallets over its projected ten-year life span. In  total, the 300 totes will eliminate 960,000 plastic bags and boxes from the landfill  and reduce the need for 24,000 totes over the projected lifespan. The residual  fruit returned in each tote is recycled at a local ethanol plant. This system  represents a closed loop cycle that eliminates 100% of the waste from the  landfill—investment of $750,000 2012 SunOPTa EnvirOnmEnTaL   STEWardShiP maTEriaLS GOaL:  Develop a complete packaging inventory to set    a packaging reduction target 40 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life 41 Environmental  |  Environmental Stewardship  |  Materials  We are working to divert our garbage from landfill and  incineration with the ultimate goal of continuously reducing the  amount of garbage that we generate. Garbage waste comes from the fact that we pay for things that we  are only going to throw away and then we pay again to have it  taken to a landfill. We are working to divert our garbage from  landfills and incineration with the ultimate goal of continuously  driving lower the amount of garbage that we generate.  at our fruit bar plant in Omak, Washington, a partnership was formed with  Washington State university in support of our Lean and Green initiatives. This  project identified a number of opportunities to decrease the amount of waste  going to landfill. One of the opportunities implemented has eliminated 52,000  plastic bags per year. The Omak facility is now operating at a 97% diversion rate  from landfill. ENVIRONMENTAL Minimizing Waste Generation  Going beyond traditional recycling initiatives, our facilities are   finding innovative ways to minimize the generation of waste and   keep remaining waste out of landfills. Some of the things we are   doing include:   Working with suppliers to reduce packaging       on incoming materials;   utilizing re-usable shipping containers   wherever possible;   Converting non-recyclable packaging    materials over to recyclable materials; and   Eliminating disposable food and beverage   containers in break and lunch rooms.  2012 SunOPTa EnvirOnmEnTaL   STEWardShiP WaSTE GOaL:  90% diversion from landfill at all of SunOpta      facilities by 2020 42 SunOpta  |  Bringing Well-Being to Life 43 Environmental  |  Environmental Stewardship  |  Garbage  100 50 0 250 200 150 CO2  Metric Torn (MT) January February March April May June July August September October November December Co2MT Net 125 Years January February March April May June July August September October November December 0.080 0.040 0.000 0.200 0.160 0.120 CO2  MT / Pallet IMDL/Pallet TL/Pallet LTL/Pallet 150 100 50 300 250 350 200 Trees Planted January February March April May June July August September October November December Trees Planted Years Until Offset 100 50 0 January February March April May June July August September October November December 250 200 150 CO2  Metric Torn (MT) TL CO2MT IMDL CO2MT  LTL CO2MT    Minimizing Transportation Waste  We have identified and implemented a number of initiatives to  minimize transportation waste, including:   Consolidating shipments from suppliers;   Optimizing the packing of trucks and containers;   Sourcing from local suppliers whenever possible;   developing relationships with progressive, environmentally    conscious freight providers; and   Encouraging employees to carpool and use public transit. Like many of the other green wastes, transportation waste results  from using excessive amounts of transportation that is powered  by fossil fuels. We are focusing on minimizing the amount of  transportation required and moving towards environmentally  friendlier forms of transportation and offsetting our current impact.  SunOptas C.H. Robinson and Trees Ontario Tree Planting Partnership  In April 2009, Tradin USA and Food Solutions, divisions of  SunOpta approached  C.h. robinson, our logistics provider, to formulate a strategy for minimizing the  environmental impact of CO2 emissions via over-the-road freight transpor tation. The C.h. robinson London, Ontario team took a unique approach,  engaging Trees Ontario to establish a carbon offset tree-planting program on  behalf of our company. The strategy was to plant one tree in Ontario, Canada,  the location of SunOptas corporate office, for every shipment of SunOpta  products. The planted trees live 125 years on average and offset 19 metric tons  of CO2 annually per hectare.  in 2010, C.h. robinson London, Ontario planted 2,516 trees on SunOptas  behalf. This equates to a CO2 offset of 3,800 metric tons over the life of the  trees. as a result of the efforts put towards this program, all of the SunOpta/C.h.  robinson freight CO2 emissions in 2010 will be offset during the life of the  planted trees.

We  are focusing our efforts to eliminate biodiversity waste through  the support of sustainable agriculture practices.  as a leader in the natural and organic food market, we rely heavily on the natural  environment to provide a sustainable supply of resources to our operations.  While the destruction of biodiversity within the natural environment can come  from many things, one of the biggest impacts we have on biodiversity comes  indirectly from the consumption of agricultural products. Sustainable agriculture is essentially about meeting the agricultural needs of the  present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own  agricultural needs by eliminating the biodiversity waste that results from  traditional agricultural practices. at SunOpta, we are in a unique position to  drive forward sustainable agriculture due to our vertical integration in the  agricultural market.  One way that we are promoting sustainable agricultural practices is through  our direct support of north american soybean growers committed to  environmentally-sound farming practices. We work directly with farmers to  offer them premium pricing contracts for their non-genetically modified (GMO)  and organic soybeans, which are used in our soymilk production. We control  every step of the soymilk process by operating a vertically-integrated business  model, from planting soybeans to the finished product. This allows us more  control over the long-term environmental sustainability of soymilk production  and processing. In total, we have contracts with over 3,000 Certified Organic  farmers who grow a variety of crops.  SunOptas Traceability Integrity Program  In order for our customers to be assured they will reap the benefits of a specialized  crop or product, valuable traits in specialized crops must be measured and  tracked. This is why our Grains and Foods Group uses a Traceability Integrity  Program (TIP); so that they can trace a specific variety or type of grain to its origin  for full seed-to-table vertical integration. The TiP process works to ensure the  purity of a crop is maintained through supply chain so that the end user receives  the desired characteristics for their crop varietal or trait. it allows for traceability,  quality, control and more marketability and safety, which in turn results in high  quality, non-GmO seed selection that is environmentally sustainable. By eliminating the biodiversity waste that results from traditional  agricultural practices, we give future generations the ability to meet  their own agricultural needs.

Measurement of outcomes  Description of how the company monitors and evaluates performance.  SunOpta has policies and procedures in place to protect the Human Rights of its  employees. We have implemented a Condence Line program that allows all  employees to condentially contact a third party administrator and notify them of  any ethical or inappropriate behavior witnessed in the work place. The third party  will then contact the head of Human Resources and inform them of the reported  incident. At that point in time, there will be a HR Representative designated to  conduct a thorough investigation. After the investigation is complete, a  determination will be made as to what actions will be taken and a follow-up letter  is sent to the third party to communicate directly with the individual ling the  complaint. There is a Condence Line report that is presented to the Senior  Management Team and Board of Directors every quarter  There are also extensive safety procedures and communication posted  throughout all SunOpta facilities. Safety training is required for all employees,  especially those working in a manufacturing environment. Theyre national safety  meetings held every month.
