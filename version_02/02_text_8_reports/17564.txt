2011 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  AND ACTIVITY REPORT  Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 2 "My personal convictions..." B eing proactive on sustainable development and going beyond the mere respect of regulations  is today a necessity. I firmly believe that enterprises that anticipate the major social and  environmental challenges of the future will be more successful than those that do not.   My personal conviction is that the long-term success of our Group will depend on the reinforcement of our  policies based on the protection of the environment, the respect of people and innovation in two areas:  Nutrition-Health and Plant-Based Chemistry.  Concerning Nutrition-Health, our Groups ambition is to create nutritional and sustainable solutions from  glucides, fibers, proteins, lipids and extracts that are derived from plant-based raw materials and processed in  our biorefineries. Roquette offers its customers a broad range of ingredients that seek to improve the nutritional,  functional and technical properties of the products they offer to consumers. The challenges are clear, and  consumer needs from all countries remain diverse: from nutritional requirements or food shortages to diseases  related to obesity or the aging of populations.  With the growing scarcity and volatile prices of fossil resources, the development of plant-based chemistry has  become a strategic necessity. Tomorrow, plants will be increasingly used to produce the molecules that society  needs. Roquette is at the forefront of this major transition. We must not blindly advance  forward, as we are well aware of the consequences that can arise from this approach,  notably in terms of the availability of arable land. It is a true debate. In many cases,  a complementary approach can achieve the right balance, with the same parcel of  land devoted to different uses, since each part of the harvested plant can be used.  Similarly, biorefineries can serve highly varied markets.  We have invested a lot and continue to invest in research internally, but we  are convinced that to succeed, the path lies through collaborative  development and innovation through networks. Thus, our  microalgae research program for Nutrition-Health works with  some fifteen partners, universities and private entities, as does  our research program in Plant-Based Chemistry.  Our investments in research and development may seem quite  bold, but they are in line with the trends and developments in  our world today.  At Roquette, whether as shareholders or employees, we are all  convinced that rising to these challenges will be the key to the  long-term success of our enterprise.

It produces more than 700 products from these  plant-based raw materials, aimed at five sectors: Human Nutrition, Paper- Cardboard, Pharmaceuticals-Cosmetics, Chemistry-Bioindustry and Animal  Nutrition.      Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 6 THE ROQUETTE GROUP I Interview with G. TALBOURDET and Ph. OLIVIER INTERVIEW WITH GUY TALBOURDET AND PHILIPPE OLIVIER The Roquette Group is a family-owned business whose  shareholders are all members of the Roquette family. Is  this an advantage in terms of the Groups approach to  sustainable development?  Guy Talbourdet, Chief Executive Officer:  The Groups approach to sustainable development derives  from its core values. In this way, the shareholders are real  stakeholders in its implementation. The Roquette family  is attached to the enterprise: many shareholders in the  third and fourth generation witnessed their parents strong  involvement in the family business and live in Lestrem or in  the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, where the company was founded.  They therefore know all the social, environmental and  economic challenges involved in developing a territory.  They see how growth and the balance of the three pillars  of sustainable development, "People, Planet, Profit,"  are needed to maintain a successful and independent  enterprise.   In concrete terms, the Groups family shareholders accept  the technological challenges involved in relatively long lead  times to bring products to market. The levels of profitability  defined by the shareholders correspond to what is required  to maintain the family independence while deploying a  strong policy of reinvestment in the enterprise. Why do sustainable development projects sometimes  require more time? Philippe Olivier, Reliability and Sustainable  Development Corporate Director:  Establishing a culture of sustainable development  in an enterprise is not done in a day. It makes  more sense and is more effective to work over a  longer period in order to mobilize the maximum  number of employees at all the levels and in all the  functions. Sustainable development lies at  the heart of the corporate strategy.  For example, we have decided to  equip our Beinheim factory with a  geothermal installation to develop the  use of renewable energy sources. It is  a world first that represents a very big  investment.  The Roquette Group is becoming more  international. How is it anchored in  the territories in which it produces and  sells its products?  GT: To start with, we work with suppliers  of agricultural raw materials that are located closest to our  factories. For the entire Roquette Group, the vast majority  of our raw materials are produced locally.  We reinforce our collaboration with the agricultural sector  because we are well aware that our responsibility extends  throughout the entire life cycle of our products, from the  agricultural raw materials to the products final use.  We also work with a network of service providers located  near our factories, notably for transport, maintenance and  investment works. In this way, the Group indirectly creates  a lot of jobs.   Our local presence is also an asset when it comes to  understanding and responding to the demands of  consumers whose habits regarding food can vary a great  deal from region to region. Does your local commitment extend to involvement in  the communities around you? PhO: Each factory, and each subsidiary of our Group,  contributes to local projects or finances them, either  directly or indirectly, because our employees and those of  our suppliers are all members of local communities.  We work in collaboration with the elected officials to  achieve the right balance between the development of  the community, the creation of jobs and the industrial  footprint. You spoke about your suppliers but what are the new  demands from your customers?  GT: Up until the end of the last decade, the Roquette  Group was a relatively secret enterprise. We were used  to doing without necessarily talking. Now, our  customers expectations go beyond the quality  of our products and their price. They concern  elements that must guarantee the institutional  Roquette brand.  Our customers question us more and more  regularly on our engagements to Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR). For example, their  criteria to establish sustainable relations  include the various aspects related to our  business  practices,  our  environmental  footprint, our relations with employees and  the communities in which we operate.  We must move forward with them, anticipate  their questions, respond to their many  requirements, and be flexible. Guy TALBOURDET  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 7 THE ROQUETTE GROUP  I Interview with G. TALBOURDET and Ph. OLIVIER Philippe OLIVIER customer demand as well as to  the evolution of our society, which  is demanding more and more  products that respect society and  the environment.  In your opinion, what are the  responsible  and  sustainable  innovations of tomorrow?   PhO:  We  listen  to  market  expectations and we develop,  for  example,  alternatives  to  bisphenol A  and  phtalates,  products whose risks have been  noted in various studies.  We are  also making advances in starch-based substitutes for  certain petrochemical molecules used in specialty markets. Another very promising sector for the future is microalgae.  Their potential is far from being fully evaluated, and we are  convinced that their field of development for human food  is immense. Roquettes major asset is its biorefineries, which allow  it to work in perfect symbiosis on both Nutrition- Health and Plant-Based Chemistry, which are becoming  complementary rather than competitive.  What are the future challenges for the Roquette  Group?    GT: To continue to thrive, our Group must adapt  regularly to the market and confront major challenges. Today, we are facing three such challenges:  the new European Common Agricultural  Policy,  the  globalization  of  financial  markets, notably with the speculation in  agricultural raw materials and energy,  and, of course, the increased competition  that now includes players from new  horizons, new geographic areas, and also  new business sectors.  We must therefore be innovative and  know how to turn constraints into  strengths.  Our ambition is to meet these challenges  by succeeding in our mission:  "To serve people by offering the best of  nature". Have your customers urged  you to communicate about the  Groups approach to sustainable  development?   PhO: In terms of CSR, our  customers were initially focused  on social responsibility, notably  with respect to the principles  issued by the International Labor  Organization.  Four years ago, we decided to  begin publishing a Sustainable  Development Report. From the  very first edition, this report has  been highly appreciated by our  customers, our shareholders, our  suppliers and our employees. This report also lists our  engagements under the United Nations Global Compact,  which offers a common framework for companies  committed to sustainable development. Today, we are also making progress to reduce the carbon  footprint of our products. We have chosen to go beyond  what is asked and work on Life Cycle Analyses (LCA) in  order to measure the total impact of our products on  the environment without limiting ourselves just to the  problem of carbon. We plan to integrate these LCA into our  approach on progress and innovation.  Do innovation and the search for new products  and processes also help promote sustainable  development?   GT: Of course. Taking into consideration the  challenges of sustainable development  before developing a new product is the best  way to guarantee the actions of Roquette  in this area over the long term. This  approach also helps generate new ideas  for developing the range of products and  services we offer our customers.  Our researchers work to anticipate future  needs and new markets. This is what we  have done recently, for example, we  recently launched a whole flour made  from microalgae, for use in human  food, a product and market that did  not exist before!  This is what we call  "disruptive" innovation.  We must always remain attentive to  Our Mission:  To serve men and women  and transform agricultural  raw materials into  products that are directly  or indirectly used in food,  health and consumer and  capital goods, with an  approach based on the  principles of sustainable  development.

Marc Roquette, Chairman Once upon a time in the North... The adventure started in 1933 when two brothers,  Dominique and Germain ROQUETTE, then grain agents  in Lille, created the company "Roquette Frres, the big  starch producer of the North" and began construction on a  potato starch plant at Lestrem, a small village in the North  of France.  In 1946, the workshops began working on another  interesting cereal grain: corn. Other renewable raw  materials would subsequently be added to Roquettes  activity: wheat in 1956, peas in 2005 and microalgae in  2008. Beyond the frontiers The years from 1958 to 2000 marked the groups first  wave of expansion outside France, with the acquisition or  construction of European industrial sites in Spain, Italy and  England.  In the 1980s, the Roquette Group set its sights overseas  with its first factory on the American continent.  As of 2000, the groups global expansion strategy began  looking east, with acquisitions notably in China, Korea,  Japan and India. Denys Dhaine: My father, Andr, began in 1948 at the  factory in Lestrem, where he worked for 38 years.  Mr. Grnewald called him "Captain" and his colleagues  "Chmarin" because he used to work in the navy.  He spent practically his entire career in the boiler room,  where he saw the boilers grow in size at the same pace  as the factory.  As a child, I remember that he would come home covered  in coal dust, from shoveling coal into the boilers, which is  what they had to do at the time. With the new technologies, its a lot cleaner today, and  a lot healthier! Without any qualifications, I began as a lab assistant  right after turning 18. When I was given the opportunity  to work in the boiler room, like my father, I jumped at  the chance! I took courses at the technical school in Lille  and received my diploma. First I was a roundsman, then  a tabler, and I was a shift supervisor when I retired after  42 years. I witnessed quite a lot of changes over the years,  especially in terms of the working conditions, which im- proved a great deal. I am proud to have followed in the  footsteps of my father, proud of the work I accomplished  and proud to see my son, in turn, give the best of himself  to this same company.  Jrmy Dhaine: Already when I was young I dreamed of  working at the factory.  I left a job at a flour mill to join Roquette. Ive been given  the post of operator in the glucose plant and I hope with  all my heart to have a long career at this company.  What I really like about this company is its ability to  always go further, and that nothing is impossible, even  changing the course of the Lys River! That makes me  confident about the future.  My dearest wish is to advance to a position in  the boiler room, of course ! In the DHAINE family, there was the grandfather, then the  father, and now the son... Germain ROQUETTE, one of the founding brothers, and Adam Grnewald, a brilliant  engineer, whose rigor, inventiveness and energy came to bolster the courage and daring  of the two pioneers in 1933. Nearly 80 years of existence To date, Roquette remains an independent family-owned  business, one of the world leaders in the starch industry. A  pioneer in Research & Development with its first laboratory  in 1951, the Roquette Group has made innovation a  constant priority for future development around Nutrition- Health and Plant-Based Chemistry. Andr, Denys and today Jrmy, all three employed at Roquette  Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 10 GOVERNANCE At the head of the Group, Marc ROQUETTE represents the third generation of the family.  In 2004, he succeeded Dominique ROQUETTE, son of one of the two founding brothers.  The stability of the family shareholder base and the financial independence of the  Group contribute to the implementation of its strategy of sustainable development  and investment. Governance evolved The ambition of the Roquette family is to retain control of  a successful Group that enjoys an excellent reputation and  is ranked among the top world leaders in its sector. In order  to adapt to the needs of its growing shareholder base, its  system of governance underwent a major transformation  in December 2011: the merger-absorption of the holding  companies from the different family branches.  Now, all shareholders are on the same footing and all  directly hold shares in Roquette Frres. The Board of Directors The Board of Directors determines the strategic, economic,  financial, technological and social orientations of the  Group and oversees their implementation by the General  Management.  Its mission is to ensure the long-term development of the  company and its activities. As a collegial body, it acts in  the social interest and serves the common interest of the  shareholders.  As of 31 December 2011, the Board consisted  of nine members.

Its industrial sites are located in  Europe, America, Asia and India. Its international presence  is further bolstered by its nearly 70 sales agents around the  world. This world-wide presence serves to respond to the needs  and expectations of our customers, who insist on the same  level of quality wherever they do business. Multiplying new markets The Group reinforces its presence throughout the world  by entering into partnerships with enterprises recognized  The Roquette Groups global expansion policy has long been based on a mix of  industrial sites, sales offices and agents.  Currently present in more than 100 countries, the Group pursues its deployment and  strong growth in geographic areas through an industrial policy of broad scope. in their field of expertise. It remains open to industrial and  commercial opportunities that will allow it to continue its  world-wide development. Deployment in Southeast Asia In 2011, the Roquette Group launched a new sales  organization in Southeast Asia. The logical consequence  of its strong growth in the region, Roquette Singapore  is now broadening its activity with teams in Malaysia,  Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, countries  until now handled by sales agents. Its teams are being  reinforced primarily through local recruitment and will  seek to actively cover this emerging region of more than  500 million inhabitants.   18 industrial sites 30 sales offices nearly THE ROQUETTE GROUP I International Expansion San Francisco Queretaro Keokuk Gurnee Vic/Aisne Geneva Delft Frankfurt Merville Beinheim Vecquemont Istanbul Moscow ESPOO Kltze Mumbai Allroed Benifayo Barcelona Beijing Osaka Tokyo Seoul Lianyungang Qingdao Cassano Nanning CALAFAT CORBY Wuhan Lestrem shanghaI SINGAPORE Guangzhou Bangkok jakarta Manila kuala lumpur H-Chi-Minh Ulsan  Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 14 OUR BUSINESS THE ROQUETTE GROUP I Our business Our industrial units transform renewable raw materials (corn, wheat, potatoes, peas  or microalgae) to obtain more than 700 products aimed at five industrial sectors:  human nutrition, paper and cardboard, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, chemistry and  bioindustry, and animal nutrition.  The Roquette Group thus promotes the concept of the integrated biorefinery.    The Roquette Group, partner of the agricultural  world  Each year, the Group transforms 7 million tons of  agricultural raw materials, including 3.5 million tons of  local French origin, representing a total of 800,000 hectares  of cultivated land. For many years, it has maintained privileged relations with  its suppliers, most of whom are located close to its factories  to promote local sourcing within a small logistics radius.   The richness of a molecule Our biorefineries extract and separate the components of  corn, wheat, potatoes and peas, which are then transformed  into more than 700 products. The main component, starch,  made from molecules of glucose, is a tremendous source of  energy. It is marketed in its native form or in derivative forms.  This diversity of raw materials, combined with Roquettes  manufacturing processes, allows the Group to develop  products adapted to the needs of the market. In Human Nutrition, for example, our products are used  in infant formula, beverages, soups, breaded products,  cheese, jams, confectionary, chewing gum, ice cream, to  name but a few. In Pharmaceuticals-Cosmetics, our products can be  found in toothpaste and beauty creams, as excipients for  syrups and caplets, or as the active principle for injectable  products. In Animal Nutrition, our products enrich pet food and feed  for livestock. Among applications in Paper-Cardboard, our products  are used as adhesives for cardboard and to improve the  softness and resistance of facial tissues and the print  quality of books, etc. In the Chemistry-Bioindustry sector, our products are  employed notably in the treatment of metals, in wall  adhesives and as additives for concrete.

Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 16 LOCAL RAW MATERIALS The quality of our products relies on agricultural raw materials of irreproachable  quality. For years, the Roquette Group has worked in close partnership with its local  farmers, cooperatives and other suppliers... How long has the Noriap Cooperative been a  supplier to Roquette?  The first contacts date back to the 1980s, for wheat  starch first in Vecquemont then in Lestrem via Agro  Picardie, which has since become Noriap. We began to  deliver corn to Lestrem in 1987, then peas to Vic-sur- Aisne as of 2000.  Over the course of these exchanges, we have made a lot  of progress together in the definition and the respect  of technical specifications. In the beginning, it was not  always easy to integrate the demands of a specialized  industrial company into our working processes. But by  working together, sharing analyses and results, we could  each understand the needs of the other, and over time  this forged a real mutual trust. Is sustainable development integrated into your  activity? Yes, of course! Sustainable development is integrated  into all the activities of the cooperative.  We developed a very active policy regarding tools to  assist decision-making, which we made available to  agricultural producers to enable them to optimize their  resources (using less and in a more efficient manner),  while retaining the two fundamentals: yield and quality  of the product. More than half of cereal shipments are handled by train  or water to reduce the number of trucks on the roads.  Furthermore, we deliver within a radius limited to 200  km, which improves the carbon footprint of our activity. We manage each year more than 5,500 test fields to  improve our seeds and raise our members production  yields and quality. Over time, has the relation between Noriap and  Roquette evolved?  Our simple seller-buyer relationship has evolved towards  a more technical partnership, in which the needs of the  buyer are integrated into the way the members of the  cooperative produce their wheat.  This transition to a relationship of customer and supplier,  where each is a co-contributor to the development of  the sector, has led us to encourage exchanges such as  site visits, meetings and the sharing of results, audits,  etc. Our two groups have been greatly enriched by  this relationship, which has jointly contributed to the  creation of value both for Noriap producers and for the  Roquette Group. Understanding the needs of the other has allowed us to forge a real  mutual trust. Martin MIGONNEY, Director General of the NORIAP Cooperative, cereals supplier to Roquette France THE ROQUETTE GROUP I Local raw materials A strong presence in the territory The various factories of the Roquette Group are all strongly  anchored in their respective territories and purchase  cereals from local suppliers. For the Roquette Group, stable sourcing means developing  long-term relationships with suppliers and optimizing  transport from numerous local collection points. Train and barge are the preferred methods of transport  in order to reduce the carbon footprint of logistics.  When necessary, road transport by truck is used for short  distances. In addition, the Roquette Group optimizes its  logistics routes in order to minimize transport of empty  containers. Each year, numerous audits are carried out on the silos of our  accredited cereal producers. These diagnostic inspections  contribute to the improvement of the infrastructure  and help ensure that our network of collection points  is optimized and properly maintained throughout the  territory. Local sourcing serves to limit transport between  storage points and loading platforms, and thus avoids any  delays in loading. Waxy corn, an example of close collaboration with  farmers The production of waxy corn dates back to the 1970s. Waxy  is a relatively new type of corn that is rich in amylopectin,  one of the two key components of starch. Forty years ago, a  few kilos of waxy corn seeds were imported from the USA for  testing in Italy. The small test field was located in the middle  of the park of an old abbey to keep it isolated from the  pollen of other plants. Since then, the Groups agronomists  each year test new varieties to propose to farmers. Privileged  relations have thus promoted the loyalty of farmers – in  certain cases up to three generations now – and improved  the profitability of this sector for sourcing. Waxy corn also plays an important role in the Roquette  Groups international expansion strategy. It was introduced  in China in 2005 with the same approach and the same  success as in Europe. After a first phase testing different  varieties, Roquette Chinas agronomists have established  direct contracts for the procurement of waxy corn for two  years now. The agronomists monitor agricultural production  in close collaboration with the farmers from the big cereal- producing provinces close to the industrial Lianyungang  site.  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 17 THE ROQUETTE GROUP I Our CSR commitment OUR CSR COMMITMENT Sustainable development poses fundamental challenges, both in terms of social and  societal issues as well as environmental and economic performance. The Roquette  Group remains strongly committed to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The Ethics Charter Since 2009, the Ethics Charter has been the document of  reference that defines the convictions, the responsibilities  and the commitments of the Group, as well as the spirit in  which it seeks to manage its activities. This charter reflects the ambitions of the Senior  Management and Board of Directors to affirm the Groups  values and principles of action: Respect, Trust, Solidarity;  Innovation, Passion for the job and Commitment to  achieve. It provides the employee with guidelines to clarify  professional conduct and choices, notably in situations of  dilemma or uncertainty. The Code of Conduct The Code of Conduct lists the operational practices and  principles of the Ethics Charter:  - Respect of the law and regulations, - Protection of the social rights of employees, - Good business practices, - Respect of the environment, - Prevention of conflicts of interests, - Management of information, - Protection of the assets of the Roquette Group. The Ethics Committee  In addition to the Ethics Charter and adherence to the  United Nations Global Compact, the Roquette Group  has also had an Ethics Committee since 2009. Under the  auspices of the Reliability & Sustainable Development  Dept., the Ethics Committee is composed of representatives  from the different regions plus one external member. Our adherence to SEDEX SEDEX (Supplier Ethical Data EXchange) is a not-for-profit  organization for companies committed to improving the  ethics performance of their production and distribution  chains.  Adherence to this initiative involves participating  in a platform for exchanging information on social  responsibility and performance. Certain multinationals  from the agrofood sector have joined the "AIM-PROGRESS"  consortium in order to promote good ethical practices with  their suppliers. To this end, they rely on the SEDEX platform,  which applies the principle that "an audit for one is an audit  for all."  Roquette has been part of SEDEX since 2006 and in  2012 engaged in audits of two of the Groups sites: Lestrem  (France) and Lianyungang (China). What is the role of the Ethics Committee and how  does it perform its function? The creation of the Ethics Committee reflects  the commitment of the Group in terms of social  responsibility and ethics, notably at the level of the  decision-making process. It acts transversally by  involving all the levels and the functions. All the regions are represented, which gives a  multicultural perspective to best guide the enterprise  and the professional conduct and behavior of each  employee, in particular in situations of dilemma or  ethical uncertainty. The Ethics Committee meets twice a year, and more  frequently if the need arises. In 2011, it was called upon  three times to respond to questions from the different  regions. Ethical issues or questions can be submitted  directly to a member of the committee or by e-mail to  the following address:  "Guiding professional conduct and behavior, in particular in situations  of dilemma or ethical uncertainty" Lori Hale, Member of the Ethics Committee and Project Coordinator at Keokuk (USA) ethics@roquette.com Going beyond the legal requirements to promote the Groups values and principles  of action.

Since this announcement at the end of 2008, and in order  to continue a healthy potato starch activity, the Roquette  Group has worked closely with its potato suppliers to  prepare for the transition towards the new system. Our Vecquemont factory (France) was until recently  supplied by nearly 1,200 potato producers.  Listening to the customer  As part of its constant efforts to improve customer  relationships, the Roquette Group ran a satisfaction survey  in 2011 to listen to customers, respond to their expectations  and identify areas for improvement. Conducted with 7,000 people in 108 countries, the study  sought to determine how customers perceive our offers  and services, around six major themes: the Groups product  range; its sales teams; its agents and distributors; the  technical support it provides for development; logistics;  and the handling of complaints. The results of the survey show a particularly high overall  satisfaction rate of 95%.    This study on our strengths and weaknesses highlights  that the most important criteria for our customers involve  logistics, sales and product issues where the Roquette  Groups performance received high scores.  The areas where customers would like to see improvements  concern:  - The development of innovative solutions in partnership  with the customer,  - Responding to requests for market information, and  -  Improving the way we handle complaints.  The action plan established around these priority issues  involves all employees of the Group and is accompanied  by an ambitious campaign to raise awareness among  employees. Working closely with farmers helps to prepare a sustainable future for the potato  starch sector in France, following changes in European regulations.

"() Ten years ago, the Roquette Group planted a seed  of hope in the Development Zone of Lianyungang to  launch its activities in Asia. Over the past decade, it has  taken root in China and grown at an incredible pace  Roquettes Lianyungang factory has become the Roquette  Groups biggest production unit in Asia, one of the biggest  enterprises to arise from foreign investment and one of  the most important French investments in the province of  Jiangsu.  "All these accomplishments bear witness to the  considerable efforts of Roquette that have contributed not  only to the tremendous support of numerous institutional  and strategic partners, as well as to a friendly collaboration  with the municipality and the Technological and Economic  Development Zone of Lianyungang. "Since 2009, Lianyungang has improved its integration of  resources and accelerated its development. We will increase  our efforts to assist Roquette in Lianyungang. To provide  new contributions to business and economic exchange,  we also sincerely hope that we will be able to develop our  friendship and our cooperation with the Roquette Group  ()." The Sustainable Development Report: a method  for dialogue and sharing good practices Testimonial from Dennis Janssen, Coordinator of the Safety,  Health, Environnement Program (Keokuk - USA) "The Sustainable Development Report is a very professional  and very practical document. It highlights the actions of  the Roquette Group and shows readers the considerable  work done by the enterprise at a global level. When you go  through this document and you read an article on a subject  for which you have devoted numerous hours, you begin  to understand that in each unit another person has made  the same efforts. And if you multiply this by the number of  workshops and subjects, you get a pretty clear picture of  the considerable amount of work that we carry out. "The Roquette Group makes very specific efforts to bring  together our international community in order to define  common objectives in line with the priorities of the  enterprise. Thanks to this, it will be stronger and more  efficient. Most of our employees are highly invested in their  work, but they need to be assured of what is needed for the  Dialogue with shareholders Testimonial from Herv Roquette, Shareholder and Employee  of the Roquette Group  "The companys relationship with its shareholders is a  determining factor, and the latter are sensitive to this  privileged connection, which goes well beyond merely  providing legal information. Roquette maintains a close  relationship with its shareholders in order to inform them  and take into account the expectations of new generations  in the family. "In addition to two annual informational meetings,  appropriate site visits or training programs are organized  with the Senior Management and internal specialists. "The shareholders of an eponymous company are also  ambassadors of the company in public life." The latter are now organized into two cooperatives that  supply the Vecquemont starch production plant. The result  is a better synergy between the sectors actors and the  French and European authorities. In parallel, the Roquette Group has intensified its efforts  to develop sales of potato starch and derivative products  on sustainable markets in order to ensure our supplier  partners a profitable activity, even after the change in  European regulations.

The human and technological expertise put  into application are in line with the high ambitions of the Roquette Group,  one of which is to rank among the most innovative enterprises in the areas of  Nutrition-Health and Plant-Based Chemistry.  Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 24 INNOVATION AT THE HEART OF THE ENTERPRISE Innovation has been the backbone of the Roquette Groups development and growth  since the 1950s, when its first research laboratory was launched at Lestrem (France).  To support its research activities, the enterprise employs more than 300 people,  and devotes 3% of its annual turnover. Thanks to its global network of application  laboratories, it makes every effort to offer products with new functions or alternative  solutions that are more respectful of human health and the environment. A CULTURE OF INNOVATION  I Constant innovation The Roquette Group innovates continuously to create new  products and solutions adapted to the needs of consumers.  Its research activities are primarily based in France at  Lestrem. Over the past several years, five other application  laboratories have been added (USA, China, Japan, India  and Italy).  The research relies on numerous areas of expertise,  including chemistry, biochemistry, phycology (the science  of algae), microbiology, toxicology, etc. Multidisciplinary  teams skilled in state-of-the-art technologies and  equipment design, test, analyze and develop innovative  solutions, products and processes that are more  respectful of people and the environment, as well as more  economically sustainable. Numerous research contracts  with universities, laboratories and other partners from  around the world allow Roquette to benefit from studies  and other works in complementary areas of expertise. They  allow the Group to keep up with the latest scientific and  technical knowledge. The Roquette Groups innovation strategy focuses on  designing new products and solutions from renewable  resources in two main activities: Nutrition-Health and  Plant-Based Chemistry. Nutrition-Health creates sustainable solutions for nutrition  and health. It responds to the specific nutritional needs  of populations and offers innovative solutions based on  glucides, fibers, proteins, lipids and other extracts. It relies on  results validated by clinical studies and renowned experts. Plant-Based Chemistry is an integral part of our approach  to develop the groups economic and environmental  performance through the use of renewable resources.  It offers new biosourced chemical intermediaries with  improved properties and functions.  It also works on new methods of production, such as  biotechnologies, to substitute existing chemical compounds  with molecules from plant-based origin. Lastly, it develops  natural polymers and other materials with special properties  and functions, all from plant-based resources. "The efficiency and performance that  we seek come from sharing skills and  ideas thanks to our way of working  collaboratively within our global   business networks."

In this spirit, we are  building world-wide research networks and reinforcing  our local presence in the different regions. The Group is  also developing synergies between the sales & marketing  teams and the application laboratories in order to develop  greater proximity with customers.  On the strength of its experience with current partners such  as DSM and Solazyme, the Roquette Group is reinforcing  this type of win-win collaboration to mutually develop  expertise. Innovation to respond to the needs and concerns of  society Research & Development is a key priority to respond to the  needs of our customers and to the evolution of the market.  By offering products with exceptional nutritional qualities,  designing innovative functional ingredients with strong  health benefits, and developing sustainable alternatives  to petrochemistry, the Roquette Group responds to  the demands of consumers who are more and more  concerned about their health and well-being and that of  the environment. These are top priorities for the Roquette  Group.  A few examples of recent and historic innovations are  illustrated on the following pages. This is the story of a small company, Roquette  Frres & Cie., which submitted on 15 April 1937  its first patent protecting "a sweet, comestible  product, for use in confectionary, pastries and  other products, presented in the form of a white  paste, with a consistency analogous to butter,  such that it can be put in breads or dough and  can also be kneaded or spread." More than 74 years later, this same company  has submitted its 4,667th patent covering a  variant strain of Schizochytrium with high  productivity in DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid, a  family of omega-3).  This latest success reflects the strategic, techni- cal and geographic diversification of the Group,  having been developed by a team of inventors  from Roquette France and China!  This long, proactive and dynamic policy of in- dustrial intellectual property development has  led Roquette to be ranked No. 1 in France for  patents filed in the agrofood industry1, a clear  reflection of its culture of innovation. --------------------------------- 1 Source : the Patent Panorama of the French agrofood  industry    2010 - www.frinnov.fr Patents at Roquette, a sustainable, renewable and  integral product!

Its role in  daily life, however, is often still not fully understood. It is from corn that we produce glucose for the injectable  solutions that are widely used in hospitals for intravenous  rehydration and parenteral nutrition of patients. Glucose  is obtained from starch extracted from corn grain and  fractioned (hydrolyzed) into glucose monomers.  Since 1894, scientific advances in hydrolyzation techniques  and purification processes have led to the production  of a quality of glucose that is exempt from all pyrogenic  substances. This purity avoids the reaction of fever in the  patient. For many decades, the Roquette Group has been the  leading manufacturer of apyrogenic glucose. To consolidate  its position and maintain excellence, a completely new  production unit equipped with the latest technologies has  been built at the Lestrem site (France) in 2011.  Apyrogenic glucose is defined in the monographs of the  pharmacopeia, which describe specific tests such as the  LAL test. These serve to verify production circuits as well  as to control the product to ensure it conforms to the  expectations of customers. The batches of crystallized apyrogenic glucose are  packaged in sacks or in big bags. Upon reception by the  customer, they are placed in solution and repackaged in  sterile pouches or flasks.  In this way, corn is at the origin of the molecule of life,  glucose, a raw material used in post-surgery and trauma  care as a source of energy. Several tens of thousands of tons  are delivered throughout the world for the satisfaction of  our customers and the well-being of patients. The limulus polyphemus, also known as the horseshoe crab, is a living  fossil that has not evolved for over 500 million years. Its longevity is  due to the properties of its blue blood, which coagulates in the pres- ence of endotoxins. This characteristic is used in the LAL test in order  to prepare the reactive material that detects the presence of bacterial  endotoxins in a solution. These are pyrogenic substances, i.e. they pro- voke a potentially harmful increase in body temperature following pa- renteral injection. Thanks to the LAL test, rabbits are no longer needed  for apyrogenetic testing. The limulus is a protected species, and the  taking of blood is done under strict control, after which the crabs are  returned to their natural sea environment. This practice contributes to  the protection of the species.

The story of a small grain of corn that became the molecule   of life  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 27 A CULTURE OF INNOVATION  I Nutrition-Health The DigestScience Foundation was created at the initiative of  doctors and researchers in the North of France to "promote  research on diseases of the digestive system and nutrition".  The Roquette Group is one of the founding partners.  The scientific community considers this association for  medicine and nutrition as a leading force for sustainable  progress in the treatment of these pathologies. Works by  the experts who launched this foundation have brought  the region of Lille, in the North of France, to the forefront of  the research world. To support these efforts, the Roquette  Group has made a five-year pledge to provide 300,000  euros a year to DigestScience. At the time of its creation,  studies on the impact of our polyols and fibers on oral  and intestinal microbiotics had been done for many years,  notably with teams of researchers involved in the origins of  DigestScience. Over the past three years, DigestScience has launched  two calls for proposals, organized several workshops  and congresses, published bimonthly newsletters, and  provided therapeutic education with the support of a  dedicated nurse. The foundation each year also organizes  an athletic competition for the benefit of research, the  Testathlon, which is well known to Roquettes employees in  France, who often receive the trophy for most participants  from a single company. Useful calls for proposals  DigestScience finances cutting-edge research programs  on digestive disorders and human nutrition. The European  calls for proposals are managed by a high level scientific  council.   The first call for proposals (2009-2010), for an amount of one  million euros, sought to promote cutting-edge research in  chronic Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), cliac disease  and the immunological and/or inflammatory aspects  of intestinal dysfunction. The winning team (Prof. D. W.  Hommes et al, University of Leiden, Netherlands) took an  innovative and original therapeutic approach: it employed  stem cells from bone marrow (mesenchymatous stromal  stem cells), possessing a high power of proliferation and  differentiation in various tissues, for the treatment of IBD. The first results of the phase 1 clinical study (Duijjvestein  et al., GUT, 2010) are very encouraging for the treatment of  Crohns disease. The second call for proposals (2011-2012), for an amount  of 500,000 euros, targeted the handling of intestinal flora  in the domain of health and disease. The four winning  teams, led by Laurent Debarbieux of the Pasteur Institute  of Paris (France), embarked on an innovative project: "The  interactions between bacteriophages and bacteria in  intestinal flora" (still little understood at the digestive level).  Given that bacteriophages are viruses that are exclusively  directed against bacteria and represent the most numerous  biological entities on the planet, these phages play a  primordial key in microbial equilibrium. This ambitious  project is expected to lead to numerous applications, and  the initial results are expected in 2012. High level workshops Many themes have been addressed since 2009. The latest  being: "Inflammation, Hypersensitivity and Abdominal  Pain: mechanisms and recommended conduct" (June  2011).

Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 28    How to innovate in nutrition without  sacrificing taste and enjoyment? These days, consumers want foods that taste great, but  they are also increasingly aware of the need for a healthy  and balanced diet. Yes, its possible to please the taste buds while savoring a  few cookies or an ice cream and still protect your waistline  and your health! With microalgae, an innovative solution is now available  thanks to the creation in 2011 of the Solazyme Roquette  Nutritionals joint venture.  Microalgae, an innovative source of nutrients Microalgae are single-cell algae that feed on a carbonated  source and can be produced in a controlled and secure  environment.  Discovered centuries ago but only recently applied  for industrial purposes, microalgae include several  hundreds of thousands of species. They are known for  their extraordinary intrinsic composition: proteins, lipids  (including omega-3 and omega-6), a wide range of  vitamins and minerals, various pigments, etc. Cultivating microalgae at industrial scale  In order to offer a product for the agrofood industry on a  large scale, the big challenge was to select the right strain  of microalgae and identify the optimal conditions for  cultivation. The decision was made to cultivate the microalgae in a  reactor, to avoid changes in climate and other conditions  associated with an uncontrolled environment. This  approach also presents the undeniable environmental  advantages of preserving natural resources. A unique, new whole food ingredient The whole flour obtained from microalgae combines  proteins, lipids and fibers. The lipids in this flour have a very  interesting nutritional profile, close to that of olive oil. This food ingredient is a great solution to improve the  nutritional properties of many food applications, notably  cereals and bakery products, beverages or frozen desserts.  It offers very low content in saturated fats and contains  no trans fatty acids or cholesterol. It considerably reduces  calories while providing fiber and proteins. Best of all,  it offers the same mouth feel and same consistency as a  solution rich in fats. Thanks to these characteristics, the  possibilities for innovation are endless.  Microalgae offer tremendous opportunities for innovation  in nutrition without sacrificing taste or enjoyment, while  improving the well-being of consumers. In November 2010, Solazyme Inc., a California-based company  specializing in oils and renewable bioproducts, and the Roquette  Group formed the joint venture SOLAZYME ROQUETTE NUTRITIONALS  (SRN) to combine their skills and technologies. Specialized in food  ingredients derived from microalgae, SRN is based in San Francisco. A first production run, with capacity of 300 tons of whole flour, was  launched at the Lestrem site (France) for SRN, which is planning to  begin marketing the product in 2012. Production capacity for this  unit will eventually be raised to 5,000 tons a year. SRN, a pioneering joint venture in  microalgae The whole flour obtained from microalgae can replace lipids in a broad range of  applications: cereal and fine bakery products, beverages or frozen desserts. A CULTURE OF INNOVATION  I Nutrition-Health  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 29 A CULTURE OF INNOVATION  I Nutrition-Health    Healthy beverages Beverages for the Nutrition-Health market continue to be  developed. Consumers are demanding beverages with less  sugar content, fewer calories and greater nutritional benefits  for their health.  With the specific properties of NUTRIOSE fiber, notably  its solubility and neutral taste, the Roquette Group has  developed a new beverage concept that is rich in fruits  and entirely sugar-free, thanks to a NUTRIOSE blend  that replaces the sugar that is usually added. The taste,  sweetness and texture of this beverage are fully comparable  to the traditional sugared drink, but with 75% fewer calories.  Furthermore, the NUTRIOSE fiber is  recognized as a natural  food ingredient. It can be produced from two renewable  raw materials: corn or wheat. This flexibility adds to the  natural advantages of this ingredient. The solution is always  guaranteed to be gluten-free. The international strategic consulting firm FROST &  SULLIVAN has just awarded the Roquette Group the  2011 European Food Fiber Ingredients Customer Value  Enhancement" award for its soluble NUTRIOSE fiber.   This distinction is the latest to reward the Groups strategy  of continuous improvement, in particular on the scientific  validation of the nutritional and health properties of its  ingredients.    Plant-based proteins, a response to the  challenges of aquaculture According to forecasts by the United Nations Food and  Agriculture Organization (FAO), aquaculture is expected to  show strong growth in the coming decades, as increasing  consumer demand for fish puts greater pressure on natural  fish stocks. Fish meal and oil are the primary ingredients for fish food.  The rise of fish farming has increased demand for these raw  materials, which traditionally come from fish capture, where  production is sluggish. Through its range of proteins derived  from the fractioning of peas, potatoes, wheat or corn, the  Roquette Group provides alternative solutions to fish-based  raw materials.  Plant-based proteins represent a highly digestible protein  source that responds to the nutritional needs of fish farming.  Furthermore, they provide a response to the problem of the  sustainability of the aquaculture sector. In the short term, aquaculture can rely on ingredients from  renewable plant-based raw materials such as proteins, while  preserving marine resources.  Soluble NUTRIOSE fiber replaces added sugar, reducing calories by 75% without  compromising taste. The scientific studies confirm that it is possible to substitute 75 to 90% of fish meal in  aquaculture food with a blend of plant-based protein sources without negative effect on  the fish or its environment (Source INRA).  Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 30    A new plant-based floor covering for our  babies How can we protect young infants from the potential  toxicity of everyday products such as floor coverings,  which often contain phtalates? This problem is regularly  discussed in establishments where children are present,  such as day-care centers. Now there are new and highly innovative solutions that  can contain up to 75% renewable materials. A floor  covering made from PVC (polyvinyl chloride) can be  produced in this way. It is flexible and homogeneous with  excellent resistance to wear even under strong traffic.  The big innovation is the use of a plastifier produced by  our Group that is 100% plant-based, POLYSORB ID37,  which is entirely made from renewable raw materials.  It is a green alternative to traditional plastifiers such as  phtalates. It is completely non-toxic and poses no danger  whatsoever to human health or the environment, so it can  be used in absolute safety, notably for floor coverings for  day-care centers. Thanks to these non-toxic and innovative characteristics,  the Roquette Group received the Agrobiobase 2011"  prize for its biosourced molecule at the "Green Chemistry  for 2020" congress in France, the first European congress  devoted to plant-based chemistry. The plant-based plastifier produced by the Roquette  Group is a derivative of isosorbide, a biosourced diol  obtained by dehydration of sorbitol (a derivative of  glucose). Isosorbide can be used for the manufacture of  specialty polymers such as polyesters, polycarbonates,  and polyurethanes. Thanks to its rigid structure, it is the  only biosourced diol that improves resistance to heat,  to ultraviolet (UV) light, and to chemical products. It  confers excellent optical and mechanical properties to the  materials obtained. With isosorbide (for which the Roquette Group is the world  leader), a whole range of biosourced derivatives is being  brought to market. Isosorbide can not only substitute  for potentially toxic molecules (such as Bisphenol A and  phtalates) but it also provides remarkable additional  properties to the polymers. In 2011, this product was successfully registered under the European  REACH regulation, which provides Roquette the right to produce  more than 1,000 tons. The Roquette Group can now promote the  product on a large scale and sell it on all markets. New step for POLYSORB ID37 A CULTURE OF INNOVATION  I Plant-Based Chemistry PLANT-BASED CHEMISTRY  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 31    Shoes that leave a biosourced footprint Choosing the right shoes is important for the individual but  also for the environment. The soles of shoes are often made with polyurethane. This  elastomeric polymer is currently produced from different  compounds, notably adipic acid from fossil resources. This  can be advantageously replaced with succinic acid made  from plant-based matter, which significantly reduces the  carbon footprint. For each type of shoe, a reduction of CO2 emissions can  thus be calculated. This can vary from 1 to 8 kg of CO2  per  pair of shoes, according to its type (reduction of 1 kg of CO2  for a pair of street shoes or running shoes, reduction of 8  kg of CO2  for a pair of ski boots; these carbon estimates are  based on calculations by Reverdia with life cycle analyses  of biosourced succinic acid and different shoe models).   A 100% biosourced molecule Biosourced succinic acid, Biosuccinium, is a product  offered by Reverdia, a joint venture of Roquette and Royal  DSM N.V, a Dutch multinational company specializing in  life sciences and material sciences. Reverdia is the exclusive proprietor of the technology  developed, which is based on a highly advantageous yeast- based fermentation process. This process considerably  reduces the consumption of energy compared with the  traditional method, which means lower CO2 emissions. In 2011, DSM and Roquette announced the construction  of an industrial production unit for biosourced succinic  acid with a capacity of about 10,000 tons per year. The  new unit at the Roquette site in Cassano (Italy) is expected  to enter production in the second half of 2012.  Initial feedback from the market is very encouraging and  indicates that the choice to invest in renewable alternatives  to fossil raw materials and develop biotechnological  processes is beginning to bear fruit.   Biosourced succinic acid will allow customers in the  chemicals industry to opt for an alternative with a lower  environmental footprint for a vast range of applications. The fruitful cooperation between DSM and Roquette began in  2008.  In 2010, a demo production unit was set up at the Roquette site  in Lestrem (France) and today is running at full capacity.  That same year, DSM and Roquette announced the creation of  their joint venture, Reverdia.  The new industrial production unit for biosourced succinic acid at  Roquettes Italian site will have a capacity of 10,000 tons, making  it the biggest in Europe! Reverdia, a successful  collaboration launched in 2008 "Our exclusive fermentation process   will significantly slash saline   and other emissions and improve   the overall environmental footprint   of finished products."   Rob van Leen, Director of innovation at DSM  Biosourced succinic acid can replace components of fossil origin, serving to  significantly reduce the carbon footprint of shoe soles. A CULTURE OF INNOVATION  I Plant-Based Chemistry  Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 32 A CULTURE OF INNOVATION  I Plant-Based Chemistry In cardboard applications, borax and/or boric acid are  widely used in the adhesives for the corrugated joints.  Since 2008, borax and its compounds have been classified  as CMR (Carcinogenic, Mutagenic and Reprotoxic).  The  main concern is that the adhesives become reprotoxic  (toxic for reproductive health), if the concentration exceeds  5% for boric acid and 8.5% for borax. In order to protect employees, the cardboard industry has  developed formulas with liquid solutions so that handling  of the product is kept to a minimum. To go even further, and considering that the residues  of borax and other derivatives in cardboard have been  analyzed with contents inferior to 0.1%, the Roquette  Group has developed in its applicative research laboratories  a formula that would eliminate the need for borax entirely. VECTOR N-7152, a pea starch produced in our factory  at Vic-sur-Aisne (France), can be used in adhesives for  cardboard. It has been judged as effective as borax for  all types of gluing and, best of all, it allows productivity  to remain at the same level as that obtained with borax- based formulas, notably in maintaining the speed of the  machines manufacturing the cardboard.    Pea starch: an alternative solution to replace  borax and boric acid Cardboard is a recyclable material based on renewable raw materials.  In Europe, 80% of cardboard is recycled. The structure of corrugated cardboard is similar in  design to that used by Gustave Eiffel to construct  the famous tower that bears his name. It is this  structure that gives such a level of rigidity to this  lightweight material. The average weight of 1 m2  of cardboard is only 530 grams. Its construction helps protect goods during transport, thanks to  its capacity to absorb impact. This is one of the primary functions  of packaging: to reduce losses during transport. Without the right  packaging, for example, some 50% of food products would be  damaged or destroyed in transport. Last but not least, cardboard  helps contribute to the notoriety of the packaged product, because it  allows for highly attractive printing. In Europe, 22 million tons of cardboard are produced annually.

Our plant-based resins contain more than 50% plant- based materials. Thanks to their composition, our resins  represent a significant and direct reduction in petrol and  gas consumption, compared with traditional fossil-based  plastics, thus helping to preserve scarce fossil resources  for future generations. The content of this biosourced  material is guaranteed and certified for each type of resin  with a label delivered by the Association Chimie du Vgtal  (association for plant-based chemistry) in France. A low environmental footprint  GAALENE  resins  respond  to  todays  growing  environmental concerns, in particular those linked to the  increase of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.  The capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air in the resin,  and the fact that the synthesis from starch only requires a  few steps, together help contribute to a particularly low  carbon footprint. Emissions in CO2 equivalent are reduced  by 65% compared with those of polyolefins, the family of  synthetic polymers most often used for plastic materials. The environmental data for these resins result from  evaluations done under the ISO 14 040/44 standard for life  cycle analyses and have been certified by an independent,  external source. Furthermore, these resins are fully  recyclable during their production and at their end of  life. They thus constitute a renewable resource that can  be used for the production of new plastic objects. Innovation in the service of the customer The resins also present unique and advantageous technical  properties, for example their soft and pleasant feel, which  will enable new concepts and designs.  While they are derived from green resources,  GAALENE  resins are not biodegradable. This means they can be used  for short, medium, and long-term applications, just like  plastics made the old way.  They also offer the advantage  of being easily transformed with the processes that already  exist at plastics companies, but at lower temperatures than  those required usually. In March 2011, five months after the launch of its new plant-based  resins, the Roquette Group was honored at the Biowerkstoff congress  on biosourced materials in Cologne (Germany), where it was awarded  the innovation prize for its GAALENE plant-based resins. This prize is an official recognition by the German and international  plastics industry of our capacity to innovate. It also reinforces our  image as a new supplier to the plastics industry.

To preserve the natural balance of our biosphere, which is necessary  to preserve life, the enterprise seeks to protect our planets natural capital by  reducing the impact of our activities on the world around us.  Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 36 A CULTURE THAT RESPECTS THE ENVIRONMENT  I Environmental conservation PRESERVING THE NATURAL CAPITAL, A PRIORITY    Preserving water, in quantity and quality Controlling water consumption The Roquette Groups industrial activities require water,  which is used in extracting the components of cereals.  It is therefore necessary to manage this resource in a  sustainable manner.  For this reason, Roquette regularly studies new ways to limit  water use. For example, under a program to be initiated  in 2012, condensation from evaporation will be collected  and reused, according to water quality. The water will be  either reused directly in the same process, or in a different  circuit that uses water of lesser quality. This will reduce the  volumes sent to the water-treatment station, which will  also promote a better understanding of the dimensions  needed for the Groups future water-treatment stations. Process optimization is a constant and essential challenge.  As with their energy plans, all of the Groups industrial sites  will continue and intensify their plans to reduce water  consumption. "Controlling our water consumption   is a clear economic and ecological   necessity for several reasons, notably  to protect the natural environment and  to preserve the water resources we need   to cultivate our raw materials   and transform them in our factories."     Agns FIEVET, Group Energy and Environment Expert Cleaner waste The Group has been treating its effluent since the 1970s,  when it installed the very first treatment station in the North  of France region, at its Lestrem site. Because it transforms plant-based raw materials, Roquette  can use biological methods to treat its effluent at the various  sites of the Group. Improvements are continuously made to  optimize our internal water-treatment stations.  ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) defines environmental  objectives to improve the quality of aquatic environments. For industrial  groups, these objectives involve a mandatory reduction, or even com- plete cessation, of emissions of dangerous substances in water. In 2011, the Roquette Groups factories in France, ahead of their Euro- pean counterparts, began checking for any substances that might be  found in emissions after going through the treatment station. Measure- ments as precise as one microgram per liter were carried out under the  WFD guidelines, and no dangerous substance was found. In our ongoing  desire to reduce our impact on water, our continuous improvement pro- gram will continue to seek ways to improve the quality of our emissions. Going beyond the objectives of the  European directive For example in Romania, the biological treatment station is  currently being modernized, which will multiply its capacity  to treat effluent by five. Emissions into the natural environment are under particularly  strict controls, and are tracked daily by independent  organizations throughout the world.  Our sites' teams also regularly check for the absence of  dangerous substances in the environment. The new treatment station at the Calafat site (Romania) will be operational in 2012  and will increase the current treatment capacity by a factor of five. The main objectives of our environmental strategy involve monitoring environmental  performance, reducing emissions, optimizing our processes, using renewable energy  sources, researching the cleanest new technologies and reducing the impact of our  logistics chain.  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 37 A CULTURE THAT RESPECTS THE ENVIRONMENT  I Environmental conservation    Reducing dust emissions and limiting odors For all its sites, the Roquette Group implements different  technologies to reduce dust emissions from the handling  of cereals and the production of powdered products.  For odors, the site at Cassano (Italy) has done extensive  analyses that allowed it to map the areas of olfactory  impact around the site and to determine the origins of  odor emissions. Thanks to the knowledge obtained from  this cartography, targeted investments have been decided  and the projects launched to reduce odor pollution.    Anticipating and reducing noise pollution The Roquette Group takes into account the question of  noise when designing its new installations. For example, for  the construction of the wood chipper for the new biomass  boiler at Beinheim (see page 41), the building was specially  designed to dampen noise from the chipper. Furthermore,  the chipper was designed with extra capacity so that the  full weekly production can be achieved during the day and  the chipper can be stopped at night and on the week-end  in order to respect the tranquility of the neighborhood.    Reducing the quantity of waste and recycling  it to create value The Roquette Group aims for "zero waste" by optimizing  manufacturing processes and by recycling even the  smallest waste. To improve the energy efficiency of our production sites,  the methanization of effluent has been developed at most  of the European sites. In 2011, the decision was made to  construct a methanizer on the Italian site of Cassano. It will  allow the sites effluent to be turned into bio-gas, which in  turn will power a gas motor to generate green  electricity,  thus reducing the carbon footprint of the site. Methanizers produce less granular mud than traditional  treatment stations. In this way, value is generated from  the effluent of the French factories of Lestrem and  Vecquemont. These will in turn be used to prime other  methanizers at the different European urban or industrial  water-treatment stations.  In the USA, the factories continue to develop systems to  identify, measure and reduce waste. Before the start of  the logistics chain, for example, an approach has been  developed to define a second use for materials not directly  used in the process (for example packaging). The idea  is not only to define a new usage but also to set up an  organization and method to ensure a second life for these  materials rather than to simply scrap them.  The biomass boiler at Beinheim (France) has been designed to reduce the noise  generated by the chipping of tree trunks.

For this,  an approach of continuous improvement has been  implemented for many years on the existing installations,  on the processes and on the logistics chain.    Optimizing energy consumption  Each  year,  the  Group  studies  and  implements  improvements to limit the consumption of energy.  A third energy plan for the European units As part of its continuous improvement of energy  performance in Europe, Roquette launched studies for a  new energy plan in the second half of 2011. This study was initiated by the Energy & Environment  Expertise Center and developed by the technical managers  from the European factories.  The previous plan led to annual energy savings approaching  194 GWh, or roughly 40,000 tons CO2 equivalent. This  third plan to reduce energy usage was validated at the  end of 2011 and will be progressively implemented by  the operations teams throughout 2012. It will be fully  operational in 2013. The latest plan relies primarily on reducing steam  consumption and on a number of improvements to reduce  consumption of electricity on the ventilation circuits. For all European factories, the expected drop in volumes  of natural gas consumed will represent an emissions  reduction of 11,000 tons of CO2. Spray towers that use less energy Spray drying is a technique used to transform a liquid into  a dry product in powdered form. During dehydration by  spray, the liquid is pulverized into fine droplets, in a vertical  cylinder in contact with a current of hot air in order to  evaporate the water.  This technique offers numerous advantages, such as the  Alain BOULANGER, Technician at the Energy Dept. of Lestrem (France)  The third energy plan for the European units should reduce emissions by 11,000 tons of CO2.  A CULTURE THAT RESPECTS THE ENVIRONMENT  I Continuous improvement  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 39 speed of drying. It also preserves the technical properties  and organoleptic qualities of the product. However, good  ventilation is necessary because dehydration represents a  non-negligible proportion of annual energy consumption. Different optimization solutions were studied, but the  option retained concerned regulating ventilator speed  with a frequency variator. This allows the air flow to be  perfectly adapted to the operating conditions of the spray  tower. This modification was successfully tested on three  different spray towers, leading to annual energy savings  of 2,700 MWh, or a reduction in emissions of 243 tons CO2  equivalent.  Other equipment located at different sites of the Group will  undergo a similar modification. A sustainable process in wheat starch  The Roquette Group has developed a new technology for  the separation and production of wheat starch. The new  system was recently installed at the Corby site (UK) as part  of a 25% capacity increase.  This process significantly improves yield as well as energy  efficiency. Consumption of steam and electricity has  been reduced by about 10% per ton of starch produced,  compared with the old process.  Other improvements are expected, notably regarding the  optimization of water consumption and production of  effluent. In parallel, the new process uses equipment that is smaller  in size than the old system, which improves the hygiene,  safety and cleanliness of the workshop. Furthermore, the  equipment installed is similar to that at the other sites of  the Group, which helps rationalize maintenance. Improvements in energy use at Gurnee (USA) At our American site in Gurnee, various energy-optimization  measures were put into place in 2011.  The hydrogenation reactors have been covered with a  removable thermal insulation that helps prevent heat loss,  thus saving 2.1 GWh per year. This also improved working  conditions for the operators by lowering the temperature  in those workshops. A second improvement was to install a regulator on the  boilers that adjusts to the rate of smoke. The savings  totaled 8.3 GWh per year. These improvements help cut emissions by about 2,000  tons CO2 equivalent per year. They also will be duplicated  at other sites of the Group. Ronald J. COOGAN, Operator at Gurnee (USA)  The installation of a regulator on the boiler helps reduce energy consumption. The new process developed for wheat starch at the Corby site (UK) saves energy.

Beinheim, to slash it use of fossil fuels by 75% Two major investments in the production of thermal  energy from renewable sources are being developed at  the Beinheim site (France): the geothermal and biomass  projects. Both are exclusively thermal, offering energy  yields significantly higher than cogeneration and able to  cover more than 75% of the steam requirements for the  industrial site. The geothermal project is a world first: It involves a production center for thermal energy derived  from heat that is drawn from deep within the earth. It is  the first time the technology is being used for industrial  purposes.   In the subterranean granite of the Soultz-sous-Forts  region in France, the temperatures can reach 170C. The  ambitious project calls for the construction of a thermal  production unit, the drilling of two wells between 2,500  and 3,000 meters in depth, and pipes to carry the heated  water the 17 kilometer distance between the Beinheim site  and Rittershoffen, where the wells are located. Geothermal  production is scheduled to begin in 2015 and is expected  to cut the sites dependence on natural gas by providing  24 megawatts of energy (out of the total of 90 megawatts  required) and save 39,000 tons of fossil CO2 per year.  This project was born from the shared ambition of three  groups long involved in the research of renewable and  sustainable energy solutions: the Roquette Group, the  Groupe Electricit de Strasbourg and the Caisse des  Dpts, which joined forces to create the company ECOGI  (Exploitation de la Chaleur d'Origine Gothermale pour  l'Industrie) with the support and the guarantees of the  ADEME (Agence de lEnvironnement et de la Matrise de  lEnergie), the Alsace Region and SAF Environment.  Even after the factory has drawn the energy it needs, the  water will still be at a temperature of 70C when it exits  the site. This means it can be used for greenhouses or  other purposes. In this way, this project offers tremendous  potential for the further development of the local economy.  An abundant resource   for the planet Transforming subterranean rock into a thermal exchanger would  provide the planet with a practically unlimited source of energy.  In coming decades, global energy demand is expected to soar  inexorably. Fossil fuels that pollute the atmosphere with carbon  dioxide (CO2) will no longer be able to meet this surging demand.  It is therefore vital to find new sources of energy that are preferably  non-polluting and renewable. Geothermal energy from hot, fractured rock is a potential solution to  this planetary challenge. Underground rock is continuously heated  by the thermal flows of our planet. At a depth of 40 km below the  earths crust, the temperatures reach 1,000C. We are living atop an  energy stock that is practically infinite. To understand just what this means, 1 km3 of rock cooled to just 20C  liberates as much thermal energy as the combustion of 1,275,000  tons of petrol!

Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 41 A CULTURE THAT RESPECTS THE ENVIRONMENT  I Continuous improvement Creating value from bio-CO2 The Beinheim site (France) each year generates 100,000  tons of CO2 of plant-based origin released during alcoholic  fermentation in the production of bio-ethanol.  Instead of immediately releasing it into the atmosphere,  the CO2 is now purified and liquefied in a new unit  constructed at the Beinheim site by Carboheim (a  subsidiary of the Belgian group ACP), which started  operations in 2011.  It can be used as a substitute for CO2 of fossil origin in  different applications. For example, it can be used as an  additive in carbonated beverages or as an accelerator for  growing vegetables in greenhouses. Taking samples for Quality Control during the reception of wood to feed the biomass  boiler at Beinheim (France). The straw boiler at the Calafat factory (Romania) will reduce its dependence on fossil  fuels Biomass energy from wood:  The second investment for the production of thermal  energy at the Beinheim site was launched at the end of  2011: a boiler fueled by wood biomass.  As with the geothermal project, the biomass system also  benefits from the support of the ADEME. This installation  provides more than 50% of the sites steam needs and each  year will save 29,000 toe (tons of oil equivalent) in gas and  75,000 tons of fossil CO2 per year. Annual consumption represents 150,000 tons of wood- energy produced locally within an average radius of 100  km. The sourcing of the combustible wood has been  validated as sustainable by the regional authorities. It is  made up of logs, branches and wood chips from forests,  saw mills and other sources.  The installation for combustion is equipped with a filter to  respect strict dust emissions standards and to recover the  calories.  "Our biomass project helps reinforce  the local ecosystem, with numerous  partners and suppliers of agricultural  raw materials via this   new sourcing of wood."    Clment ROBERT, Director of the Beinheim site (France) A straw boiler at the Calafat site The Calafat site (Romania) has also launched a biomass  project with a boiler fueled by straw, scheduled to be  operational in spring 2012.  Until now, the Romanian unit has been completely  dependent on fuel oil for its energy. This investment will  slash its fuel oil requirements by about 75%. The boiler will be fed a few tons of wheat straw per hour.  The boiler will also be compatible with other types of  cellulose, such as corn stalks. It will be equipped with the  latest technologies to obtain a quality of smoke that has  little impact on the environment and is compatible with  the environmental standards of the country. To secure its sourcing for straw, contracts have already  been signed with the local farmers, who also supply our  corn, thus reinforcing our ties with these partners.   Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 42 The Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is an indispensable tool for  sustainable development. It determines a products total  impact on the environment throughout its life cycle. The  objective of an LCA is to find ways to reduce this impact  wherever possible. Roquette started with an internal study of its products.  The methodology and tools for calculation were based  on current standards and guidelines for good practices.  This study provided results for some 20 product families  (glucose syrup, powdered Sorbitol, etc.) PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was called in to audit the  work. Following the audit, an assurance opinion was issued  by PwC, certifying that the methodology conformed with  the ISO 14040/44 standard and the results conformed to  the approach developed. The results obtained are being used in the context of  Roquettes policies of continuous improvement and  reduction of the environmental impact of the enterprise, in  response to the demands of our customers.  The Roquette Group has also participated in a study led  by the Association des Amidonniers et Feculiers (AFF), the  European starch producers association, with the help of a  company that specializes in LCA. Expected for mid-2012,  the results of this new study will be based on average  production data from 12 European starch producers and  more than 30 production sites.     The ANTARES approach: "Doing what we  already know better" ANTARES is our program for continuous improvement. It  seeks to find solutions around four main pillars – technical,  social, organizational and economic – and involves all  actors in the enterprise. When it was launched in 2010, this program targeted just  the production units, but today it has been extended to the  business functions, such as Purchasing and Engineering. Below are a few examples of results from the ANTARES  program: At the Lestrem site (France), it is necessary to clean a starch  dryer each time the product in the circuit is changed. This  task, which used to take up to 13 hours a week to perform,  has been completely revised according to the Single  Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) method. Now, eight hours     Life Cycle Analysis  Through such efforts, starch producers are working  together to develop a common approach and methodology  to determine the environmental impact in areas most  pertinent to the industry.  The current study will provide  LCA data for some 20 product families. The methodology  used by Roquette for its work is fully compliant with that  developed by the European starch industry. LIFE CYCLE   ANALYSIS A CULTURE THAT RESPECTS THE ENVIRONMENT  I Continuous improvement  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 43 Infrared spectroscopy, a tool to reduce the impact on  the environment   Near Infra Red (NIR) spectroscopy is a technique for  physical-chemical analysis that has been used for over  a quarter century at Roquette to control the quality of  products. This alternative technology has the advantage of being  non-destructive and can be performed without chemicals.  Safety is improved and the impact on the environment  The Process Studies Department prepares for the future During the design and development of new processes, the  Roquette Group studies ways to reduce the consumption  of water and energy.  The strategy of the Process Studies Dept. is to prepare for  the future. For this, the choice of new processes is based  on new technologies that require less treatment and less  waste. These new manufacturing processes naturally tend to rely  on what are known as "disruptive" technologies, i.e.  radically  different innovations that replace existing technologies.  These studies are done at the start of the project.    Innovative technologies, more respectful  of the environment Jean-Christophe CAILLIAU, Environmental Control & Analysis Dept., Lestrem (France).  NIR spectroscopy serves to perform analyses without the use of chemicals. "The involvement of operators and managers  is the keystone for success with the ANTARES  approach. This is not limited to purely  technical aspects, which have been the priority  up to now; it extends to the organizational,  economic and social aspects, such as   working conditions."  Franck MORALY, Director of the Group Industrial Performance Project per week is sufficient. The ultimate objective is to bring this  down to five hours. Optimizing this operation represents a major financial  gain for the enterprise because of the reduced cleaning  times and the concurrent increase in productivity. It also  represents a real benefit in terms of improved working  conditions. For example, the operators movements  through the workshop to complete the cleaning operation  have been halved (fewer steps to go up and down) and  certain manual tasks have now been automated.  In the Sweeteners unit at the Benifayo site (Spain),  displaying the daily pollution indicator in the workshop  has encouraged the personnel to get more involved and  take responsibility. The end result has been a significant  drop in emissions. The reduction of more than 1,600 tons  of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) recorded in 2011  also represents a big drop in energy consumption at the  station. The operator of the treatment station is responsible  for updating the indicator and participates in the TOP 5  meeting (see page 49), providing ideas for improvements.  Teamwork is reinforced, with better reactivity of operators  and managers.  is reduced. Very easy to use, NIR spectroscopy allows  operators who are not lab experts to perform frequent  analyses. This information helps optimize manufacturing  circuits and reduce the consumption of energy and  ingredients.  Throughout 2011, the Quality Control Dept. at the Lestrem  site (France) has accelerated the development of such  projects. With the help of a student intern (see interview  page 50), this has made it possible to handle more of the  many requests for analyses from the different production  units of the site and to provide technical advice to the other  Quality Control laboratories of the Group regarding the  choice of equipment. A CULTURE THAT RESPECTS THE ENVIRONMENT  I Continuous improvement  Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 44    Reducing the impact of our logistics activity Reducing the environmental impact of the logistics chain  is a clear objective in the fight against climate change.  For this, the Roquette Group favors alternative transport  methods combined with optimize loads for trucks. Alternative solutions to road transport The Roquette Group is committed to making available  innovative solutions that are respectful of the environment.  It develops alternative methods to road transport, such as  river or rail transport, as well as combined transport. For example, the usage rate of combined transport with  road/rail/roll-on & roll-off ship (*) in relation to road  transport departing from the Cassano site (Italy) has  increased considerably in recent years. It reached nearly  28% in 2011, compared with less than 22% in 2007.  These sustainable transport methods respond to the three  pillars of sustainable development:  -  In economic terms, the market prices for these methods  remain competitive with road transport;  -  Environmentally, they use less energy and produce fewer  greenhouse gas emissions;  -  Socially, they present a lower risk of accidents.   - (*) roll-on/roll-off ship: ship used to transport loaded trucks and other         vehicles, with one or more access ramps.  Optimizing the load factor of trucks In terms of logistics, one of the major challenges for the  Group is reducing the number of trucks on the road. This  requires improving the load rate of trucks while respecting  the regulations in application. In Spain, for example, optimization has led to:  -  a 60% reduction in unfilled quantities for bulk liquid  tankers  - an increase of more than 3% in the loaded quantity of  bulk powders.  These improvements are the result of precise tracking  of loads by operators and the extensive deployment of  optimization tools throughout the Group. These tools  make it easy to identify the optimal load, according to the  products and the pallet sizes. In France since 18 January 2011, the agrofood sector has  been authorized to use trucks of 44 tons with five axles.  The Roquette Group has worked with its main partners to  promote the use of this type of truck. The initial results are  very encouraging in terms of optimization, notably for bulk  liquid where the load rate has been improved by about 10%.  River transport is a sustainable alternative transport method. Historically, the Roquette  Group has sought to locate its factories close to rivers.  For its customers in the animal nutrition sector, the Roquette  Group has moved towards alternative methods to road transport,  notably for proteins, fibers and oils, which represent a considerable  volume of goods. The development of river and rail transport has helped reduce our  carbon footprint, as well as to offer our clientele an innovative res- ponse to their demands. Today, nearly 400,000 tons of products per  year are transported to our customers in animal nutrition by river  and/or rail from our sites of Lestrem and Beinheim (France). A new river terminal for the Lestrem site Barges and trains to serve customers In partnership with the Artois Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  the Roquette Group actively supports the Navigable Waterways  of France, with the construction of a terminal for loading and  unloading cereals and products for animal nutrition at the port of  Bethune, which is close to the Lestrem site (France). This terminal  gives the Group access to the future channel of Seine-Nord, and to its  cereal storage platforms as well as those of the sea port of Dunkirk.  The installations at the port of Bethune allow the enterprise to  significantly improve the safety, quality and productivity of its river  transport operations. A CULTURE THAT RESPECTS THE ENVIRONMENT  I Continuous improvement  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 45 ECO-CITIZEN INITIATIVES Whether in eco-citizen actions, developing technologies  that are more economical, or debating ideas on sustainable  development, the Roquette Group actively supports  collective or individual initiatives that seek to reduce our  impact on the environment.      Virtualization and electronic exchange in  the service of sustainable development The Roquette Group has invested in Information and  Communication Technologies (ICT) that help protect the  environment by reducing the need to use paper, ink and  physical storage space. In addition to generating less  waste, these technologies of virtualization and electronic  exchange also offer economic and other practical benefits. Exchange of electronic data The Groups first Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system  was set up in 1999. This channel for transmitting information  has been progressively deployed at a large number of  our stakeholders (customers, carriers, suppliers, banks,  Customs offices). While paper invoices are still required,  electronic data exchange is developing fast today thanks  to new fiscal legislation on virtual data in many countries.  To date, 20% of our customer invoices are transmitted by  EDI, i.e. without paper. Associating the customer to the reduction of paper printouts Since 2010, others vectors for communication with our  customers have been put in place. For example, we now  offer customers a catalogue of services for sending  invoices. From sending a paper invoice with one copy  maximum, to sending it by e-mail with or without paper,  or making invoices available via a Web portal, we offer our  customers a number of ways to reduce paper printouts.  This also extends to other documents such as certificates of  analyses and delivery notifications, for which e-mail is now  the general method of transmission. In 2011, nearly 60,000  certificates of analyses were sent via the Internet from our  European and American subsidiaries.  Virtualization of centralized printing The printing of management reports consumes a  particularly large amount of paper. These can be  virtualized on a computer file that is stored on digital  media and managed for the period during which they  must be retained. In practice, the user can consult the  necessary document from his or her workstation and print  only the relevant parts needed.  This good practice, already in place in Italy and the USA, is  currently being deployed in France. It has already helped  save 2.3 million sheets of A4 paper. An exceptional meeting between Lester Brown and Marc Roquette.    The recycling of mobile phones At the end of their life, mobile phones pose a real threat to  the environment when they are thrown out or lost because  they contain polluting materials. To reduce this ecological  impact, they need to be recycled. At Roquettes four French  sites, mobile phones are regularly collected for recycling  through the association GREENPHONE, in partnership with  an enterprise of social insertion that helps people find jobs.  Thanks to these collection drives, some 800 used mobile  phones, both personal and professional, have been recycled.  This eco-citizen initiative has also provided a jobless person  employment for 10 months.    Participating in debates to raise awareness In September 2011, Marc Roquette participated in a  "Debate on Exceptional Ideas" in Lille (France). The event  was organized by the Center for Young Directors, in honor  of Lester Brown on the occasion of the release of his latest  book "World on the Edge". This agro-economist is a research  pioneer on sustainable development and has been named  by the international press as one of the 100 most influential  people in the world.  A few key points from Marc Roquettes presentation: "Lester Brown raises consciousness without being an  extremist (...) His work restores hope and offers solutions.  The latter are the fruit of amazing advances in technology  (...) Each year, 300 million tons of petroleum products are  used in factories for organic chemistry. But starch can  also be used to obtain certain products that are currently  produced with fossil resources."

S ince its creation, the Roquette Group has based its success and  development on the professional engagement of its people and their  commitment to the enterprise. In parallel, each entity within the group is  anchored in its territory and is engaged with the local community.     Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 48 A SOCIAL AND SOCIETAL CULTURE  I Building a career at Roquette EMPLOYEES AS ACTORS OF THE ENTERPRISE The Roquette Groups culture is profoundly based on the human dimension. Our values  of Respect, Trust, Solidarity, and our principles of action –  Innovation, Passion for the  job and Commitment to achieve – can only exist through the commitment and actions  of each member of the group. To involve each employee in the development of the  enterprise, we rely on a strong and structured Human Resources policy that embraces  the diversity of our economic and social environment.    Seniority and loyalty rewarded   The Roquette Group believes in the importance of  employees who contribute every day to the life and  development of the enterprise. Generations come and go,  but the spirit of the enterprise remains fundamentally the  same: a spirit of respect, trust and solidarity. The Group is highly committed to its employees, and the  same holds true in return for the employees, who year  after year show their loyalty to the enterprise. As proof, the  average level of employee seniority for the Group is more  than 12 years, and even higher for the older sites in France,  Spain and Italy. The year 2011 was marked by the 10th anniversary  of Roquettes industrial presence in Asia. Nearly 120  employees received recognition and awards for their loyalty  to the enterprise since it began industrial operations in  China in 2001. It is interesting to note that for all companies  implanted in China, employee turnover is statistically high  and average seniority relatively low. We can therefore be  very proud of the loyalty of our employees at our Asian  sites.  BUILDING A CAREER AT ROQUETTE "Roquette has a higher sense of  ethics than my previous employer."  (Japan) "The spirit of a family business  remains present and provides a  feeling of safety." (France) "Its long-term strategic approach,  combined with its transformation  program, gives it confidence in the  new challenges for the future."  (Finland)  Diversity  is  respected  and  encouraged, I can offer my opinion,  work autonomously and make  decisions." (USA) "This is a family business, with  strong solidarity and an appetite  for innovation. Its values and its  practices make me want to work here  for a long time." (China) "This is a multicultural enterprise,  with an international presence that  allows me to be in contact with  people in other countries." (Mexico) "A solid enterprise with a relaxed  working atmosphere." (Germany) I like to work at Roquette  because I believe in the companys  values, which are reflected in  its commitment to quality, its  range of products, innovation and  responsibility towards people and  natural resources." (Indonesia) "Each day is unique and offers  new challenges, with the ability to  rely on colleagues who share their  knowledge and help us to give the  best of ourselves." (UK) "The enterprise is sensitive to social  issues, close to its people, attentive to  their needs and their safety at work."  (Italy) "An international company with  working conditions that are more  advantageous than those at local  companies." (Turkey) "A Group that promotes a spirit of  cooperation, a sense of engagement  and satisfaction in its sphere of  influence." (India) "The high quality of the people  who work here helps me to learn  every day, and helps me to develop  both personally and professionally."  (Spain) OUR EMPLOYEES SPEAK OUT What differentiates ROQUETTE from other companies   and what motivates you to work there?   A sampling of responses from our employees Roquette Asia employees who have been with the company for 10 years were honored  with a giant wall display composed of their photos as a testimony to the companys  gratitude for their contribution to the development of the Roquette Group.     Promoting career development Employees have the possibility to develop their skills  throughout their career, not only in their current sectors but  in other areas of the business as well. Each year, numerous  employees benefit from training programs. An employee  in production wants to try out purchasing? No problem! An  IT technician wants to move to sales? Thats possible, too !  This allows for a real mix of populations. The enterprise  listens to its employees, who can at any time express their  ambitions, their projects or their desire to switch jobs or  develop their careers.  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 49 A SOCIAL AND SOCIETAL CULTURE  I Developing our managerial culture and anticipating needs in skills ANTICIPATING NEEDS IN SKILLS    Accompaniment adapted to all phases of  professional life Different types of career assistance are proposed to  employees of the Roquette Group in all the regions and  at any time in their professional career. Two new initiatives  have been put in place.    Mobilizing the management, a source of  efficiency In a world where change is constant, the ability to mobilize  all members of the company represents an essential  strength. To this end, managers meet at various occasions to  develop a global vision of the enterprise, share information  and work on transversal themes.  - The "Senior Management Meetings" (SMM) bring  together the Roquette Groups senior managers twice  a year at Group level and in each of the regions (Asia,  America and Europe).  - The "Horizon" meetings gather all the managers at a site  to review the major events and key figures of the past  year, and to share the strategy and the vision of the  enterprise.  DEVELOPING OUR MANAGERIAL CULTURE "During the TOP 5, we discuss what went well   and above all what did not function correctly.   The idea is to make progress,   to always improve our daily jobs."   Jrmie DESFOSSEZ, Bagger (Lestrem - France) Senior Management Meetings are an important moment for top managers to share  the global vision of the enterprise.    Listening and sharing with employees Communication in the production units has always existed.  As part of our continuous improvement program, dialogue  between employees has been reinforced with special  management meetings called TOP 5 and TOP 15.  The TOP 5 end-of-shift meeting is a special moment during  which the operators and the shift supervisor meet for 5  minutes before the end of their shift.  This exchange serves  to discuss, consolidate and analyze the results obtained  during the shift, notably in terms of productivity, quality and  safety. In the same spirit, the Top 15 are 15-minute meetings  organized for the day shift, when the day supervisor and the  teams discuss operations and the overall functioning of the  workshop. Distribution of the workforce of French sites by age The first initiative seeks to develop "Ppins" (young  potentials), i.e. to hire young graduates and tailor a special  orientation for them. Through different missions, they will  learn the objectives, the challenges and the fundamentals  of their future job while discovering others business areas of  the enterprise. Multiple technical and managerial training  programs are also available. Each "Ppin" is followed by a  mentor who defines and monitors their missions and by a  reference contact with whom they can discuss and share.  They are assigned to their definitive post at the end of 18  months at one of the Groups sites. The second initiative concerns "Seniors" in France. These  are employees aged 45 and over, who represent 43% of  the workforce. The senior action plan seeks to anticipate  the development of professional careers. Thus, each senior  who so desires can request an interview on the second  part of his or her career. This is a chance to examine their  professional career, their desires and the opportunities for  internal mobility and talent development. 57% 16% 13% 14% < 45 years old  Ages 45 to 49  Ages 50 to 54  Ages 55 and over  Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 50 30 43 57 14 20 22 22 24 23 Asia America Europe A SOCIAL AND SOCIETAL CULTURE  I  Reinforcing the diversity of profiles Sustainable development means encouraging diversity  and fighting discrimination in all its forms. The diversity of  teams, in terms of age or social, ethnic or cultural origin, is  a source of great richness and constitutes a fundamental  objective of social policy.    Promoting international mobility  In 2011, the number of expatriates moving from American  and Asian regions to France increased significantly. An  expatriate mission has several objectives: to establish the  Groups procedures and working methods following new  acquisitions, to transmit the "Roquette culture" to the new  employees, and to train a local replacement at the end of  the expatriates mission.  Some 20 employees were involved in this type of mobility  in 2011, not counting those who accepted foreign missions  of shorter duration. REINFORCING  THE DIVERSITY OF PROFILES    The transmission of knowledge:  training in  internship Apprenticeships can be a great way for young people  to begin their careers, but they are also an excellent  opportunity – and a challenge – for the enterprise. Indeed,  it is a way to prepare for the companys future needs by  transferring knowledge and know-how and by integrating  and developing new skills. Bringing in young people with  internship contracts is a way to participate in their training,  to teach them the business and to integrate them into the  life and culture of the enterprise at which they may one  day be hired. In this context, 12 interns were invited to the  Lestrem site (France) in 2011.    Training to optimize skills For the Roquette Group, developing the skills of its  employees is a strategic objective.  Each year, the Group devotes a budget of several million  euros to training.  Training is based on two fundamental principles:  - Equal opportunity: all employees of the Group must be  given the chance to participate in training programs to  develop their skills;  - Pertinence: the enterprise establishes training programs  that respond to its immediate or future needs for skills. Each site deploys its own training program on the themes  of its choice. For example, Roquette Russia has developed  training programs on the acquisition and development  of communication skills. In Asia, training focused on the  reinforcement of managerial skills. In the USA, the priority  was given to safety.  This important investment in skill optimization serves to  prepare for the companys future and the businesses of  tomorrow. An internship is an interesting bridge between school and    the professional world                     Justine FRANCOIS, Apprentice Lab Technician at Lestrem (France) What is the context for your mission at Roquette? After an internship of 10 weeks to obtain my technical  diploma in Chemistry, I was given the chance to  continue my experience at the Quality Control Dept.  of Lestrem. I am now proud to have been offered a  professional contract in preparation for a professional  degree in "Processes in chemistry and sustainable  development" at the University of Lille.  What was this experience like, and what did it  give you? I feel well integrated into the enterprise and I  work in a good atmosphere. Professionally, it is an  opportunity to discover a lot of techniques and acquire  a lot of knowledge in the domain of spectroscopy.  My  colleagues want to share their experience with me  and in return, my ambition is to provide them with  new ideas.  What is your view of internship and how do you    see your future? Internship is a really interesting bridge between  school and the professional world, which, in my  opinion, must continue to be developed.  I hope to be able to put my training to good use and to  continue my experience at this company, working on  the environment.

Since 1998, she has suffered from a  visual deficiency, a problem that has been aggravated over time. After a few years coming to terms with her physical challenge, and with the help  of Roquettes medical-social services, she filed with the MDPH (Maison Dparte- mentale des Personnes Handicapes) to be  recognized as a worker with a phy- sical challenge, a status known in France by the acronym RQTH. Her dossier was  accepted in 2009. Since then, things have moved fast: an ergonomics specialist redesigned her  workstation, with some special touches such as software to zoom in on text, a por- table magnifying glass, a big computer monitor, and specially adapted lighting.  These modifications were co-financed by Roquette and the AGEFIPH (Association  de gestion du fonds pour linsertion des personnes handicapes). She also benefits from assistance for mobility. An association makes available to  her a car and driver to take her to and from work. "Being physically challenged is difficult to accept in the beginning, Catherine  says. Above all, it is the way others look at you that makes you feel less worthy. I  have adapted my life to my physical challenge. I learned a lot about myself, and  today I take things in perspective. I can do things I would never have dreamed I  could do, and in the end, this test has made me stronger. * to respect her desire for anonymity, we are not using her real name                                        Employing a person who is physically   or mentally challenged Have you observed any changes in the way the  physically or mentally challenged are perceived at  Roquette? ML: At the Lestrem site, over the last two years we have  observed an increase in requests for formal recogni- tion as a worker with a physical or mental challenge,  or RQTH. The various actions taken to raise awareness  have allowed us to demystify the physically or mentally  challenged.  A lot remains to be done but we do not  want to apply pressure on such a serious subject.   What are the blocking points? ID: Reticence, fear of taking that step to request RQTH.  We assist the employee in returning to their job, if there  was a break, as well as in the administrative steps or  in personal matters. We develop a relationship of trust.  What are the results in terms of employment? ML: 100% of employees who are physically or mentally  challenged have remained employed, sometimes with,  depending on the case, a change or adaptation of the  job. The qualifications are never revised. ID: We act exclusively in the interest of the employee.  The earlier the reflection, the more effective the  approach. Is monitoring reinforced for workers who are  physically or mentally challenged? ML: The doctor is free to set the frequency of visits.  There is no need to reinforce follow-up if the modifi- cations have gone well. But our door always remains  open.

In Spain, a campaign to raise awareness has also been  launched at Benifayo. In the context of support provided  each year to a local association, people with physical or  mental challenges have been invited to the site. A large  panel of employees from different departments at the site  participated in this meeting, which was considered by all  parties involved as a particularly enriching and gratifying  exchange. The ambition has been expressed to renew the  operation in 2012, around new activities. The association for disabled persons "SOM I ESTEM" visiting the site of Benifayo (Spain).  The objectives of SACHa for 2012: To increase efficiency and be even more proactive, the  SACHa group will now be organized in four sub-groups,  each in charge of developing one of the four axes defined  in the groups mission, by implementing action plans on  the following objectives:  - Informing and raising awareness about the physically or  mentally challenged within the enterprise (creation of a  dedicated Intranet site),  - Maintaining the employment of employees with physical  or mental challenges (by adapting their workstations, for  example),   - Opening more recruitment of the physically or mentally  challenged,  - Continuing the collaboration with partners that  specialize in helping disabled persons. Frdric Smagghe, Polyols Unit Director, and Thierry Leroy, HR Manager (Lestrem,  France). On the occasion of the National Week for the Employment of the Disabled 2011,  the SACHa group invited the French employees to take part in activities and events in  which they could place themselves in the position of a disabled person. "We must continue to progress.   We must all act to ensure that the  support and integration of the  physically or mentally challenged is  an even greater reality for tomorrow".    The SACHa Group  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 53 A SOCIAL AND SOCIETAL CULTURE  I  Sharing a meaningful  project    Communication to accompany growth  Our communication needs to be ever more structured and  our messages and actions must be clear and coherent, both  externally and internally. To this end, numerous actions are  engaged and regularly renewed. The Group Communication Plan, a perfect example of  collaborative work Communication plays a key role in the Groups development  and strategy. Given the broad range of communication actions, the  Group has established a Communication Committee to  oversee external and internal communication to ensure a  common and coherent approach. The latter has developed  a Group Communication Plan, linking all communication  actions from the different management units and regions  to precise communication objectives in line with the  Groups strategy. The result of significant collaborative work, the Group  Communication Plan coordinates communication on an  ever more numerous and varied set of subjects as well as  on the ever increasing demands from our stakeholders  (employees, customers, partners, the media, etc.). This  approach allows all the management units to share a  structured and formalized vision. It has also created a very  dynamic relationship between all the actors involved in  communication. "We evolve at great speed in this era of  communication. The key words of this  new era and the key success factors  are: creation, dialogue, being open to  everything, working collaboratively with  multiple partners."     Marc ROQUETTE, Chairman SHARING A MEANINGFUL PROJECT The integration seminar is an important time for new managers to discover the Roquette  culture.    The importance of on-boarding All new employees benefit from an orientation program  to help them start their new job. This can take different  forms, depending on the site, region, business sector or  responsibilities of the new arrival. The objective is to:  -  Introduce new employees to the companys culture,  values and principles of action, its Ethics Charter and its  Code of Conduct,  -  Give them the tools they need to understand what is  expected of them in their new job,  -  Monitor their integration to ensure the respect of the  companys rules on hygiene, quality, safety and security.    Listening and encouraging dialogue   Dialoguing with the social partners Ratification of a new labor contract at Keokuk (USA) On 23 July 2011, Roquette America and the local labor  union ratified a new labor contract at Keokuk, thus ending  a lock-out that began at the end of September 2010 after  the two parties failed to reach agreement on the new  contract.  As a result of the breakthrough, more than 200 members  from the local union were once again able to head back to  the factory after a week of safety training. The new labor contract was the result of negotiations on  developing the skills and expertise of each employee, with  the goal to continuously improve Industrial Performance.  Another objective is to promote teamwork and cooperation,  while contributing to a work environment that is peaceful,  productive and secure. Several actions have been put in place to improve  collaboration and communication, to establish a culture  of change based on trust, to share values, to promote the  exchange of ideas and discuss problems and solutions.  Regular meetings between the management and the local  union are organized to promote and facilitate exchanges  and sustainably reestablish the social dialogue. For example, French-speaking managers who are newly  hired or promoted take part in an Integration Seminar at  Lestrem (France). This gives them a transversal vision of the  different functions and business sectors of the enterprise  as well as its organization.  Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 54 Gender equality at Roquette In France, the management and the labor unions in  2011 worked together on a formal agreement on gender  equality at the workplace. The objective is to reaffirm the  principles of equality and define the priorities for action. In Spain, guaranteeing the equality of men and women  in terms of working conditions and remuneration  constitutes the main objective of the gender equality plan  implemented at the Benifayo site. The plant was awarded  the "SELLO DIGUALDAD" ("label of equality") for the second  consecutive year, in recognition of its social engagement. The labor union of the Lianyungang site in action... The labor union of Roquette China was launched in 2006.  It plays a key role in maintaining harmonious working  relations and protecting the rights of employees. Its main  actions include:   -  Maintaining balanced relations between the personnel  and the enterprise, and helping to resolve any conflicts;  -  Developing an innovative spirit among the personnel  and  promoting creativity (organization of challenges  and competitions);  -  Organizing professional training programs on themes  such as knowledge of chemistry, raising awareness on  safety, or foreign languages;  -  Reinforcing communication to enable the enterprise to  listen to its employees;  -  Monitoring working conditions, hygiene and health.  As a reward for all these actions, the labor union of Roquette  China received the distinction of "Municipal Advanced  Unit" from the local government. Listening to employees In order to develop a culture of dialogue, Roquette  has deployed a number of initiatives to listen to what  employees have to say. "Pulse", a survey at Group level The objective of this survey is to assist the Groups ongoing  transformation by regularly measuring the evolution  of working methods and employee expectations. A  representative sample of employees chosen at random  from throughout the Roquette Group was sent an  electronic survey to ascertain their concerns and identify  opportunities for improvement.  Among the 740 employees contacted, 60% responded to  the survey. The findings confirmed:   - Their motivation, their strong level of engagement, their  confidence in the capacity of the Group to attain its  objectives,  - A heavy workload and difficulty to discern priorities. The roundtables have spoken! The ambition to listen to employees and gauge perception  has led the Group to organize some 50 roundtable discussion  sessions, as well as individual interviews, at the Groups four  French sites.   More than 600 employees representing all areas of the  enterprise have thus freely expressed their thoughts with the  help of an external facilitator. The themes addressed include  the companys vision, its image, its current operations and  future development, the role of the employee, his/her  contribution and engagement, and the sense of reciprocity,  both as currently perceived and as desired. The results of these exchanges reveal a strong attachment  to the enterprise and to the Roquette family, and a positive  image of the company as a family business that is free and  independent, even if some concerns have been expressed  regarding its future evolution. The personnel appreciate  and recognize the strong human values of the company.  They are also open to change but express the need for  stronger involvement in the Groups projects. A document  summarizing the results of these roundtables has been  sent to each employee in France. An action plan is being  implemented to respond to the expectations expressed by  the employees.

At each of its sites throughout the world, the Group  is committed to offering its employees and subcontractors  a safe work environment. Accidents are never unavoidable,  and the primary objective is to protect the people with an  ultimate target of "zero accidents." The involvement of one and all: a necessity All employees can and must engage in individual or  collective actions to reduce the frequency of accidents.  The Groups good safety results come from the active  involvement of each and every member of the team.  This year, our safety "culture" has progressed thanks to the  role played by the managers and the safety committees  in the management of safety. The application of safety  management tools at all sites (safety audits, safety briefings,  assessments of accidents and near misses, etc.) and the  networks of safety facilitators have helped reinforce this  positive trend.  The first Group safety meeting took place in November 2011  at the site of Keokuk (USA). This meeting was an opportunity  to share good practices and unveil the Groups new objective  for accidents with lost time: TF1 inferior to 1 in 2016 (TF1  is the frequency rate corresponding to the number of  accidents with lost time per million hours worked). The annual safety week at the European sites In 2011, a coordinated action on pain prevention, called  "Handling, Ergonomics and Well-being at Work," was  deployed at all European sites. The objective is to raise  awareness about the important role each employee plays  in safety and risk prevention. The action focused on four  key values of safety: professionalism, the involvement  of each employee, leading by example, and recognition.  This action was successfully followed by the European  Learning the acts that can save lives: a demonstration during the safety week at Benifayo  (Spain).

The development of a safety culture in the USA New actions have been put in place at the Groups  American sites to improve safety results and meet the new  challenge set for 2016. All managers of Roquette America  have participated in a two-and-a-half day training program  to raise awareness, take responsibility and commit to safety  performance. Every employee, whether at home, at work,  or traveling, must ask three questions: What do I plan to do  today? Are there any safety risks? If yes, what precautions  must I take? This brief checklist must allow the individual  to do their job without risk to their safety. A new slogan has  been posted at the two American production sites: "Safety  first in every action we take No one gets hurt today!"   At the end of 2011, the rate of accidents with lost time  was zero at the American sites of Gurnee and Keokuk. An important fire drill at Lianyungang (China) To test the capacity to manage a fire, the fire brigades of  Jiangsu province conducted a major simulation exercise  at the Lianyungang site.

China Roquette Asia is continuing its partnership with the Shanghai Association of  Apprentice Bakers, which helps orphans and disadvantaged young people  to train to become bakers. The company provides financial support for the  equipment of the training center and supplies Roquette products for use in  the training practice.  It also sponsors the Shanghai "Charity Carnival" dedicated to the Childrens  Health Foundation, which helps children afflicted with congenital heart  disease to live normal lives. Spain To promote the benefits of sports, the Benifayo site organized a bicycle  race that attracted more than 400 professionals, amateurs and Roquette  employees. The factory served as both the point of departure and the  finish line for the race, called the "Marcha Cicioturista La Ribera – Roquette."  Group Following the catastrophic consequences of the earthquake that struck  Japan on 11 March 2011, all of the Roquette Groups sites mobilized to  collect funds for humanitarian associations such as the Japanese Red Cross  and to pledge support  for their Japanese colleagues. USA Helping people in financial difficulty, promoting education and health,  these are among the objectives of "Big River United Way", a local community  group in Keokuk to which the employees of Roquette America provide  extensive financial support.

Numerous employees from the Beinheim site participated in the Brumath  races for the benefit of the Telethon. For the sixth consecutive year, the employees of Lestrem, Vic-sur-Aisne  and Vecquemont have turned out in droves to represent Roquette at the  Testathlon, a sports event organized by DigestScience (see page 27). Germany Roquette Germany provides financial support to a charity organization  in Frankfurt that helps the physically or mentally challenged to develop  their lives in their environment. Rooms made available by the city were  adapted to serve as special day-care centers. India Roquette India provides financial support to "VIDYA", a non-governmental  organization that assists disadvantaged women and children in the  regions of Delhi and Mumbai.   Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 58 5 EVALUATION  AND PERFORMANCE Carlos CLIMENT RUTIA, Operator at the Benifayo site (Spain)  F or the past four years, the Roquette Group has formalized its engagement  in Corporate Social Responsibility by publishing an annual report on  sustainable development, by signing the United Nations Global Compact  and by reinforcing its commitment to improve the quality of its products and  the protection of its know-how. This year, it has adopted the methods of the  Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) to review and reinforce its indicators.  Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 60 EVALUATION AND PERFORMANCE  I Our approach to progress OUR APPROACH TO PROGRESS IN QUALITY, SECURITY  AND RISK MANAGEMENT Under its new policy on Safety, Quality, Security and the Environment deployed in  2011, the Roquette Group does everything it can to satisfy its customers and develop its  activity in the most secure and sustainable manner possible. Its approach to progress  extends from the quality of its products to the protection of its intellectual property, all  the while managing risk.      Improving quality  Improving satisfaction in the handling of complaints As part of its program to improve the customer relationship,  the Roquette Group has engaged in a major study to  improve the way it handles complaints. A working group has been established, with members  specializing in quality, logistics and sales from the different  regions, to review good practices and reconsider the  system for managing complaints in order to provide  better assistance to customers and improve their level of  satisfaction.  The basic objective is to develop a dynamic and harmonized  system of practices throughout the Group that can be  implemented rapidly and efficiently in 2012.  A commitment to quality to ensure the safety of food  products In line with the Roquette Groups strategy on quality, the  ISO 9001 and ISO 22000 standards have been deployed  at the majority of the Groups production sites. The  application of these standards has led to the renewal  of the corresponding certifications or the accreditation  of FSSC 22000 certification on food safety. The respect  of these standards is formalized by the renewal of the  corresponding certificates. In addition, certain sites have  obtained certification under the FSSC 22000 guidelines.  Here are a few examples: In England, with the implementation of the new process  at the Corby site (see page 39), several studies have been  completed to revalidate compliance in terms of food safety  (method: HACCP Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point). Thanks to this approach, the Corby site received FSSC 22000  certification. This now provides our customers, who are  primarily English, with assurance of control over product  safety comparable to that provided by certification from  the British Retail Consortium (BRC), for example.  In the USA, the Gurnee site is actively preparing for  the renewal of its ISO 22000 certification in view of its  qualification for FSSC 22000 certification in the spring  of 2012. The Gurnee site (USA), already certified ISO 22000, is engaged in the approach for  FSSC 22000 certification Safety certification for animal feed In addition to GMP+B2 certification, which for several  years has already covered the sites of Lestrem (France),  Vecquemont (France) and Cassano (Italy), European Feed  Ingredients Safety Certification (EFISC) was delivered in  2011 to these same sites, in light of their activity in animal  nutrition. A voluntary approach to certify our production of  bioethanol The Beinheim site (France) has received 2BSvs certification  (Biomass Biofuels Sustainability Voluntary Scheme) for the  production of bioethanol from sustainable biomass (wheat  and corn). This  certification  demonstrates,  via  independent  verification, the respect of the sustainability criteria set  forth in the European Directive 2009/28/CE, a directive  on promoting use of energy produced from renewable  sources. "75% of the Roquette Groups sites are  certified safe for food products. The objective  is FSSC 22000 certification for all our sites"    Xavier DURIEZ, Group Quality Manager  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 61 EVALUATION AND PERFORMANCE  I  Our approach to progress    Protecting our interests   In a tough economic climate where innovation, expertise,  prudence and boldness are critical to a companys survival,  the protection of the Roquette Groups interests against  malicious acts is indispensable. Stealing information or assets, extortion of funds, identity  theft, cybercrime – these are just some of the challenges  for the Groups security management system. To prevent is to protect, and to plan is to progress! To this end, a multi-disciplinary working group has been  established to review security, develop expertise and align  our practices at all the Roquette Groups sites. The working group seeks to position the security of the  enterprises interests, its viability and its development  by implementing rules, tools and a campaign to raise  awareness.    Managing operational risks   For more than four years, a Risks Committee has brought  together directors from the subsidiaries and from the  regions of America, Asia and the REC (Roquette Emerging  Countries) as well as the directors of the support functions  to oversee the management of risks within all the entities  and management units of the Roquette Group. Among  other things, the committee assumes overall responsibility  for highly critical or transversal risks. This approach to risk management relies notably on an  annual updating of risk cartographies that identify all risks  within the organizations and that cover the operational  processes as well as the support functions. Assessed according to their frequency, their gravity  and their degree of control, the identification of major  operational risks can then give rise to action plans that can  be monitored in terms of prevention and protection. In this  way, the reduction of sources of risks and their intensity  (tangible and intangible) is also managed. The coverage and management of industrial risks and  responsibilities are organized jointly with the Groups  insurers and are measured according to level of protection:  HPR (Highly Protected Risk), PR (Protected Risk) and NP  (Non Protected Risk). The management team at the factory in Corby (UK) received certification as "Highly  Protected Risk on 17 June 2011. Protecting the companys heritage constitutes the main objective of the security system  implemented for the entire Roquette Group. The Lianyungang site (China) has been certified "Highly Protected Risk" since June 2011. "More than 50% of the Roquette Groups  production units benefit from classification as  a protected or highly protected risk, a figure  that rises to 60% for the installations   of Lestrem (France)."  Francis VAN DEN NESTE, Group Risk Manager   Roquette I Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 62 EVALUATION AND PERFORMANCE  I A responsible enterprise A RESPONSIBLE ENTERPRISE Launched in July 2000, the United Nations  Global Compact is a set of policies and a practical  framework for companies that have made a  commitment to sustainable development and  responsible business practices. It is not an instrument of regulation but rather  We need business to give practical meaning and reach to the values and principles that  connect cultures and people everywhere. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the United Nations a voluntary initiative for businesses, founded  on public responsibility, transparency and  information open to all. Since September 2009, the Roquette Group has  adhered to the United Nations Global Compact  and communicated its 10 general principles. By  respecting  these  10  principles, the Roquette Group  acts as a responsible corporate  citizen.  Examples  of  these  actions are marked with this  logo throughout the pages of  this report and indicate the  principle to which the action  corresponds. Businesses should make sure that  they are not complicit in human  rights abuses. 2 Businesses  should  support  and  respect  the  protection  of  internationally  proclaimed  human rights. 1 Businesses should uphold the  freedom of association and the  effective recognition of the right  to collective bargaining. 3 Businesses should support the  elimination of all forms of forced  and compulsory labor. 4 Businesses should support the  effective abolition of child labor. 5 Businesses should support the  elimination of discrimination  in respect of employment and  occupation. 6 Businesses should support a  precautionary  approach  to  environmental challenges. 7 Businesses should undertake  initiatives to promote greater  environmental responsibility. 8 Businesses should work against  corruption in all its forms,  including extortion and bribery.  10 Businesses should encourage  the development and diffusion  of  environmentally  friendly  technologies. 9 Page 17 Page 17 Pages 17, 53, 54 Page 17 Pages 17, 36, 37 Page 17 Pages 17, 50 to 52 Pages 17, 36, 37, 40 to 45 Page 17 Pages 17, 38 to 44    Supporting the Global Compact  Sustainable Development and Activity Report 2011 I Roquette 63 EVALUATION AND PERFORMANCE  I A responsible enterprise Reporting on sustainable development consists of  measuring a companys performance in this area through  the use of pertinent performance indicators and then  communicating the results to the internal and external  stakeholders. To prepare its Sustainable Development and Activity  Report, the Roquette Group has chosen to adopt, in part,  the methodology of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).  Created in 1997 at the initiative of the United Nations  Environment Program (UNEP), the GRI is a non- governmental organization that works as a network,  whose role is to work for sustainable development and to  promote the preparation of reports on the environment,  social responsibility and governance. It regularly  develops and distributes guidelines to assist companies  in producing these reports. Its framework for reporting on  sustainable development is the most widely used in the  world. This framework includes the "G3 Guidelines", which set  the principles and indicators that organizations can use to  measure and report their economic, environmental and  societal performance.  Among the reasons for which it can be used:  - To measure and evaluate performance in relation to  the laws, rules, codes, standards of performance and  volunteer initiatives,  - To demonstrate an organizations influence on  stakeholders expectations,  - To compare, over time, the performance of one or more  organizations.    Indicators that conform and are pertinent  The French Law n2010-788 of 12 July 2010, on the national  engagement for the environment (the so-called Grenelle II  Law), and whose methods of application are expected to  be defined by decree in 2012, formalizes the obligation to  publish non-financial information (according to specified  thresholds). Initiated in 2010, Roquettes working group this year  continued its mission to ensure that our practices comply  with the law and, in order to evaluate the pertinence of our  indicators, to reinforce their reliability and transparency  and formalize the methodology and procedures for  analysis, reporting and consolidation.    Measuring performance with the GRI    Financial evaluation In a report dated 15 March 2012, the Standard & Poor's (S&P)  ratings agency assigned the Roquette Group an A- Long  Term rating (seventh level out of 20 in the S&P Long Term  chart) for 2011. Citing strong operational and economic  performance as well as a prudent and solid financial policy,  S&P judged the groups outlook stable, reflecting the  confidence in the Groups future accorded by its partners. In parallel, S&P confirmed the Groups A-2 Short Term  rating, which it has held for many years, the third-best level  on a scale of seven. S&P also affirmed the Roquette Groups capacity to  confront the volatility and cyclical activity of the market for  starch and its derivatives in a difficult economic context,  thanks its products with high added value, its geographic  diversification and its development towards new markets.
