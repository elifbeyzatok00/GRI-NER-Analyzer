Impressive technological solutions which conserve resources  and the environment are the basis of our success, ensuring  sustainable, protable growth to secure the long-term future  of KSB.  2 MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 We have created a triad made up of  strategy, organisation and corporate cul- ture to achieve our global objectives.  Improved energy efciency in the opera- tion of pumps will reduce electricity costs  and save valuable resources. KSB provides a wide range of  products to help ensure  tomorrows water supplies. New technical solutions are required to  make efcient use of regenerative energy  sources. 18 20 54 112  3 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   4  Chairman's Letter   6  Board of Management   8  Report of the Supervisory Board  14  2010 – An Overview  16  KSB Shares  18  Strategy: Focusing on Long-Term Success Factors  60  Balance Sheet  61  Income Statement Including     Statement of Recognised Income and Expense  62  Statement of Changes in Equity  63  Cash Flow Statement  64  Segment Reporting  65  Notes  107  List of Shareholdings  110  Supervisory Board and Board of Management  111   Proposal on the Appropriation of the      Net Retained Earnings of KSB AG GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT  26  Group Structure and Focus of Business  28  Economic Environment  30  Business Development and Events  33  Net Assets, Financial Position and Results of Operations  40  Research and Development  42  Employees  44  Corporate Social Responsibility  47  Risk Management  50  Report on Expected Developments GENERAL INFORMATION 118   Responsibility Statement 119   Auditor's Report 121    Corporate Governance Report / Remuneration Report 126    Corporate Governance: Statement of Compliance 127   Glossary 129   Contacts CONTENTS WEB LINK     * www.ksb.com CROSS-REFERENCE     * SEE PAGE COVER Group Financial Highlights Products and Services Global Presence Financial Calendar  4 MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Currently, long-term financial crisis scenarios are no longer an issue and the global economy is  picking up steam once again. KSB too, despite some difficulties that remain on the market, is  back on track. For the second time, our order intake has exceeded  2 billion, and we are con- fident that this year our order volume will return to or even exceed its pre-crisis level. Sales  revenue also looks set to continue to rise, as in 2010. Our growth is supported by our general business with standard pumps and valves, which is di- rectly benefiting from the recovery in demand. Our project business, with its emphasis on engi- neered products built to order, is growing rather more slowly. This is an area where the impact  of the financial crisis – which led our customers to shelve some plans for new plants – will  continue to be felt in the current financial year. Accordingly, fewer large project-based tenders  are currently being awarded. WE NEED TO FOCUS STRATEGICALLY, BUT REMAIN FLEXIBLE. Today we can already see that, on the whole, KSB has weathered the economic storm better  than many other companies in our industry. We believe we know the reason why: The stability  of KSB, even in a global crisis, has a great deal to do with the good reputation of our products  and our financial soundness, as well as with our broad positioning in the market. Since we  supply our products to many different sectors and regions, there is always the possibility of  balancing out the opportunities and risks in the various sales areas. We have taken advantage  of this in the crisis that is now coming to an end, and thereby succeeded in stabilising our busi- ness overall. The flexibility and commitment of our employees have helped us very much in  this respect. We need to maintain our broad positioning and flexibility in the markets in the future. At the  same time, as part of our strategy for the coming years we need to focus on particularly prom- ising business lines and strengthen our position there. This is not a contradiction: As focused  as possible, as diverse as necessary – this is one of our new strategic guiding principles.  We are following this principle with a number of strategic projects that aim to tap market op- portunities that are interesting for us. One the one hand, we will be breaking new ground in  technology, on the other we will be making the most of opportunities to reach more customers  worldwide with our current range of products and services. Dr. Wolfgang Schmitt, Chairman of the Board   of Management  5 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Chairmans Letter WE WILL USE OUR GLOBAL OPPORTUNITIES. To do this, we will coordinate our activities within the KSB Group even more effectively. Put- ting it more specifically, this means: strengthening KSBs manufacturing network, developing  new global products, creating uniform global processes and establishing more regional centres  for preparing quotations and handling projects. By intensifying our activities in the regions outside Europe, we are responding to the shifts in  the key growth areas to countries such as China, India and Brazil. In those countries we al- ready rank among the leading suppliers of pumps and valves, and are continuing to expand  our sales and production structures. In this context, we aim to grow our general business with  standard products in countries where we are firmly established through our project business.  But we are also entering some markets in Southeast Asia and South America that are only now  starting to develop. WE ARE BUILDING OUR BUSINESS ON A BASIS OF TRUST AND PERFORMANCE. Throughout the world, wherever we look after our customers and work on their behalf, we set  ourselves the same standard: We want to be better than our competitors, and as a result be  more successful. This means constantly developing the trust of our customers, not least  through high-quality, durable and energy-efficient products and excellent service. In the same way, the people who provide these services can rely on us, and on the fact that we  take responsibility for our workforce, environment and society. For this reason, in 2010 we  signed the United Nations Global Compact, whose logo you will see for the first time in our  Annual Report. If you invested in our company last year, your confidence in KSB has been justified. Within the  scope of twelve months our ordinary shares increased in value by more than 50 percent, while  the increase in the value of our preference shares was not much lower at 45 percent. In 2011  we intend to ensure that investing your money in KSB will continue to be worthwhile in the  long term.

In summary, the fallout from the global financial and economic crisis continued to  leave its mark on 2010, affecting KSBs markets with varying intensity and, to some extent, at  different times. As such, projecting its further course and potential consequences was again a  prime concern in the year under review. Apart from this, our consultations with the Board of  Management largely centred around strategy implementation measures, implementation of  the new corporate structure, and the key elements of our corporate culture. Throughout the last financial year, the Supervisory Board performed its tasks with great care  in accordance with the law, the Articles of Association and the rules of procedure. We regu- larly advised the Board of Management on corporate management issues and monitored its  work. The Supervisory Board was consulted directly and at an early stage with regard to deci- sions of fundamental importance. The Board of Management informed us about the position  of the Company, including but not limited to its business, financial and staffing situation,  planned investments, as well as relevant corporate planning and strategic and organisational  development issues via written and oral reports prepared regularly and on an ad hoc basis in  a comprehensive and timely manner. We discussed key KSB business transactions in detail on the basis of reports drawn up by the  Board of Management. Any departures in business developments from the plans and targets  were reviewed and commented on in detail by the Board of Management. After thorough   examination and discussion, we adopted our resolutions on reports and proposals by the  Board of Management. Beyond the intensive work in the plenary sessions and in the commit- tees, both the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and other Supervisory Board members were  in frequent contact with the Board of Management to discuss the current business develop- ment and significant transactions. No conflicts of interest arose involving members of the  Board of Management or the Supervisory Board that would have been required to be reported  to the Supervisory Board or the Annual General Meeting in the period under review. MAIN FOCUS OF WORK IN THE SUPERVISORY BOARD PLENARY SESSIONS AND IN THE  COMMITTEES Four regular Supervisory Board meetings were held in 2010. The performance of KSB   Aktiengesellschaft, the Group and the individual units was the subject of regular discussions  in plenary sessions, primarily with regard to the performance of order intake, sales revenue,  earnings, assets and employment levels as well as the current economic situation, the strategy  and investment and acquisition projects. The latter were the subject of multiple discussions  during the past financial year, particularly in connection with the further strengthening of our  German and international service activities. In the light of the many acquisitions made during  the past few years, special attention was paid to their structured integration and future man- agement within the Group, e.g. by creating uniform reporting and control structures and  eradicating managerial weak points, even through partial divestment. The specific ways in  which KSB intends to achieve its general growth targets, including the underlying strategic  considerations, were explained in detail. We closely monitored the Companys acquisition of a  majority interest in an Italian manufacturer of innovative drive technology through which we   9 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Report of the Supervisory Board expect to make major leaps in expertise in an area that is currently the focus of energy effi- ciency considerations. On several occasions, we were involved in major investment projects,  especially in Asia. These initiatives serve to modernise our locations, exploit existing potential  and secure future business opportunities.  In view of the crisis experience and the need to introduce correlating control measures, the  Supervisory Board attached great importance to optimising the reliability of forecasting.  The instruments recently used in this context were examined with a critical eye. At the same  time, the Board of Management presented a series of proposals outlining appropriate and   adequately flexible responses to possible developments, with the focus clearly on driving sales  activities. Numerous debates on the specific, long-term determinants that govern economic  growth rounded off the analysis. The Supervisory Board continued to pay close attention to our business activities in China,  which the Board presented to us from a variety of different angles. Depending on further   political decisions, supplementary investments are planned to be made in the current year in  our joint venture for nuclear products founded in 2008. In addition, the Supervisory Board  approved major investments in the Valves product area in order to facilitate sustained growth  in this field through an increase in Chinese production capacity. A recurring topic on the agenda were measures introduced by the Board of Management to  nurture the ongoing development and consolidation of our corporate culture based on estab- lished values. Imparted and consolidated in a top-down process starting with the manage- ment, these values shall serve as a frame of reference for our staff and also define the stand- ards we expect of them. For this reason, we attach considerable importance to this  Group-wide project and its long-term outcome. The Supervisory Board convened in September for a two-day meeting at the Pegnitz site,  where it was able to assess how business was developing and observe the high-performance  production facilities, including the latest site expansion. We reviewed the status of the corpo- rate organisation that was restructured at the start of the year and obtained a detailed run- down of the strengths and weaknesses evident in the implementation phase. We also gained  an insight into one of the new Business Units. At this and the following meeting, we also ex- amined changes made over the course of the year to the German Corporate Governance Code  and its impact on procedures within the Company. In December we chiefly looked at business  performance during the year and planning for 2011. Dr. Hans-Joachim Jacob, Chairman of the Supervisory Board  10 MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 To ensure its tasks are performed efficiently, the Supervisory Board established six committees  and seven sub-committees in the past financial year. They prepared the Supervisory Boards  resolutions and special issues to be discussed. In addition, they also made their own decisions  – to the extent that this is legally permissible – within the scope of their areas of responsibil- ity. This allocation has proved worthwhile in practice. At the plenary meetings, the Chairs of  the committees regularly and comprehensively reported on the content and results of the  work in the committees; the relevant committees were informed of the topics discussed in the  sub-committees. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board serves as the Chair of all committees  with the exception of the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Corporate  Development Committee. The Nomination Committee looked at the shareholder representative nominations prior to  the Supervisory Board elections at the Annual General Meeting. To do so, this committee met  once during the year under review. The Planning and Finance Committee met four times in the year under review. It addressed  corporate and investment planning and the financial situation of the Company, and prepared  the Supervisory Boards resolutions on these matters. One focus was the regular examination  of the Board of Managements rolling forecast report which continuously covers medium- term time frames. The committee members also discussed in detail the underlying planning  assumptions and the quality of planning. To this end, they requested an in-depth presentation  of the planning process.  The Innovation sub-committee met three times and discussed fundamental aspects of the re- search, development and innovation organisation within the Company. A focus of attention  was the need to intermesh corporate topics and assign them to different specialist depart- ments. The Nuclear sub-committee met on three occasions and primarily discussed fundamental  questions regarding the expansion of business activities for products with nuclear applica- tions. As in the previous year, the development of the joint venture founded in conjunction  with a Chinese partner in 2008 for the purpose of manufacturing such products was thus the  subject of closer scrutiny. The Sales and Production Management sub-committees are looking at ways in which to sys- tematically develop their respective corporate areas on an ongoing basis. In 2010, they were  principally involved in implementing the new organisational structure, meeting on five and  two occasions respectively. The Corporate Development sub-committee met twice to discuss issues of strategy implemen- tation and the status of current and planned projects. In September 2010, we created the Corporate Development Committee. The new Committee  focuses on topics such as corporate development and strategy, innovation, nuclear markets  and production management; the corresponding sub-committees were dissolved. Meeting on  two occasions in the year under review, it looked at innovative business models and funda- mental new trends in technology, in addition to the associated communication aspects. The Controlling sub-committee established in December 2010 has its origins in correspond- ing deliberations of the Audit Committee, and convened four times in the year under review.   11 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Report of the Supervisory Board It advises the Board on tasks related to this corporate area, including the relevant interdisci- plinary interfaces. The Personnel Committee held five meetings in the year under review. It primarily addresses  issues relating to the Board of Managements remuneration, including the terms of the service  contracts for the individual Board of Management members as well as other Board of Man- agement issues. Decisions on the Board of Managements remuneration are made in plenary  session with the committee acting in a preparatory capacity. On the committees recommen- dation, the plenary session extended the appointment of Dr. Wolfgang Schmitt and Jan Stoop  to the Board of Management, with the new terms ending on 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2013  respectively. Dr. Peter Buthmann took over from Dr. Schmitt as Human Resources Director  with effect from 8 February 2011. These changes took place against the backdrop of the reor- ganisation of the Board of Managements responsibilities, which had been the subject of in- tense discussions in prior committee and plenary meetings. They will ensure that our strategy  and new corporate structure come to the fore. Personnel development issues were also dis- cussed with the aim of recruiting candidates for the Board of Management and other manage- ment positions from within the Companys own ranks. In 2010, the committee members  again participated in events with potential candidates of all management levels in an effort to  foster a direct exchange of ideas. Special emphasis was also placed on conceptional aspects  related to the deployment of staff abroad. The Leadership and Corporate Culture sub-committee met on one occasion to discuss funda- mental considerations relating to the topics defined, as well as specific practical experience in  these areas. After a policy paper had been produced and then debated in the Supervisory  Board plenary session, the committee was disbanded at the end of the year. The four meetings of the Audit Committee were always attended by the Member of the Board  responsible for Finance and, on several occasions, by the auditors. The committee primarily  examined the annual and consolidated financial statements, the audit reports submitted by  the auditors and the internal auditors as well as the further development of the risk manage- ment system and compliance organisation. The half-year financial report was also discussed  with the Board of Management. Furthermore, the committee defined key audit areas for the  independent auditing of the Supervisory Board in accordance with section 171 of the AktG  [Aktiengesetz – German Public Companies Act] and for the external auditing of the financial  statements. It submitted a proposal to the plenary session for the appointment of auditors to  be voted on by the Annual General Meeting, and subsequently commissioned the auditors  with the task of auditing the annual and consolidated financial statements. The declaration of  independence by the auditors was obtained in accordance with section 7.2.1 of the German  Corporate Governance Code and the auditors continued independence was monitored. In  2010 too, an ongoing debate as part of the preparations for the work performed in the ple- nary session, concerned the course and impact of the global financial and economic crisis. There was no requirement during the year under review to convene the Mediation Committee  required by section 27(3) MitbestG [Mitbestimmungsgesetz – German Co-determination Act]. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE The Supervisory Board continuously monitored the ongoing development of corporate gov- ernance standards. We held several meetings to discuss the implementation of changes made  to the German Corporate Governance Code and the associated statutory changes. The Board  of Management and the Supervisory Board report on corporate governance at KSB in accord-  12 MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010  * www.ksb.com/investor-relations     ** SEE PAGE 128 (GLOSSARY)  ance with section 3.10 of the German Corporate Governance Code on pages 121 to 125 of  this Annual Report. On both 30 March and 8 December 2010 they jointly issued an updated  statement of compliance in accordance with section 312 AktG and made this available to  shareholders on the Companys web site*. With two exceptions, KSB Aktiengesellschaft com- plies with the recommendations contained in the 26 May 2010 version of the Code which  was published by the Federal Ministry of Justice on 2 July 2010. AUDIT OF THE ANNUAL AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The accounting documentation, in addition to the proposal by the Board of Management on  the appropriation of net retained earnings and the audit reports submitted by the auditors,  was provided in good time to all members of the Supervisory Board. It was addressed in de- tail by the Audit Committee on 22 March 2011 as well as by the Supervisory Board plenary  session on 29 March 2011 and explained in depth in both cases by the Board of Manage- ment. The auditors attended the meetings of both bodies, reported on the findings of the audit  and were available to provide additional information. The Supervisory Board examined the annual financial statements and the management report  of KSB Aktiengesellschaft for the year ended 31 December 2010, which were prepared in ac- cordance with the provisions of the Handelsgesetzbuch [HGB – German Commercial Code],  as well as the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report for the  year ended 31 December 2010, which were prepared in accordance with the International   Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS**) and the proposal by the Board of Management on the  appropriation of net retained earnings.  The Frankfurt/Main offices of BDO AG Wirtschaftsprfungsgesellschaft, Hamburg, audited  the annual financial statements and the management report of KSB Aktiengesellschaft for the  year ended 31 December 2010, as well as the consolidated financial statements and the Group  management report for the year ended 31 December 2010, and issued an unqualified audi- tors opinion. The Audit Committee defined key audit areas for the year under review, such as  the structure and efficacy of the accounting process, the validity of planning, the mapping of  risks in connection with the adequacy of risk provisioning and the treatment for accounting  purposes of company acquisitions and the associated purchase price allocations (the informa- tion contained in the Notes and the accounting treatment of conditional purchase price pay- ments were also scrutinised). The auditors reported their findings on these key audit areas  both orally and in writing. The Supervisory Board concurs with the auditors findings. Based on its own final examina- tion results, the Supervisory Board plenary session did not raise any objections to the annual  financial statements, consolidated financial statements, management report and Group man- agement report. In accordance with the recommendation of the Audit Committee the Super  visory Board approved the financial statements prepared by the Board of Management; the  annual financial statements are thus adopted. After its own examination, the Supervisory  Board deems the proposal by the Board of Management on the appropriation of net retained  earnings of KSB Aktiengesellschaft to be appropriate and concurs with it.  13 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Report of the Supervisory Board DEPENDENT COMPANY REPORT The auditors also audited the dependent company report prepared by the Board of Manage- ment in accordance with section 312 AktG and issued the following unqualified opinion on  this report: On completion of our audit and assessment in accordance with professional standards, we  confirm that:  1. the actual amounts and disclosures in the report are correct;  2.  the consideration paid by the Company for the transactions listed in the report was not  inappropriately high;  3.  there are no circumstances relating to the measures listed in the report that would indicate  an assessment that is materially different from that of the Board of Management. The reports by the Board of Management and the auditors were provided in good time to all  members of the Supervisory Board and were also discussed by the Audit Committee and at  plenary sessions. The auditors attended the meetings of both bodies, reported on the material  findings of the audit and were available to provide additional information. The Supervisory  Board concurs with the auditors findings. Both the recommendation by the Audit Committee  and the final results of the Supervisory Board plenary sessions examination did not give rise  to any objections to the dependent company report prepared by the Board of Management  and to the statement by the Board of Management at the end of the dependent company   report. CHANGES IN THE SUPERVISORY BOARD AND BOARD OF MANAGEMENT Dr. Stefan Bross joined the Supervisory Board with effect from 1 January 2010 as an elected  reserve member for Carl-Wilhelm Schell-Lind, who left the Supervisory Board with effect  from 31 December 2009. Ludwig Udo Kontzs term of office on the Supervisory Board ended  upon the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on 19 May 2010; his place as elected  member of the Supervisory Board was taken by Dr. Martin Auer. With effect from 1 Septem- ber 2010, Reiner Euler joined the Supervisory Board as an elected reserve member for Dieter  Mller, who left the Supervisory Board with effect from 31 August 2010 in order to enter re- tirement. The Supervisory Board extends its gratitude to the retiring members of the Boards  for their constructive and expert contributions and for many years of work in an atmosphere  of mutual trust. The Supervisory Board would also like to acknowledge and thank the Board of Management,  the employees and employee representatives of all Group companies for their work in the  year under review. They significantly contributed to another successful year for KSB.

More  than 2,000 Indian employ- ees currently work at the  companys five production  sites and numerous sales  and service facilities.  PUMP MONITORING The PumpMeter monitoring  unit can be used to track all  of a pumps key measure- ment variables and to indi- cate the potential for energy  savings. Launched in 2010,  this innovative product has  won the special-category in- novation award for Indus- try by the German federal  state of Rhineland-Palati- nate. NEW VALVE PLANT In Changzhou (near Shang- hai), KSB Valves (Changzhou)  Co., Ltd. starts construction  of a new production plant.  From the second half of 2011  onwards the plant will manu- facture ANSI*-standard  valves. ENERGY-EFFICIENT MOTORS KSB acquires an 80 percent  interest in ITACO s.r.l., an  Italian drive specialist. This  acquisition ensures access to  a new kind of energy-efficient  motor that already exceeds  the most stringent require- ments specified in EU direc- tives for high-efficiency mo- tors.  * SEE PAGE 128 (GLOSSARY)  16 MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Developments on the worlds stock markets varied consider- ably in 2010: While stock markets in the emerging countries  and in the USA continued to recover from the effects of the  financial crisis, many exchanges in Europe and Japan (Nikkei  – 3 %) suffered losses. In Europe, the ongoing debt crisis was  the main reason for the price slump. In addition, investors  were concerned about the value of the euro. Thus, the EURO  Stoxx 50 fell sharply in the first half of the year and managed  to make up only some of the lost ground by the end of the  year. Year on year, the loss amounted to almost 6 %.  By contrast, investors in U.S. stocks saw the Dow Jones rise  by 11 %. After a good start, the economy started to show  signs of running out of steam towards the middle of the year.  The stock market responded with a decline in prices falling  to values below those seen at the start of the year. However, a  new and positive prevailing mood, due in part to changes in  monetary policy, led to rising share prices in the third and  fourth quarters of the year.  GOOD YEAR FOR THE DAX In contrast to many other European countries, equity inves- tors in Germany posted gratifying gains. Year on year, the  value of the DAX increased by a good 16 %. That said, the  DAX had tended to move laterally until September before  prices really took off in the subsequent months. The reason  for the sudden improvement was surprisingly upbeat news on  the economic and corporate fronts which, despite concerns  about the high national debt of several European countries,  resulted in quite a mood swing.

From the start of the year onwards, investors saw the value  of their shares in KSB rise continuously, clearly outperform- ing the DAX as a whole. Ordinary shares gained 51 % dur- ing the year, while preference shares increased by 46 % com- pared with their value at the end of 2009. At 30 December  2010, the price of our ordinary shares was  618.00, while  our preference shares were trading at  582.00.  These marked increases were reflected in our market capitali- sation, which, by the end of the year, had exceeded the  1  billion mark for the first time. The year-on-year change con- stituted a rise of  343.6 million (around 49 %) to  1,051.2  million.  STABLE DIVIDEND PAYOUT DESPITE DROP IN EARNINGS   AT KSB AG Even if our earnings did not quite match those of 2009, we  want to keep the dividend at the same level as the previous  year. We will therefore propose to the Annual General Meet- ing on 18 May 2011 an unchanged payout to ordinary share- holders of  12.00 per share. Holders of preference shares  once again are to receive  12.26. EARNINGS PER SHARE BELOW PRIOR YEAR LEVEL  The decline in consolidated earnings resulted in a drop in the  earnings-per-share figure compared with the previous year.  Earnings per ordinary share were  44.09, compared with    61.32 in the previous year, and  44.35 per preference  share, compared with  61.58 in 2009.

Answering this question  was essential for the development of our current Group strat- egy, which will continue to be in focus in the coming years as  well.  We will continuously analyse the market, survey our  customers and identify relevant technical trends. Our inten- tion is to find and implement the best solutions for future  customer problems early on. By doing so, we open up new  sales opportunities and secure our long-term market position. This solution-oriented approach, coupled with our expertise  in technology and the pursuit of long-term success, is the  driving force behind our work. We use the distinctive  strengths of our corporate culture, and simultaneously align  our organisation with our strategic goals. Our primary goals include:   Taking a leading position in attractive markets   Being better than our competitors in the eyes   of our  customers   Ensuring sustainable, profitable growth to secure the future  of KSB in the long term To achieve these goals, we have created a triad made up of  strategy, organisation and corporate culture. We are continu- ously developing our three-point management system and  adapting it to needs arising from changes in external and in- ternal conditions. The focus is on achieving flexibility. USING REGIONAL SKILLS GLOBALLY Our Group strategy calls for the further globalisation of our  activities. We are ideally positioned for this. For more than  50 years KSB has been active in countries such as Argentina,  Brazil, India, Mexico, Pakistan and South Africa with its own  manufacturing plants and sales centres. In response to the  specific customer requirements in these and other markets,  our local companies have developed special technical skills.  When developing our corporate strategy, we examined the  extent to which these skills are also relevant in a global con- text. We will now extend the use of relevant expertise to pro- vide even better service to customers in other markets too.  NEW ORGANISATION CREATES SYNERGIES For this we needed to reorganise processes and structures  within the Group. At the start of the reporting year, we de- coupled production and sales responsibility and introduced a  global product management system. At the same time we es- tablished a network of regional expert teams for project han- dling. We coordinate these teams on a cross-regional basis in  order to be able to quickly serve our customers who operate  internationally with the professionalism they have come to  expect from us. By interacting globally, the new organisation aims to exploit  synergies and improve the profitability of KSB through econ- omies of scale. Moreover, by making our solutions expertise  available to an even larger extent, we can strengthen our  quality position in many individual markets, helping to se- cure our corporate future. In addition to developing new solutions, part of our strategy  is to systematically exploit market potential with existing  products and services. For this we draw on our long-stand- ing, good relations with many companies. At the same time,  we are striving to make our technologically advanced prod- ucts and proven solutions available to even more customers.  We can build on our ability to produce a wide range of prod- ucts and variants efficiently. This ability enables us to imple- ment many individual user requests as part of standardised  and partially standardised solutions. As a result we are, for  example, able to offer our customers in highly developed in- dustrial countries particularly energy-efficient and durable  products that incorporate advanced drive technologies and  proprietary materials. However, we can equally provide tech- nical alternatives for less demanding applications.  By making use of the versatility of our existing product range  worldwide, we generate the funds necessary to develop new  business lines. Here we focus on those we consider to be the  most promising for the future. STRATEGY: FOCUSING ON LONG-TERM SUCCESS FACTORS   Using synergies, tapping the full market potential   Taking advantage of a range of opportunities through a global approach   Project organisation for strategy implementation   19 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Strategy MINIMISING RISKS, EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES We want our global business to be as focused as possible and  as diverse as necessary. This applies to the activities in our  various sales regions as well as to the various areas of appli- cation for our products, from building services to power  plant processes.  To maintain or achieve the necessary strength in strategic  business lines, we need to, on the one hand, temporarily con- centrate our resources. On the other hand, because we are  maintaining the breadth of our activities, we have a high de- gree of flexibility – not least to balance out economic fluctua- tions in individual business lines. Regionally we wish to reduce our dependency on the Euro- pean market through above-average growth in other regions  in the coming years. This will enable us to benefit more from  the dynamism of these markets, which include not only   Brazil, Russia, India and China, but also attractive smaller  markets that we have known for many years and to which  we can supply suitable products and services. Still, we will  not be neglecting our domestic market of Europe, but will  rather be seeking out and taking advantage of new opportu- nities here as well.  In terms of content we diversify our risks by being involved  in many diverse and complex areas such as energy supply  and service. With our products for conventional and nuclear  power applications, we support, for example, economies that  are just embarking on industrialisation. At the same time, we  are helping to reduce CO2 emissions in industrialised coun- tries with our equipment for renewable energy supply sys- tems. In emerging economies, we are also contributing to the  establishment of decentralised supply infrastructures. We have a similar aim when it comes to the deployment of  our service expertise in both the industrialised countries   – where there are a large number of existing plants – and the  emerging markets, where availability, operating reliability  and safety, and low life cycle costs are becoming increasingly  important. Requirements and market reactions are quite dif- ferent in both cases. PROJECT ORGANISATION INSTEAD OF HIERARCHICALLY  MANAGED EXPERTISE At the same time as defining our strategic projects, we adopt- ed a project methodology and organisation that allow us to  prepare and implement our numerous individual projects ef- ficiently. We have decentralised the responsibility for these  projects and linked them to local resources, thus ensuring  that all Group companies are involved in strategic tasks. Thus, at KSB, many employees contribute to the success of  our corporate strategy in national and international teams.  Increased project work marks an organisational and cultural  change. It leads away from a hierarchy-based structure to a  flexible way of working involving temporary, decentralised  responsibility. Most of our strategic projects require more than a year, and  consequently were not yet completed at the end of 2010. Such  longer-term projects mainly aim at developing new products,  accessing new markets and establishing sales channels. We have implemented a series of short-term measures to re- duce costs, globalise materials procurement and expand our  service network. Two acquisition projects were successfully  concluded in 2010 with the acquisition of a motor manufac- turer in northern Italy and of the business operations of a  service provider in the southern United States. They represent  – along with some of the product launches – important mile- stones on the road to developing future areas of strategic rel- evance. We will continue working intensively on this task in  2011 as well. At the same time, we will strengthen our organ- isation and corporate culture and – where appropriate – im- prove it even further.  Creating transparency, setting  objectives, making a difference: KSB  secures the future of its business  using a triad made up of strategy,  organisation and corporate culture.  21 The operation of pumps alone requires around  10 percent of all the energy consumed in  Europe. Not many people are aware of this.  Around a third of this huge amount of energy  could be saved if these pumps were selected  correctly, automatically controlled and  equipped with energy-ef cient motors. Our cus- tomers are increasingly taking advantage of the  opportunities to operate their pump sets eco- nomically, not least for commercial reasons. But  there is still a lot more we can do in terms of  energy ef ciency in order to preserve our valu- able resources.

We also provide a wide range of services to users of  these products.  In the year under review, 51 operating companies in 33 coun- tries were dedicated to achieving this mission. Eight Group  companies exercised a holding company function.  KSB AG, Frankenthal, Germany, as the parent company, di- rectly or indirectly holds the shares in the companies belong- ing to the Group. Besides KSB AG itself, the companies in the  KSB Group with the highest sales revenue are   KSB S.A.S., Gennevilliers (Paris), France   KSB Service GmbH, Frankenthal, Germany   KSB Bombas Hidrulicas S.A., Vrzea Paulista, Brazil   KSB Shanghai Pump Co.

Information is dis- closed only to the extent that it applies to KSB AG.  KSB AGs share capital amounts to  44.8 million, of which   22.7 million is represented by 886,615 no-par value ordi- nary shares and  22.1 million by 864,712 no-par value pref- erence shares. Each no-par value share represents an equal  notional amount of the share capital. All shares are bearer  shares. They are listed for trading on the regulated market  and are traded in the General Standard segment of the Frank- furt Stock Exchange.  Each ordinary share authorises the holder to one vote at KSB  AGs Annual General Meeting. Klein Pumpen GmbH, Fran- kenthal, holds approximately 80 % of the ordinary shares;  the KSB Stiftung (KSB Foundation), Stuttgart, holds the ma- jority of the shares of Klein Pumpen GmbH. The preference  shares carry separate cumulative preferred dividend rights  and progressive additional dividend rights. Detailed informa- tion on the share capital and shareholders holding an interest  of more than 10 % is provided in the Notes*. Holders of  preference shares are entitled to voting rights in the cases  prescribed by law. The issue of additional ordinary shares  does not require the consent of the preference shareholders.  Similarly, the issue of additional preference shares does not  require the consent of the preference shareholders unless the  subscription rights exclude newly issued senior or pari passu  preference shares. The company is authorised by a resolution passed at the An- nual General Meeting on 19 May 2010 to purchase company  shares totalling up to  4,477,196 of the registered share  capital by 18 May 2015. The Board of Management shall be  entitled to: (1) Sell company shares purchased on the basis of  this authorisation either on the stock exchange or by another  means that safeguards the rule of equal treatment of all  shareholders; (2) Sell the shares with the consent of the Su- pervisory Board, excluding shareholders subscription rights,  if the shares are sold for cash and at a price that is not mate- rially lower than the market price for company shares of the  same type and with the same features at the time of the sale.  This authorisation is limited to the sale of shares which over- all represent no more than 10 % of the existing share capital  at the date on which such authorisation becomes effective or,  if the amount is lower, the date this authorisation is used  (where the 10 % limit shall include the proportional amount  for shares issued within the scope of a capital increase during  the term of the authorisation excluding subscription rights or  for the maximum number of shares that can be issued for the  purpose of servicing warrants and convertible bonds); (3) Sell  the shares with the consent of the Supervisory Board, exclud- ing shareholders subscription rights, to third parties for the  purpose of acquiring companies, parts thereof and / or finan- cial interests in companies as well as within the scope of cor- porate mergers or (4) Redeem the shares. KSB AG has not yet  made use of this authorisation to purchase treasury shares. There are no resolutions by the Annual General Meeting au- thorising the companys Board of Management to increase  the share capital (authorised capital).

The  Supervisory Board decides on the appointment and termina- tion of the mandate of members of the Board of Manage- ment in accordance with the statutory provisions.  Amendments to the companys Articles of Association are re- solved by the Annual General Meeting. If the amendments  only affect the wording of the Articles, they can be approved  by the Supervisory Board. ORGANISATION, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL  Management is monitored by a Supervisory Board consisting  of twelve members. The Annual General Meeting of share- holders appoints six members of the Supervisory Board, with  the remaining six being delegated by the employees under the  terms of the Mitbestimmungsgesetz [German Co-determina- tion Act].  KSB AGs Board of Management manages and controls the  KSB Group. The strategy and instructions formulated by the  Board of Management are implemented within an organisa- tion that since 1 January 2010 has been divided into three  areas of responsibility: pumps, valves and service. At the cen- tre of this organisation are the Business Units with their areas  of focus, which act as interfaces between Sales and Opera- tions. All organisational units base their activities on the new  Group strategy*, which was presented in the 2009 Annual  Report. The strategy aims to ensure sustainable, profitable  growth that will secure both KSBs financial independence  and medium- and long-term future, in order to achieve and  defend a leading competitive position in attractive markets. MARKETS AND LOCATIONS The main products of the KSB Group are centrifugal pumps,  which account for almost 70 % of sales revenue. These  pumps, as well as shut-off valves, are sold to engineering con- tractors, OEMs and end users or, in some cases, distributed  via dealers. The same applies to control and monitoring sys- tems, and to package units with pumps and valves.  The best developed sales market for these products is Europe,  where KSB operates its main manufacturing facilities in Ger- many and France. KSB AGs main plant in Frankenthal is its  largest in Europe, ahead of those in Pegnitz (Bavaria) and  Halle (Saxony-Anhalt), in Germany, and La Roche Chalais,  in France.  The second-largest market for KSB products is currently in  the Region Asia / Pacific, followed by the Americas and the  Region Middle East / Africa. Outside Europe, KSBs biggest  manufacturing facilities are in Brazil, China, India and the  USA.  KSB manufactures products and components in a total of 19  countries; they are sold through the Groups own companies  or agents in more than 100 countries. The Groups compa- nies supply its products to customers from industry and  building services, the energy industry, mining and the public  sector. KSB is world leader in pumps deployed in power  plants and process engineering, and the Group ranks among  the leading manufacturers in other areas of application as  well.  The market generating the highest sales revenue for our  products in 2010 was once again industry, where the KSB  Group has established itself as the second-largest pump man- ufacturer in the world.  MANAGEMENT PARAMETERS WITHIN THE KSB GROUP The current target variables for managing the Group are the  development of order intake and sales revenue, as well as  profitability, which we measure on the basis of pre-tax return  on sales.  When setting our targets, we are guided on the one hand by  developments in the market, and on the other by the perfor- mance of our key competitors.  In future, value-based management will play a larger role at  KSB. We will use the EVA* (Economic Value Added) perfor- mance indicator for this.    * SEE PAGE 18  * SEE PAGE 128 (GLOSSARY)     * www.ksb.com/investor-relations  28 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT   WORLD MARKET OF CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS AND VALVES Asia / Pacific  34 % Europe  30 % Americas  27 % Middle East / Africa  9 % Source: DIW Berlin The global economy saw a much faster recovery in 2010 than  many experts had predicted. The Asian emerging markets in  particular, which had already begun their economic turna- round in the middle of the previous year, showed very dynam- ic developments. But production in many industrialised na- tions also increased again. The path to economic recovery was  supported by a variety of economic stimulus programmes,  generally favourable interest rates and a tangible need to catch  up in sectors that had suspended capital expenditure as a re- sult of the crisis. Asia was once again the fastest growing economic area by far,  with the emerging markets in the region achieving average  gross domestic product growth of over 9 %. This momentum  weakened somewhat during the second half of the year, not  least as a result of regulatory measures, especially in China.  The eurozone also saw economic growth of 1.7 % again in  2010. Nevertheless, there was a considerable economic divide  between the members of the Monetary Union. For example,  the countries hit by the real estate and debt crisis were hardly  able to achieve any growth of note. Germany, however, posted  a growth rate of 3.6 %, surprisingly strong given the current  circumstances in Europe, and a number of smaller eurozone  countries also performed well. In Eastern Europe, the effects of the financial and economic  crisis were putting a damper on economic momentum. By con- trast, economic stimulus measures and stable domestic de- mand helped Poland to stand out as an exception among the  other countries in this economic area. The growth leader in the Americas was Brazil, where positive  economic prospects stimulated companies investment activi- ties. Outside of the Brazilian market as well, there were fa- vourable developments in South America. In the US, although  there was a slight upward trend in 2010, there were still no  signs of a sustainable improvement.  The Region Middle East / Africa benefited from rapidly rising  demand for energy sources and raw materials. The oil-produc- ing nations of the Middle East used part of their additional in- come to reduce their dependency on oil exports through in- vestment in other sectors of industry. CONSIDERABLE GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR MACHINERY Mechanical and plant engineering did well weathering the  most difficult crisis experienced by the sector in the post-war  era and was able to benefit from a rebound in the demand for  industrial goods in 2010. Growth-oriented customers ordered  new machinery in order to expand their production facilities  or catch up on modernisation plans that they had postponed.  The pace of the recovery in order intake in the various   branches of the mechanical engineering sector varied depend- ing on the customer industries and their economic cycles. In  line with the level of the decline in orders, which was particu- larly large in the case of foundry, textile and plastics process- ing machinery, improved demand immediately led to strong  growth rates.  Overall, the German Engineering Federation (VDMA – Ver- band Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau) recorded 8.8 %  growth in production for its member companies. However,  this improvement could only partially make up for the previ- ous collapse in order intake. As a result, the volume of incom- ing orders in mechanical engineering was only at about 2005  levels. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT  Global economy remains on road to recovery   Mechanical engineering sector benefits from demand for industrial goods   Market for standard pumps and valves picks up again  29 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 UNEVEN DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MARKET FOR PUMPS,  VALVES AND SERVICES Demand for pumps varied considerably in 2010 with respect  to areas of application. The economic revival in industry and  the construction sector led directly to an increased number of  orders for standard pumps starting in the spring. By contrast,  the late-cyclical project business, involving a large share of en- gineered pumps manufactured to order, proved to be affected  by negative investment decisions made during the preceding  crisis period.  The considerably lower number of new major orders increased  price pressure. Competitors with a one-sided focus on plant  engineering business were often prepared to accept lower mar- gins in order to utilise their capacity. This made it difficult to  generate adequate returns – particularly in the case of power  plant pumps. Infrastructure projects such as the construction  of waterworks and waste water treatment facilities were less  affected by this trend. In fact, the demand for pumps for water  engineering plants even grew. Developments in the valves market were similar to those in the  market for pumps. Demand for standard globe, gate and but- terfly valves rose at a brisker pace than that for engineered  valves. These products are ordered, for example, by plant engi- neering contractors for use in power plant processes. In 2010  growth momentum for valves came mostly from markets out- side Europe. Nevertheless, orders from the Asian shipbuilding  industry remained well behind their previous volumes. In the service market for fluid transport plants, demand was  stable for maintenance, inspections and repair services in the  power plant sector. Moreover, Germany and France saw a  boost in demand from industry. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COMPETITIVE SITUATION Many pump and valve manufacturers responded to the eco- nomic crisis by putting in place restructuring measures or cost- cutting programmes, and thus were able to weather a difficult  period for business. Manufacturers of standard products were  able to benefit from the recovering economy, while suppliers  whose sales are focused on project business were hurt by a de- crease in the number of new orders awarded.  In the time immediately following the crisis, pump and valve  manufacturers focused strongly on overcoming the difficulties  in the market and once again making better use of their capac- ities. No significant corporate takeovers occurred during this  time. However, some providers, including KSB, strengthened  their position through smaller, strategic acquisitions in selected  business areas.  The standard pump business reacts  quickly to economic stimuli. In 2010,  the industrial pump manufacturing  facility in Frankenthal increased its  output again. Economic Environment  30 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT The rapid improvement in the overall economic situation laid  the foundation for positive growth in 2010. Order intake in  our general business with standard pumps and valves saw  considerable recovery during the second half of the year.  Contrary to general opinion made in early 2010, we succeed- ed in increasing both our order intake and our sales revenue.  ORDER INTAKE UP 7.3 % Driven by the rebound in general business and good growth  of demand overall in markets outside Europe, we increased  our order intake by 7.3 %. Once again, the overall volume of  orders received within the Group exceeded the two billion  euro mark and totalled  2,075.0 million.  We posted an increase in orders for pumps, valves and ser- vices. In percentage terms, the service business achieved the  strongest growth thanks to excellent performance in the Ger- man and French markets. Some 70 % of all orders were for  pumps including automation equipment. The growth in order intake is primarily attributable to the  performance of our companies outside Europe. By contrast,  order volume at our European Group companies fell slightly  short of the previous year due to the project business, which  was still impaired by the after-effects of the crisis. This was  felt by KSB AG, in particular, where order intake in the year  under review was 5.8 % lower than in the previous year. Our four consolidated operating companies in the Region  Middle East / Africa performed extremely well. This holds  true especially for our Turkish company, which was able to  boost its order volume by more than 50 % thanks to good  business developments in industry, water and waste water en- gineering. In South Africa, major orders from the water and  energy sectors, as well as industry helped generate consider- able growth. Group companies in the Region Asia / Pacific posted the  greatest total order growth, increasing the total volume of in- coming orders by around one third. This good performance  was mainly based on demand from the engineering contrac- tors and operators of power plants, water management com- panies and industry. Excellent growth rates were posted in  China and India where, in addition to general growth in in- dustrial production and the expansion of new power plant  capacities, water engineering infrastructure projects stimu- lated demand. In China we also received orders from Chinese  engineering contractors for export, chiefly to India and Indo- nesia. The order situation for Indian control valves also de- veloped well in 2010. Order intake at our American Group companies improved  considerably over the previous year. Our US subsidiary KSB,  Inc., in particular, succeeded in sharply increasing its order  volume in 2010 through successful business with products  for power plants and waste water engineering. KSB Chile  benefited from rising demand for pumps for mining applica- tions. The lions share of orders in Brazil were for the water  business and industry. SALES REVENUE GROWTH IN REGIONS OUTSIDE EUROPE Consolidated sales revenue also grew 2.5 % to total    1,939.3 million. In the strongest segment, pumps, sales   revenue rose  32.0 million to  1,333.8 million while valve  sales increased  14.6 million to  331.3 million. Sales   revenue in the service business rose  42.3 million to  276.5  million. As they did in order intake, the European Group companies  saw a further decline in sales revenue overall (down 2.1 %).  KSB AG was not affected by this development and generated  sales revenue (in accordance with the German Commercial  Code [HGB]) of  778.8 million, up 1.3 % year on year. Sales revenue generated by our Group companies in the Re- gion Middle East / Africa rose 12.4 %. Similar to the order  intake trend, the companies in Turkey and South Africa post- ed the most positive changes. KSB companies in the Region Asia / Pacific also made a  strong contribution to growth again in 2010. They succeeded  in boosting their sales volume by 12.4 %. Strong growth  rates were posted not only by our two Indian companies but  also several subsidiaries in smaller countries as well as Aus- tralia. The subsidiaries operating in the Americas also achieved   12.4 % growth.

Consolidated order intake and sales revenue reflect the first- time consolidation of five operating companies in Germany,  Italy, Canada, Norway and Russia. Without this expansion of  the consolidated Group, order intake and sales revenue  would have been  40.2 million and  35.4 million lower re- spectively. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW GROUP STRATEGY Outside of our operative business, in the year under review,  we were focused on implementing our new Group strategy  and, by doing so, tapping additional growth potential. 34 strategic projects were launched by the end of 2010.  Around 170 further full or sub-projects are currently at vary- ing stages of planning and will be completed by 2018. These  include defined plans for    Developing new products and services or optimising exist- ing ones   Better tapping selected regional markets, including those of  the BRIC* countries   Creating new sales channels, especially for the sale of  standard pumps and valves    Adapting manufacturing structures and processes in Opera- tions in line with strategic projects To perform these tasks in 2010, we trained about 150 people  in project management. At the same time, we established a  system for managing and supervising all projects according  to uniform criteria: It ensures that projects that are still in  progress can be completed reliably and implemented in line  with objectives. EXPANSION OF PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY IN ASIA  To implement our strategic projects, in 2010 we further en- hanced our production base in India, China and Indonesia. A  key step toward expanding our Indian production facilities  was the commissioning of a new, environmentally friendly  foundry in Vambori, which allowed us to double our produc- tion capacity of steel and stainless steel castings in India from  600 tonnes a year to 1,200 tonnes a year. In China, we integrated a new test field into our standard  pump plant, making us equipped at KSB Shanghai Pump Co.  Ltd. for planned growth in the sale of industrial pumps.  Moreover, we established a new foundry for high-quality  stainless steel on location. Starting from 2011, it will produce  high-quality investment cast impellers for power plant and  industrial pumps. We completed construction of our factory for power plant  pumps in Lingang in 2010. As part of a joint venture found- ed together with Shanghai Electric Group Co., Ltd. in 2008  we have begun to produce pumps there that will be used in  Chinas new nuclear power plants.  In Indonesia, we transferred our production, including test  facilities, to a new plant at mid-year. This step allowed us to  adapt our capacities to the strongly growing business of PT.  KSB Indonesia. At the new site, the staff will primarily as- semble products for industry and building services, mining  and the oil and gas industries. GLOBALLY STANDARDISED SYSTEMS In order to integrate and accelerate our business processes  across companies, we continued the migration of our IT sys- tems to the central SAP ERP* System. In the year under review we connected our valve sites in Ger- many to the new system. In the previous year, we had already  migrated the IT systems at our butterfly valve production  sites in France and Spain. Our sales staff can now directly in- itiate production orders in all of our European valve plants.  In addition, we integrated all of KSB Shanghai Pump Co.  Ltd.s sales, production, purchasing, controlling and financial  processes into the central SAP System in 2010. As a key strategic measure, we also started to roll out a new  CRM** system to provide global support for our customer  relationship management. It serves to make complex contacts  with our customers clearer for their contact partners in the  Group. The system allows us to optimally meet our custom- ers requests with offerings from individual plants through- out the world and to follow up on projects. Sales, marketing  and service activities can be managed more efficiently. Initial-  * SEE PAGE 128 (GLOSSARY)  * SEE PAGE 128 (GLOSSARY) ** SEE PAGE 128 (GLOSSARY)  32 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT ly, we rolled out the system in selected sales offices in Ger- many and France and carried out a full rollout in Finland,  the UK and Sweden. By 2012, we will integrate around 50  companies into the CRM system. INNOVATIONS PRESENTED AT 65 TRADE FAIRS In the year under review, we presented our product range to  customers at 65 trade fairs in 27 countries. In addition to  showcasing innovative products for heat transfer or high- pressure applications, the food industry and power stations,  we put a major focus on energy efficiency.  Our energy-efficient motors supplied by the Italian firm   ITACO s.r.l. in Ponte di Nanto, in which we took a majority  stake in mid-2010, met with particular interest. The innova- tive pump drive developed for KSB surpasses even the most  stringent requirements of the EU directives for high-efficiency  motors* and proved effective in initial practical tests. Our new monitoring unit, PumpMeter**, helps customers  identify further savings potential in pump operation by con- tinuously measuring the difference between optimum perfor- mance in terms of energy consumption and the actual  operating conditions. The device, which has won an innova- tion award, has been very well received by the market. ACQUISITIONS STRENGTHEN THE SERVICE BUSINESS To strengthen our position in individual technical areas and  regions, we made acquisitions of smaller service companies in  2010. This included the acquisition of the business operations of a  service provider in the US at the end of the year, which we  incorporated into a newly formed company, Standard Alloys,  Inc., based in Port Arthur, Texas / USA. By bringing on board  this specialist in the modernisation of pumps and the produc- tion of replacement parts we are expanding our service offer- ing, especially for customers in the southern US. In France we acquired Euro Techno Consulting in Montcenis,  a service company for power plant valves. In this way, we  have improved the conditions for successfully handling or- ders for servicing nuclear power plants. These orders are only  awarded to qualified service providers with a regional pres- ence and a sufficient number of qualified employees. Furthermore, in 2010 we acquired a majority interest in   gear-tec GmbH in Eggebek, near Flensburg, a specialist in  services for wind energy systems, thus expanding our exper- tise in the area of renewable energies. This brings the number  of our service locations to 29 in the German market and over  144 worldwide.  * SEE PAGE 127 (GLOSSARY)   ** SEE PAGE 127 (GLOSSARY)  33 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Business Development and Events Net Assets, Financial Position and Results of Operations The development in order intake, sales revenue and earnings  basically confirmed the forecasts we made in last years An- nual Report.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The structure of our income statement changed on a value  basis in the financial year under review. In this context, the  effects of the above-mentioned first-time consolidations de- scribed in more detail in the Notes need to be taken into ac- count. Earnings before taxes The KSB Group generated earnings before taxes of  135.8  million, compared with  172.8 million in 2009, achieving a  return on sales of 7.0 % (previous year: 9.1 %).  Increase in output of operations Total sales revenue increased by 2.5 % due to improved busi- ness development. Work in progress and inventories of fin- ished goods increased by  12.3 million year on year. As a  reduction of inventories was reported in 2009, total output  of operations grew more sharply than sales revenue, amount- ing to  1,953.8 million, or 3.8 % above the prior-year figure  of  1,881.8 million. Change in cost structure  Cost of materials increased by 7.4 % due to factors such as  increasing purchase prices on the supply markets. The in- crease was therefore greater than the change in total output  of operations (+ 3.8 %). The figure of  790.9 million is  equivalent to 40.5 % of total output of operations (previous  year: 39.1 %).  Staff costs rose by 5.1 % to  649.8 million in absolute  terms. In relation to total output of operations, this meant a  moderate increase of 0.4 percentage points to 33.3 %. The  reasons for this were collectively agreed salary increases and  the increase in the number of employees, mainly attributable  to the first-time consolidation of five operating companies.  However, we also increased headcount at KSB AG – as part  of strategic projects – and at our companies in the growth  markets of Brazil and India. The KSB Group employed on  average 290 more people during the year under review. Com- pared with the previous financial year, average output per  employee improved from  131 thousand to  134 thousand. Measured against total output of operations, other operating  expenses changed only slightly (17.4 % compared with 17.2  %). In absolute terms, they increased by  15.8 million to    339.5 million. Higher selling expenses were one of the fac- tors contributing to this development.  As forecast, major investments made in previous years are  now having an impact on depreciation and amortisation ex- pense. This explains the year-on-year change from  43.4  million to  48.1 million.  Financial income / expense declined by  5.8 million overall.  Higher interest income was offset by increased interest ex- pense (the interest on the loan against a borrowers note tak- en out at the end of 2009 had to be borne for the first time  for 12 months in the year under review) and an increase in  impairment losses on financial assets.  Earnings after taxes  The income tax rate rose by 4.6 percentage points, up from  29.2 % in 2009 to 33.8 %. As a result, the fall in earnings  after income taxes to  90.0 million (previous year:  122.4  million) was more substantial (– 26.5 %) than the change in  earnings before income taxes (– 21.4 %).  Earnings attributable to non-controlling interest fell from    14.7 million to  12.5 million, but rose slightly relative to  earnings after income taxes (13.9 % compared with 12.0 %  in the previous year).  At  77.4 million, earnings attributable to shareholders of  KSG AG were thus 28.0 % lower than in the previous year   ( 107.6 million). Earnings per share  Earnings per ordinary share were  44.09, compared with    61.32 in the previous year, and  44.35 per preference  share, compared with  61.58 in 2009.  NET ASSETS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Decline in consolidated earnings    Stable distribution of dividends at KSB AG   Another significant improvement in net financial position  34 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT Decline in earnings also at parent company KSB AG KSB AG generated pre-tax earnings (in accordance with  HGB) of  39.8 million, down 14 % from the previous year  ( 46.3 million). While sales revenue (+1.3 %) was just  slightly above the prior-year level, total output of operations  could no longer achieve the level of 2009, dropping 0.5 %  due to smaller increases in inventories compared with the  previous year, among other things. High dividend Despite the decline in earnings, we aim to keep the dividend  at a high level. We will therefore be proposing to the Annual  General Meeting on 18 May 2011 the distribution of a divi- dend of  12.00 per ordinary share and  12.26 per prefer- ence share (including a preference dividend right of  0.26),  as in the previous year.  Segment results In line with our management and reporting structures, our  segment reporting format is by business unit. In the Business Unit Pumps we achieved an increase in order  intake of 5.3 %. Sales revenue rose by 2.5 %. We generated  EBIT of  121.6 million (compared with  129.8 million in  2009).  The Business Unit Valves reported just over 9 % more orders  and a 4.6 % increase in sales revenue. EBIT, at  10.1 mil- lion, was below the figure for the previous financial year of    11.2 million.  The Business Unit Service posted strong growth, with order  intake up 16.4 % and sales revenue up 18.0 %. However,  EBIT generated only increased from  26.9 million to  30.5  million due to special charges in Belgium.  The effects presented in the reconciliation line related to the  recognition of construction contracts under IAS 11 have de- clined sharply. This applies to both sales revenue ( – 42.4  million) and EBIT ( – 31.1 million).

We base the nature and scope of  all financial transactions exclusively on the requirements of  our business. The aim of our financial management is to en- sure liquidity at all times and to finance our activities at opti- mum conditions. In financing our export business, we hedge  foreign exchange and credit risks to the greatest extent pos- sible. We continuously improve our receivables management  methods with the goal of settling our outstanding amounts  by their due dates.  Hedging financial risks Our primary tool for minimising the foreign exchange risks  inherent in our export business are currency forwards. This  applies both to transactions already recognised and to future  cash flows from orders on hand that are still being processed.  We transact most of our foreign currency business in US dol- lars. There is only a relatively low volume of foreign currency  liabilities.  We reduce the risks resulting from changes in prices on the  procurement side for orders with extended delivery dates by  agreeing cost escalation clauses or, in the case of fixed-price  contracts, by including the expected rate of cost increases in  our sales price.  We limit the risk of default by taking out credit insurance,  arranging advance and partial payments, and agreeing bank  guarantees. To ensure long-term liquidity, we agree on pay- ment terms and conditions with our customers in the project  business that reflect the cost trend curves of order completion  as far as possible.  We take account of the risks from short-term fluctuations in  cash flows by agreeing sufficient lines of credit with our  banks. In order to be able to provide the necessary securities,  appropriate guarantee volumes are also made available. Ad- equate proportions are confirmed for a period of more than  one year. Our cash credit and guarantee credit lines amount  to around  888 million. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the following comments  on the financial situation relate to the published prior-year  figures. Equity The KSB Groups equity amounts to  825.6 million. This in- cludes KSB AGs subscribed capital of  44.8 million. Capital  reserve amounts to  66.7 million. Revenue reserves total    602.5 million, including earnings after taxes attributable to  shareholders of KSB AG of  77.4 million.  111.6 million  are attributable to non-controlling interest. Despite the sig- nificant  215.9 million (13.1 %) rise in total equity and li- abilities, the equity ratio once again improved (44.4 %; pre- vious year: 43.8 %). Taking into account the reclassification  of advances received from customers and parts of advances  received  from customers (PoC) as well as the first-time con- solidations, the increase in total equity and liabilities would  have been  151.1 million or 8.8 % year on year. The equity  ratio would then have increased by 2.3 percentage points. Non-controlling interest relates mainly to KSB Pumps Ltd. / India ( 39.7 million), PAB GmbH / Germany ( 18.1 mil- lion), KSB Shanghai Pump Co. Ltd. / China ( 11.0 million),  GIW Industries, Inc. / USA ( 9.7 million), KSB America   Corporation / USA ( 9.4 million) and SISTO Armaturen  S.A. / Luxembourg ( 5.2 million). Liabilities The largest item under liabilities are provisions for employee  benefits, including, also as the largest item, pension provi- sions. These were increased by 4.1 % to  245.4 million as at  the reporting date. A large number of the pension plans cur- rently in use in the KSB Group are defined benefit models.  We have been reducing the associated risks, such as demo- graphic changes, inflation and salary increases, since 2009,  for example by introducing defined contribution plans for  new employees. Our obligations for current pensioners and vested benefits of  employees who have left the company account for just over  half of the amount recognised in the balance sheet. The rest  relates to defined benefit obligations for our current employ- ees, who have an average remaining working life of about 15  years.  36 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT The remaining provisions for employee benefits, which, in  contrast to pension provisions, are predominantly short-term,  fell from  143.8 million to  134.9 million as a result of a  decline in partial retirement and profit bonus obligations.  Other provisions include long-term components of  15.6  million for warranty obligations. The excess relates to provi- sions for mainly short-term uncertain liabilities. Non-current liabilities fell significantly from  160.1 million  to  109.6 million. The reason for this is in particular the  early redemption of loans that we had taken out in the previ- ous year in order to secure the liquidity of the Group in the  event of a prolonged crisis.  Current liabilities increased substantially. In addition to trade  payables, there was also a substantial increase of   + 59.6  million in advance payments received that were reclassified as  liabilities.  As the increase is greater than the increase in total  equity and liabilities, the share of current liabilities in total  equity rose to 21.8 %.  Contingencies and commitments The KSB Groups off-balance sheet contingent liabilities  totalled  13.3 million as at the reporting date (previous  year:  17.4 million). These arise mainly from collateral and  performance guarantees. There are no other extraordinary obligations and commit- ments beyond the reporting date. Other obligations and com- mitments fall within the scope of what is needed to continue  business operations, such as obligations from long-term rent- al, lease and services agreements (in particular information  technology and telecommunications) and from purchase  commitments. Liquidity The KSB Groups net financial position, i.e. the difference be- tween interest-bearing financial assets on the one hand and  financial liabilities on the other, once again improved signifi- cantly from  223.0 million in 2009 to  293.0 million as a  result of our systematic liquidity management. SOURCES AND APPLICATION OF FUNDS Cash flows from operating activities amounted to  162.1  million, a year-on-year decrease of  50.2 million. Cash flows  were impacted by the reduction in earnings and a larger  amount of funds tied down in receivables. Resources were  freed up primarily through an increase both in advances re- ceived from customers and in liabilities. The volume of our investment activity was considerably re- duced compared with the previous year, leading to total cash  flows of  – 91.6 million (previous year:  – 99.4 million). Cash flows from financing activities changed from  + 127.4  million to  – 88.3 million due to the redemption of bank  loans. In the previous year this figure was affected by bor- rowings and a loan against borrowers note.   NET FINANCIAL POSITION 2010 2009 + 424.1 – 131.1 + 418.2 – 195.2 Borrowings (m) Investments (m)  37 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Net Assets, Financial Position and Results of Operations The KSB Groups cash and cash equivalents from all cash  flows together changed only insignificantly, from  409.8 mil- lion to  407.6 million (including  18.9 million of restricted  cash used to secure credit balances for partial retirement ob- ligations, compared with  16.1 million in the previous year),  although this includes changes in exchange rates.  We assume that, in future, we will continue to be able to  meet our outgoing payments largely from operating cash  flow. From todays perspective, we are therefore not planning  any additional external financing measures. NET ASSETS Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the following comments  on net assets relate to the published prior-year figures. Our total assets rose by 13.1 % to  1,861.3 million. This is  mainly due to an increase in non-current assets as well as an  increase in receivables and other assets. In addition, this in- cludes the above-mentioned reclassifications and first-time  consolidations (the latter resulted in an effect of  8.6 mil- lion). Around 28 % is attributable to fixed assets, as in the previ- ous year. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment  with a historical cost of  968.5 million have carrying  amounts of  449.4 million. Investments in property, plant  and equipment in the year under review amounted to  67.8  million, considerably below the prior-year figure of  85.3  million, but still in excess of depreciation ( 44.7 million).  The highest additions relate to other equipment, operating  and office equipment ( 21.0 million), and to plants and ma- chinery ( 20.2 million). The focus of our investment activi- ties was, as in the previous year, the Region Europe, predomi- nantly Germany and France. Outside Europe, the highest  additions were made at our plants in India, China, Indonesia,  Brazil and the USA. We maintained our policies for measur- ing depreciation and amortisation in the year under review.  We increased our investments in financial assets year on year;  loans in particular increased by some  8 million compared  with the previous year. However, growth amounted to only    4.2 million overall due to the decline in the carrying  amounts of the investments in affiliates and other equity in- vestments. Additions, predominantly resulting from the in- crease in our stake in an Italian motor manufacturer, were  more than offset by effects from the first-time consolidation  of six companies and by write-downs as a result of impair- ment tests. The write-downs basically relate to companies in  Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.  Taking into account the above-mentioned reclassification of  advances received from customers and the first-time consoli- dations, inventories increased by 5.9 % to  324.5 million,  mainly as a result of the growing business volume. They tied  up around 17 % of our resources. This is slightly down from  the adjusted prior-year figure (18 %) because there was a  greater change in total assets.  As a result of the increased sales revenue, in particular to- wards the end of the year, trade receivables were more than    60 million above the prior-year value at the end of the re- porting period. Along with an increase in orders on hand  (more than  1.1 billion at the end of 2010), the value of cus- tomer orders in progress, measured according to the percent- age of completion method, not including PoC advance pay- ments, increased by  10.3 million. As a result, receivables  and other current assets made up around 32 % of total assets  (previous year 30 %), taking into account the change in the  total assets.   38 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT Cash and cash equivalents account for around 22 % of assets  (previous year: appro. 25 %). This change can be attributed  solely to the increase in total assets because, despite the early  redemption of loans, we were able to keep the absolute value  of cash and cash equivalents virtually constant. Inflation and Exchange Rate Effects There are no companies within the Group whose financial  statements were required to be adjusted for the effects of in- flation.  The translation of financial statements of consolidated com- panies that are not prepared in euros gave rise to a difference  of  + 39.1 million. This was taken directly to equity.  SUMMARY OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION OF THE GROUP  Despite the negative effects on the financial performance,  which we had anticipated, the economic situation of the KSB  Group remained stable at a high level at the end of financial  year 2010. We therefore have a good basis for achieving con- tinued business success in the coming years. PRINCIPLES OF THE REMUNERATION SYSTEM FOR THE  BOARD OF MANAGEMENT The remuneration of the Board of Management consists of  fixed and variable components. The amount of the fixed re- muneration is governed primarily by the function and re- sponsibility assigned to the member of the Board of Manage- ment. The fixed remuneration component consists of a fixed  sum plus benefits as well as pension commitments (retire- ment, occupational disability and widows and orphans pen- sion). The fixed basic salary is paid monthly; the benefits in- clude the private use of a company car, coverage of insurance  premiums and any payments for a post-contractual restraint  on competition. The variable remuneration component is  linked to the return on sales for the financial year in ques- tion. The Board members also receive variable remuneration  components which serve as a long-term incentive. These de- pend on a consideration of the growth in earnings over a   period of three years based on the economic added value  method.  The total amount of the variable components is limited, to  take account of extraordinary, unforeseeable developments.  No stock options or other share-based payment arrange- ments are granted to members of the Board of Management. The additional possibility of a premium, to be paid out at the  discretion of the Supervisory Board, of no more than three  monthly salary payments per financial year in recognition of  the special performance of individual members of the Board  of Management was also recently created. Such decisions will  be made on an irregular, i.e. not necessarily annual, basis. DEPENDENT COMPANY REPORT The Board of Management has submitted the dependent  company report to the Supervisory Board. This concludes  with the following declaration: In accordance with section  312(3) of the AktG [Aktiengesetz – German Public Compa- nies Act], we declare that our company – on the basis of the  circumstances known to us at the time when the transactions  were made or the measures were either taken or not taken –  received adequate compensation and was not disadvantaged  by the fact that the measures were either taken or not taken. INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM (DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO  SECTION 315(2), NO. 5 OF THE HGB) Our internal control system (ICS) serves to ensure that regu- lar financial reports and consolidated financial statements are  properly prepared. Key elements of the ICS are – in addition  to the risk management system that is described in detail  elsewhere in this management report – guidelines and regula- tions which include, among other things, standard account- ing and valuation policies. They must be applied to the full  extent by all Group companies. There is a clear separation of  functions and the four-eye principle is applied. Reviews of   39 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Net Assets, Financial Position and Results of Operations our Internal Audits departments ensure that this happens.  Our accounting practices also include regular analytical plau- sibility checks using time series analyses and actual/budget  variance analyses. These reviews enable us to identify signifi- cant changes early on, which we then examine for accounting  and valuation discrepancies. The results are discussed at  management level. Our ICS is subject to a continuous development and im- provement process, and we are in regular contact with our  auditors. We analyse current financial reporting issues togeth- er, such as, for example, announced changes to the account- ing regulations. If it becomes necessary to adapt existing  guidelines or codes or issue new ones, this is done promptly  and communicated to the entire Group. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECLARATION  We will make our updated Corporate Governance Declara- tion pursuant to Section 289a of the HGB accessible to the  public from 31 March 2011 at www.ksb.com > Investor Re- lations > Corporate Governance Declaration. In addition to  the Corporate Governance Report (including the Statement  of Compliance in accordance with section 161 of the German  Public Companies Act), the Corporate Governance Declara- tion includes relevant information on corporate governance  practices applied at KSB AG that go beyond statutory re- quirements. Also described are the working methods of the  Board of Management and Supervisory Board, and the com- position and working methods of the committees of the su- pervisory Board. REPORT ON EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD The tragic events in Japan have cast a new light on the dis- cussion of the use of nuclear power as a source of energy. It is  still too early to assess the extent to which this will have an  impact on orders for energy industry components such as  pumps and valves. In principle, KSB offers products suitable  for all forms of energy conversion. Should the share of global  electricity supplies accounted for by nuclear power fall in the  future, this would necessarily drive up demand for conven- tional power plants or renewable energy facilities. From to- days perspective, such a trend towards substitution would  not put KSB at a disadvantage.   40 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT The achievements of our research and development are the  basis for KSBs technological leadership, which we put to  good use in a wide range of applications for pumps, valves  and related systems. In addition to the innovative capacity of  our engineers and technicians, one of the keys to our success  is our project-oriented collaboration with universities and in- stitutions of higher education.  In 2010, as in the past, we  took advantage of partnerships like these for a number of  technical projects.  MAKING PUMPS TRANSPARENT  Unlike most modern machinery, pumps do not yet have elec- tronic displays that give their users up-to-the-minute operat- ing data. Without this information, it is not possible to check  whether the units are operating within the desired perfor- mance range and with the minimum drive energy. To put an  end to working blindly in this way, in 2010 we developed  PumpMeter, a monitoring device that can be factory-mount- ed on any pump. It lets operators know whether their units  are working efficiently and with minimum wear and tear. In  addition, the device analyses the pump operating data to see  whether it would make economic sense to use an energy-sav- ing variable speed system. We successfully launched this in- novative metering device in the market in 2010.  The use of high-efficiency motors, which we have been pro- moting for several years, aims at utilising drive energy more  efficiently. In 2010 we transposed this technology to the drive  system of our wet-installed waste water pumps. This step was  a technical challenge, as water-tight electric motors need spe- cial sealing systems and combined motor / pump bearings,  which suffer greater friction losses than the ball bearings of  standard motors. This meant it was harder to meet the re- quirements of the highest efficiency class (IE3*) with a sub- mersible motor. We succeeded in the year under review, how- ever, by optimising the electrical and magnetic design of our  KRT pump series up to a drive rating of 150 kW. The new  motors we developed in-house are mechanically and electri- cally optimised for the requirements of the hydraulic compo- nents in waste water pumps.  VIRTUAL TEST RUNS  When custom-designed engineered pumps are built, test runs  are required to check whether the guaranteed operating data  are actually met. Manufacturing tolerances occur more fre- quently with impellers that have very large diameters. These  tolerances call for mechanical finishing of the impeller to en- sure its energy-efficient operation. To date, this may have ne- cessitated reassembling the pump and checking it on the test  rig several times.  To eliminate the need for these steps in future, KSB specialists  are currently developing a method of entering the three-  dimensional data of the supplied pump components into a  computer and simulating their contours. This should allow  them to carry out virtual test runs on the computer instead of  on the test rig.  USE IN SOLAR THERMAL APPLICATIONS  The power stations being built in the deserts of the world to  convert solar energy into usable thermal energy place high  demands on the design and the materials of the pumps used.  Huge reflector panels collect the sunlight and heat a liquid  which passes on its heat to a water circuit. Unlike conven- tional power plants, in which the liquid remains at a virtually  constant temperature, even over a period of years, these pow- er plants experience substantial temperature fluctuations  ranging from sub-zero temperatures at night to 375 C dur- ing the day when the suns power is at its highest. In order to  provide the right pumps, based on proven product series, for  such extreme operating conditions, we carried out intensive  stress and strength analyses on our boiler recirculation  pumps in 2010 and improved their design. The results show  that we have pumps ideally suited to solar thermal energy   applications*, which we have already been able to sell for a  major project.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT    Developing the transparent pump    Impeller tests by computer simulation    New materials for lowering costs   * SEE PAGE 127 (GLOSSARY)  * SEE PAGE 127 (GLOSSARY)  41 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Research and Development  IDEAL WORKING ENVIRONMENT FOR EVERY PUMP  A significant contribution to a pumps smooth and cost-effec- tive operation is made by ensuring the pump environment is  appropriate. This is where our hydraulic engineers can bring  their technical expertise to bear and advise customers on the  design of intake structures, for example. With computer-aid- ed flow analysis and model testing, they help to find the best  compromise between cost-saving design and the optimum  layout of the structures from the hydraulic perspective. Cus- tomers took advantage of this service in 2010 for the large- scale waste water pumping station of La Caldera in Mexi- co City.  SHUT-OFF VALVES FOR MARINE APPLICATIONS  Aiming to consolidate our position as manufacturers of ma- rine valves, we developed a range of special shut-off butterfly  valves for use in the transport of ballast water as well as hy- drocarbons and liquefied gases. These applications impose  very high design requirements on the valves, as the operating  conditions onboard a ship are considerably tougher than  those in comparable systems on land.  IRON INSTEAD OF COBALT  As an alloy component, cobalt plays a part in increasing  wear resistance and temperature stability in high-alloy metal- lic materials. In pumps and valves, such alloys are welded to  critical wear points to make them more resistant.  However,  cobalt is in high demand because of its excellent properties  and is one of the more costly metals. With the aim of avoid- ing bottlenecks in the procurement of this material, we exam- ined the possibility of using cobalt-free substitute alloys  based on iron. We tested characteristics such as resistance to  wear and corrosion, which is of major importance for pumps  and valves. The results of our research are highly promising  and are set to be continued.  EXPENDITURE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  In 2010 we invested some  41 million (previous year: some   34 million) in research and development, which accounts  for about 2.1 % of our sales revenue. In the year under re- view, 422 of our employees (previous year: 414) were in- volved in research and development activities in locations in  Europe, Asia and the Americas.  Using a working model, KSB hy- draulic engineers demonstrate how  solid deposits can be prevented at  a Mexican sewage plant.  42 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT If we want to provide our customers with innovative prod- ucts and attractive services, we need the very best employees.  We seek such employees out around the world, foster them  and give them the opportunity to develop their skills in a  professional, highly cooperative work environment.  INCREASE IN NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES   At the end of 2010, KSB had 14,697 employees around the  world, 448 more than in the previous year. This growth in  staff is mainly attributable to the first-time consolidation of  five operating companies in Germany, Italy, Canada, Norway  and Russia. Staff was also added at KSB AG which launched  numerous strategic projects, as well as at two companies in  Brazil and India.  EMPLOYEES – TOTAL 2010 2009 14,697 14,249 Source: DIW Berlin EMPLOYEES – BY REGION Europe  55 % Asia / Pacific  25 % Americas  14 % Middle East / Africa  6 % COMPETITION FOR TALENT  Demographic changes pose new challenges for our human  resources department, particularly in Germany. In the Demo- graphic Fitness project launched in late 2010, we are devel- oping analytical methods for identifying location-based prob- lems associated with the aging population and limiting their  impact on KSB. Part of this involves finding suitable young  talent at an early stage; at the same time we want to give our  more senior staff the opportunity to extend their professional  lives.  We maintain close contact with students in the disciplines  that are important for our activities so that we can recruit  well educated, qualified graduates in the near future. Our  partnerships with technical universities such as those in the  German cities of Kaiserslautern, Karlsruhe and Leipzig help  us in our search for engineers. At university job fairs, we  show potential young talent which options are available for  starting a career at KSB.  In Germany, we satisfy our need for specialists and commer- cial staff to a large extent through our own vocational train- ing programme. Over the past few years we have continuous- ly increased the number of trainee positions, which reached  327 during the year under review. In 2010 we invested  around  8.5 million in this area, including expenses for  equipping our training facilities. All in all, we are currently  training young people in 13 different vocations. Methodo- logical skills and social learning form core components of the  training programme.  To determine the best candidates for key positions we use the  opportunities offered by international recruitment. In 2010  we began standardising these around the world. Defined tar- get processes, uniform quality standards and transparent re- sponsibilities are desigend to help fill these vacancies quickly  and more efficiently.

They  can take advantage of an in-house training portfolio featur- ing foreign language courses, commercial and technical train- ing, IT seminars and personal development events. In 2010  some 4,600 participants took part in 525 seminars and train- ing sessions from this portfolio. Employees also made use of  learning opportunities offered via electronic media. E-learn- ing enables each and every participant to choose when and  how quickly they want to study, specify what topics they  wish to focus on and repeat content as often as they want.  One key focus of staff development activities during the year  under review was to train employees to become project man- agers. This will make it easier for us to use uniform processes  and professional methods to guide our strategic plans to suc- cess. With that goal in mind, prospective project managers  also completed their qualifications in line with the standards  of the International Project Management Association*.  DEVELOPING THE CORPORATE CULTURE EVEN FURTHER  We want to base our actions within the Group on clearly de- fined values and rules of conduct. The values that guide our  work and the way we act and interact with each other are  trust, responsibility, professionalism, honesty and apprecia- tion. We consider these to be a part of our corporate culture  and believe that in developing this culture even further, we  also contribute to our economic success.  In 2010 some 300 employees debated the concrete meaning  of these corporate values in value dialogues. During the  sessions, these employees discussed with their managers how  they relate to the corporate values personally and what rel- evance the values possess with regard to their business activi- ties. External facilitators structured and guided the process.  In addition, managers with leadership functions attended  special seminars where they focused on value-based leader- ship.  Regular feedback, provided both by department heads to  their staff and also by staff to their managers, contributes to  the KSB leadership culture. Following its success in Argen- tina, Germany and Finland, the anonymous Leadership  Feedback initiative was organised on a global scale for the  first time in 2010. The results show managers how their be- haviour is perceived by employees and how they can improve  their work as managers.  OUR EMPLOYEES SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENTS  2010 was a tough financial year plagued by crisis and yet  throughout it all, our employees showed great flexibility in  responding to changing market requirements. Some employ- ees in underutilised areas made use of their working time ac- counts to reduce or prevent short-time work. Our sales staff  made good use of generally lower market potentials to stabi- lise the order situation; production staff quickly re-adjusted  to increasing volumes in standard business during the second  half of the year. At the same time, employees implemented  our new organisation and many of them contributed toward  the implementation of strategic projects. This achievement  deserves our respect and our gratitude.   * SEE PAGE 127 (GLOSSARY) We also provide vocational training  to qualify young people for skilled  metalworking jobs.  44 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT As an employer, consumer, supplier and neighbour, KSB also  has a responsibility to society. This includes using sustainable  business practices that take environmental and employee-re- lated issues into consideration as well as a long-term social  commitment. We arrange our own activities and make dona- tions to promote measures that are important to society as  well as to alleviate hardship. Our sustainability principles are  an integral part of our corporate policy and benchmarks that  guide our actions. They apply at all locations and for all  companies within the KSB Group.  In April 2010, KSB signed the UN Global Compact*, an ini- tiative of the United Nations. This initiative aims to give glo- balisation a more social and also more ecological form. Upon  joining, we committed ourselves to implementing the initia- tives ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour  standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption  within our company. We aspire to improve continuously and  take practical measures to substantiate this. Likewise, we also  demand that our business partners uphold these principles.  We take the same approach in applying the core conventions  of the International Labour Organisation (ILO**).  ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY WORK AND PRODUCTION   At KSB, environmental protection begins at the point when  we design our production processes and look at their impact  on material and energy consumption. At all of our plants we  strive to produce our pumps, valves and related systems in a  manner that is as energy-efficient as it is environmentally  friendly. With this in mind we regularly review our environ- mental protection measures and improve continuously. One  aspect of conserving our natural resources is to correctly sep- arate waste materials and recycle raw materials. We got sev- eral such projects off the ground in 2010.  We try to guarantee that water is used sparingly by using it  multiple times wherever possible. In Lille, France, we  launched a model project to harvest rainwater. A conduit sys- tem transports runoff water from the plants roof into three  containers that can each hold a volume of 10,000 litres.  These supply the test station and sanitary facilities, which  saves a considerable amount of drinking water. We will im- plement this concept at additional sites in the years to come.  To cut our energy consumption we are using more and more  energy-saving light bulbs in our workshops, warehouses and  offices. We also replace old, less efficient machines and de- vices with modern equipment that has better efficiency levels.  As part of this, one focus in 2010 was on modernisation  measures in India, which included the installation of energy- saving lighting systems. At the Lingang site in China, we started up KSBs very first  geothermal heat pump system during the year under review.  This system uses the Earths natural capacity to store heat in  order to heat and cool buildings. Compared with standard  systems, use of the geothermal heat pump cuts energy costs  by around 30 %.  During the past few years, we have made an ongoing effort  to gradually certify our sites around the world in accordance  with the ISO 14001* environmental standard; in 2010 seven  additional production and service sites were added in Ger- many, Italy, the Netherlands and the USA. We are also in- creasingly demanding that our suppliers provide evidence of  their certification under this internationally recognised stand- ard as well.  SAVING ENERGY, REDUCING CO 2 EMISSIONS  Today many customers demand products with low energy  consumption, from the perspective of not only economic con- siderations but environmental aspects as well. We meet cus- tomers expectations by providing pumps with high efficiency  levels as well as automation systems that help identify and  make use of potential for saving energy. In research and de- velopment, we are working on additional solutions which si- multaneously reduce the use of energy resources and cut op- erating costs.  One of the countries where our energy-efficient pumps are  experiencing growing demand is India. There, in response to  the scarcity of energy, a large-scale government programme  has been initiated with the objective of replacing units which  consume large amounts of energy with more efficient ma- CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   Membership in the UN Global Compact   Resource-saving production processes    Products with greater energy efficiency   * SEE PAGE 127 (GLOSSARY)  * www.ksb.com/global-compact     ** SEE PAGE 128 (GLOSSARY)  * SEE PAGE 127 (GLOSSARY)  45 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility chines. At the same time, these measures also aim to slow  down growth in carbon dioxide emissions. Of the pump  types produced in our plants in India, 51 already meet the re- quirements of the two strictest of the countrys five efficiency  classes.  Reducing greenhouse gases is a global objective pursued by  many companies around the world. As a result, suppliers like  KSB should be able to provide information regarding the  amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) released during production  of their products. We have been providing this information,  known as the carbon footprint*, for a series of pumps  made in France since 2007. CO2 information about our but- terfly valves has also been available since 2010. We expect  that customers will require this kind of information more  and more frequently in the future and will continue our ef- forts to determine the figures for additional products as well.  To play a part in helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions,  we have joined an environmental protection initiative in Aus- tria and also help cities and communities to make their con- tribution.  FURTHER INCREASE IN SAFETY AT THE WORKPLACE  Within the scope of our integrated management approach,  we look at the connections between environmental protec- tion, occupational safety and employee health. One example  of this is our avoidance of hazardous materials. Moreover,  we consider occupational health and safety to be a key aspect  of identifying risks at an early stage and preventing accidents  and other damage to employees health. Our objective is to  make the workplaces of all employees as safe as possible.  In 2010 we focused on this at our companies in the Ameri- cas. In Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and the United States,  some 30 measures were implemented at 10 locations with the  goal of reducing the number of accidents in workshops and  warehouses. Measures taken included marking danger zones,  mandating the use of protective equipment and improving  lighting at work stations. In addition, we took several steps  to increase the safety of Brazilian sites, such as installing new  fire-fighting systems.  MAINTAINING GOOD HEALTH THROUGH PREVENTIVE  MEASURES AND SPORT  In addition to workplace safety measures, we use preventive  measures to promote the good health of our employees. Dur- ing the year under review, our companys medical services in  Germany alone performed around 2,000 medical check-ups  and administered 450 flu shots. We also consider our compa- ny-internal athletic offering to be a contribution toward  maintaining the good health of our employees. In Italy, where  our company was named one of the 100 best employers in  2009, we set up a 100 m2 fitness studio for staff at one of our  sites. Trainees in Germany benefit from special fitness pro- grammes where they also learn how to correctly lift and car- ry heavy objects to prevent musculoskeletal damage.  People doing computer work frequently only put weight on  one side of their spinal columns, which can lead to back pain.  To address this problem, we have launched a programme in  Germany which specially targets those employees who work  in the office. Over the Internet, participants receive video in- structions for exercises aimed at relaxation and strengthening  up to three times a day. These can be done right at their  desks. So far around 400 employees are taking part in this  programme. NEEDS-BASED OFFERINGS FOR FAMILIES  As a family-friendly company, we offer our employees ways  in which they can better harmonise their professional lives  with their personal obligations. The precise needs that exist  in this area are determined through internal surveys. Depend- Internal provisions for screen  workers include regular eye tests.   * SEE PAGE 127 (GLOSSARY)  46 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT ing on the familys particular circumstances, we can help find  childcare or nursing services for relatives. In Germany we  collaborate both with partners at our locations as well as  with agencies that operate nationwide. In addition we offer  operational measures to assist employees who find them- selves in difficult circumstances.  COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION AND HELP FOR DISASTER  VICTIMS  Our social initiatives are especially geared toward ensuring  that children and young people – who we see as our employ- ees of the future – receive an adequate education. Conse- quently we are a founding member of and actively involved  in the Wissensfabrik – Unternehmen fr Deutschland  [Knowledge Factory – Companies for Germany] initiative,  where we help foster childrens linguistic and natural science  skills. In 2010, for instance, we provided several elementary  schools with materials that playfully spark childrens interest  in topics related to technology and natural science. Moreover,  in the Storyteller Workshop project we offered additional  training for teachers who shape childrens linguistic experi- ences at the pre-school age.  In Asia, too, we make an ongoing commitment toward pro- moting better education. Via the KSB CARE* relief fund we  support several school projects in China, Indonesia and Viet- nam which enable better learning for children. At the same  time, KSB CARE also helps renovate old sanitary facilities in  schools in India and build new ones.  In the event of natural disasters as well, we donate money  and make contributions in kind. Together, KSB and its em- ployees contributed  100,000 in donations for the victims of  flooding in Pakistan. Our Pakistani company coordinated  how these funds were used to ensure that food, medicine and  drinking water reached the people affected as quickly as pos- sible. We not only helped set up water filtration systems but  we also assisted with the reconstruction of infirmaries and  schools. Furthermore, KSB employees in Pakistan took part  in relief campaigns and gave shelter to the homeless.  Company donations are also made for the benefit of children,  youths and the socially disadvantaged at our German sites.  This was the aim of our 2010 campaign, Donations instead  of presents, in which we granted financial assistance to in- stitutions and projects in Frankenthal, Pegnitz and Halle be- fore Christmas.   * SEE PAGE 127 (GLOSSARY)  47 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Risk Management As a group with global operations, the KSB Group is exposed  to both global and regional risks. To achieve our business ob- jectives, it is necessary to be aware of the various risks and to  limit them. We do this with the help of a Group-wide risk  management system that is part of our management system.  Under the terms of the Risk Management Manual, all Group  companies are responsible for identifying and assessing risks  and reporting these to Group headquarters. They must also  initiate countermeasures to avert or limit any damage. Only  through the systematic management of risks can opportuni- ties for profit-oriented growth be leveraged responsibly.  The management of opportunities and risks involves first   and foremost Controlling, Finance and Accounting as well as   Internal Audits. Relevant guidelines on organisation and   implementation have been issued.  Accounting is responsible for preparing the annual and con- solidated financial statements, according to subprocesses  clearly defined in advance. As part of the planning and reporting process, Controlling  and Finance and Accounting systematically identify docu- ment the opportunities and risks associated with each operat- ing area. In addition, they carry out results analyses on an  ongoing basis and report each month to the Board of Man- agement. Twice a year, the individual business operations re- port on the current situation as well as foreseeable develop- ments.  If necessary, measures are then initiated to take  advantage of new opportunities and manage recognised risks.  The Internal Audits department is integrated in the control- ling processes. It is kept informed and plans its audits in such  a way that priority is placed on examining units with a risk  potential. The auditors also ensure that all operating units  observe guidelines and actively and regularly take part in risk  management.  Information on recognised risks and the countermeasures in- troduced in response forms an integral part of reporting to  the Board of Management and the Audit Committee of the  Supervisory Board. In this process, we identify and communi- cate risks in line with the following categories:  MARKET / COMPETITION  The global financial and economic crisis affected most of the  sectors in which KSB operates. There was a risk that the re- sulting falloff in demand might take a firm hold, leading to  lasting underutilisation of our production facilities. This risk  was significantly reduced in 2010 with the change in the eco- nomic climate and increased willingness to invest on the part  of many customers. By the second half of the year, short-time  working, which had been used selectively as a tool, was no  longer necessary.  In 2010, our plants producing goods for building services  and industrial applications moved back closer to their pre- crisis production levels. In the business with pumps for the  energy industry, there will be a lag before the economic turn- around has an effect on order placements, meaning that pres- sure on the sales prices of our products will continue. In our  production of valves for liquefied gas transport systems,  which also saw low capacity utilisation in 2010, we expect  an improvement for the current and the following year. The trend for some economies to close off their markets to  foreign providers may continue. We are responding to this  development by intensifying our creation of local added   value.  Overall, we expect the market risks resulting from the finan- cial and economic crisis to continue to decrease during the  current and the following year. The political upheaval in North Africa may result in a tem- porary reduction in order placements. However, this will not  have a material effect on our overall business, as sales in the  affected countries represent only a small proportion of that  business. PRODUCTS / PROJECTS  Technology and prices that reflect market requirements are  vital prerequisites for a successful future. For this reason, we  RISK MANAGEMENT    Crisis-related market risks reduced   Financial flexibility with high reserves   Rising prices for raw materials  48 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT are constantly reviewing our product portfolio. Pumps,  valves and systems that no longer meet our technical require- ments are quickly replaced with new or improved versions  that generally offer a higher level of customer benefits. To be  able to offer these products at competitive market prices, cost  considerations are a crucial part of our design and engineer- ing work. At the same time, in our development process we  ensure that the materials we select do not have negative im- pacts on the environment. In 2010, we responded to our customers requirement to  make increasing use of energy-efficient motors by acquiring a  majority interest in the Italian company ITACO s.r.l. This  company offers an innovative drive technology that enables  substantial efficiency gains in combination with KSB variable  speed systems. Moreover, the motors come without rare  earths*, a usual requirement for high-efficiency drives. Such  materials are expected to be subject to supply bottlenecks  and higher costs.  There are no significant risks that could result from any tech- nical problems in our products.  FINANCES / LIQUIDITY  In some cases, the financial and economic crisis had an effect  on customers ability to make payments. To minimise the re- sulting default risks, we monitor our incoming payments on  an ongoing basis. This allows us to respond quickly and  adapt our receivables management appropriately. There were  no major payment defaults in 2010, which confirms the ef- fectiveness of our measures. We will continue our strict re- ceivables management system and continue to require ad- vance and partial payments, especially in the large-scale  projects business. We reduce risks from having payment flows  in different currencies by means of foreign exchange hedges.  To this end, we mainly use forward currency contracts for  transactions that have already been recognised and for future  cash flows from orders still to be processed. We did not have to draw on the loan against a borrowers  note placed in the previous year to finance our operating  business in 2010. We were also able to finance our strategic  projects using our own funds and also make early repay- ments of loans. In the current year and the following year as  well we expect to make at most partial use of our full finan- cial resources, and therefore have access to a considerable  cushion of liquidity.   PROCUREMENT  The framework conditions on the supply markets became  somewhat more difficult during the year under review. In- creasing production in markets such as China and India  meant that at times we had to pay higher purchase prices for  the finished and raw materials we needed than in 2009.  If the global economic recovery continues during the current  year, then prices for these goods can be expected to increase  further. Procurement bottlenecks may also be encountered.  To respond to this risk, we have secured additional sources of  supply, primarily in Asia. However, the economic recovery  will also increase our ability to pass on higher material costs  to customers via price adjustments. TECHNOLOGY / RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  During the past financial year, we intensified our activities in  research and development. In particular, the Group organisa- tion introduced at the start of 2010 fosters product-related  innovation.  When developing our products, we aim to recognise technical  and market-related risks in good time. Sales employees are  involved in key development phases to ensure that the latest  findings from the market flow directly into the process.  Where necessary, we respond to these findings with design  changes. In order to shorten the time from the development  of new products to their rollout on the market, we made ap- propriate changes to our processes in 2010. We continue to develop products to meet customer specifica- tions that are only used in very limited applications. Con- tracts concluded with customers ensure that compensation is  paid for customised designs regardless of their use. This  avoids any financial risk for KSB.   * SEE PAGE 127 (GLOSSARY)  49 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Risk Management  ENVIRONMENT  Like other companies, KSB is subject to numerous environ- mental protection laws and regulations in the EU and indi- vidual countries. With the aim of reducing environmental  pollution risks, officers at all KSB sites monitor operations to  ensure that employees strictly observe these regulations and  comply with – in some cases even stricter – internal environ- mental standards. Appropriate provisions are recognised to  provide financial cover for any remediation needed in the  event of legacy contamination at individual sites.  OTHER RISKS  Serious business disadvantages can result from the manipula- tion or loss of data. We minimise these risks by using power- ful, state-of-the-art hardware with the latest software ver- sions. We have standardised IT infrastructures, data backup  systems, mirrored databases, the latest virus protection appli- cations and secure access procedures. In addition, we also  have replacement capacity to prevent any bottlenecks caused  by system failures.  In countries where KSB companies still work with IT systems  whose software maintenance contracts are coming to an end  or which are at higher risk of failure, we have pressed ahead  with the deployment of SAP ERP. This is part of our policy  to harmonise our business processes globally and to make  them more secure.  As a result of demographic changes, competition for qualified  specialists and managers is intensifying. To prepare for this,  we are carrying out the Demographic Fitness* project, which  involves analysing age structures and creating needs-oriented  action plans. Furthermore, we are simplifying and standardis- ing our processes for advertising new positions internation- ally. OVERALL ASSESSMENT  Despite a recovering global economy, the markets have still  not completely overcome the financial and economic crisis.  Therefore, in 2011 and 2012 management will continue to  have the key responsibility of identifying the associated risks  and countering them in good time.  Overall, we did not identify any risks in financial year 2010  that could significantly or permanently impair the Groups  net assets, financial position or results of operations.  * SEE PAGE 42 We do not use scarce natural  resources to develop new energy- efficient motors for our pumps.  50 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND SALES OPPORTUNITIES In 2011, the global economy is expected to continue its re- covery from the recession of two years ago. Having returned  to the growth track early on, emerging markets still offer ex- port-oriented nations good sales potential. This fact, com- bined with their improving domestic economies, gives reason  to hope that the upturn in a number of industrialised nations,  including Germany, will gain staying power. By contrast, in  some countries with high levels of debt, observers must wait  and see whether, and to what extent, the economic situation  is going to improve.  On the whole, forecasts for 2011 largely anticipate a contin- ued upward trend in the economy, although this is not likely  to develop the same dynamism as in the previous year. The  necessary measures taken to consolidate critical state budgets  – especially in over-leveraged European nations – could result  in a dampening effect. Another factor curbing growth may  come from national restriction measures taken in economies  such as China, India and Brazil in order to keep inflationary  risks in check. Order intake in the mechanical and plant engineering sectors,  which fell sharply during the crisis, will increase again signifi- cantly in 2011. Therefore, the German Engineering Federa- tion (VDMA) anticipates production growth of roughly   10 %. Demand for pumps, valves and systems will also rise during  the current year. Continued improvement in order intake is  also expected in the short-cyclical general business, whereas  the purchase order situation is likely to stabilise in the pro- ject business. In 2011, business will be shaped by more in- tense competition and stronger price pressure.   Pumps With the end of the financial and economic crisis, our pumps  business already showed a marked positive trend in the sec- ond half of 2010, and we expect this to continue during the  current year. We expect increasing investment in the chemi- cals industry and in the power and water engineering sectors  to produce growing order volumes for single-stage and multi- stage pumps.  In addition, positive effects should result from the introduc- tion of new pump type series, including very powerful circu- lating pumps for use in high-rise buildings and additional siz- es of our pressure booster pumps for industry, water supply  and building services. To increase submersible pumps sales,  we will step up our activities in the waste water business,  with the aim of winning additional market share. As part of our strategic projects, we are also intensifying our  sales of standard pumps in key markets and focusing on new  areas of application. These include, for example, the hygienic  fluid transport market, renewable energies and fire-extin- guishing systems in line with the US FM / UL* standard. We  also see good development opportunities in mining and will  intensify our efforts in this market in selected countries. Customer demand for products with a high level of energy  efficiency favours our sales of energy-saving variable speed  systems and energy-efficient motors.  This is an area where  we are technologically well positioned and will use these ad- vantages to boost our sales revenue with automation prod- ucts.  Valves We would like to continue the upward trend from the second  half of 2010 and increase our order intake for globe, gate  and butterfly valves as well. After our successes with stand- ard valves last year, we are counting on the fact that as the  economy picks up, it will also drive demand for customised  valves for use in specific applications.  REPORT ON EXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS    Order intake and sales revenue set to increase considerably   Asia / Pacific remains the most important growth region   Stabilising earnings despite high price pressure  * SEE PAGE 128 (GLOSSARY)  51 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Report on Expected Developments  We have high expectations in connection with developments  in the chemical industry and our power plant business in cer- tain regions. Even the sale of marine valves, which collapsed  during the crisis, is likely to recover during the current year.  A series of new butterfly valves scheduled to be launched in  2011 will strengthen our position in the valves market.  Service In the service business, we will continue to improve our cus- tomer relationships in selected markets in line with our strat- egy. The establishment of new service centres in Asia, the  Americas and Australia will contribute toward this goal. We  will also selectively expand our service presence in the Mid- dle East. We expect a higher percentage growth in the regions  outside Europe than for our European core market. In Europe we expect momentum to come from our nuclear  business in France this year. We already concluded initial  framework agreements for services there in 2010, drawing on  the experience and contacts of our newly acquired French  company Euro Techno Consulting, which has specialised in  such systems. Furthermore, in Germany and France we will  offer our services in the renewable energies sector, especially  in the area of wind power plants. OUTLOOK FOR THE GROUP AND FOR THE REGIONS Current developments in the markets corroborate the funda- mental direction of our strategy, which, among other objec- tives, involves increasing market penetration in countries out- side Europe with strong prospects while stabilising our  position within Europe. Within the Group, we will work in- tensively towards these aims as well as other strategic pro- jects. Based on these initiatives and trends in the market, it is  possible that our order intake in the Regions Asia / Pacific and  Americas could see much stronger percentage growth in  2011 than in our European home market.  Europe In the current European market, we can expect to see two  types of economic development. While export-oriented econ- omies will benefit from the revival in global trade, other  countries will lose ground in their economic recovery as a re- sult of the debt crisis and the difficult process of consolida- tion. Our general business with standard products is likely to see  further growth. By contrast, our power engineering and wa- ter transport project business will remain affected by reluc- tance on the part of many investors, who launched no new  projects during the crisis. This goes for Western Europe in  particular, whereas in the Eastern European market, especial- ly in Russia, there are definitely reasons to see potential for  positive developments in the project business. In our service  business, acquisitions completed in Germany and France in  2010 provide starting points for expanding our business.  Moreover, in 2011 as well, we would like to close regional  gaps and broaden our service expertise.  Middle East / Africa The upturn in the global economy and associated demand  for energy and base metals has driven prices for these goods  upward. Higher revenues in some raw materials and oil-ex- porting countries have freed up investment capital for infra- structure projects in the areas of water supply and wastewa- ter treatment as well as construction projects. Furthermore,  new pumps and valves are required by the oil and gas in- dustry. In North Africa, it is likely that for a temporary pe- riod, fewer orders will be placed due to the political unrest. We serve our customers via a regional trading centre in  Dubai and a network of sales companies and trading part- ners. In Turkey, Saudi Arabia and South Africa we also do  direct, local manufacturing in selected markets. In 2011, we  would like to focus on improving our regional service offer- ing, which involves a number of service companies, in the  United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.  52 GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT  Asia / Pacific Despite regulatory measures taken in some countries, we ex- pect the momentum in the Asian markets to continue. In the  two strongest economies, China and India, we can participate  directly in this growth through the sales and production com- panies we have established there. As a result of rising industrial production in the region and  steadily growing demand for energy, we see good order pros- pects in the manufacturing industry and in power plant con- struction. Water and waste water projects will also become  more important for our business due to rapid developments  in infrastructure. By setting up new regional centres for pro- ject management and application consultancy, we will im- prove our customer support and offer even more effective  services, fast and efficiently. Furthermore we have the strategic goal of intensifying our  general business with standard pumps and valves. Special  sales teams are putting in place the prerequisites for this in  several Asian countries. Growing new business in the Asia / Pacific region will bring  about an increase in the demand for service. This develop- ment is associated with the increasing willingness of custom- ers to outsource services to external providers. We will there- fore set up new repair centres, above all in China, India and  Australia. China Source: DIW Berlin India Russia Brazil REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE BRIC COUNTRIES 2011 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 2010 10.1 % 9.9 % 3.9 % 7.8 % 9.5 %  (Forecast) 7.8 %  (Forecast) 4.3 %  (Forecast) 5.1 %  (Forecast)  Americas Economic growth in the Region Americas in 2011 will like- ly end up lower than in 2010. The North American market  is experiencing a slow recovery, and we therefore anticipate  opportunities to participate in projects related to energy  supply and waste water treatment systems. The high oil  price will lead to new investments in the Canadian oil sands  industry, which we supply with slurry pumps from our US  subsidiary GIW Industries, Inc. We also expect an upturn in  the service business, with a contribution coming from our  new acquisition Standard Alloys Inc.  In South America, we expect stronger growth of the econo- my, in particular in Argentina, Brazil and Chile, where we  are represented by own companies. We are planning to es- tablish a new company in Peru, another promising country.   We currently see good opportunities for orders in South  America in industry, including the oil industry, water supply  and mining.  Overall, intense competition should be expected in the US  market. This is due to the increased involvement of produc- ers from other regions, which currently aim to tap the Bra- zilian and US sales markets. Our longstanding customer re- lationships will help us to continue to leverage opportunities  in the well-established areas of application for our products.  At the same time, we intend to expand our business with  standard products and service offerings. FINANCIAL OUTLOOK Against the backdrop of an improving global economy, we  are striving to continue improving our order intake in 2011  and the following year as well. We anticipate growth in all  three Business Units: Pumps, Valves and Service. We see  growth opportunities during the current year especially in  our general business with standard products and in service,  while higher order intake in the project business is not ex- pected until 2012. Overall, however, on the basis of forecast  prospects for the economy, we will already be able to re-  attain pre-crisis levels in 2011.  53 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 We expect sales revenue to increase at a stronger rate than  order intake in all Business Units in 2011. This development  is related to the completion of the high level of orders on  hand.  In the following year, sales revenue will likely see the  same increase in volume as order intake. During the current year, we expect consolidated earnings to  reach at least the level of 2010. Considering the pressure on  prices in our sales markets and looming increases in material  and staff costs, it is not yet certain whether we can improve  this figure.  In the pumps business, we cannot rule out de- clines due to the problematic competitive situation, mainly in  the project business. By contrast, a positive development is  expected in the Business Units Valves and Service. From our  current perspective, we anticipate moderate earnings growth  overall in 2012.  Our expenditure for property, plant and equipment is likely  to rise in 2011. Thanks to our very good financial position,  we expect to be able to fully finance these investments from  equity capital. The implementation of our strategic projects will be a focus  of our activities in 2011 and the coming years as well. We are  providing the necessary financial resources and capacities for  this. We will only consider acquisitions if they fit with our key  strategic projects and are likely to prove highly advantageous  from a financial and strategic point of view. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This report contains forward-looking statements. We wish to  point out that actual events may differ materially from our  expectations of developments if one of the uncertainties de- scribed, or other risks and uncertainties, should materialise,  or if the assumptions underlying the statements prove to be  inaccurate. Report on Expected Developments  After China, India is the largest  growth market in Asia. We manufac- ture pumps and valves at five sites  in India, like this one in Nashik.  55 Tapping additional regenerative energy sources  should make us less dependent on fossil and  nuclear fuels. We support this development by  providing ef cient and durable components for  systems which use solar and wind power as  well as geothermal energy and biomass to gen- erate electricity. We are also currently testing  the  rst commercial river turbines to convert  hydropower into electricity. By developing this  small hydropower plant, we hope to achieve  payback periods that are a third shorter than  those of wind power plants.  Kerstin Gndra, Head of Product Management Submersible Pumps 57 57 Renewable energy sources  are the future.  How can we make the best  use of them today?  The Amaprop propeller ensures a homogenous mix of biomass for gas production.  55 Tapping additional regenerative energy sources  should make us less dependent on fossil and  nuclear fuels.

First-time application of new and revised standards The following new Interpretations and revised Standards issued by the International Account- ing Standards Board (IASB) were required to be applied for the first time in financial year  2010:   IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements    IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement   IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards    IFRS 2 Share-based Payment   IFRS 3 Business Combinations   IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations     (Annual Improvement Project 2008) NOTES Segment Reporting Notes   66 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements   IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate    IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation    IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners and Individual Components of   IAS 10 Events after the Reporting Period as well as IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for  Sale and Discontinued Operations   IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers    Annual Improvements [April 2009] As a matter of principle, we have not voluntarily applied the following new and revised  Standards and Interpretations prior to their effective dates:    IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures   (for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011)    This Standard provides for exemption from disclosure of information in the Notes if     the cost of complying with the disclosure requirement would outweigh the benefits of     the disclosures to users of the financial statements.   IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation (for reporting periods beginning on or after     1 February 2011)   The amendments relate to the clarification of the classification of subscription rights as a     liability or as equity.   IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards in conjunction     with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures   Annual Improvements [May 2010] (for reporting periods beginning on or after     1 January 2011) The amendments relate to six Standards and one Interpretation.    IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements  and their Interaction (from 1 January 2011)   The amendments relate to entities with minimum funding requirements within the frame- work of accounting for pension plans.    IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments (for reporting peri- ods beginning on or after 1 July 2010). This document provides assistance in the interpre- tation of the IASs/IFRSs.   This document provides assistance in the interpretation of the IASs/IFRSs. Based on our current state of knowledge, application of the above Standards and Interpreta- tions would not have any material impact on our consolidated financial statements. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION Consolidated Group In addition to KSB AG, 6 German and 52 foreign companies (previous year: 4 German and  48 foreign companies) were fully consolidated. We hold a majority interest in the voting   power of these companies, either directly or indirectly, or we have the power to appoint the  majority of the members of the companies management. No companies are currently   accounted for using the equity method or proportionately consolidated.  67 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  We included the following companies for the first time in the consolidated financial state- ments effective 1 January 2010:   KAGEMA Industrieausrstungen GmbH, Pattensen (Germany)   KSB Armaturen Verwaltungs- und Beteiligungs-GmbH, Frankenthal (Germany)   KSB OOO, Moscow (Russia)   KSB Lindflaten AS, Lysaker (Norway)   KSB Service Italia S.r.l., Scorz (Italy)   KSB Pumps Inc., Mississauga / Ontario (Canada) The changes in the consolidated Group described above contributed around 1 % or  0.8  million to consolidated earnings. Further effects on the consolidated financial statements are  presented in the relevant tables (for example, in the additional column titled 31 Dec. 2009  (adjusted) included in the balance sheet) and explained in the information provided on indi- vidual items. The carrying amounts of the companies assets and liabilities acquired and included in the  consolidated financial statements for the first time almost completely matched their fair value.  Purchase price allocation, based on the data at the time of acquisition, only resulted in differ- ences amounting to  239 thousand. These were above all attributable to the measurement of  customer base and orders in hand. Overall, as in the previous year, we had to make no payments for successive acquisitions of  consolidated companies in the year under review.  12,906 thousand (previous year:  7,144  thousand) was spent on companies that have not yet been consolidated because this would  not have had a material impact. This amount resulted mainly from an increase in the interest  held in an Italian motor manufacturing firm, a newly formed company in the Americas and  the acquisition of shares in relatively small companies in Europe. In light of our new Group strategy which, among other things, involves merging the numer- ous small companies to form larger legal entities, in 2009 we began initiating appropriate  corporate changes. In this context, further companies that have not yet been consolidated will  be included in the consolidated Group over the course of the next few years. Consolidation methods Capital consolidation uses the purchase method of accounting, under which the acquisition  cost of the parents shares in the subsidiaries is eliminated against the equity attributable to  the parent at the date of acquisition. Any goodwill arising from initial consolidation is ac- counted for in accordance with IFRS 3 in conjunction with IASs 36 and 38. It is measured at  the relevant current closing rate, presented in intangible assets and tested for impairment at  least once a year. An impairment loss is recognised if any impairment is identified.  Any excess of our interest in the fair values of net assets acquired over cost is recognised di- rectly in profit or loss. Those shares of subsidiaries equity not attributable to KSB AG are reported as non-control- ling interest.  68 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS All intercompany receivables, liabilities, provisions and contingent liabilities, as well as sales  revenue, other income and expenses, are eliminated. Intercompany profits contained in inven- tories and fixed assets are also eliminated. The financial statements of all material companies or those required to be audited under local  law have been audited and independent auditors reports have been issued. This audit also   extended to the correct reconciliation of the financial statements prepared under local GAAP  to the uniform Group IFRS accounting policies.  Currency translation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euros (). Amounts in this report  are presented in thousands of euros ( thousands) using standard commercial rounding rules. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the individual companies at  the rate prevailing when the transaction is initially recognised. Monetary assets and liabilities  are subsequently measured at the closing rate. Currency translation gains and losses are recog- nised in profit or loss. Financial statements of consolidated companies that are not prepared in euros are translated  using the functional currency principle. These companies are financially, economically and or- ganisationally independent (foreign entities). Assets and liabilities are translated at the clos- ing rate; the income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the year.  The resulting effects are presented directly in equity. Gains and losses from the translation of items of assets and liabilities compared with their  translation in the previous year are taken directly to equity. The exchange rates of our most important currencies to one euro are: Closing rate Average rate   31 Dec. 2010 31 Dec. 2009 2010 2009 US dollar 1.3362 1.4406 1.3321 1.3933 Brazilian real 2.2177 2.5113 2.3377 2.7706 Indian rupee 59.7580 67.0400 60.9563 67.3098 Chinese yuan 8.8220 9.8350 9.0167 9.5172 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies have generally not changed as against the previous year and apply to  all companies included in the consolidated financial statements.  In addition to the above-mentioned changes to the consolidated Group, we have made adjust- ments versus the prior-year presentation of disclosures of advance payments on inventories  and, in part, for PoC contracts. We now disclose these advance payments as a component of   69 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  liabilities, whereas in the previous year they were presented as part of Inventories or Re- ceivables and other current assets.  The effects are described in these Notes in the section on  Liabilities. For reasons of comparability, the prior-year values of the relevant items were  adjusted in the tables presented in the sections on Inventories, Receivables and other cur- rent assets and Liabilities. Acquisition cost In addition to the purchase price, acquisition cost includes attributable incidental costs (except  for costs associated with the acquisition of a company) and subsequent expenditure. Purchase  price reductions are deducted from cost. Should borrowing costs pursuant to IAS 23 arise, these  will be capitalised from 2009 onwards. As in the previous year, no borrowing costs were in- curred in the financial year. Production cost In addition to direct material and labour costs, production cost includes production-related  administrative expenses. General administrative expenses and selling expenses are not capital- ised. Should borrowing costs pursuant to IAS 23 arise, these will be capitalised from 2009 on- wards. As in the previous year, no borrowing costs were incurred in the financial year. Financial instruments  Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at the  time when KSB becomes a party to a financial instrument and when at least one party has ful- filled the agreement. When the contractual right to payments from financial assets expires, these  are derecognised. Financial liabilities are derecognised at the time when the contractual obliga- tions are settled or cancelled or have expired. Regular way purchases and sales of financial in- struments are recognised at their value at the settlement date; only derivatives are recognised at  their value at the trade date. This applies to so-called primary financial instruments such as  trade receivables and monetary receivables, as well as to trade payables and financial liabilities  (from or to third parties as well as intragroup and associate companies).  Derivatives, which we use to hedge against foreign currency and interest rate risks, are also fi- nancial instruments. Classification in measurement categories:   Financial Assets Held for Trading (FAHfT) / Financial Liabilities Held for Trading    (FLHfT): Financial assets and liabilities held for trading and measured at fair value      through profit or loss (derivatives not included in hedging relationships)   Loans and Receivables (LaR): Loans and receivables (loans and primary financial    instruments not quoted in an active market)   Available for Sale (AfS): Available-for-sale financial instruments (non-derivative financial    instruments that are not allocated to any other measurement category, such as investments    in non-consolidated affiliates or securities)  70 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   Financial Liabilities Measured at Amortised Cost (FLAC): Financial liabilities measured at    amortised cost using the effective interest method (liabilities that are not quoted in an    active market, such as trade payables) None of our financial instruments are classified as held-to-maturity investments. Financial instruments are measured at fair value on initial recognition. Subsequent measure- ment is generally based on fair value. Subsequent measurement of loans and receivables is  based on amortised cost using the effective interest method. We do not currently make use of  the fair value option. Fair values are based on market prices determined at the reporting date  that are obtained from recognised external sources. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised directly in   equity. They are recognised in profit or loss when the assets are sold or determined to be im- paired.  As in the previous year, we did not make any reclassifications between the individual measure- ment categories. Intangible assets Intangible assets are generally carried at cost and reduced by straight-line amortisation. The  underlying useful lives are two to five years.  Write-downs are charged for impairment if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying  amount. If the reasons for an impairment loss charged in a previous period no longer apply,  the impairment loss is reversed (write-up). We amortised goodwill originating between 1 January 1995 and 30 March 2004 over a maxi- mum of 15 years. In accordance with IFRS 3, the resulting cumulative amortisation was elimi- nated against historical cost effective 1 January 2005. Goodwill has been tested for impair- ment at least once a year since 2005; it is not amortised any longer. This impairment test  relates to the cash-generating units, which at KSB are the legal entities. Write-downs are  charged for impairment if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. Good- will originating up to and including 1994 has been deducted from revenue reserves. Negative  goodwill originating prior to 30 March 2004 was eliminated against revenue reserves directly  in equity. Any excess of our interest in the fair values of net assets acquired over cost arising  after 30 March 2004 is recognised directly in profit or loss. When calculating goodwill we apply purchase price allocations and determine the fair value  of the assets and liabilities acquired. In addition to the assets and liabilities already recognised  by the selling party, we also assess marketing-related aspects (primarily brands, competitive  restrictions), customer-related aspects (primarily customer lists, customer relations, orders on  hand), contract-related aspects (mainly particularly advantageous service, work, purchasing   71 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  and employment contracts) as well as technology-related aspects (primarily patents, know- how and databases).  To determine values we primarily apply the residual value method, the  excess earnings method and cost-oriented procedures. Development costs are capitalised as intangible assets at cost and reduced by straight-line   amortisation where the criteria described in IAS 38 are met. Research costs are expensed as  incurred. Where research and development costs cannot be reliably distinguished within a  project, no costs are capitalised.  Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost and reduced by straight-line depreciation.   No tax-motivated depreciation is recognised. Write-downs are charged for impairment if the  recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. If the reasons for an impairment loss  charged in a previous period no longer apply, the impairment loss is reversed (write-up). We have applied the component approach under IAS 16. Depending on the relevant item, government grants relating to property, plant and equipment  are deducted from the assets concerned or transferred to an adjustment item on the liabilities  side. This adjustment item is reversed over a defined utilisation period. As far as government  grants recognised which are to be held for specific periods of time are concerned, we expect  that these periods will be complied with. Maintenance expenses are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred,  unless they lead to the expansion or material improvement of the asset concerned. The following useful lives are applied: USEFUL LIVES   Buildings 10 – 60 years Plant and machinery 7 – 25 years Operating and office equipment 3 – 25 years Leases Lease payments that are payable under operating leases are recognised as expenses in the pe- riod in which they are incurred. In the case of finance leases, the leased asset is recognised at  the time of inception of the lease at the lower of fair value and the present value of future  minimum lease payments. A liability is recognised in the same amount for the future lease  payment. The assets carrying amount is reduced by depreciation over its useful life or the  shorter lease term.   72 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Non-current financial assets Investments in unconsolidated affiliates and associates are carried at fair value. Interest-bear- ing loans are recognised at amortised cost.  Non-current financial assets are measured at cost if their fair value cannot be reliably deter- mined because they are not traded in an active market.  Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is measured using  the weighted average method. Write-downs to the net realisable value take account of the in- ventory risks resulting from slow-moving goods or impaired marketability. This also applies  to write-downs to fair value if the selling price is lower than production cost plus costs still to  be incurred. If the reasons for an impairment loss charged in a previous period no longer   apply, the impairment loss is reversed. Advances received from customers are recognised as current liabilities. Construction contracts under IAS 11 The percentage of completion (PoC) method is applied for construction contracts defined  under IAS 11. The stage of completion of contracts is determined on the basis of the pro- portion that contract costs (without indirect material costs) incurred for work performed  up to the reporting date bear to the estimated total contract costs (without indirect mate- rial costs) at the reporting date. The percentage contract revenue less the related advances  received from customers is reported – depending on the balance – in receivables and other  current assets or in current liabilities. Effects in the period are recognised in the income  statement as part of sales revenue. The gross amount due to customers for contract work is  included in other provisions. Receivables and other current assets For subsequent measurement, receivables and other current assets that are classified as loans  and receivables (LaR) are recognised at amortised cost. Low-interest or non-interest-bearing re- ceivables are discounted. In addition, we take account of identifiable risks by charging specific  write-downs and experience-based write-downs using allowance accounts. If the reasons for an  impairment loss charged in a previous period no longer apply, the impairment loss is reversed. We hedge part of the credit risk exposure of our receivables (for further explanations, refer to  the Financial Risks – Credit Risk section). The prepaid expenses reported relate to accrued expenditure prior to the reporting date that  will only be classified as an expense after the reporting date. Financial instruments Financial instruments are carried at their fair values at the reporting date.  73 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents (cash, bank balances and short-term deposits) are recognised at  amortised cost. Deferred taxes We account for deferred taxes using the balance sheet liability method on the basis of the en- acted or substantively enacted local tax rates. This means that deferred tax assets and liabilities  generally arise when the tax base of assets and liabilities differs from their carrying amount in  the IFRS financial statements, and this leads to future tax expense or income. We also recognise  deferred tax assets from tax loss carryforwards in those cases where it is more likely than not  that there will be sufficient taxable profit available in the near future against which these tax  loss carryforwards can be utilised. Deferred taxes are also recognised for consolidation adjust- ments. Deferred taxes are not discounted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always offset  where they relate to the same tax authority. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are calculated on the basis of actuarial re- ports. They are based on defined benefit pension plans. The reports are prepared using the  projected unit credit method. We apply the 10 % corridor rule, under which actuarial gains  and losses that are 10 % greater or lower than the present value of the DBO (defined benefit  obligation) are recognised over the average remaining working lives. The actuarial demo- graphic assumptions and the definition of compensation and pension trends, as well as inter- est rate trends, are best estimates. The interest component is reported as an interest cost in fi- nancial income / expense. KSB companies that use a defined contribution pension plan do not recognise provisions. The  premium payments are recognised directly in the income statement as pension costs in the  staff costs. These companies have no obligations other than the obligation to pay premiums. Other provisions A provision is recognised only if a past event results in a present legal or constructive external  obligation that the company has no realistic alternative to settling, where settlement of this  obligation is expected to result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, and  the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. No provisions are recognised for   future internal expenses. The amount recognised as a provision is our best estimate. Any   recourse or reimbursement claims are recognised separately and are not deducted from the  provisions concerned.  Provisions for restructurings are recognised only if the criteria set out in IAS 37 are met. Non-current provisions are discounted if the effects are material. Liabilities Liabilities classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost (FLAC) are recognised  at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  74 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Derivative financial instruments We only use derivatives for hedging purposes. We hedge both existing recognised underlyings  and future cash flows (cash flow hedges) against foreign currency and interest rate risks. The  hedging instruments used are exclusively highly effective currency forwards, currency options  and interest rate derivatives entered into with prime-rated banks. We hedge currency risks pri- marily for items in US dollars (USD). Interest rate risks are minimised through long-term bor- rowings at variable rates of interest. Group guidelines govern the use of these instruments.  These transactions are also subject to continuous risk monitoring. Fair value changes of currency derivatives used to hedge an existing recognised underlying are  recognised in profit or loss, as are changes in the fair value of the related hedged items.  In the case of cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of currency derivatives are taken di- rectly to equity until the related hedged item is recognised.  Fair value changes of interest rate derivatives used to hedge against interest rate risks in liabil- ities are recognised directly in equity. The carrying amounts equal fair value and are determined on the basis of market prices. Fair  values may be positive or negative. Fair value is the amount that we would receive or have to  pay at the reporting date to settle the financial instrument. This amount is determined using  the relevant exchange rates, interest rates and counterparty credit ratings at the reporting  date. There was no material hedge ineffectiveness that would have been required to be reported. Derivatives are reported under other receivables and other current assets, and under miscel- laneous other liabilities and deferred income. The maturities of the currency derivatives used are mostly between one and two years, and  those of interest rate derivatives are between six and ten years. The maturities of the hedging  instruments are matched to the period in which the forecasted transactions are expected to  occur. In the year under review, almost all hedged forecasted transactions occurred as   expected. Contingent liabilities (contingencies and commitments) Contingent liabilities, which are not recognised, are possible obligations that arise from past  events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of un- certain future events. Contingent liabilities may also be present obligations that arise from past  events where it is possible but not probable that there will be an outflow of resources embody- ing economic benefits.  Contingent liabilities correspond to the extent of liability at the reporting date.  75 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  Income and expenses Sales revenue consists of charges for deliveries and services billed to customers, and licence  income. Sales allowances reduce sales revenue. Sales revenue is recognised when the   deliveries have been effected or the services have been rendered and the significant risks of  ownership have been transferred to the buyer. Effects resulting from application of the   percentage of completion method are also recognised in the sales revenue. Expenses are recognised when they are incurred or when the services are utilised. Estimates and assumptions Preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs requires manage- ment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting policies to be applied.  When implementing such accounting policies, estimates and assumptions affect the assets,   liabilities, income and expenses recognised in the consolidated financial statements, and their  presentation. These estimates and assumptions are based on past experience and a variety of  other factors deemed appropriate under the circumstances. Actual amounts may differ from  these estimates and assumptions. We continuously review the estimates and assumptions that  we apply. If more recent information and additional knowledge are available, recognised  amounts are adjusted to reflect the new circumstances. Any changes in estimates and assump- tions that result in material differences are explained separately. Maturities Maturities of up to one year are classified as current.  Assets that can only be realised after more than 12 months, as well as liabilities that only be- come due after more than 12 months, are also classified as current if they are attributable to  the operating cycle defined in IAS 1. Assets and liabilities not classified as current are non-current.  76 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN INTANGIBLE ASSETS       ( thousands) Concessions, industrial  property and similar rights and   assets, as well as licences in   such rights and assets       Goodwill       Advance payments     Intangible assets  Total Historical cost 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Balance at 1 January 34,588 33,470 37,142 36,664 1,326 1,841 73,056 71,975 Change in consolidated Group /   Currency translation adjustments / Other   831   295   4,375   478   –   1   5,206   774 Additions 3,714 1,299 – – 1,278 44 4,992 1,343 Disposals 194 1,024 – – – – 194 1,024 Reclassifications 1,426 548 – – – 1,301 – 560 125 – 12 Balance at 31 December 40,365 34,588 41,517 37,142 1,303 1,326 83,185 73,056                   Accumulated depreciation and amortisation 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Balance at 1 January 27,550 24,492 3,332 – – – 30,882 24,492 Change in consolidated Group /   Currency translation adjustments / Other   426   200   –   –   –   –   426   200 Additions 3,423 3,882 – 3,332 – – 3,423 7,214 Disposals 194 1,024 – – – – 194 1,024 Reclassifications 64 – – – – – 64 – Balance at 31 December 31,269 27,550 3,332 3,332 – – 34,601 30,882 Carrying amount at 31 December 9,096 7,038 38,185 33,810 1,303 1,326 48,584 42,174 As in the previous year, we did not capitalise any development costs in the year under review  because not all of the comprehensive recognition criteria defined in IAS 38 were met. We conduct our impairment tests once a year. If an additional impairment test is deemed to  be required because there is an indication that an asset may be impaired (trigger event), the  test is performed promptly. As in the previous year, this proved unnecessary in the year under  review. We apply the discounted cash flow model to determine the recoverable amount (value in use).  The future earnings (EBIT in accordance with IFRS) applied were taken from a four-year  plan, the basis of which was approved in December. We carried out this planning based on  certain assumptions which were drawn from both forecasts from external sources (e.g. cur- rent VDMA publications) and our own knowledge of markets and competitors. For the first  BALANCE SHEET DISCLOSURES Fixed assets 1  77 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  year we anticipated figures to remain basically on a par with those of the year under review.  Over the subsequent years we expect a positive economic trend again. In our calculations we  consistently extrapolated the result of the fourth plan year as a constant; we did not apply  any growth rates. The reconciliation to cash flow is performed to adjust for the effects of  scheduled investments for expansion. If the planned depreciation and amortisation amounts  deviate significantly from planned replacement investments, the cash flows recognised are also  adjusted.  The carrying amounts of cash-generating units do not contain any items related to taxes or  financing activities.  To determine the discount rate, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) method is ap- plied in conjunction with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Under this method, first the  cost of equity is determined using CAPM and the borrowing costs are defined, and then the  individual capital components are weighted in accordance with the capital structure. The in- terest rate for risk-free ten-year Bunds was used as a base rate. In response to the global eco- nomic recovery we have lowered the market risk premium from 5 % to the pre-crisis level of  4 %; as in the previous year, a beta factor of 1.0 was used. The individual discount rate be- fore taxes which was derived for each cash-generating unit ranges – depending on each coun- trys individual tax rates – between 7.40 % and 9.11 % (previous year: between 8.69 % and  10.69 %). The impairment test did not identify any impairment requiring a write-down. Last years im- pairment test revealed the need for write-downs of  3,332 thousand at a cash-generating  unit in Belgium due to economic difficulties.  A 10 % increase in the relevant discount rate would require write-downs of  648 thousand  (previous year:  0 thousand). Of the carrying amount of all goodwill totalling  38,185 thousand (previous year:  33,810  thousand)  18,285 thousand (previous year:  18,285 thousand) was attributable to the  Dutch Group company DP industries B.V.;  3,710 thousand (previous year:  3,710 thou- sand) to the Italian company KSB Italia S.p.A.;  2,980 thousand (previous year:  2,980  thousand) to the German company Uder Elektromechanik GmbH and  3,358 thousand   (previous year:  2,790 thousand) to the South African company KSB Pumps (S.A.)

The remaining  6,142 thousand (previous year:  6,045 thousand) is attributable,  as in the previous year, to another 12 companies. As in the previous year, we did not recognise any impairment losses on other intangible assets  in the year under review.     78 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT     ( thousands)     Land and buildings   Plant and  machinery Other equipment,   operating and   office equipment Advance payments   and assets under   construction Property, plant and  equipment   Total Historical cost 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Balance at 1 January 232,824 196,440 394,531 351,458 149,483 139,207 32,528 51,530 809,366 738,635 Change in consolidated Group /   Currency translation adjustments / Other   7,539   2,626   12,799   3,758   7,400   1,885   1,405   320   29,143   8,589 Additions 9,999 11,808 20,234 32,397 20,968 17,010 16,606 24,060 67,807 85,275 Disposals 314 791 10,525 11,838 8,361 10,470 1,696 46 20,896 23,145 Reclassifications 4,169 22,741 30,695 18,756 – 3,987 1,851 – 31,002 – 43,336 – 125 12 Balance at 31 December 254,217 232,824 447,734 394,531 165,503 149,483 17,841 32,528 885,295 809,366                       Accumulated depreciation and amortisation 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Balance at 1 January 99,564 94,718 244,126 234,941 100,158 95,796 – – 443,848 425,455 Change in consolidated Group /   Currency translation adjustments / Other   2,529   298   7,150   1,762   4,445   1,324   –   –   14,124   3,384 Additions 6,444 4,998 24,366 18,736 13,915 12,424 – – 44,725 36,158 Disposals 230 450 9,582 11,311 7,473 9,388 – – 17,285 21,149 Reclassifications – – 2,212 – 2 – 2,276 2 – – – 64 – Reversal (write-up) 913 – – –  – –  – – 913 – Balance at 31 December 107,394 99,564 268,272 244,126 108,769 100,158 – – 484,435 443,848 Carrying amount at 31 December 146,823 133,260 179,462 150,405 56,734 49,325 17,841 32,528 400,860 365,518 The volume of investment in property, plant and equipment declined by 20 % compared with  the previous years level. After major investments were made in previous years, we returned to  the usual level of investments in the year under review as anticipated in the previous year.  Assets resulting from finance leases (almost exclusively real property) are recognised as fixed  assets in accordance with IAS 17, and corresponding financial liabilities are recognised. The  carrying amount of these recognised assets amounts to  7,076 thousand (previous year:    7,167 thousand). Disposals of items of property, plant and equipment resulted in book gains of  1,781 thou- sand (previous year:  1,538 thousand) and book losses of  1,219 thousand (previous year:   1,235 thousand). The book gains and losses are reported in the income statement under  other operating income and other operating expenses. As in the previous year, we did not recognise any impairment losses on property, plant and  equipment in the year under review.   79 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  Investments in affiliates and other equity investments reported under non-current financial as- sets declined. Additions, above all resulting from the increase in our interest held in an Italian  motor manufacturing firm, were more than offset by effects resulting from the first-time con- solidation of six companies and by write-downs. These write-downs relate primarily to five  smaller companies in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Our impairment tests at these  companies identified impairment losses due to economic difficulties. The planned first-time  consolidation of further companies in financial year 2011 is expected to result in another de- cline in this balance sheet item in 2011. The increase in loans is attributable to financing measures for a newly formed company in the  Americas. For financial year 2011, we expect a significant decline in this item, too, as a result  of the planned changes in the consolidated Group. We currently have no plans for the sale of investments in affiliates and other equity invest- ments.  9,434 thousand (previous year:  1,817 thousand) of the loans are loans to affiliates.  The effect of currency translation adjustments taken directly to equity on fixed assets was a  gain of  14,112 thousand (previous year: gain of  5,877 thousand).  The list of shareholdings is included at the end of these Notes.

Construction contracts under IAS 11 include recognised profits of  26,539 thousand (previ- ous year:  27,224 thousand) and costs of  195,182 thousand (previous year:  184,200  thousand). Sales revenue in accordance with IAS 11 amounted to  328,716 thousand (previ- ous year:  349,428 thousand). The gross amount due to customers for contract work is in- cluded in other provisions. The other receivables and other current assets include receivables from employees and de- ferred interest. They also include recoverable taxes (primarily from VAT) in the amount of   2 3 4  81 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes   11,294 thousand (previous year:  6,319 thousand) and other financial assets from curren- cy forwards in accordance with IAS 39 in the amount of  1,519 thousand (previous year:    2,037 thousand). As in the previous year, there are no receivables relating to interest rate  derivatives. At the reporting date, the notional volume of all currency forwards was  139,105 thousand  (previous year:  112,179 thousand), and the notional volume of all interest rate derivatives  was  5,532 thousand (previous year:  16,430 thousand).

Current financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents Current financial instruments amount to  500 thousand (previous year: none). Cash and cash equivalents are primarily term deposits with short maturities and call deposits.  The German Group companies use  18,900 thousand of cash and cash equivalents (previous  year:  16,100 thousand) for hedges of credit balances prescribed by law for partial retire- ment arrangements. They are available to us at any time due to the underlying contractual  structure.  Equity There was no change in the share capital of KSB AG as against the previous year. In accord- ance with the Articles of Association, it totals  44,771,963.82 and is composed of 886,615  ordinary shares and 864,712 preference shares. Each no-par value share represents an equal  notional amount of the share capital. The preference shares carry separate cumulative pre- ferred dividend rights and progressive additional dividend rights. All shares are no-par value  bearer shares. The capital reserve results from the appropriation of premiums from capital increases in   previous years. In addition to revenue reserves from previous years, the revenue reserves primarily include  currency translation adjustments and consolidation effects taken directly to equity. These   effects resulted in deferred tax assets in the amount of  230 thousand (previous year:    128 thousand) and deferred tax liabilities in the amount of  20 thousand (previous year:    11 thousand). 5 6  82 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A total of  21,241 thousand (dividend of  12.00 per ordinary share and  12.26 per prefer- ence share) was paid from equity by a resolution of the Annual General Meeting of the  Groups parent company KSB AG, Frankenthal, on 19 May 2010. Equity also includes changes in the fair value of derivatives used to hedge future cash flows  amounting to  – 750 thousand (previous year:  – 480 thousand).

KSB AG holds a 51 % interest in   PAB GmbH, while Klein Pumpen GmbH, Frankenthal, holds a 49 % interest.  Details of the changes in equity accounts and non-controlling interest are contained in the  Statement of Changes in Equity. The proposal on the appropriation of the net retained earnings of KSB AG calculated in ac- cordance with HGB is shown at the end of these Notes. CAPITAL DISCLOSURES Adequate capital resources and sufficient financial independence are key requirements for sus- tainably increasing KSBs enterprise value and safeguarding the companys continued exist- ence in the long term. Obtaining the necessary funds for ongoing business operations is also  extremely important for us. In addition to order intake and sales revenue, our key perfor- mance indicators are the return on sales and our net financial position (i.e. the difference be- tween interest-bearing financial assets on the one hand, and financial liabilities on the other).  The changes in the equity ratio are also relevant for us. We regularly monitor the develop- ment of these indicators and manage them through active working capital management and  by constantly optimising our financial structure, among other things. We present the development of these indicators in the management report.   2010  2009 Order intake  million 2,075.0 1,934.0 Sales revenue  million 1,939.3 1,892.8 Return on sales % 7.0 9.1 Net financial position  million 293.0 223.0 Equity ratio % 44.4 43.8  83 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS More than 90 % of the provisions for pensions result from defined benefit plans of the German  Group companies. These relate to direct commitments by the companies to their employees.  The commitments are based on salary and length of service. Contributions from employees  themselves are also included. There are smaller benefit plans at certain foreign Group compa- nies. At the US companies, there are post-employment medical care obligations for employees.  These are measured using comparable principles. The amounts provided for these defined benefit obligations and the annual expense for pension  benefits are measured and calculated each year on the basis of actuarial reports using the pro- jected unit credit method (IAS 19). The actuarial assumptions are as follows: The discount rate applied to the obligations was re- duced from 5.4 % to 5.3 %. As in the previous year, the assumed rate of future salary increases  is 2.7 %, and the assumed growth rate for the pension trend is 2.0 % per annum. The biometric  assumptions are based on the 2005G mortality tables published by Prof. Klaus Heubeck. A  mean fluctuation rate (2.0 %) was applied to staff turnover. The retirement age used for the cal- culations is oriented on the Rentenversicherungs-Altersanpassungsgesetz 2007 [RVAGAnpG –  German Act Adapting the Standard Retirement Age for the Statutory Pension Insurance Sys- tem]. Actuarial gains and losses outside the 10 % corridor around the present value of the DBO  are recognised. Where the cumulative gain or loss exceeds the 10 % corridor, the excess amount  is spread over the average remaining working lives of the employees and recognised in the   profit or loss of future periods.

Contributions totalling  25,849 thousand (previous year:  23,361 thousand) were paid to  state pension insurance funds in the year under review. OTHER PROVISIONS Provisions for taxes contain amounts of tax still payable for the year under review and for previ- ous years for which no final tax assessment has yet been received. Provisions for other employee  benefits relate primarily to profit-sharing, jubilee payments, compensated absence, partial retire- ment and severance payments. The provisions for warranty obligations and contractual penalties  cover the statutory and contractual obligations to customers. The provisions for miscellaneous  other obligations include provisions for expected losses from uncompleted transactions and oner- ous contracts (primarily from construction contracts with gross amounts due to customers in ac- cordance with IAS 11 in the amount of  840 thousand for 2010 and  4,577 thousand for 2009),  customer bonuses, accrued costs and environmental measures.   40,203 thousand of the other provisions is non-current (previous year:  43,482 thousand).

This  originally served to ensure the solvency of the company even in a protracted crisis situation. Assets amounting to  5,242 thousand (previous year:  2,753 thousand) have been pledged  as security in the KSB Group for bank loans and other liabilities on the basis of standard  terms and conditions. Of these,  124 thousand (previous year:  184 thousand) relate to  property, plant and equipment,  3,674 thousand (previous year:  1,254 thousand) to inven- tories,  506 thousand (previous year:  302 thousand) to receivables and  938 thousand  (previous year:  1,013 thousand) to cash and cash equivalents, as well as other securities.  9,389 thousand (previous year:  8,648 thousand) of the liabilities were secured by land  charges or similar rights in the year under review. The weighted average interest rate on bank loans and overdrafts as well as on an open-  market credit (loan against borrowers note) was 3.70 % (previous year: 3.05 %). Interest  rate risk exists for the major portion of the loan against borrowers note mentioned above.   87 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  There were no covenant agreements for loans in the year under review. In 2009 covenant  agreements had to be observed for three loans totalling  60 million. These loans were repaid  before maturity in the year under review due to the sound liquidity situation. In the previous  year, two of these loans totalling  50 million were subject to a creditor-defined indicator   (equity ratio) which was not allowed to fall below 25 %. The covenants of the third loan in  the amount of  10 million referred to compliance with a dynamic debt to equity ratio and  debt service coverage ratio. Here, too, both indicators were defined by the creditor.  Taxes classified as other liabilities also relate to taxes that Group companies must remit for  third-party account. Miscellaneous other liabilities include changes in the fair value of hedging instruments  amounting to  3,008 thousand (previous year:  2,395 thousand).  350 thousand (previous  year:  514 thousand) of this amount relates to interest rate derivatives. Deferred income  amounts to  2,030 thousand (previous year:  848 thousand). This also includes investment  grants totalling  3,171 thousand (previous year:  2,189 thousand) received for new buildings  in Germany. INCOME STATEMENT DISCLOSURES Sales revenue The changes in the consolidated Group in the year under review accounted for  35,381  thousand; in the prior-period consolidated financial statements they would have accounted  for  24,059 thousand. Sales revenue includes revenue from the sale of goods and goods purchased and held for re- sale amounting to  1,773,346 thousand (previous year:  1,782,444 thousand) as well as  revenue for services rendered amounting to  165,908 thousand (previous year:  110,396  thousand).

The increase in interest  and similar income is attributable to the Groups improved financial position. Write-downs of  financial assets relate primarily to the above-mentioned impairment losses on the carrying  amount of investments in non-consolidated companies due to economic difficulties. The changes in the consolidated Group did not have any material impact on the financial in- come / expense; the same would have been reported in the prior-period consolidated financial  statements.

Based on the planning figures available, we expect realisation to take place. As in the previous year, the introduction of new local taxes had no significant material effects  in the year under review. Equally, changes in foreign tax rates did not have any significant im- pact on the total tax expense ( 840 thousand), as in 2009. In the case of net income from affiliates and other equity investments, withholding taxes in- curred in connection with distributions and German taxes incurred are recognised as deferred  taxes if these gains are expected to be subject to corresponding taxation, or there is no inten- tion of reinvesting them in the long term. We did not recognise deferred tax assets from loss carryforwards amounting to  41,841  thousand (previous year:  17,334 thousand) because it is unlikely that there will be sufficient  taxable profit available in the near future against which these deferred tax assets can be uti- lised. The same applies to minor deductible temporary differences.  92 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RECONCILIATION OF INCOME TAXES    ( thousands) 2010 2009 Earnings before income taxes 135,796 172,784 Calculated income taxes on the basis of applicable tax rate (29 %) 39,381 50,107 Differences in tax rates –  101 2,007 Change in write-downs on deferred taxes on loss carryforwards and   unused tax loss carryforwards   7,438   –  195 Tax-exempt income / non-deductible expenses –  4,367 –  711 Prior-period taxes 796 707 Non-deductible foreign income tax 1,419 1,319 Other 1,270 –  2,808 Current taxes on income 45,836 50,426 Current tax rate 34 % 29 % The applicable tax rate of 29 % is a composite rate resulting from the current German corpo- ration tax, solidarity surcharge and trade income tax rates.

This also applies to finance lease liabilities, trade payables and other liabilities. This is mainly  due to the short maturities of these financial instruments. In the case of financial liabilities excluding finance lease liabilities, the fair values are determined as  the present value of the cash flows associated with the liabilities. We apply an appropriate yield  curve to arrive at this present value. The fair values of the current and non-current financial instruments presented in the table above  are based on prices quoted in active markets. The fair values of derivates included and not includ- ed in hedging relationships are determined on the basis of input factors observable either directly  (i.e. as a price) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). The interest presented above is a component of financial income / expense; the other gains and  losses are partly reported in other operating income and other operating expenses. The AfS measurement category resulted in a remeasurement loss of  8 thousand (previous  year: gain of  47 thousand), which was recognised directly in equity. As in the previous year,  no withdrawals were made from equity and realised in the year under review.  97 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  Financial risks  We are exposed to certain financial risks as a consequence of our business activities. These  risks can be classified into three areas: On the one hand, we are exposed to credit risk. We define credit risk as potential default or de- lays in the receipt of contractually agreed payments.  We are also exposed to liquidity risk, which is the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its  financial obligations, or will be unable to meet them in full.  Finally, we are exposed to market risk. The risk of exchange rate or interest rate changes may  adversely affect the economic position of the Group. Risks from fluctuations in securities   prices are not material for us. We limit all of these risks through an appropriate risk management system. We define how  these risks are addressed through guidelines and work instructions. In addition, we monitor  the current risk characteristics continuously and regularly provide the information obtained in  this way to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board in the form of standardised  reports and individual analyses. The three risk areas are described in detail in the following. You will also find additional infor- mation in the Group management report, in particular in the Net Assets, Financial Position  and Results of Operations and Risk Management sections. CREDIT RISK The primary credit risk is that there is a delay in settling a receivable, or that it is not settled in  part or in full. We minimise this risk using a variety of measures. As a matter of principle, we  run credit checks on potential and existing counterparties. We only enter into business rela- tionships if the results of this check are positive. In addition, we take out trade credit insurance  policies primarily through our European companies. In exceptional cases we accept other secu- rities (collateral) such as guarantees. The insurance policies primarily cover the risk of loss of  receivables. Moreover, cover is also taken out against political and commercial risks in the case  of certain customers in certain countries. For both types of insurance, we have agreed deducti- bles, which represent significantly less than 50 % of the insured volume. As part of our receiv- ables management system, we continuously monitor outstanding items, perform maturity anal- yses and establish contact with customers at an early stage if delays in payment occur. In the  case of major projects, our terms and conditions provide for prepayments, guarantees and   – for export transactions – letters of credit. These also mitigate risk. Impairment losses are rec- ognised for the residual risk remaining in trade receivables. We examine regularly the extent to  which individual receivables need to be written down for impairment. Indications of this are  significant financial difficulties of the debtor, such as insolvency or bankruptcy. We also cover  the credit risk of receivables that are past due by providing for the risk involved on the basis of  historical loss experience. Receivables are written off if it is reasonably certain that receipt of  payment cannot be expected.  98 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impairment losses on Trade receivables are the only material impairment losses in the KSB  Group. They changed as follows:   ( thousands) 2010 2009 Opening balance at 1 January 26,349 21,760 Additions 6,074 8,056 Utilised – 1,699 – 1,244 Reversals – 2,960 – 2,064 Change in consolidated Group / Currency translation adjustments / Other 2,202 – 159 Closing balance at 31 December  29,966 26,349 The maturity structure of trade receivables is as follows:   ( thousands) 31.12.2010 31.12.2009 Receivables that are neither past due nor individually impaired 331,168 279,462 Receivables that are past due but not individually impaired      1 to 30 days 36,308 36,660  31 to 90 days 27,609 18,313  91 to 180 days 11,978 11,705  >180 days 4,905 14,826 Total 80,800 81,504 Receivables individually determined to be impaired 16,726 5,308  Receivables individually determined to be impaired at their principal amount 46,692 31,657  Specific write-downs 29,966 26,349 Carrying amount (net) 428,694 366,274 With regard to the trade receivables that are neither past due nor individually impaired, there  are no indications at the reporting date that our debtors will not meet their payment obliga- tions. The maximum default risk, excluding collateral received, corresponds to the carrying amount  of the financial assets.  There is no concentration of risk because the diversity of our business means that we supply a  considerable number of customers in different sectors.   99 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  LIQUIDITY RISK Our liquidity management ensures that this risk is minimised in the Group, and that solvency  is ensured at all times. There are no concentrations of risk because we work together with a  number of credit institutions, on which we impose strict creditworthiness requirements. We generate our financial resources primarily from our operating business. We use them to   finance investments in non-current assets. We also use them to cover our working capital re- quirements. To keep these as low as possible, we monitor changes in our receivables, invento- ries and liabilities regularly using a standardised Group reporting system.  In response to the extraordinary situation that arose in the wake of the global financial and  economic crisis, and to provide for the risk of the crisis being of a prolonged nature, in 2009  we successfully placed a loan against borrowers note with a 3-year and 5-year maturity as an  added precaution. The reporting system additionally ensures that the Groups centralised financial management is  continuously informed about liquidity surpluses and requirements. This enables us to optimal- ly meet the needs of the Group as a whole and the individual companies. For our German  companies, for example, we use a cash pooling system. We are also in the process of rolling out  our receivables netting procedure within the KSB Group so as to minimise the volume of cash  flows and the associated fees. In addition, we always ensure that credit facilities are sufficient;  we identify the need for these on the basis of regular liquidity plans. The following tables present the contractual undiscounted cash flows of primary and deriva- tive financial liabilities. Interest payments on fixed-rate liabilities are determined on the basis  of the fixed rate. Floating-rate interest payments are based on the last floating interest rates  fixed before 31 December. Net payments on derivatives result both from derivatives with nega- tive fair values and from derivatives with positive fair values. Projections for future new liabili- ties are not included in the presentation. Based on our current state of knowledge, it is neither  expected that the cash flows will take place significantly earlier, nor that the amounts will devi- ate significantly.  100 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CASH FLOWS OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 2010 ( thousands) Total Up to 1 years 1 – 5 years > 5 years Financial liabilities 144,158 25,670 113,871 4,617   Trade payables   181,391   181,286   105   –  Other liabilities 42,777 37,656 4,782 339 Derivative financial instruments   – 1,569 – 1,101 – 467 – 1   366,757 243,511 118,291 4,955 CASH FLOWS OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 2009 ( thousands) Total Up to 1 years 1 – 5 years > 5 years Financial liabilities 215,930 39,159 172,129 4,642   Trade payables   147,090   147,090   –    –  Other liabilities 34,360 18,172 16,188  –  Derivative financial instruments   – 633 – 47 – 585 – 1   396,747 204,374 187,732 4,641 MARKET RISK Our global business activities expose us primarily to currency and interest rate risk. Any changes  in market prices here can affect fair values and future cash flows. We use sensitivity analyses to  determine the theoretical effects of such market price fluctuations on profit and equity. In doing  so, we assume that the portfolio at the reporting date is representative for the full year. Currency risk mainly affects our cash flows from operating activities. It arises when Group com- panies settle transactions in currencies that are not their functional currency. We minimise this  risk using currency forwards and options. You will find further information on this in the   Derivative financial instruments section of the Notes. As a rule, we do not hedge currency risk  from the translation of foreign operations into the Group currency (EUR).  The most significant foreign currency in the KSB Group is the USD. The volume of trade receiv- ables denominated in USD amounts to around  29 million (previous year: approximately  27  million). The volume of trade payables denominated in USD amounts to around  7 million   (previous year: approximately  5 million). For the currency sensitivity analysis, we simulate the effects based on the notional volume of our  existing foreign currency derivatives and our foreign currency receivables and liabilities at the  reporting date. For the analysis, we assume a 10 % increase (decrease) in the value of the euro  versus the other currencies.   101 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  At the reporting date, equity and the fair value of the derivatives would have been  7.2 million  lower (higher);  3.6 million results from USD and  3.6 million from the other currencies. At the previous years reporting date, equity and the fair value of the derivatives would have  been  4.2 million lower (higher);  2.9 million would result from USD and  1.3 million from  the other currencies. The theoretical effect on profit in the year under review would have been a decrease (an increase)  of  0.2 million.  0.7 million would be attributable to USD and  – 0.9 million to the other cur- rencies. The theoretical effect on profit in the previous year would have been an increase (decrease) of    0.8 million.  1.1 million would be attributable to USD and  – 0.3 million to the other curren- cies. Floating rate financial instruments are exposed to interest rate risk. In the case of long-term  loans, we hedge against this risk using interest rate derivatives on a case-by-case basis. Fixed rate  financial instruments are not exposed to this risk.  As part of our interest rate sensitivity analysis, we simulate a 100 basis point increase (decrease)  in market interest rates and analyse the effects on the floating rate financial instruments. In 2010,  the net interest balance would have been  3.2 million (previous year:  2.7 million) higher (low- er). Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives used to hedge floating rate liabilities in- crease (decrease) equity by  0.1 million (previous year:  0.2 million).  CASH FLOW STATEMENT The cash flow statement is prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows are classified by  operating, investing and financing activities. Effects of changes in the consolidated Group  and in exchange rates are eliminated in the relevant items. The effect of exchange rate   changes and changes in the consolidated Group on cash and cash equivalents is presented  separately. Cash flows from operating activities include a cash flow subtotal that merely comprises the  net profit for the year; depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses as well as reversals  of impairment losses; changes in non-current provisions; and non-cash effects, for example,  of the disposal of fixed assets. This subtotal is combined with the changes in the other oper- ating components of assets (including current financial instruments) and liabilities to deter- mine cash flows from operating activities. Cash flows from investing activities exclusively reflect cash-effective acquisitions and dispos- als of investments in intangible assets; property, plant and equipment; and non-current finan- cial assets.   102 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In addition to cash flows resulting from equity items (capitalisation measures and dividend  payments), cash flows from financing activities comprise cash flows arising from changes in  financial receivables and liabilities. Employee deferred compensation is also presented here as  it is externally funded. If cash and cash equivalents include restricted cash (e.g. cash used to hedge credit balances  prescribed by law for partial retirement agreements), this is reported separately.    Cash flows from operating activities include cash flows from interest received amounting to   7,159 thousand (previous year:  4,150 thousand) and cash flows from (income) taxes to- talling  – 37.894 thousand (previous year:  – 43,529 thousand).  Cash flows from investing  activities include cash flows from dividends received amounting to  4.201 thousand (previ- ous year: 5,148 thousand). Cash flows from financing activities include cash flows from in- terest paid amounting to  – 7.660 thousand (previous year:  4,621 thousand).  5.2 million of the cash flows from operating activities is attributable to the first-time con- solidation of companies; the prior-year figure would have been  1.0 million.  – 0.6 million  of the cash flows from investing activities is attributable to the first-time consolidation of  companies; the prior-year figure would have been  – 0.0 million. The effect of first-time con- solidations on cash flows from financing activities is  0.0 million; the prior-year effect  would have been  – 0.8 million. SEGMENT REPORTING Segment reporting corresponds to our new internal organisational and management struc- ture, as well as the reporting lines to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.  In our matrix organisation management decisions are primarily taken on the basis of the key  performance indicators – order intake, sales revenue and earnings before income taxes –   determined for the Pumps, Valves and Service Business Units. Reporting the relevant assets  (including the resulting depreciation and amortisation, impairment losses / write-downs),  number of employees and inter-segment sales revenue for these Business Units is not part of  our internal reporting. The managers in charge of the Business Units, which are geared to  product groups, have profit and loss responsibility. They identify business opportunities  across markets and industries and assess our options based on current and future market   requirements. They also proactively encourage the development of new products and im- provements to the available range of products. In this context, they work closely with our  Sales organisation and Operations.  103 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 Notes  The Pumps product group covers single- and multistage pumps, submersible pumps and   associated control and drive systems. Applications include process engineering, building   services, water and waste water transport, energy conversion and solids transport. The Valves product group covers butterfly, globe, gate, control, diaphragm and ball valves, as  well as associated actuators and control systems. Applications primarily include process en- gineering, building services, energy conversion and solids transport. The Service product group covers the installation, commissioning, start-up, inspection,   servicing, maintenance and repair of pumps, related systems and valves; as well as modular  service concepts and system analyses for complete systems  The amounts disclosed for the individual segments have been established in compliance with  the accounting policies of the underlying interim consolidated financial statements.  Transfer prices for intercompany sales are determined on an arms length basis. There were no discontinued operations in the year under review, as in the comparable period  of the previous year. The order intake of the Business Units by segment presents order intake generated with  third parties and unconsolidated Group companies. The external sales revenue of the Business Units by segment presents sales revenue generated  with third parties and unconsolidated Group companies. The effects from measuring con- struction contracts in accordance with IAS 11 are presented separately as reconciliation   effects. The segment results show earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), including non-control- ling interests. The effects from measuring construction contracts in accordance with IAS 11  are presented separately as reconciliation effects. The segment reporting format in the prior-period consolidated financial statements was by  region, in line with the internal organisational and management structure in place at the  time.  104 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER DISCLOSURES The changes in the consolidated Group did not have any material impact on the other disclo- sures; the same would have been reported in the prior-period consolidated financial state- ments. Contingent liabilities (contingencies and commitments) CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND SECURITY GRANTED   ( thousands) 2010 2009 Liabilities from guarantees 2,738 7,846 Liabilities from warranties 7,400 6,509 Liabilities from the granting of other security for third-party liabilities and other contingent liabilities 3,151 3,046   13,289 17,401 At present, there are no indications that any claims will be asserted under these obligations. Other financial obligations from rental agreements and operating leases (minimum lease pay- ments) amount to a total of  25,724 thousand (previous year:  22,494 thousand). Of these,   11,012 thousand (previous year:  10,389 thousand) is due within one year and  12,203  thousand (previous year:  10,402 thousand) due between one and five years. In the year   under review,  10,389 thousand was spent on these agreements. Operating leases relate primarily to vehicles and real estate. FINANCE LEASES Minimum lease payments Present values ( thousands) 2010 2009 2010 2009 Due within one year 2,990 748 2,866 685 Due between one and five years 862 3,199 789 2,949 Due after more than ve years 252 295 252 281   4,104 4,242 3,907 3,915 Finance leases relate almost entirely to real property. The term of the contract covers most of  the useful life of the asset concerned, or there is a purchase option, as is the case for a prop- erty in Germany.  The annual obligations from IT services agreements amount to  28,498 thousand (previous  year:  33,166 thousand) over a term of one to five years.   105 GENERAL INFORMATION CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 As in the previous year, there are no purchase price obligations from acquisitions of compa- nies and no payment obligations from capitalisation measures at Group companies. The aggregate purchase obligation for investments amounts to  6,905 thousand (previous  year:  11,567 thousand). Almost all of the corresponding payments are due in 2011. Other covenant agreements In the year under review there are two guarantee credit facilities for  10 million for which  covenant agreements defined by the lender must be observed. Both agreements relate to de- fined equity limits and to a dynamic debt level. There are currently no risks that the agreed  covenants will not be honoured. Related party disclosures Pursuant to section 21(1) of the WpHG [Wertpapierhandelsgesetz – German Securities Trade  Act], KSB Stiftung [KSB Foundation], Stuttgart, notified us on 21 May 2008 that its voting  interest in KSB AG, Frankenthal / Pfalz exceeded the 75.00 % threshold on 5 May 2008 and  amounted to 80.24 % (711,453 voting shares) on this date. 0.54 % of the voting rights  (4,782 voting shares) were held directly by KSB Stiftung and 79.70 % (706,671 voting  shares) were attributed to KSB Stiftung pursuant to section 22(1), sentence 1, No. 1 of the  WpHG. The voting rights attributed to KSB Stiftung were held by Klein Pumpen GmbH,  Frankenthal.  A rental and services agreement has been entered into between KSB AG and Klein Pumpen  GmbH. This resulted in the recognition of expenses of  77 thousand (previous year:  24  thousand) and income of  8 thousand (previous year:  9 thousand) at KSB AG in the year  under review. No interest (previous year: interest of  3 thousand) was paid on short-term  cash deposits by Klein Pumpen GmbH with KSB AG. Short-term deposits by KSB AG with  Klein Pumpen GmbH and by Klein Pumpen GmbH with KSB companies carry appropriate  rates of interest. Liabilities to Klein Pumpen GmbH as at 31 December 2010 amounted to    7 thousand (previous year:  473 thousand). All transactions are entered into on an arms length basis. This is also demonstrated by the  dependent company report prepared in accordance with section 312 of the AktG [Aktienge- setz – German Public Companies Act]. The total remuneration of members of the Supervisory Board amounts to  1,310 thousand  for financial year 2010 (previous year:  1,257 thousand), and the total remuneration of the  Board of Management amounts to  4,027 thousand (previous year:  3,705 thousand).    19,580 thousand (previous year:  21,026 thousand) has been provided for pension obliga- tions to former members of the Board of Management and their surviving dependants; total  benefits paid to these persons amounted to  1,436 thousand in the year under review (previ- Notes   106 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ous year:  1,428 thousand). Additions of  1,770 thousand (previous year:  1,906 thou- sand) were made to the pension provisions for active and former members of the Board of  Management. Based on the relevant legal provisions, the Annual General Meeting on 19 May 2010 resolved  not to disclose the remuneration of the Board of Management separately for each member  and classified by components. The members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management are listed the presenta- tion of the proposal on the appropriation of the net retained earnings of KSB AG. Auditors BDO AG, Frankfurt am Main, were appointed as the auditors and group auditors for finan- cial year 2010 at the Annual General Meeting in on 19 May 2010. The expenses for financial  year 2010 include audit fees of  250 thousand (previous year:  245 thousand). A further    45 thousand (previous year:  40 thousand) was incurred for the audits of German subsidi- aries. In addition, fees of  217 thousand (previous year:  30 thousand) were incurred for  other services. Events after the reporting period The tragic events in Japan have cast a new light on the discussion on the use of nuclear power  as a source of energy. It is still too early to assess the extent to which this will impact on or- ders for energy industry components such as pumps and valves. In principle, KSB offers prod- ucts suitable for all forms of energy conversion. Should the share of global electricity supplies  accounted for by nuclear power fall in the future, this would drive up demand for conven- tional power plants or renewable energy facilities. From todays perspective, such a trend to- wards substitution would not put KSB at a disadvantage. German Corporate Governance Code The Board of Management and Supervisory Board of KSB AG issued the current statement of  compliance with the recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Cor- porate Governance Code in accordance with section 161 of the AktG [Aktiengesetz – German  Public Companies Act]. The statement of compliance is published on our web site   (www.ksb.com) and has thus been made permanently accessible to our shareholders.  108 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     Name and seat of company     Country     Capital   share   %   Equity   thousands Net profit /   loss for the year    thousands     KSB Service LLC, Abu Dhabi U.A.E.

Frankenthal, 14 March 2011 The Board of Management  119 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 GENERAL INFORMATION Responsibility Statement Auditors Report AUDITORS REPORT We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by KSB Aktiengesellschaft,  Frankenthal / Pfalz, comprising the balance sheet, the statement of recognised income and ex- pense, the income statement, the statement of changes in equity, the cash flow statement and  the notes to the consolidated financial statements, together with the group management re- port for the business year from 1 January to 31 December 2010. The preparation of the con- solidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with IFRSs, as  adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to  section 315a(1) of the HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch – German Commercial Code] are the respon- sibility of the parent companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on  the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report based on our   audit. We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with section  317 of the HGB and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial state- ments promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprfer [IDW – Institute of Public Auditors].  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materi- ally affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in  the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting  framework and in the group management report are detected with reasonable assurance.  Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group  and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of  audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the  evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the group  management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit.  The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of those entities included in con- solidation, the determination of entities to be included in consolidation, the accounting and  consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evalu- ating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and group management  report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  120 GENERAL INFORMATION Our audit has not led to any reservations. In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the consolidated financial statements com- ply with IFRSs, as adopted by the EU, the additional requirements of German commercial law  pursuant to section 315a(1) of the HGB and give a true and fair view of the net assets, finan- cial position and results of operations of the Group in accordance with these requirements.  The group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as  a whole provides a suitable view of the Groups position and suitably presents the opportuni- ties and risks of future development.

The majority of  new recommendations added to the Code in 2010 were im- plemented, i.e. they were integrated into internal company  workflows and pending decisions. The new recommendation  which states that the Supervisory Board should specify con- crete objectives for its composition was not complied with,  however, although, in principle, we are guided by the criteria  specified in the Code in this context, and an age limit is in  place. Members of the Supervisory Board shall as a rule step  down at the Annual General Meeting held after they reach  the age of 75, and not later than upon reaching the age of 80.  These rules are currently being observed without exception.  Should Dr. Jacob and Mr. Lederer be proposed for re-election  at the Annual General Meeting in May 2011, their periods of  office would, by way of exception, exceed the age limit   recommended in the Rules of Procedure, but end well before  the they reach the age of 80.  The Board of Management and Supervisory Board once  again submitted a Statement of Compliance on 8 December  2010 in accordance with section 161 of the AktG and made  this accessible to shareholders on the companys web site  www.ksb.com together with statements from previous years. The Company complies with the recommendations of the  German Corporate Governance Code apart from two excep- tions*. The statement will be updated as required.  Going forward, we will continue to monitor and respond  quickly to further developments in the German Corporate  Governance Code to ensure that suggestions and recommen- dations that are applicable to KSB are implemented in the in- terests of sustained transparency and growth in our enter- prise value. At the same time we want to foster the trust  which investors, financial markets, employees, the public and  our customers, in particular, have placed in us. SHAREHOLDERS AND ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING KSB AG issued both no-par value ordinary shares and no-par  value preference shares. The holders of these shares, our  shareholders, exercise their co-determination and control  rights at the Annual General Meeting which is held at least  once a year. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board report  as follows on corporate governance at KSB as well as on the  remuneration principles for the Board of Management in ac- cordance with sections 3.10 and 4.2.5 of the German Corpo- rate Governance Code:  The term corporate governance covers the legal and factual  regulatory framework for the management and supervision  of companies; it is geared towards responsible management  and control with the ultimate goal of sustainable value crea- tion. The principles of corporate governance at KSB are  based on the German Corporate Governance Code. This  Code provides the basic framework for the management and  supervision of listed companies and formulates nationally  and internationally recognised standards of good and respon- sible corporate governance. We welcome the work of the  Government Commission of the German Corporate Govern- ance Code as well as the ideas and recommendations con- tained in the Code. These were last revised on 26 May 2010  and published on 2 July 2010 in the electronic Bundes- anzeiger [German Federal Gazette]. We are convinced that good, responsible corporate govern- ance will contribute greatly to the companys long-term suc- cess. This is why it has always ranked highly at KSB. Even  before the Code was introduced, we implemented the core  corporate governance and control processes in such a way  that they complied with the current key requirements of the  Code. We were traditionally guided in this by nationally and  internationally recognised standards of transparent, compre- hensible corporate governance. During the past financial year,  the Board of Management and Supervisory Board of KSB  Aktiengesellschaft discussed compliance with the Codes  guidelines as well as the relevant legal requirements in detail  on several occasions. Our objective is to continue developing  the principles of corporate governance in all parts of our  company.  STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE UPDATED  Pursuant to section 161 of the AktG [Aktiengesetz – German  Public Companies Act], the Board of Management and Su- pervisory Board of listed German public companies are under  the obligation to declare once per year whether the German  Corporate Governance Code was complied with and will     * SEE PAGE 126  122 GENERAL INFORMATION Continuous dialogue based on mutual trust between the  Board of Management and the Supervisory Board provides  an important foundation for the success of the company.  Their common goal is to generate appropriate, sustainable  returns through the systematic pursuit and implementation of  these principles. Both bodies thus collaborate closely for the  benefit of the company. The Supervisory Board receives regular, timely, comprehen- sive updates from the Board of Management regarding all  planning, business development, risk position and compli- ance issues which are relevant to the company. Decisions of  fundamental importance must be approved by the Super- visory Board. Any departure in business performance from  the formulated plans and objectives is discussed in depth and  openly; particular importance is attached to maintaining  strict confidentiality towards other persons. The principles of  the companys strategic and organisational alignment are de- fined in close cooperation between the Board of Management  and the Supervisory Board and are reviewed constantly. At  times the Supervisory Board also convened without the  Board of Management in order to intensify the exchange of  ideas within the Board. TRANSPARENCY KSB considers it extremely important to provide capital mar- ket participants with regular, comprehensive, consistent and  prompt information on the Groups economic situation. Re- porting takes place via annual reports, half-year financial re- ports and interim reports. All publications are published  within the time frames specified.  In addition, we provide information by means of press   releases and ad hoc statements whenever necessary. All infor- mation can be accessed online (www.ksb.com). At the web  site, you will also find our financial calendar which contains  the scheduled dates for major recurring events and publica- tions. In the event that any directors dealings take place which are  subject to reporting requirements, you will find the relevant  information at Investor Relations / Corporate Governance /  Directors Dealings*. Each shareholder is entitled to attend the Annual General  Meeting in accordance with the requirements as stipulated in  the Articles of Association and the law. If shareholders can- not or choose not to attend in person, they can opt to ap- point a proxy who will exercise their voting rights on their  behalf. In accordance with the Articles of Association, the Chair of  the Supervisory Board presides over the Annual General  Meeting. The Chair determines the order in which proceed- ings are conducted as well as the type and form of voting.  The Chair may reasonably restrict the time allocated to ques- tions and speeches by shareholders and, at the start of or  during the course of the Annual General Meeting, set time  limits for the entire proceedings of the Meeting, the discus- sion of the various items on the agenda as well as on individ- ual questions and speeches. The Annual General Meeting reaches decisions pertaining to  all of the duties and responsibilities assigned to it by law (e.g.  appropriation of net retained earnings, amendments to the  Articles of Association, election of Supervisory Board mem- bers). Each ordinary share authorises the holder to one vote.  The preference shares only entitle holders to voting rights as  prescribed by law but carry progressive additional dividend  rights. Klein Pumpen GmbH, Frankenthal, holds approxi- mately 80 % of the ordinary shares; the KSB Stiftung [KSB  Foundation], Stuttgart, holds a majority stake in Klein  Pumpen GmbH.  RESPONSIBLE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE BOARD OF  MANAGEMENT AND THE SUPERVISORY BOARD Good corporate governance requires an ongoing develop- ment of the dual management system prescribed for German  public limited companies in all sections of the business. This  begins with independent management by the Board of Man- agement which is monitored and advised by the Supervisory  Board. To promote effective management, the Rules of Proce- dure for both bodies specifically state that business shall be  conducted in accordance with the German Corporate Gov- ernance Code, with any departure from compliance with the  recommendations in justifiable, individual instances being  disclosed by the Board of Management and the Supervisory  Board.  * www.ksb.com/investor-relations   123 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 GENERAL INFORMATION Corporate Governance Report /  Remuneration Report KSB AG created an insider directory as required by section  15b of the WpHG [Wertpapierhandelsgesetz – German Secu- rities Trading Act]. Those persons affected are informed of  their current legal obligations and potential sanctions.  At the end of the financial year, the aggregate of all shares in  KSB AG held by members of the Board of Management and  Supervisory Board, either directly or indirectly, did not ex- ceed a total of 1 % of the shares issued.  Members of the Board of Management and Supervisory  Board are under the obligation to act in the companys inter- ests. When making their decisions, they must neither pursue  personal interests nor use for their own purposes any busi- ness opportunities that present themselves for the company.  Any conflicts of interest must be disclosed to the Supervisory  Board immediately. Should the need arise, the Annual Gen- eral Meeting must be informed of any conflicts of interest  and how they were dealt with. ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  The consolidated financial statements and interim financial  statements of KSB are prepared in accordance with the Inter- national Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted  by the European Union. After the consolidated financial  statements have been prepared by the Board of Management,  they are audited by the auditors elected by the Annual Gen- eral Meeting (BDO AG Wirtschaftsprfungsgesellschaft) and  adopted by the Supervisory Board. Prior to the publication of  interim reports and the half-year financial report, these are  discussed with the Audit Committee. An agreement has been reached with the auditors that the  Chair of the Supervisory Board or the Chair of the Audit  Committee shall be notified immediately of any substantial  findings or issues which emerge during the audit or of any  grounds for exclusion or exemption. MANAGEMENT PARAMETERS AND CONTROL SYSTEM As well as order intake and sales revenue, key performance  indicators for the management of the KSB Group are the re- turn on sales and the net financial position (i.e. the difference  between cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing in- vestments on the one hand, and financial liabilities on the  other). We also attach great importance to managing our ac- tivities in accordance with the economic value added (EVA)  concept. Our internal control system is based both on guidelines and  regulations that specify standard procedures as well as our  Group-wide risk management system. The organisation and  implementation of this risk management system are docu- mented in a manual. All Group units are responsible for iden- tifying and assessing risks and reporting these to Group  headquarters. They must also initiate countermeasures to avert or limit any  damage. Reporting on identified risks and the countermeas- ures initiated is an integral part of the planning and control- ling process. The Supervisory Boards Audit Committee also  looks at the reported risks on a regular basis. KSB identifies and communicates the risks based on the fol- lowing categories:    Market / Competition    Products / Projects   Finances / Liquidity    Procurement    Technology / Research and Development   Environment   Other risks The Internal Audits department performs regular reviews to  establish to what extent the specified guidelines and regula- tions are observed and whether the operating units are ap- propriately involved in risk management. COMPLIANCE AS A KEY TASK OF CORPORATE   MANAGEMENT Compliance in the sense of implementing measures to ensure  observance of applicable law and internal guidelines by  Group units is one of the Board of Managements key man- agement tasks. The Board of Management expressed its re- quirement of professional, honest conduct within our Group-  124 GENERAL INFORMATION REMUNERATION OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD The Supervisory Boards remuneration system is set out in  our Articles of Association. According to this, Supervisory  Board members shall receive lump sum remuneration in the  amount of  6,000 for the financial year. The chair is entitled  to twice this amount and the deputy chair is entitled to one  and a half times the amount. In addition, the members of the  Supervisory Board receive an attendance fee of  2,000 per  meeting of the Supervisory Board and its committees they at- tend; the attendance fee for committee chairpersons is    3,000 per committee meeting attended. No attendance fees  are paid for meetings of the Committee pursuant to section  27(3) of the MitbestG [German Co-determination Act]. The  members of the Supervisory Board are also covered by direc- tors and officers liability insurance taken out by the com- pany on behalf of the members of the Board of Management  and the Supervisory Board at standard market conditions. Finally, Supervisory Board members receive dividend-depend- ent remuneration for the financial year. For every 25 cents by  which the dividend distributed to ordinary shareholders ex- ceeds the amount of  1.0, the remuneration paid out to Su- pervisory Board members amounts to  1,200 for the chair,    900 for the deputy chair and  600 for the remaining mem- bers.  Any additional remuneration is reserved for determination by  the Annual General Meeting. The total compensation paid to  members of the Supervisory Board in 2010 amounted to    1,310 thousand (previous year:  1,257 thousand). REMUNERATION OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT   (REMUNERATION REPORT) The Remuneration Report summarises the principles applied  when determining the remuneration arrangements for the  Board of Management of KSB Aktiengesellschaft. It is geared  towards the recommendations of the German Corporate  Governance Code (section 4.2.5) and explains the remunera- tion system in place for Board of Management members.  This system is geared towards sustainable corporate develop- ment. It is adopted by the Supervisory Board plenary session  based on the recommendation of the Personnel Committee  and reviewed at regular intervals. The same applies to indi- vidual Board of Management compensation amounts. wide Code of Conduct. As well as talking to designated  people within the company, employees can call a whistle- blower hotline or contact an ombudsman if they are or be- come aware of any violations of anti-trust, cartel or penal  laws or guidelines. An external law firm is on hand which  will promptly forward any information to the Group Com- pliance Officer. Some fundamental statements contained in the Code of Con- duct are addressed in more detail in other, separate guide- lines. This particularly applies to the areas of anti-trust or  cartel law and anti-corruption measures. The applicable laws  and regulations are explained in greater detail and useful in- formation on proper conduct in concrete situations is pro- vided. The latter is similarly applicable to the guidelines pro- hibiting insider trading. This document provides an overview  of current legal requirements and specifies a clearing house  which can be contacted in the event of any doubts.  The main emphasis of compliance activities in 2010 was the  further development and management of our international  compliance organisation, particularly with regard to drawing  up and implementing suitable report formats. In addition, a  Group-wide compliance audit was conducted in order to  document and assess how thoroughly previous measures  were implemented within the Group. To round this off, spot  checks were performed on large-scale projects to ensure ob- servation of special aspects of compliance. The series of glob- al training sessions for employees were continued and, for  the time being, completed. The aim of these sessions was to  convey the core content of the guidelines in a practical man- ner and create a forum for discussion. Over the past three  years, these sessions gave more than 2,500 employees an op- portunity to learn about anti-trust, cartel and anti-corruption  legislation; updates are planned for the future. Another focus  of the Compliance Offices activities was to address basic   issues of IT compliance; these were addressed in greater  depth and in more detail during the financial year in coopera- tion with the department concerned.  125 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT MANAGEMENT AND ISSUES 2010 GENERAL INFORMATION Corporate Governance Report /  Remuneration Report The remuneration arrangements for the Board of Manage- ment are structured as clearly and transparently as possible.  The total amount of remuneration for the individual Board  of Management members is determined based on various   parameters. Criteria for assessing the appropriateness of the  remuneration include the responsibilities of the individual  Board of Management members, their personal performance,  the economic situation, the companys results and prospects  as well as customary remuneration amounts when taking  peer companies and the remuneration structure used else- where within the company into consideration. The remuneration of the Board of Management consists of  fixed and variable components. Fixed components are grant- ed regardless of performance and consist of a fixed sum plus  benefits, as well as pension commitments (retirement, disabil- ity, widows or orphans pension). The fixed sum makes up 60 % of the maximum annual sal- ary and is paid out as a monthly basic remuneration. All  Board of Management members are equally entitled to the  accompanying fringe benefits which include the private use of  a company car, payment of insurance premiums and any pay- ments associated with a post-contractual non-competition  clause. No loans or advance payments were granted to mem- bers of the Board of Management in the year under review. The variable component of remuneration is linked to the re- turn on sales achieved during the financial year in question,  with a weighting factor of 15 % of the maximum annual sal- ary. Board of Management members also receive variable remu- neration components which serve as a long-term incentive.  These are determined based on an economic value added ap- proach over a three-year period; a weighting factor of 25 %  of the members maximum annual salary is applied. Any neg- ative developments during this period are also taken into  consideration when calculating payments for the third year.  The total amount of the variable remuneration components  is limited in order to take extraordinary, unforeseen develop- ments into account. The weighting factors above do not re- flect the additional possibility of a premium, to be paid out in  individual cases at the discretion of the Supervisory Board, of  no more than three monthly salary payments per financial  year in recognition of any special performance of individual  members of the Board of Management. Such decisions shall  only be made on an irregular basis meaning that they do not  necessarily have to be made annually. Furthermore, when entering into any Board of Management  contract it is agreed that payments made to a Board of Man- agement member in the event that his or her Board of Man- agement tenure is terminated prematurely without good rea- son shall not exceed the value of two years remuneration  including fringe benefits (settlement cap in accordance with  section 4.2.3 of the German Corporate Governance Code).  No other payments have been promised to any Board of  Management members in the event of termination of service;  similarly no compensation will be paid in the event of a take- over offer. On 19 May 2010 – using a legally permissible option – the  Annual General Meeting once again resolved not to disclose  the details of the compensation for individual members of the  Board of Management for a period of five years. The total re- muneration paid to Board of Management members for ser- vices provided during the past financial year amounted to    4,027 thousand. During this period of time, additions of    1,770 thousand were made to the pension provisions for  active and retired members of the Board of Management. No  stock options or other share-based payment arrangements  are granted to members of the Board of Management. Fur- ther disclosures on the remuneration of the Board of Man- agement are to be found on page105 of the Annual Report.  126 GENERAL INFORMATION Since the publication of the last statement of compliance on  30 March 2010 KSB Aktiengesellschaft, Frankenthal (Pfalz),  has complied and continues to comply with the recommenda- tions of the Government Commission on the German Corpo- rate Governance Code as set out in the latest applicable   version – currently that dated 26 May 2010 –, with the ex- ception of the following: 1. With the exception of an age limit, the Supervisory Board  does not specify concrete objectives regarding its composition  (subsection 5.4.1, paragraphs 2 and 3). Reason:We appreciate the diversity in the composition of the  Supervisory Board aimed at by the Code, which will gener- ally be conducive to the interests of the company. To date, we  have always followed this principle. However, we take a criti- cal view of detailed specifications, in particular of quota sys- tems, as we believe that this would make it more difficult to  ensure an appropriate and adequately flexible composition  of this body. Frankenthal,  8 December 2010 For the Supervisory Board   For the Board of Management Dr. Hans-Joachim Jacob  Dr. Wolfgang Schmitt 2. The total amount of the remuneration paid to the mem- bers of the Supervisory Board for their service on the Board,  as well as of remuneration or advantages extended for ser- vices provided individually, in particular advisory or agency  services, is disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Finan- cial Statements, but in the Corporate Governance Report the  remuneration is disclosed neither separately for each member  nor classified by components (subsection 5.4.6, paragraph 3). Reason: The remuneration of the Supervisory Board mem- bers is described in detail in the Articles of Association; they  can be referred to for information on the individual remu- neration components in relation to the functions assumed on  the Supervisory Board. Beyond that, we prefer to provide  summarised information about the remuneration of the  members of the Supervisory Board rather than breaking it  down into the compensation paid to the individual members  and the components it contains, as we do not believe that the  latter would provide any additional benefits for shareholders  or the development of the company.
