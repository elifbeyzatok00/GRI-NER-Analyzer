Eco Tourism at  Karen Blixen Camp Karen Blixen Camp is an eco friendly luxury camp located  in the beauful Mara North Conservancy. We strongly  believe responsible tourism has the capacity to protect  a natural wildlife area, alleviate poverty through proper  working condions and contribute posively to the local  community  Dear Reader, Eco Tourism is the Buzz Word in todays tourism - if you Google it, it has more than 18,3 million  hits. Yet, nobody really seems to be able to explain what it incorporates, and what qualifies for a  property to use it.  Karen Blixen Camp believes that Eco Tourism is responsible and sustainable tourism, that it  has the capacity to protect a natural wildlife area, alleviate poverty through proper working  condions and contribute posively to the local community. With the great support from our  agents and appraisals from our guests, we know that Eco Tourism has come to stay in the todays  traveling market.  The responsibility doesnt end at the property â€“ the ground operators, travel agents and travelers  should make a stand, and inquire about the pracces of the property they plan to visit. We cannot  believe that anyone vising a camp, in a fragile ecosystem as the Mara, would wish to contribute  to deforestaon or polluon; that freshly chopped wood is used for heang their shower water or  cooking food, let alone that wastewater produced, is led directly into the Mara River. There is no doubt that the future of wildlife tourism, and survival of many wilderness areas across  the African connent looks very bleak; and if we dont begin to take Eco Tourism very seriously,  there will be very lile le of the Africa we love, for the next generaon. One of the most rewarding events in the last few year has been the consolidaon of Mara North  Conservancy. The Maasai landowners and the tourism partners have agreed to sign a lease  agreement that will protect this area and its wildlife for the next 15 years; safeguarding one of the  worlds most beauful places. The Maasai landowners receive a direct and predictable income for  seng aside their land for wildlife conservaon and we have the privilege to game drive within  their homeland area. We are very proud that a dedicated local community and a responsible  tourism sector can conserve a wildlife area.  We are also very proud that we have been approved by Danida, Danish Internaonal  Development Agency to establish a hospitality school for the Maasai youth. Our ambion is to  invest in the educaon of tomorrows young chefs and waiters. Our school will also offer IT as well  as foreign language courses for our staff and the local Maasai community. In future, when you  visit our camp, your safari guide will be able to share his or her knowledge in German, French or  Spanish.  The ideas we have put into Karen Blixen Camp do not have any copyrights, so please lets us share  the responsibility. Sren Rasmussen Chairman & Founder Karen Blixen Camp Yours faithfully, Marn Snderby Nielsen Managing Director & Founder Karen Blixen Camp  Educaon is a strategic social  investment, benefing both the local  community and the private sector Educaon is highly important in Kenya. Parents  will do everything possible to secure educaon for  their children. Life in the Mara is no exempon,  but for the majority of the young Maasai a full  course of secondary or terary educaon is  sll out of reach. There is simply no secondary  school found in the area; and for most families  school fees and the cost of living in the cies  are too high. Studies show that the educaon  level in the local Mararienda village is very low:  out of a populaon of 2,000 only ten people  have aended college educaon and only two  students have registered for their first degree  in a university. The research also shows gender  related concerns as only two girls out of 100  pupils graduate with a full primary school  educaon. Lack of affordable educaon facilies  clearly prevents the Maasai youth from expanding  their full employment opportunies. More than  50 percent of Maasai youth find themselves in  constant unemployment, contribung to the cycle  of poverty. Being located in one of the most famous wildlife  areas with visitors from around the world, Karen  Blixen Camp relies on our staff to give our visitors  that lile extra from their safari experience. This  is why we wish to establish the Karen Blixen  Hospitality School; giving the Maasai youth the  possibility of accessing affordable educaon. Learning for Life is a project funded by Danida  and Karen Blixen Camp. Our goal is to enable  A cooking school for Maasai youth   About Danida Karen Blixen Camp has been granted funding  from Danida through its Innovave Partner- ship for Development Program. IPD has the  objecve to alleviate poverty through job  creaon, economic growth and social devel- opment.  Companies receiving IPD funding should align  their business pracces with the principles of  the UN Global Compact and support the UN  Millennium Development Goals.  Danida is the Danish Internaonal Develop- ment Agency to developing countries. Please  visit www.ambnairobi.um.dk for more infor- maon about Danida in Kenya. graduated chefs and waiters to seek employment  at camps in the Mara or elsewhere in Kenya. We  have now finished the construcon of classrooms  and training kitchen for our future students. The  cooking school will give students a comprehensive  and praccal hands-on understanding of the  fundamental cooking skills; balancing between the  classical cuisine and modern recipes. Educaon  will be full me and students will be prepared for  entry-level posions such as comis-chef, demi- chef, chef de pare, or baker and pastry chef.  The Cooking School is set to open early January  2012.  Later, a food and beverages program for those  who wish to become waiters as well as a short  term course for room aendants will follow.  IT educaon  Karen Blixen Camp will also offer IT educaon.  A classroom will be completed with laptops and  internet connecon and an IT teacher will be  employed. IT courses for beginners, intermediate  and advanced levels will be offered, not only for  our future students, but also for our camp staff  as well as the local Maasai community. Our target  for 2015 is to offer IT educaon for all our staff  and make sure that at least 20 percent of the local  Maasai children and youth, girls and boys alike  have received IT educaon.  Literacy and Language courses  Foreign languages courses such as German,  French or Spanish will be offered to our  safari guides, enabling them to enhance their  qualificaons and in future offer professional  wildlife guiding in the above languages. Adult  educaon will be made available for those of our  staff wishing to become literate in languages as  Maa, Swahili and English.      Karen Blixen Camp believes educaon is a  strategic social investment that effecvely  contributes to the beerment of the local  communies as well as the private sector. The  direct benefit for us and other camps is access to  an internaonal skilled local workforce that gives  an outstanding service; compeve with the best  restaurants and hotels in the world.  decent income as well as environmental security  for the future.  The Forestry School will offer theorecal as well as  praccal tuion. Educaon will teach the students  about the Masai Mara climac condions,  indigenous trees, establishing  nurseries and how  to successfully plant, protect and nurture trees  into maturity. Students will also learn how to raise  awareness about the beauful Masai Mara by  performing speeches for guests.  Growing trees The forestry team has established a nursery with  a holding capacity of 7,000 seedlings. The tree  nursery is irrigated by recycling the wastewater  from the carwash area ulizing a simple waterway  system.  We focus on tree seedlings endemic to the lower  Mara River Basin as well as growing endangered  tree species. Our future plans is to expand the  degraded forests along the riparian zone of the  Mara River to reduce erosion, increase bird and  protect wildlife habitat.  Plant trees for conservaon We invite our guests to plant trees for  conservaon. Walk along the banks of the Mara  River, pick your favorite spot and dig a many holes  as you can and plant your tree seedlings.  Holisc Forestry  Kenyas rich natural wildlife is  threatened by widespread  deforestaon Only 1.7 percent forest cover remains of the  ones vast woodland areas. Commercial farming  and wood logging diminished the larger part in  the past. Today charcoaling is the biggest threat  to the environmental stability of Kenya. It is  esmated that 70 tons of charcoal are sold at  the Nairobi market every day. This represents  an annual destrucon of 120 km2 of Kenyan  forest. Much is consumed by the urban Kenyan  households, whom for economically reasons  depend on firewood or charcoal for their basic  domesc cooking needs. Large quanes are also  being exported for the barbeques in the Middle  East. Paradoxically, safari tourism has tradionally  contributed to this environmental disaster by  using unsustainably harvested firewood and  charcoal as an inexpensive way for heang up  water for guests showers. Maybe, oblivious of the  fact, that they are destroying the very foundaon  their own businesses are relying on?   Masai Mara is experiencing similar ecological  challenges. Precious virgin forested areas have  been destructed for commercial (tourism) and  household use of charcoal and firewood during  the last 20 years. The damage is beginning to  become significant. In some areas, especially  around the small villages, the shallow volcanic  topsoil is disappearing due to deforestaon. Most  Maasai women now have to walk at least 5 km  in search of firewood. Ambious reforestaon  iniaves are vital to restore the previous acacia  forest cover and renewable energy soluons must  be found.  Karen Blixen Forestry School Karen Blixen Camp is partnering with the  Woodlands 2000 Trust. We will establish a  Forestry School and offer vocaonal forestry  educaon for the Maasai youth. Our mission is  to conserve and enhance the beauful Masai  Mara by teaching the Maasai youth how grow  sustainably woodlots providing them with a   Teddy Kinyanjui doing what he loves most  The Woodlands 2000 Trust The Woodlands 2000 Trust is a Kenyan based organizaon that offers afforestaon consultancy  services to companies, farmers and landowners who are interested in commercial and environmental  sustainable woodlot farming. The overall objecve is to create a sustainable and profitable tree  products industry that contributes towards poverty alleviaon and increased bio-diversify in semi-arid  regions. The Woodland 2000 Trust was established in 2001 with a grant from the Brish Government, DFID,  Department of Internaonal Developments Business Partnership Program, in close partnership with  the Tamarind Group. The Trust has facilitated the plantaon of 700,000 trees in Kenya. Olisuk Concession a natural forested  area protected by Karen Blixen Camp  Green  Technologies Karen Blixen Camp has been  constructed to run in the most  environmental friendly manner  using the latest green technologies Being located in one of the most densely  populated natural wildlife areas in the world,  offering visitor exclusive safari experiences  represent many conflicng interests. No maer  the precauons taken, human interfere will  always put pressure on the ecosystem and its  wildlife. The important queson is: how should  one ensure an absolute minimized impact on the  environment?  Karen Blixen Camp has 24 hour electricity,  powered by an extensive solar panel system.  During sunny days the solar panels follows the  posion of the sun and the solar energy goes  into the baery bank ensuring electricity is also  available at night or on rainy days. The benefit is  obvious; there is no excessive use of diesel fueling  noisy generators and our outlet of CO2 is kept at  a minimum.  The total investment in the solar system with 55  solar panels of 175 Wa amounted to 135,000  USD. It is esmated that, with good care, the solar  system will last us 8-10 years. The equivalent  usage of power provided by a generator will  cost 54,750 USD per annum or 547,500 USD for  10 years usage. The cost buying the generator  exempted. In this context, invesng in green  technologies rather than a pollung generator  makes financial sense.         Tradional safari tourism relies on firewood and  charcoals as their main source of energy. But with  only 1.7 percent forests cover le in Kenya, usage  of firewood and charcoals is no longer viable.  Previously Karen Blixen Camp used gas for heang  our shower water, but has just recently installed  solar water heaters for heang water for the  outdoor guest showers. Recent development of  Our zero energy cold room: Four walls of  sustainable grown charcoal, some chicken  wire to hold it all together and an insulated  roof - and you have a 40M3 cold room,  where the temperature never exceeds 8  Celsius degrees  Eco Tourism is a business imperave. Not only a moral observa- on. Using green technologies is always an opportunity. Also in  Africa. Kenya offers a wide range of very enthusiasc companies  who are specialized in the development and sale of green tech- nologies. There is really no excuse not to go green. And it makes  great financial sense too  Moreover, we have stopped buying PET mineral  water boles as no proper recycling plant can be  found in Kenya. Instead guests are provided with  refillable water boles. We will connuously strive  to align our business pracces with a sustainable  purchase policy for reduced waste producon.  A school built of old milk and juice cartons The Late Peter Rosenberg was previously  working with Tetra Pack, Kenya, as the  Product Director. In 1997 he opened EcoTech,  a company recycling used Tetra Packs by  melng the old milk and juices packages into  blockboards. The combinaon of plasc and  foil makes these blockboards very durable  and all weather proof building materials. 800  tons of waste is recycled this way. Tetra Pack  has adopted Mr. Rosenberg iniave for  other countries to have their waste handled  responsible.     Ramji Haribhai Devani, a large Kenyan  company, was established in the late 1970s.  The company collects all types of hard plasc  and is melng the plasc waste into termite  proof plasc poles. Rhino Charge is one of  the biggest customers, using the plasc poles  in their commitment to protect the Abedare  Forest by fencing in the forest.  Karen Blixen Camp has bought 33 tons  of EcoTech block boards and 20 tons  of recyclable plasc poles to build our  hospitality school and boarding unit. With the  solar panel system our school will probably  be one of the greenest of its kind.     solar technology now allows, sufficient energy  from the sun to be captured, even on cloudy days.  Adding to the benefit, the solar water heaters  is centralized into one unit, connected to our  main water system, providing hot water for all  22 guest tents on a 24 hour base. We believe the  investment in solar water heaters will be returned  within 18 months. The benefit is simple; when not  using firewood and charcoal we do not contribute  to the deforestaon of Kenyan woodlands.  Wastewater treatment is another important  maer when running a camp out in the bush.  Water for guest showers, and not to menon  flushing toilets, creates wastewater. All  wastewater produced are led into the sewage  system and directed into the sepc tank. From  here the wastewater is mechanical treated as it  runs through channels of charcoal and sand filters,  ending in two huge soak pits. The surface water is  collected and used for watering our bush garden.  We test the grey water by sending samples to the  Kenyan Naonal Laboratory to ensure zero out let  of pollung agents.    Another new system which has just been  implemented is biogas. Biogas digesters are being  used to collect the black wastewater from our  staff houses where the gas produced are used to  heat showernwater for staff. In future we plan to install rainwater catchment  will be installed on all roofs throughout the camp.  We esmate that the rainwater will supply us  with 20 percent of our consumpon for our guest  showers and laundry.     Karen Blixen Camp is commied to recycle all  our waste produced. However, we must admit it  present a very challenging affair to accomplish  this obligaon. The western world benefit from  governmental regulated waste management  systems, whereas countries like Kenya sll struggle  to establish sufficient and effecve recycling  plants throughout the country. Much depend on  the private sector as well as the people working  in the takataka (waste) business. We separate our  waste and transport the non-degradable waste  back to Nairobi. We liaise with a private company  who collects it and sell it to recycling companies.   Trade, not aid The tourism industry is oen  cricized for not ensuring that  enough of its revenue goes back to  the host community Karen Blixen Camp distributes its revenue in many  different ways following the principle trade, not aid,  making it possible for the local Maasai community  to profit from our presence in their area. Karen Blixen Camp protects 3,400 acres (1,373 Ha)  of natural wildlife area as a private concession.  Eleven Maasai families have decided to lease their  land to us and in return we pay them a fixed bed  night fee every me a guest stays at our camp. The  bed night fees accumulate to 70,000 USD annually. We support locally produced goods and use local  suppliers. Free ranging and eco friendly Masai goats  and lambs are sold by Masai herdsmen and served  for our staff. Milk for the staffs morning tea also  comes from the local Masai cale. For logisc and  contractual work we hire local trucks and jeeps. We  spend 40,000 USD annually using local suppliers,  saving us money, me and diesel not purchasing  from Nairobi. When guests previously visited the tradional  Masai village the cket fee oen did not benefit  the villagers. Together with Tribal Voice, UK, we  have iniated a simple ckeng system to ensure  direct payment and transparency. When guests visit  the local Masai village they are obliged to obtain a  cket at the camp. We keep track of all sold ckets  and at the end of each month the total amount  is calculated and the money paid. In this way, the  villagers are ensured to receive the money they  are entled. On behalf of our guests we forwarded  8,500 USD to the tradional Maasai village in 2010.  The beauful Maasai arfacts for sale in the gi  shop are made by a local womens group. Since we  wish to promote trade, not aid, prices are nego- ated and the gi shop makes a profit every me a  guest buys the arfacts. Last year we bought Masai  beadwork worth 3,800 USD and sold everything,  making the business profitable for both pares.  IFU, Investment fund for developing countries Karen Blixen Camp is a Kenyan registered company owned by Danish shareholders. IFU, the Investment  Fund for developing countries has granted us a loan, as a part of their objecve to promote economic  and social growth in developing countries.  IFU has invested with Danish companies in Africa for nearly 40 years and is one of the most experi- enced instuons when it comes to invesng in and seng up businesses on commercial terms on  the connent. Companies must integrate an ambious CSR policy to ensure high standards in respect  of environment, labour principles, human rights and an-corrupon. Please visit www.ifu.dk for more  informaon on Danish investments in Africa.   Alternave housing for the Maasai - Why Eco Housing? Most Maasai families reside in small huts made of cow dung, but many wish to improve their standards  of living. The delicate cow dung dried roof and walls cannot provide adequate protecon against the  weather, especially during the rainy season. Moreover, airborne diseases as common cold, pneumonia  and tuberculosis are constant risk factors in these poorly venlated living condions with a constant  exposure to smoke. Brucellosis, a bacterial disease affecng people in close contact with cale, is also a  hazard as it is transmied to humans through consumpon of unpasteurized milk and possible through  inhalaon of dry dust.  The natural resources of the Masai Mara have for generaons been taken for granted, but these days  are over. It is important that modern alternave building techniques are introduced to preserve the  forest cover and water resources and at the same me improving the living standard in a cultural and  environmental sensive way. Karen Blixen Camp is considering how we can facilitate beer housing for the Maasai. We have asked  an architect to design three types of houses using EcoTech blockboards and plasc poles. The idea is  that an individual local Maasai family can come to our partner, Muskaki Enterprisess, shop in Aitong  and buy their preferred model house with rainwater catchment and solar panel system. We will donate  the salary for the architect and cover the cost of transporng building materials from Nairobi to Masai  Mara.  Being the single largest sector in  the world economy, tourism plays a  key role for many African countries.  Tourism creates jobs and incomes for  millions of people. As such tourism  is capable of contribung posively  to the UN Millennium Development  Goals; alleviang extreme poverty  and hunger through full and decent  employment Africa is highly dependent on the global econo- my, but the global economy is not dependent on  Africa. Africa accounts for less that 1 percent of  annual global capital inflows and for less than 2  percent of the world trade. The enre GDP of Af- rica (excluding South Africa and Nigeria) is about  equal to that of a small country as Ireland.  According to the World Bank an esmated 44  percent of the African populaon will connue to  live in extreme poverty with less than 1 USD per  day. In absolute terms, the number of poor people  has nearly doubled, from 200 million in 1981 to  380 million in 2005. Sadly, the financial crisis has  pushed another 65 million people into vulnerable  employment worldwide. They and their family  find themselves living in extreme poverty without  a financial stable job, but reliant on casual, sea- sonal or own-account labour. To beat the poverty  line, 11 millions of jobs must be created every  year in Africa. Research shows that nine out of  ten jobs are created in the private sector; making  private sector led economic growth crucial for  employment generaon and poverty reducon.  In this light tourism presents a key role, being the  single largest sector in the world economy with  millions of people depended on the revenue gen- erated. Tourism of today has a huge responsibility  of contribung to a beer and more just world.  But tourism must be conducted in a responsible  manner, adhering to internaonal accepted stand- ards. Tourism is, unfortunately, a fiercely compe- ve global market, with incenves for pung  short-term earnings before long-term social and  environmental consideraons. Protecng the  environment, respecng workers right, ensuring  full and decent employment as well as promot- ing gender equality is crucial should the tourism  industry wish to have a sustainable impact in the  developing countries.     Karen Blixen Camp observes the Working Law  of Kenya 2007 and respects the Internaonal  Labor Organizaons (ILO) declaraon on rights  to work. We support the UN Global Compact and  Working condions  are obliged to submit a yearly communicaon on  our progress. Moreover, we have adopted the UN  Millennium Development Goals and are working  towards seng our own targets. Full and decent employment We employ 111 staff members. 96 are working at  the camp in the Mara and 15 are working at the  head office in Nairobi. All staff  is employed on a permanent  contract unl rerement. This  ensures full and producve  employment with job security,  rights in case of terminaon  as well as social and medical  benefits. We refrain from using  casual and seasonal labor.  The salary consists of a base  salary and travel or housing  allowance. In addion we pay  5 percent of our total revenue  every month as a bonus salary.  Staff works on a monthly  schedule with 21 working  days, 7 days on leave and an  addional 3 weeks holiday a  year. Freedom of associaon The Internaonal Labour  Organizaon has endorsed  workers with the universal right  to freely join an associaon  and to bargain. We respect  and encourage these rights. All staff is free to  join any chosen associaon. Five staff members  have been democracally elected to form the  staff commiee. The commiee represents the  staff and act on their behalf, raising quesons or  maers that worry them. Staff is also able to voice  any concern through the monthly staff meengs  where the enre staff and the management are  represented.  Gender equality Promong gender equality is crucial. Poverty is  not gender-neutral, but affects men and women in  different ways. Women are more likely to be em- ployed in vulnerable jobs â€“ in farming, as unpaid  family workers or as own-account workers â€“ with  no or lile financial security or social benefits.  Karen Blixen Camp is commied to promote  gender equality. Women and men are given the  same employment condions and salary is paid  in accordance to qualificaons. Women are also  given 3 month of maternity leave on full pay. Men  are entled to 14 days paternity leave.  Of our 111 staff members, only 14 are women.  In other words; we are sll lacking far behind  securing a 50 percent gender rao amongst our  staff. The reasons are barriers within the society  as well as lack of educaon. Women are therefore  strongly encouraged to apply.  Medical and social benefits Medical insurance is important in countries  without welfare state funded healthcare systems.  Our staff has insurance through the Naonal  Health Insurance Fund. NHIF covers the individual  and his/her close family in case of in-paent  medical help (hospitalizaon), but not in case of  out-paent medical help. When needed, staff is  able to seek medical help at the local Mararienda  Health Clinic. Such out-paent acvies  are paid  by the company. Some of our staff has registered for Kentours Sacco, a  cooperave that provides loans on an employee membership  base. Every month we reduce a fixed amount from the  individuals salary, which is paid into a joint fund. Whenever  needed staff can apply for a loan with low interest rate for  payment of school fees, hospital bill or even building a house  Two doctors, Dr Ingrid Helweg Gichere and  Dr Raphael Gichere from Kenyaa Naonal  Hospital, Nairobi, are aached for counseling and  monitoring of health for all staff. The doctors also  come to our camp and inform about HIV/Aids  and family planning. Our staff is able to pose any  quesons on maers that worry them and their  families.   Social security is provided through the Naonal  Social Security Fund (NSSF), which reimburses  social benefits when a member reres from a  regularly paid employment or to the dependants  of a deceased member. NSSF also offers funeral  grants. Living condions Working in the bush means living in the bush.  Our staff accommodaon comprises two stone  houses; canteen, flush toilets and hot water  showers. All staff rooms have a bed, beddings,  linen, a mosquito net and a lockable cupboard for  private belongings. The canteen serves breakfasts,  lunches and dinners. TV with DSTV provides news  from the outside world and a DVD shows movies.  Twice a year, a football tournament between the  camps of the area is arranged.  UN Global Compact The UN Global Compacts asks companies to align their business pracces with the  ten universal accepted principles:     Human Rights 1. Businesses should support and respect the protecon of internaonally proclaimed human rights;  2. make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Labour 3. Businesses should uphold the freedom of associaon and the recognion of the right to collecve      bargaining; 4. the eliminaon of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; 5. the effecve abolion of child labour; and 6. the eliminaon of discriminaon in respect of employment and occupaon. Environment 7. Businesses should support a precauonary approach to environmental challenges; 8. undertake iniaves to promote greater environmental responsibility; and 9. encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. An-Corrupon 10. Businesses should work against corrupon in all its forms, including extoron and bribery. The UN Millennium Development Goals by 2015 1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger 2. Achieve universal primary educaon 3. Promote gender equality and empower women 4. Reduce child mortality 5. Improve maternal health 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases 7. Ensure environmental sustainability 8. Develop a global partnership for development  One of the worlds most beauful cats, which Mara  North Conservancy are proud to host six of  Mara North  Conservancy Karen Blixen Camp is located in the  beauful Mara North Conservancy.  We protect more than 32,000 Ha of  stunning natural wilderness in close  partnership with the Maasai  communies and our tourism  partners Mara North Conservancy is one of the most  densely populated wildlife areas within the Masai  Mara Ecosystem. The conservancy forms the vital  north western corridor of the Greater Masai Mara  Ecosystem. It is the favored habitat for a large  variety of very unique African wild animals and  serves as key dispersal area for the annual great  wildebeest migraon.  Mara North is home to the Leopard Gorge, a vital  birthing and maternity ground for the big cat  predators, made world famous by the BBCs Big  Cat Diary. Five prides of lions amounng to 52  family members, seven cheetahs and at least six  leopards has made the conservancy their home- land area. In the northern corridor the scenic  Lemek Hills make an important wildlife refuge,  parcularly to a pack of highly threatened African  wild dog. Community and tourism conservaon Communies living in natural wildlife areas must  be provided with the economic incenves to set  aside their land for wildlife conservaon. The  Mara North member camps guarantees the Maa- sai landowners fixed monthly lease payments for  the privilege to game drive within their beauful  homeland area. The lease payment is not subject  to the number of conservancy ckets sold and  therefore enrely unaffected by possible fluctua- ons of tourism. The concept is truly innovave  and marks the first me that the Masai landown- ers in this area have received direct, predictable  and transparent income from wildlife, allowing  the community members to plan ahead for the  future. Ecosystem Management Professional wildlife management is crucial. Brian  Heath, Seiya Ltd. has been appointed as Mara  North Conservancy Conservaon Manager with  Marc Goss as the daily Manager and Benson  Ketere as Head Warden of the ranger surveillance  team. Seiya Ltd. is an internaonal recognized  conservaon company with over 40 years of  wildlife conservaon experience. Mara North employs 30 rangers to protect the  conservancy and its wildlife. Their foremost objec- ves are an-poaching enforcement, controlled  grazing zones for livestock, restoraon of natural  habitats and response to human/wildlife conflicts.   Poaching has been and is a very current threat  to wildlife. Elephants are sll being shot in great  numbers to remove and sell their tusk for ivory  producons. Plain game as zebras or wildebeests  is caught in snares to be sold at the growing  worldwide bushmeat market. Marc Goss and his  rangers will, when necessary, arrest and hand  over suspects to the Kenyan Wildlife Services and  the Kenyan Police. The day and night surveillance  of the wilderness area most definitely prevent  poachers to access and destroy wildlife within the  Mara North Conservancy.     Human-wildlife conflicts occur in areas where man  and wild animals live side by side. The Maasai  have never hunted the plain games for meat, but  Exclusive and private wildlife area Mara North Conservancy is of the exclusive  use of the eleven member camps. Guests  vising our area are ensured of a truly private  safari experiences with controlled vehicle  density and sound ecotourism pracces. The  number of beds per camp has been restricted  to ensure minimum impact. Starng in  2011, only Land Cruisers and Land Rovers  are allowed and must be accompanied by  a professional safari guide. Mara North  camps and their guests must adhere to a  professional code of conduct when game  driving. Mara North was established as a  not-for-profit public company on the 1st of  January 2009.  Three siblings of the famous Leopard Gorge pride.  The picture are from March 2009, so today they are  almost grown ups  enrely depended on their livestock. However,  tradions have prescribed for every young warrior  to kill a lion in order to reach his manhood. This  pracce has unfortunately not completely ceased  to exist. Young Maasai warriors will sll kill the big  cat predators in retaliaon for aacked livestock.  Marc Goss and his rangers are responding to any  human-wildlife conflicts occurring within the area  to discourage retaliaon and find a joint soluon  for future co-existence. Mara North Conservancy  has introduced a compensaon scheme in the  event of predator-livestock conflicts. The scheme  works as an insurance fund with the landowners  paying 50 percent and the member camps the  other part. The cost to the individual landowner  is on average 21 USD per year. Moreover, we are  introducing predator proof enclosures (bomas)  to keep livestock safe at nights as well as recom- mending beer herding pracces. Controlled grazing and zoning for livestock is  important to accommodate both wildlife and  livestock. Mara North Conservancy keeps certain  zones and hours restricted for grazing. Cale  grazing are permied in areas, where they do not  interfere with wildlife such as the predators. The story behind   The Masai Mara is one of the most beauful  wildlife areas in the world; famous, for the great  migraon. However, only a relavely small area of  this unique ecosystem is protected by the Kenyan  Government. The Masai Mara Naonal Reserve  was established in 1961 and protects an area  of 1,510 km2. On the north, west and the east  border of the Naonal Reserve the Masai Mara  Ecosystem was divided into several group ranches  under communal land trust. During the early 1980s the Maasai were given  permission to re-inhabit their tradional home- land areas. The Kenyan Government subdivided  these group ranches into 60 Ha plots, issued to  individual Masai landowners, making it difficult to  create a sustainable, well coordinated and effec- ve wildlife protecon with recognizable benefits  for the wildlife and the communies.

Ten different  associaons with 143 directors were responsible  for collecng and distribung park fees as well  as protecng the area; a very challenging task  with different polical interests. It is esmated  that the Koyiaki-Lemek Wildlife Trust generated  approximately 2,5 Mill USD from the years 2005 to  2007, but only managed to distribute 20 percent  of this revenue to the Maasai landowners, giving  each landowner a total of 8 USD per Ha per year.  Furthermore cale grazing, human selement as  well as development of new tourist establishment  was uncontrolled. During the fall of 2008 the founding member  camps of Mara North decided to address the Maa- sai leaders to find a sustainable and long term so- luon for the conservaon of the area. Numerous  meengs were held beneath the shade of acacia  trees, before the 878 Masai landowners decided to  lease their land to the Mara North Conservancy.  Today, the twelve Mara North member camps are  obliged to pay 112,000 USD per month in fixed  lease payments, which on a yearly base accounts  to 1,3 million USD (using the exchange rate 80  ksh to the dollar). 83 percent is distributed as  lease payments, paid directly into the individual  landowner bank account and 17 percent is  allocated for conservaon management with  employment of rangers, vehicle surveillance  and maintenance of infrastructure. As a result,  each Maasai landowner is secured 37.50 USD  per Ha amounng to at least 2,220 USD per year.  In comparison farmers will pay approximately  22 USD per Ha for leasing the wildlife area for  culvang.
