As a  pioneer in this area, Hypo Alpe-Adria-Leasing d.o.o.  Beograd immediately positioned itself as a leader,  remaining one until today. In 2002 Hypo Alpe-Adria-Leasing is joined by Hypo  Alpe-Adria-Bank a.d. Beograd, as a part of the Hypo  Alpe-Adria-Bank International, the most successful  regional bank in the Alps-Adriatic region.

Thanks to its constant and very strong growth, the  bank was among the top five financial institutions  in the country as of December 31, 2010, present in  all major economic centres in Serbia, with top-of- the-class portfolio, more than 800 employees and a  wide business network. Head office of Hypo Alpe- Adria-Bank a.d. is located in the business centre  "Ue" in Belgrade. In the past years we invested a lot of efforts and  knowledge to win the trust of the population in  our professionalism and capabilities. Today we are  proud to say that we have succeeded in it, because  first of all, we are a partner offering absolute  security and trust to our clients, with satisfaction of  all as the most important goal.  9 Hypo Alpe Adria was founded in 1896 in Klagenfurt (Austria), started its expan- sion for the first time in 1988, by opening a Hypo Alpe-Adria-Leasing branch  in Udine. Today Hypo Alpe Adria has a network of 380 branches. In accordance  with its system of values acquired through long years of experience and modern  banking principles it operates in the Alps-Adriatic region in 11 countries: Austria,  Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Germany,  Hungary, Bulgaria and Macedonia. Our presence in the ex-YU countries has been  very important to us and we consider it to be a large responsibility.    Member companies of the Hypo Alpe Adria Group employ around 8000  people, and more than 1.2 million people use its services in all group markets. In December 2009 the Republic of Austria became the sole and 100%  shareholder of Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG. Hypo Alpe Adria is  a strong financial institution dedicated to economic growth of the Alps- Adriatic region. Our goal is to become a leader in the most efficient and best  quality financial services in all markets we operate in. Core of our activities is  based in long term relationships with clients based on loyalty and discretion,  which we gain through constant effort to become the best in the market, to  comprehend the market and needs of clients.

The core of our activities consists of the long-term relation- ships with clients based on loyalty and discretion, that  arise from constant effort to be the best on the market, to  understand market and customer needs. Hypo Alpe Adria  Safe business   tradition More than 100 years of experience  11 Sustainable growth â€“  formula of successful  business  One of the most important strategic goals of Republic of Serbia is to become  a member of the European Union, and one of the basic EU principles is  solidarity, representing a general goal of all European societies. All countries  aspiring to this principle, including the Serbian Government, participate  actively in the process of social inclusion in order to improve quality of life of  all citizens of Serbia. Realization of this goal demands changes that should  accelerate the social and economic development of our country and lead  to improvement of material standing of all social groups, families and every  individual. Having in mind the basic principles of sustainable business, the goal of  corporate social responsibility of Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank a.d. Beograd is to  contribute to development of the society and decrease of poverty through  its activities in Serbia by adhering to two key strategies: 1.  Providing support and aid for development of education, culture, art and  sport in Serbia in order to strengthen capacity for generating new work  places, increasing employment capacity of young people and promoting  healthy life style. 2.  Mitigation of effects of bad social and economic situation in the country  by aiding the most affected social groups and most affected areas.  These two key corporate social responsibility strategies of Hypo Alpe- Adria- Bank a.d. Beograd are realized through the following activities:  Supportingorganizationsandinstitutionsengagedinprojectsinareasof education, culture, art and sport   Supportingtalentedandsuccessfulindividuals  Humanitarianaidforurgentinterventions  Donationsandhumanitarianaidforthemostaffectedsocialgroups It is our opinion that such activities contribute to inclusive society and  decrease poverty, at the same time fulfilling the Millennium Development  Goals the Republic of Serbia accepted as its obligation. MArkEt oVErViEw  13 Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank a.d. Beograd is an active participant in professional confer- ences whose goal is to find solutions for economic and social problems in Serbia  and in the region. This year we were a general sponsor of the kopaonik Business Forum, one  of the best known professional conferences. Goal of this traditional econom- ic event is to study and analyze contemporary economic issues in the coun- try and exchange of opinions among the most relevant experts and decision- makers in the country and abroad. Since we have been operating in the Serbian market we have also sponsored  the Management forum of SE Europe Bled-kopaonik. Forum participants  are the highest representatives of regulatory bodies and government agen- cies, financial experts and representatives of scientific institutions from Serbia,  Slovenia and the region.  In the financial segment we support the professional community and we are  partners of the Serbian Government with purpose of improvement of the  Serbian economic development, exchange of opinions and resolving prob- lems , but one of the equally important parts of the engagement are personal  finance management workshops.  This project is managed by members of the work group for social responsibil- ity in banking and finance working as the Global Compact in Serbia, with the  subject of planning and management of personal finance. Workshops are for all citizens, regardless of their income, because higher in- come does not necessarily mean better management of personal budget. Aside from financial education as one of key targets of these workshops, great  significance belongs to mutual cooperation of bank members and business en- tities involved in organization and realization of this project, whose focus are citi- zens and their education, all with the purpose of not only better knowledge of fi- nancial services, but also strengthening of trust into the banking sector. CALL CEntrE oF   Hypo ALpE-ADriA-BAnk We are listening! Call Centre was founded to achieve the  best possible communication and  exchange of all sorts of information: 1. between the bank and its clients 2.  between departments and sectors in  the bank who use services of the Call  Centre for sales, i.e. processing banks  products and services  Providing information to clients represents  an exceptionally important and responsi- ble task. Employees of the Call Centre are  first of all demanded to provide precise,  clear and correct information, to respond to  client calls i.e. queries timely, to be kind and  to represent the company and its values  gained through long years of experience  and successful work adequately.  Aside from providing information the  client needs, a very important function of  the Call centre is to provide insight to the  bank how to meet clients needs in the  best possible way. Employees collect  complaints and suggestions from clients  sent afterwards to the Compliance  Department. Each compliant is discussed  individually, and sent to responsible units.  Purpose of these analyses is to change our  business in accordance with our  clientsneeds by responding to complaints  and suggestions, if justified. Call Centre is a very important part of the  bank, our ears to listen to our clients, take  care of them and improve our business  through their suggestions and remarks.

Equal treatment of all people who seek employment in the  bank, and all employees regardless of their race, colour of  their skin, gender, marital status, family obligations, age, lan- guage, confession, political orientation, national and so- cial background, is not only a legal obligation but one of the  founding principles the bank adheres to in its operations.

Specific characteris- tic of the banking sector, our bank as well, is the gender struc- ture expressed though the ratio of 70:30 for women. Gender  equality implies that all our employees are awarded accord- ing to their knowledge and work, and not gender and that  they all have equal opportunities.   16 65 babies were born in 2010, and for each baby employees â€“  parents received a one-off cash present.

After finalizing her studies in June  2006 she started working in Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank a.d. Beo- grad as a trainee. She said about that experience: I was intro- duced to the concept of trainee programme abroad, because  it is not very often seen in our country. I am glad that after all  the tests and interviews i became part of the programme, be- cause it enabled me to gain insight into operations of indi- vidual sectors and functioning of the bank as a whole. I think  that afterwards it really made my work and progress easier,  especially understanding of a large system. After the Faculty of economy, major in finance, banking and  insurance, Lidija enrolled in master studies in the Faculty of  organizational sciences, major in management, currently near  finalization.

She trans- ferred to her colleagues a lot of knowledge she acquired in  Formula of  success intEr ViEwS: younG, HArD-workinG AnD tALEntED 20 They are part of our Hypo family. Lidija ovi, Jasna  Popovi and Nenad Sofroni are a true example of the  thesis that hard work always pays off. various positions in the bank, which is precious to her col- leagues now in those positions. She said about her department: Although the Network Steer- ing Department is a sort of back office, we are in everyday  contact with colleagues from the network, and though them  with clients. The most important fact is that we get to achieve  better and better results every year because of team work. She is Faculty of economy graduate, major in finance, bank- ing and insurance. nEnAD SoFroni Has been with us since 2003.

Each day at work  brings new situations with it. The largest challenge is to find adequate solution  for a certain situation and to reach information and knowledge that can aid in  successful realization of work within given deadlines.  Jasna: Everyday contact with clients is a challenge in itself. They expect us to  help them find solutions that would satisfy their wishes and needs adequately.  I also try to provide support and help to colleagues from the network in their  everyday tasks. All of us together are responsible for the impression we make  on clients, because we thus directly influence forming of their opinion about  the bank. Nenad: Having in mind that I have been working in Hypo bank since it came  to the Serbian market, I have faced many challenges during its development.   I would put forward working in the Corporate Sector in the first few years of  its existence. As a member of a small team I contributed to the banks taking  a significant portion of the market and offering its clients our recognizable in- novativeness, quality and professional banking service. Another challenge  was going to work in the head office in Klagenfurt, where I was faced with a  different culture and business environment I had to adapt to.  personal and professional success Lidija: I think that people you work with and  you work for are an important factor of your  satisfaction. I am happy my colleagues are al- ways ready to help whenever I need it. Pro- fessional success would be much harder if I  didnt have people by my side who are hard  working and successful. Everyone gives their  best and thus we contribute to achieving our  common goal. Jasna: I am very proud of the fact that I  have extraordinary cooperation with my col- leagues. Satisfied clients are also a big confir- mation that your work is a success. Of course,  all that is possible when your work in an en- vironment offering possibilities for educa- tion and with people ready to pass on their  knowledge. Nenad: Regardless of the dynamic life envi- ronment, I have recently celebrated ten years  anniversary of a happy marriage and made a  family I find all my happiness in, which is my  biggest personal success.  My biggest professional success is my contri- bution to creation of one of the largest and  most professional financial institutions in our  region, creation of a pleasant work atmos- phere, and selfless help to others, all with the  interest of the organization I work for and  its clients in mind. In all situations I have al- ways tried to do the right thing, I gave my  best and I was persistent in it regardless of  the fact that my efforts and my investment  did not always provide visible short term re- sult, but with faith that long term success is  imminent. Most interesting part of work Lidija: Work I do is not monotonous and dull.  It implies getting to know a large number of  people, meeting different god and bad ideas,  facing obstacles you have to jump over and  rejoicing successful realization of work. All  those are elements making work interesting  and constantly different. Jasna: Retail and Private Banking Sector has  a wide spectre of tasks, and each client is  an individual, je implying that a special ap- proach is necessary to find the best possi- ble combination of products and services of  the bank. It is a challenge to recognize that  best combination for a client or to be of help  to colleagues in their work, which motivates  you to learn and progress every single day. nenad Sofroni Head of Group Department Credit  rehabilitation Serbia   23 Nenad: Adapting everyday activities and  set tasks to dynamic environment, daily fac- ing with complex tasks, whose solutions de- mand creativity, knowledge, persistence and  interaction with other people.  Balance between work and private life   Lidija: All I can say is that I admire people, es- pecially women, who balance their work and  family obligations successfully, because that  is not simple at all. Jasna: Balancing ones business and pri- vate life nowadays represents a true chal- lenge. Dedication is important in any case.  That means that at work one needs to stay  focused on current obligations, while time  spent with the family and friends should be  reserved only for them. Good organization is  key to success.  Nenad: I do not consider my time spent with  my family, or my time at work to be an obli- gation, but I enjoy each truly, and find pleas- ure in both. I think such interpretation is key  to success. No matter how silly that could  seem, I have not finished a single work day,  no matter how stressful and hard, without  finding some pleasure in it that would mo- tivate me to go home with a smile, spend  quality time with my family, and return to  resolving business tasks the next day with  even more energy. A man has to find a pas- sion, to dedicate himself to it every day for  at least a few moments and to give it huge  significance. in five years i see myself... Lidija: Successful both in my business and  private life, I hope. Jasna: I would like to work in positions that  would enable me to learn and get educated  further, and to contribute to success of the  Hypo bank with my knowledge.  Nenad: As much as I fantasize sometimes  about a relaxed position and short work- ing hours, I cannot see myself walking back- wards, and I think I am not ready yet to re- tire either. I think that in five years I will work  even harder in more dynamic, more complex,  more responsible and more interesting jobs,  which would provide additional satisfaction.  I am programmed to enjoy in the summer  and beautiful weather only after a long and  cold winter, so that I can enjoy vacation and  free time only after hard days work. Aside  from that, I believe that the Serbian financial  market will keep growing in the upcoming  period, which would open numerous possibilities and make the entire indus- try even more interesting.    For you, Hypo means... Lidija: Even in my student times, and I chose finance, banking and insurance  major, I wished I could work in Hypo bank, because it was different than all  the other banks present in the market at that time. I was lucky that at the time  when I finished my studies and started looking for a job, I saw a newspaper ad  for Trainee program in the Hypo bank. I did not send my resume to any other  ad until the final selection, thinking that this programme was made for me. I  never regretted rejecting some jobs in the meantime. Jasna: Security, trust, professionalism, team work. Nenad: My second home, second family. jasna popovi Senior officer for control,   compliance and data quality  24 Active partner â€“  secure foothold CoMMunity  Each country we operate in to us is not only one of the  economic markets, its a new home. It is Hypo Bank vision  to help others to achieve success and to share our success  with them. Every year we make numerous positive answers  to requests from people we live with in the same commu- nity, from culture and sports societies, from educational  institutions and other organizations. In the past year Hypo  bank set aside significant funds for numerous projects she  recognized as precious and useful for our community.  25 chet, and to engage unemployed women around the country  to produce these unique traditional products.  Childrens voiCes  Youngest members of our community have a special atten- tion of Hypo bank. One of the projects whose importance our  Bank recognized was the project of our music artist Aleksan- dra Kova, realization of a music album of the choir Belgrade  voice. Album consists of songs Aleksandra composed to lyrics  of anthology Serbian poets such as Jovan Jovanovi Zmaj and  Duko Radovi. We supported this project because of its idea to  offer good quality music to children and lyrics that would make  positive influence on their musical and general education.  Festival oF ChoreographiC  miniatures Festival organized for 14 years in arrow by the Association  of ballet dancers of Serbia, hosted many well-known and  respected artists from the country and abroad, also thanks to  support of the Hypo bank, which provided money rewards for  winners of the Festival.   Best tV series Hypo Bank continued supporting film and TV art in Serbia,  carefully choosing projects on the basis of their artistic values  and messages emitted to viewers. After huge success of the  series Stork will return, we  decided to help realization  of another local series, Her  mothers sin. This series  represents screening of the  novel written by Mir Jam,  adapted and directed by the  famous master of Serbian  cinematography, Zdravko  otra. Series was broadcast- ed in the channel one of RTS  from November 2009, with  exceptional ratings. We stimulate  preservation and  development of  cultural values As an international company respecting differ- ences, Hypo bank has always helped projects whose  goal was to preserve cultural inheritance of a commu- nity, promotion of new artistic trends, as well as support  to extraordinary talents. Projects Hypo bank supported last  year stand out as original, inspiring and useful achieve- ments in the field of culture in Serbia. 100 Women For Cultural  inheritanCe Promotion of women entrepreneurship and revitaliza- tion of cultural inheritance were the reason Hypo bank  joined the Assembly of the City of Belgrade, Secretar- iat for the economy and National agency for regional  development and aided the Ethno network to  realize its first exhibition called 100 women â€“ 100  miniatures. This exhibition was created by skilful  women from various parts of Serbia who represent- ed extraordinarily made handicrafts, reviving a part of tradition  of Serbian culture. The association Ethno network has existed  since 2005, gathering 1000 women, whose goal is to preserve  from such as embroidery, weaving, lacing, special techniques  of making textile out of wool, and special techniques of cro-  26 what does music mean to you? My best expression in music is in notes. It is much harder to find proper words  to express all the feelings music provokes in me. Still, my first association of mu- sic is escape into a perfect world, world with different rules, principles, colours...  I like fantasizing through music about another life which is sometimes so real  that it could be superior to the one I live. Music is like a universal language of  faith, love fear, honesty, the elusive and eternal. How did you feel when you were invited to go to one   of the most famous conservatories in the world?  Going to the Conservatory was a chance to expand my views and face my   own potential. I realized it is much easier to find ones own place than to take it.   And Moscow and professionalism nourished in the Russian capitol remind me  of that constantly. How close are you to realizing your dreams, at least professional ones? While I play, I always try to express what I feel and think happiness is in the  process of creation. Still, my goal is never to think that art is there to achieve any  goals. And if you ask me about my relationship with my own art, I would say  that I am not pleased with myself. I wasnt that yesterday, either. And I wont be  tomorrow either. what public appearance you remember as special? It is not always pleasant to appear before a large audience. I had a few appear- ances in the open, before an audience not musically educated and those seem  to be concerts to remember.  Do you plan a concert in Belgrade?  when was your last appearance in Serbia and where? I plan a few concerts during the summer season. Last year I appeared in the   Cello fest in Belgrade. We help young  talents to realize  their dreams MuSiC, lAnguAge oF FAith And love  Mina Zaki is one of exceptional individuals who enrolled the prestigious Moscow Conservatory thanks to her extraordinary talent. With  a wish to enable this young artist to educate, and to become one of the worthy modern music artists of Serbia, Hypo bank decided to  pay the Conservatory scholarship to Mina Zaki. Mina, currently in her second year of studies, thinks that work of crucial importance for  success in any art. Read what does music mean to Mina, about her studies and plans for the future.  27 Real friends are recognized by helping in hardest times, which  we can always confirm. We are always there for those who need  help and support the most, especially in crises.  AiD For tHE ASSoCiAtion oF   MuLtipLE SCLEroSiS pAtiEntS  We aided the association of multiple sclerosis patients,   which was unable to transport the commodity donation  from Swedish donors to Serbia. Hypo bank provided funds  for costs of transport of the donation to Serbia. AiD For trGoVitE Another natural disaster hit Serbia in May 2010. The river of  Pinja flooded out of its banks, which resulted in a large flood  That hit the municipality of Trgovite. Flood caused huge  damage to residential and commercial buildings, roads,  bridges and crops. Hypo bank donated two cargo trucks of  construction material necessary for reconstruction of a part  o damage. AiD For puBLiC kitCHEnS In 2010 we once again aided our poorest citizens, who live  in municipalities of Doljevac, Majdanpek, Vladiin Han and  Sjenica.  Local Red Cross offices in these municipalities were  donated four cars Jugo, which are now used for the needs  of public kitchens. In these municipalities 1300 people use  public kitchens, among them many old and disabled citizens. One of the hardest situations Serbia found itself in in 2010 was facing the damage caused by the earthquake that hit Kraljevo.  Aside from houses and other residential objects, huge damage was suffered by pubis institutions, so that in the first stage  of reconstruction the most needed aid was in form of construction material.  Hypo bank reacted immediately in this difficult  situation, helping citizens whose houses were damaged in the earthquake with a donation of construction material. Aside  from construction material, we also donated money to the neediest citizens of Kraljevo. We are there in   the hardest of times AiD For krALjEVo  28 equal opportuniti a computer for everyone Modern times cannot almost be imagined without a computer and  internet. Some of the people living among us need special training to be  able to use a computer. Academy Forum has been organizing programme  of education for work on the computer and the internet for blind and  low-vision people for years. This programme continued this year as well  thanks to support of the Peoples office of the President of the Republic  of Serbia and Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank a.d. Beograd. This sort of education  implies application of a special plan and programme, methodology and  use of special technical equipment and software which have to be used to  educate the blind and low-vision people to work on computers  29 s for all Many developed countries are also faced with a problem of  social inclusion. This situation demands that awareness of the  importance of inclusion is raised in all levels of society by pro- moting projects whose goal is to improve social and economic  conditions of marginalized groups. By supporting such activities  Hypo bank contributed to the process of progress of this segment  of the community. In 2010 we cooperated with the Peoples office  of the President of the Republic of Serbia in realization of three  important projects in this field. a home disabled adults  Thanks to our donation conditions of the residents of the  home for disabled adults in Doljevac have somewhat impro- ved. In the home some of its residents use work therapy in the  form of making wooden objects. Because of inexistence of  proper conditions the residents could not apply the therapy  adequately. After their request sent to the Peoples office of  the President of the Republic of Serbia and the Hypo bank  donation complete carpentry equipment and tools were bo- ught, fully equipping the carpenters workshop for the home  residents. rehabilitation Pupils and students of the primary and secondary school  Milan Petrovi from Novi Sad, and other disabled people as  well, will have an opportunity to use new equipment in the  physical rehabilitation block thanks to the donation of Hypo  bank and the Peoples office of the President of the Republic  of Serbia in the value of RSD 2.3 million.  Purpose of this rehabilitation block is to enable rehabilitati- on and adequate therapy to pupils and students and other  children and young people with disability.  Project of donation for rehabilitation equipment resulted  form joint efforts of Hypo bank and the Peoples office of the  President of the Republic of Serbia to increase availability of  primary and secondary school education to disabled persons  and to stimulate their inclusion into the society in a better  and more equal manner. Fund laza Kosti By buying tickets for the concert of the pianist Pierre Lane  we aided the Fund Laza Kosti, which used income from sold  tickets for the budget for awards to young people for literary  works and the primary school Milan Petrovi from Novi Sad.  30 Capacity to respect and feel empathy for people around us  is learned and nourished from the youngest age. For that  reason we think that we need to help whenever possible, ad  also give positive example to influence our youngest ones  to develop this capacity and apply it in interaction with  their community. KolevKa (the Crib) In 2010 Hypo bank decided to organize as a part of the  World Childrens Day an educational and precious action  for the children of our employees and for children with spe- cial needs from the home Kolevka (Crib) in Subotica. As a  part of the action Children to children kids of Hypo bank  employees visited their peers from  Kolevka with their  parents, giving them gifts they made themselves, and the  bank provided funds for buying diapers this home needs in  large quantities. The home for children with special needs  Kolevka is the home of 185 children of different ages at  this moment. Care and love form their environment is what  they need most, especially form their peers, which was  confirmed by the Home director Mirjana abri, express- ing her gratitude to Hypo bank for the wonderful initia- tive and valuable donation. Rade Vojinovi, member fot he  Executive Board of the Hypo bank, who visited the kids in  Kolevka, expressed his satisfaction with the fact that em- ployees of Hypo bank celebrated the World Childrens Day  in such way and that employees children enjoyed mak- ing presents for their friends, because they knew that they  were doing a nice and noble thing, and that children from  Kolevka would be happy because of them. Children  delight in  each other  31 For sWeet sChool days In 2010 we tried to bring joy to as many kids as we could.  Beginning of the school year is surely one of the most impor- tant events for all kids. We used 1st September as an oppor- tunity to bring joy to primary school kids from homes for chil- dren without parental care in Kruevac and Kragujevac, with  packages of school books and candies, with greeting cards  wishing them the best grades in their school booklets. hypo alpe adria brought joy   to Kids Form the home For  Children Without parental   Care drinKa pavlovi For New Years and Christmas holidays representatives of Hypo  Group visited the home for children without parental care  Drinka Pavlovi in Senjak, Belgrade, bringing joy to all kids with  holiday presents and good mood. With an intention to hep and  rejoice children spending their childhood in this home, Hypo  Group employees spent an afternoon making friends with kids  who enjoyed their new toys and other gifts, but also the the- atre play of the charity organization Mali Veliki ljudi (Little Big  People). New Year holidays are the time of joy, happiness and  giving , and Hypo Group employees wanted to bring happi- ness to kids from the home Drinka Pavlovi with their gifts,  and thus give their contribution to the institution with 125  years of tradition of taking care of children of all ages. hypo leasing For the third saFe  house in belgrade Hypo Leasing participated with a money donation in the RTS ac- tion to build the third Safe house in Belgrade, whose organization  was helped by the Peoples office of the President of the Republic  of Serbia. Problem of violence in the family was not spoken about a  lot, bringing the victims of abuse into a situation of not having an- yone to turn to for help. Now when this problem is receiving suffi- cient attention, enough Safe houses need to be built to provide ad- equate help for all victims.  For that reason Hypo Leasing joined the  action We are building a Safe house and donated money for fin- ishing the works as soon as possible, so that the third Safe house in  Belgrade can soon become a shelter for victims of family violence.  33 health is  priceless Because of dynamic pace of life forced upon us by the modern  time, we often forget our top priorities. Its usually only when we  face a health problem that we realize that health is our biggest  wealth, necessary for achieving goals we aspire to in our lives.  As a responsible member of the community, Hypo bank cares for  people whose health is in danger. Aside from donations to indi- viduals, who needed money aid for medical interventions, Hypo  bank participates with its employees in a string of activities for  improvement of health conditions in the community every year.  better health Conditions in   the Community One of the activities we do to improve health conditions in  the community, now a tradition, implies voluntary blood do- nations of our employees. Frequent appeals of responsible  units motivated us to face this constant problem by offer- ing help of our employees who regularly answer the actions  of the Institute for blood transfusion. One of our employ- ees is a sort of a record holder when it comes to this selfless  act.  Rade Vojinovi, member of the Executive Board of Hypo  bank has donated blood for as much as 25 times, thus sav- ing lives. By donating blood we help health institutions to al- ways have sufficient blood for the most urgent cases, because  when ones life is threatened, each second counts, pointed  out Rade Vojinovi.  From heart to heart Vanja Pilipovi, nineteen year old from Sonta near Sombor,  student of high school of economy, was facing a difficult situ- ation. Vanja was diagnosed with a serious heart disease at the  beginning of the year, because of which she needed a heart  HEALtH transplant in Vienna urgently, and she needed funds for that  operation. Hypo bank joined the charity action of collecting  funds for Vanjas operation, also participated by the Peoples  office of the President of the Republic of Serbia. Money need- ed for her operation was collected in a record time, in three  weeks, so that Vanja was placed on the transplant waiting list  and in May she had a successful operation. humanitarian ConCert oF  the braa baruh Choir Health of the youngest members of our community is of spe- cial significance for us as well. One of the actions designed to  hep the youngest, supported by Hypo bank, was the chari- ty concert of the Braa Baruh choir. Our bank donated funds  necessary for lease of the hall of Kolarev narodni universi- ty (Kolarac peoples university) in Belgrade, where the concert  was held. All funds collected by selling tickets for this concert  we directed to aid medical treatment of children â€“ cancer pa- tients, as well as to support the CSR project of the B92 fund  Food for everyone. hypo leasing donated Computers  to the CliniCal Centre oF serbia Hypo Leasing, as a socially responsible company, an absolute  leader in leasing business, donated computer equipment for  the entire IT system to the daily clinic of the Clinic for Vascular  surgery of the Clinical Centre of Serbia. Donation of computer  equipment is important for reception, triage, diagnostics and  post-op treatment of patients. Aside from that, it is also impor- tant for scientific work, because this clinic is a teaching base of  the Medical faculty in Belgrade.  34 growing  ecologically ECoLoGy  35 This age is facing huge ecological challenges, when green econ- omy has become a must for responsible individuals. We aspire  to making care of preservation and improvement of the envi- ronment an integral part of everyday life and work of our em- ployees. In all countries it operates in Hypo bank not only makes  no negative effect on the environment, but also supports vari- ous projects and organizes internal activities to contribute to im- proving quality of its environment.  eCologiCal  aWareness  oF employees  Our employees are trained to do their everyday tasks in an eco- logically efficient way. Electric energy is spent in all offices in a ra- tional way, and we use long life light bulbs to light our premises.  We print two-sided, and used paper is not thrown away, but col- lected and sent for recycling. Car park of Hypo bank is in accord- ance with EU ecological standards. reCyCling eleCtroniC Waste Only four days after opening of the e-waste recycling plant in  Nis, E-recycling, we became their first clients. First 1.5 t load of  electric and electronic waste such as monitors, servers, air condi- tioners, phones and other written-off fixed assets of Hypo bank  were recycled pursuant to all ecological standards. Our posi- tive example had effect to other companies. After only a month,  more than 30 IT companies made agreements with this recycling  plant for free transport of electronic waste, getting involved in  the action Write off waste.  Aside from personal effort not to influence the environment by  our work, and to contribute to its preservation, we gladly sup- port when other organizations initiate similar actions. GrEEn oASiS in City CEntrE Bulevar kralja Aleksandra (King Alexanders Boulevard) is the  longest street in Belgrade, with a London plane tree lane mak- ing it beautiful for decades, and being its integral part for many  citizens. After it was estimated that plane trees became dam- aging to the environment due to their age, due to which they  had to be removed, any citizens of Belgrade could not ac- cept the new look of the Bulevar. A few months later, after  the official decision of the City to grow a new tree lane, Hypo  bank joined the action for collecting funds to buy new young  London plane trees, a new string of jewels in the Bulevar kralja  Aleksandra since November.  36 education for   a better future Nowadays, when lifelong education and learning is promoted globally, in- vestment into education represents to us one of the most important forms  of donating. Time ahead will show that we have stepped into the age when  talent and knowledge will be highly valued in the market. Because of such  forecasts one needs to redefine strategies of the educational system and har- monize them with needs of the market. Hypo bank therefore supports ed- ucational projects stimulating creation of the community of educated and  talented human resources, pursuant to European values.  summer sChool oF eu integration Hypo bank has been supporting the ASSEi Alpbah summer  school of European integration for years, along with oth- er important institutions, such as Central European Initiative  (CEI), European Fund for Balkans and the Embassy of the  Republic of Austria in Serbia. This summer school, organized  since 2007, gathers students and post graduates from the  faculties around the SEE region, with the goal of deepening  knowledge of European integration, and achieving regional  dialogue and cooperation of the future experts in law, econo- my, and political sciences. Since Hypo Group Alpe Adria op- erates in the entire region, we support with great interest im- provement of cooperation and understanding of countries,  necessary for common progress. Aside from providing finan- cial aid necessary for organization of this school, Hypo bank  also participates in the programme of the school, f irst of all in  professional panel discussions.   EDuCAtion  37 the EU countries. Hypo bank provided pocket money and a  part of accommodation costs in Vienna for 40 children with- out parental care and 10 of their custodians. In the media event  before the trip, in the presence of the Vice President of the  Government of the Republic of Serbia Mr. Boidar eli, adult  custodians were given cards with pocket money for children. neW booKs For the university   library in ni In 2010 we also helped students of the University in Ni. For the  occasion of five years of operation of the Hypo bank branch in  Ni we donated funds for buying new books for the University  library in Ni. Around 300 different professional books enriched  the corpus of the University library. New books brought t joy to  students, first of all, but to other citizens as well, who love sci- ence and art. laptop For the best student  This was not the only jubilee we celebrated in Ni.  The  Engineering faculty of the Ni University celebrated the 50th  anniversary of its work on February 2, 2010. For that occasion  Hypo bank awarded the best student of the Engineering facul- ty with a laptop PC. 100 oF the best travelling   to europe Lets travel to Europe is a project of the European move- ment in Serbia, which awards 100 of the best students of local  universities with a possibility to get to know countries of the  EU and acquire intercultural experience. The project is motivat- ed by evident inexperience of the young generation in Serbia  with regards to knowing Europe first hand. Many young peo- ple now studying in universities in Serbia who should be carri- ers of development of this country in the upcoming years and  decades, did not have a chance due to social circumstances to  travel abroad in the past years, and thus exchange experience  with their peers in different cultural atmosphere, which makes  an important contribution to raising awareness of young peo- ple. The project is realized in cooperation with the Embassy of  the Republic of Austria in Serbia and the Assembly of the City  of Belgrade, and in 2008 Hypo bank joined the project as well.  Our bank has supported this project traditionally, by giving gift  cards of the Hypo bank with pocket money to one hundred of  the best students taking part in the project. Until now we have  awarded 300 Serbian students to whom this was their first en- try into the EU. Europe for everyone is another project organized togeth- er with the European movement in Serbia and cabinet of the  Vice President of the Government of the Republic of Serbia in  charge of Euro-integration, supported by Hypo bank as well.  Purpose of this project is to give a chance to as many children  from the endangered social groups as possible to visit one of   38 support for supreme  sports achievements Since its beginnings in Serbia, Hypo bank has been investing in  sport and young sport talents. Significance of sport for welfare of  the community is multiple, especially for a community rarely  celebrating large sport success, and where such success is cause  for rejoicing and pride of the entire nation.
