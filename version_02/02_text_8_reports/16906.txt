This is the model of a  company driven by the desire to give meaning to its actions, to take into account the  interests of its customers, employees and the communities in which it operates.       In a time of great economic uncertainty, our increasing sales are a sign of the strong relationships— founded on trust, quality and pleasure—that our brands have forged with their consumers. The Bel  Group has undeniable assets for continued growth: the specific nature and strength of our brands and  our proximity to our markets are the results of our strategy to internationalize and our Corporate Social  Responsibility policy, which guides our actions and ensures our constant growth.    Our CSR policy, a commitment that unites  Our mission—to bring smiles to all families through the pleasure provided by our products made with  dairy goodness—and our values enrich our Corporate Social Responsibility policy. This policy is at the  heart of our development strategy and influences all our operations. It is built upon our willingness to  listen and engage in dialogue with our stakeholders. We would like to convert this dynamic process into  a unifying force that will carry over to our employees, customers, partners and suppliers.    Our employees are the primary actors behind our program. Trained to face our sustainable  development challenges, our employees make sure that corporate, social and environmental  considerations are incorporated into their decision-making processes in order to strike a fair balance  between economic development, the respect for human rights and the environment. This is a continuous  improvement plan, a long-term dynamic process designed to bring change to the company.    It is only through the involvement and commitment of each one of us that our sustainable growth strategy  will enable us to fulfill our mission and spread even more smiles throughout the world.

It will be gradually rolled out from 2012. It allows all employees to know  about the values and principles to be respected in the framework of their professional activities. The Code of Best Practices is structured around 7 key principles  that the Group wants to apply in all actions implemented with its stakeholders:  - Respect laws and regulations; take into account international standards  - Protect consumers  - Respect the environment  - Protect the basic rights of employees  - Prevent conflicts of interest, fraud and corruption  - Promote fair business relationships  - Ensure the accuracy and confidentiality of professional information  These principles are in line with the10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact.    The Code of Best Business Practices will be gradually rolled out to all employees through a dedicated training module. Moreover, according to the priorities of each  geographical area, thematic training modules will be implemented including a specific one about anti-corruption.    The implementation of the Code will be completed by several measures:  - The distribution of an internal training document providing some context and examples of each of the Codes principles, in order to facilitate its sharing within Bel  subsidiaries employees and newcomers;  - The implementation of a warning process so that employees can report behaviors that may conflict with the Code;  - The creation of an Ethics Committee chaired by a Group Director will be in charge of verifying the effective sharing of the Code within the Group and receiving any  report of behavior that may conflict with the Code, in particular those related to the fight against corruption.
