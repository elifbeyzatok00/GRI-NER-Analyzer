In 2010  it strengthened competences in various themes of  sustainability by training 60 Organization employ- ees. In addition, it determined that the sustainabil- ity report should undergo a quality assurance pro- cess carried out by an external entity, to verify the  reliability of the furnished data, the relevant impor- tance of the material matters and their traceability. The section Growing Generation of Value pres- ents a consolidated financial synthesis of Grupo  Nacional de Chocolates, with all of the companies  that are part of this business group taken into ac- count in the scope. It also includes the Group inter- nationalization strategy for emerging markets and  its IMAGIX innovation model. In the section Our Planet, the environmental  data applies to all of the companies with production  plants in Colombia, except for Setas Colombianas  S.A., the Meals S.A.S. plant in Armenia, and Lito- empaques S.A.S. in Medelln. Those companies have  particular features different from the basic business- es; they are in a measuring scheme homologation  process so that they can be added into future reports.

The themes for this report were chosen after  analyzing their relative importance to measure- ment assessment, monitoring, surveys, and other  forms of contact with the Stakeholders. The in- formation is furnished taking GRI indicators into  consideration, which can be evidenced in a con- solidated summarized manner in the GRI Contents  Index at the end of this report. The Group has identified the following opportu- nities for improving its total sustainability concept:  strengthen a culture of greater sensitivity in eco- efficiency processes, provide human rights train- ing cycles for our workforce, deepen liaisons for  rapprochement with interest groups, and advance  in innovation and research and development pro- grams, using the Vidarium center and the compa- nies themselves, to generate a greater impact on nu- trition, health, and wellbeing. Furthermore, the Group sees opportunities for  reinforcing the concept in operations outside of Co- lombia, especially regarding community manage- ment and environmental eco-efficiency. During fiscal year 2010 there were no events of  relevant importance that would imply non-compli- ance with the Group goals.  Some 2009 values were restated, to be able to  compare to 2010 values.

President Grupo Nacional de Chocolates Carlos Enrique Piedrahta Arocha President  Grupo Nacional de Chocolates S.A. makes ongoing  efforts to achieve good corporate governance  practices leading to performing actions to  consolidate itself as a transparent and responsible  organization, obtaining the various stakeholders  trust and credibility. These practices include instruments such as the  Code of Good Governance, the Code of Ethics, the  Assets Laundering Prevention Manual, Internal  Control Systems, the Ethics Line, and the Board of  Directors Support Committees. The main purpose of the Code of Good Gov- ernance is generating trust among shareholders,  clients, suppliers, and employees of the Nacional  de Chocolates Group companies. It sets the rules  of conduct as a guideline for daily activities of the  Groups national and international companies part  of the Group and clearly defines the commitment  to follow ethical principles in dealing with before  the State, the community, the shareholders, and   the investors. The companies internal control systems have  the necessary mechanisms to protect their resourc- es against losses resulting from inefficiencies or  fraud and to promote order and effectiveness while  performing their activities, also ensuring the ac- curacy and reliability of information required to  manage and control it. There are specialized au- diting and control services through which com- COrPOrATE   GOVErNANCE pliance with goals and objectives is followed up,  considering the group businesses strategy. There  are also accountability systems and a risk scenario,  budgeting and cost tools, an accounts plan, and  normalized procedures and forms to document the  main activities, mainly supported by an integrated  information system. Financial statements and other reports are  published periodically and according to the  laws and instructions from the Colombian Fi- nancial  Superintendence,  including  material  findings resulting from internal control activi- ties, this way the shareholders and the inves- tors having available effective tools with which  to  follow-up  the  companies  management   and control.

The Ethics Line is a supplementary mechanism  that allows timely reporting of circumstances  infringing the law or the Code of Good Governance.  It is a confidential tool available to employees,  shareholders, clients, suppliers, and third parties  in general, allowing to report irregular situations  affecting the Organization interests. Information campaigns are carried out in order  to make this good governance practice known to all  companies and promote its use among the workforce;  Our Cold Cuts Business Team in the North region  192 Sustainability Report 2010 this includes communications through primary  groups and the media (intranet, bulletin boards,  and internal bulletins). Information to third parties  is provided by means of external communications  and press releases . 61 reports were received through the Ethics Line  during 2010, which were responded by the Organi- zations control body and handled by responsible  areas in each company. In addition, situations re- ported and their results were disclosed to the Grupo  Nacional de Chocolates S.A. Auditing Committee. The Grupo Nacional de Chocolates S.A.

ANTICORRUPTION MANAGEMENT Aware of the role it has in the prevention, control,  and surveillance process oriented to preventing   illegal capital flows, and in order to ensure that  during its operations or during the negotiation of  its securities in the stock exchange or outside the   company will not be used as a means to hide, handle,  invest, or use in any manner money or other goods  originating from illegal activities, Grupo Nacional  de Chocolates S.A. has adopted and maintains the  Assets Laundering Prevention Manual, according to  the law.

The brands portfolio,  with a variety of prices and solutions with respect  to quality and nutrition, has allowed it to - during  90 years of being close to the consumer - become a  brand leader in the Colombian market.  A strategy was defined for the regional expan- sion process, addressed to territories where we have  competitive advantages, in these emerging markets  Mexico and Peru play an important role. At the  same time, this strategy has also been used in Cen- tral America, the Caribbean, and Ecuador, and in the  United States for Hispanic consumers. Penetration  strategies are available in each case, based on oppor- tunities identified for each target market, developing  distribution networks and commercial allies that al- low us to reach the respective consumers. Each company adjusts its value proposition to  local consumers, considering a preferably differen- tiated product portfolio according to quality, nu- trition, currency, and buying power requirements,  taking into account recognition given to brands  used. In the Peru, Mexico, and Central America  cases, market penetration is strengthened through  the acquisition of local companies with brands  known to consumers and distribution networks al- lowing the delivery to the various channels.

Since I have been with the Company, there have been discussions re- garding the environment. I now see that we are quite involved in the  issue since we participate directly in activities being carried out. We  now have a matrix in small teams, divided into pillars, each of them  with one person in charge. I am the one responsible for watching  over compliance with the inter-personal relationship pillar with our  superiors. My role is keeping a log of daily events in order to identify  opportunities for improvement. A meeting is held at the end of each  month with the small teams and the heads of department, in order to  determine steps to be followed.

Four sensitizing and training sessions in hu- man rights were carried out in order to be coherent  with these principles and also obtain commitment  from our leaders and workforce, which were at- tended by the Corporate Committee, the Compa- nies Executive Committees, the Human Manage- ment Synergy Roundtable, and work teams whose  roles have direct implications on compliance with  agreements. In the labour area, our Group has always had -  and will continue having - respect for the workers  free association and their right to collective bar- gaining. It has always been our philosophy to gen- erate participation and listening spaces and resolve  differences. This philosophy reflects in the existence  of 16 labor unions in 12 of the Group companies,  and in 13 collective workers labor agreements. There were no work harassment cases in 2010, nor  any circumstances affecting our workers integrity. Joint participation mechanisms have been  created with various labor unions and leaders of  collective workers labor agreements, creating al- liances in order to manage accidents, professional  illnesses, and other issues that could affect the  quality of life of our people. Of my dads company, I like everything they do. When we  go to Halloween and in Christmas to parties, when we make  biscuits and participate in recreation events we go to farms  and do extreme stuff.

Our VALuE CHAiN TOGETHEr  WiTH SuPPLiErS AND CLiENTS SUPPORT TO FARMERS Activities promoting the cocoa sector From its Cocoa Promotion area, with a more than  50-year history Compaa Nacional de Chocolates  aids the cocoa farmer in order to strengthen the  cocoa-chocolate chain, with a long-term vision on  technology transfer and production sustainability.  This work is done in alliance with the Colombian  government and other entities. Research is a significant element of the promo- tion area, from which valuable technical knowledge  results regarding seeds, plants, pest control, develop- ment of productive techniques for better use of the  land, and obtaining of quality crops. All this knowl- edge is transferred to the peasants through techni- cal assistance programs, demonstration farms, and  support to crops. In 2010, the company contributed with COP $631  million, reaching 27 municipalities in the country,  4000 families having access to this revenue-produc- ing activity in close to 10,000 cultivated hectares. Cocoa for the Future Private Capital Fund Compaa Nacional de Chocolates and the stock- brokers firm  Bolsa y Renta presented an innovative  and socially sustainable financial model structur- ing the private capital fund Cocoa for the Future,  which allows channeling private investments to the  Colombian cocoa growers, having achieved positive  environmental and social results. More than 250  peasant families will benefit directly and 1,250 jobs  will be generated in the first year, 625 in the fol- lowing years. The project involves financing of approximately  2,500 ha, initially in four municipalities in Antio- quia, benefiting small and midsized farmers associ- ated to the Ecocacao Cooperative. Peasant families  will benefit from the knowledge transfer and from  a stable activity, also having a medium-term source  of revenues since the Fund will deliver crops for  their personal benefit once investors have recovered  their investment and received the agreed revenues. mar Jos Chadid Gonzlez, Ecocacao Ltda Manager  Ecocacao is a cooperative working for peace in the Mag- dalena Medio region. We make sure that the families, based  on their cocoa crops, will be able to improve their quality  of life, will be able to come together as family units, and  will improve themselves through community work that will  allow them to fill coexistence opportunities for a free social  human development. Compaa Nacional de Chocolates has  been working with us for more than 8 years, initially in the  cocoa promotion technological strategy in the Magdalena  Medio region, after which we were able to strengthen our  ties in the commercial area until achieving an integral alli- ance that provides technical assistance to producers in order  to improve their crops.   225 toWardS a better  SoCiety Chocolate Santander with the peasants A total of 750 families from the Colombian North- east cultivate cocoa used to make premium qual- ity Chocolate Santander.

This is a valuable source of information re- garding expectations, management, and of how the  service is being perceived, allowing for its improve- ment. 11,393 clients in Colombia were surveyed in  2010, the result being a 4.49 perceptual satisfac- tion index and a 4.43 derived satisfaction index  over 5.00, a satisfactory result considering that 2010  was quite difficult from the market point of view,  thus positioning us well above the rest of the evalu- ated competitors. Additionally, the study showed that  64% of our clients would recommend us and would  select us again as their supplier, percentage that is in  the upper range with respect to the market. Opportu- nities for improvement identified were promotional  activities and channel promotion, as well as timely  information regarding depleted products. Abroad, the 2010 satisfaction measurement was  applied to 145 direct clients in 52 countries. As a  result of this, a 4.21 derived satisfaction index was  obtained and a 4.46 perceptual satisfaction index.  We must highlight an improvement in the North  American and Caribbean regions performance with  respect to the previous year.

Bag filter -  Chocolate Factory, rionegro.  The efficient use of energy is a specific practice adopted in all the GNCH  industrial plants. Energy Management – Meals de Colombia, Bogot. RAW MATERIALS  494.124,6 tons of basic raw materials were used,  494,124.6 tons of basic raw materials were used,  between green coffee, wheat, flour, meat raw mate- rials, milk, and cocoa.  PACKAGING MATERIALS  2,047 tons of packaging raw materials were used  for the companies. 54.4% were corrugated carton,  26.8 flexible material, 14.3% foldable printed car- ton boxes, and 4.5% labels. 92% of all corrugated  material is manufactured with recycled fibers. ELECTRICAL POWER CONSUMPTION The companies have developed programs to op- timize energy consumption and use it more effi- ciently. The power consumption metric (kWh/t.p.)  showed a 0.7% reduction with respect to the previ- ous year. There was an accumulated 3.6% reduction  during 2007-2010. Energy sources used in industrial plants come  from a high percentage of clean sources, such as natu- ral gas and electrical power, representing 86.7%, with  a growing tendency. Plant initiatives using byproducts from industrial  process have allowed for alternate energy sources as  follows: in the pasta business close to 8 MW of energy  are generated, resulting from gas motor cogeneration;  in the coffee business the use of coffee grounds as fuel  generates the equivalent to 63 MW/year. Initiatives are available through the Innovative  Success Stories program, looking to impact the com- panies productive process, the environmental criteria  having to be evaluated. Small accumulated initiatives  result in significant benefits. An example of this pro- gram is the cold cuts business, implementing changes  in the refrigeration system water-cooled condensers,  significantly reducing power consumption. Special at- tention is given to quantitative measurements in terms  of the environmental impact of implemented practices.  236 Sustainability Report 2010 WATER CONSUMPTION  Programs established to promote efficient use and  savings in water consumption, changes in wash- ing processes, improvements in cooling systems,  and installation of water-saving devices resulted in  a 9.3% reduction, mainly on account of changes  made to the Cold cuts, Chocolate, and Ice Cream fa- cilities. The accumulated 2007-2010 reduction was  11.6%. Examples of initiatives of our employees through  the Innovative Success Stories program enable us  to plan the more efficient use of the water: an opti- mization process was implemented in the sprinkler  system in a smokehouse of the cold cuts business,  significantly reducing water consumption; a central  washing area was installed in the Ice Cream business,  reducing the use of cleaning solutions and flushing  times. Both of these initiatives result  in significant  savings. We are committed to the efficient and rational  use of the water. Even if there are adequate supply  sources from public utility companies, and in some  cases from sources allowed by the environmental   authorities, we believe that supply conditions enable  us to plan operations without any supply risk,, in- volving sustainable extraction of the water resource.  We also take into account Colombian conditions,  making water resources available in areas where our  plants are located. In other countries, plants have  industrial processes with low water requirements,  avoiding supply risks.  WASTE GENERATION  There was a 1.7% reduction in the volume of waste.  Integral waste management programs are being im- plemented in production plants, resulting in a 1.7%  increase in recycled waste. As shown below, 59.2% of all waste is recyclable  organic material from plant processes, 27.8% being  other commercially recyclable waste. From waste gen- erated, 0.4% is hazardous, which is disposed according  to strict control policies. Hazardous waste 0,4% General  and/or  ordinary waste 12,6% Organic  waste  from processes,  usable/tradable 59,2% WASTE CLASSIFICATION Packing  and packaging waste  (recyclable, tradable) 27,8% Our programs of rational use of water aim to optimize  the use of resources in productive and service   processes. Noel Plant.  237 our planet EFFLUENTS The Group companies keep on improving waste- water discharge control processes. The start-up of  biological treatment processes using wetlands at  Chocolates plant in Rionegro are currently running  successfully and; organic waste discharged to water  bodies has significantly been reduced, meeting even  international parameters. At a consolidated level,  the group reported a 40% reduction in organic mat- ter compared to that of 2009. CLIMATE CHANGE We are committed to giving special importance to the  climate change strategy, considering the significant  effect it has on human habitats and on crops. In  order to prepare the respective strategy, in 2010 we  developed a Greenhouse Gases Inventory. This first  stage includes industrial operations in Colombia.  The project was designed with the assistance of the  LOGyCA Foundation and with MIT CTL (MIT Center  for Transportation and Logistics). In the medium-term, we expect to be a Carbon Neu- tral Group, and therefore we are currently evaluating a  number of strategies in order to reduce, control, mitigate,  and offset greenhouse gases produced by each company.  This program, which is focused on the standardizing  stage, will be implemented in the first semester 2011. A visit was made to Colcafe plant in Bogota  because of the Fifth International Corporate  Eco-efficiency and Competitiveness Congress  organized by ANDI, during which Grupo Na- cional de Chocolates the corporate environ- mental policy was presented and a description  of some eco-efficient practices implemented  in the Coffee Business processes were shown,  such as the use of spent ground coffee as bio- fuel, the use of solar energy for water heating,  and the installation of gases afterburners.  The visit included representatives from the  Dutch Embassy in Colombia, the Dutch Energy  Investigation Center, Gail Martina Sustainable  Partners, Biddle Climate Solutions, among  others. Visitors comments were quite positive,  highlighting the Colcafe commitment to  reducing energy consumption, its atmospheric  emissions control program, and the environ- mental performance improvement, bringing  benefits to the community. EMISSIONS CONTROL In order to adjust their processes to Colombian  standards (Resolution 909), effective as of 2010, all  companies have invested in environmental control  systems, in various industrial plants. These regu- lations set forth limits for particulate matter and  gases emissions to the atmosphere, meeting the re- quired standards. As an example of our environmental management  high commitment, it is important to mention Colcafe  plant in Medellin, which meets atmospheric emissions  limits of 85% average below atmospheric emission  standards established for stationary sources – particu- late matter and gases through the installation of sev- eral control system equipment such as cyclones, bag  filters, and afterburners. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION   EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS  COP $9,049 million were invested in Integrated En- vironmental Management, in various productive  processes, mainly in the reduction of atmospheric  emissions and in wastewater  control. The value for  the last four years is COP $36,533 million. Investments were made in environmental con-  trol systems in various industrial plants, adjusting  their  processes to standards according to Colombian    238 Sustainability Report 2010 regulations - Resolution 909 effective as of 2010.  This regulation sets forth allowable emission limits  in compliance with the required standards. ACADEMIC, LABOR UNION, AND STATE RELATIONSHIPS  We highlight academic relationships with differ- ent universities and training institutions, offering  more than 50 conferences given by our executives  both in Colombia and abroad, gathering about 4,500  attendees in various sustainability and strategy is- sues such as innovation, sustainable development,   research, and quality in the food sector. Company representatives continue to actively  participate in the ANDI National and Region- al Environmental Committee, with the Valle de  Aburra Metropolitan Area, Cornare, the Bogota  Environmental District Secretary, and the Minis- try of Environment. ENVIRONMENTAL INCIDENTS   AND COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS There were no events that should be mentioned re- garding incidents causing damages to the environ- ment during 2010, nor any remark from the environ- mental authorities on noncompliance with regulations  in countries where we are present. Regarding regulatory compliance, the wastewa- ter cleaning project was implemented during 2010 in  the Chocolates plant in Peru. The designs are ready  and the equipment has been purchased, however the  construction permits are still waiting for approval. A  number of ongoing operational control measures are  being implemented, such as the reduction of wastewa- ter flow and collection and treatment of used water, in  addition to continuous monitoring and analysis of the  wastewater quality. The environmental man- agement system is part  of the integral policy. The  employees in the various  companies incorporate it  into their daily work.

General Summary  of Environmental Indicators. In all of GNCs manufacturing operations, the companies  meet legal contaminant atmospheric emission standards.  The inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GGE)  was started but it is not included in this report. Direct  emissions due to combustion and energy consumption  (scopes 1 and 2) are partially reported in this report.  The GGE report has been conducted with Fundacin  LOGyCA and with MIT CTL, using the methodology  proposed in the GHG Protocol. The preliminary report shows that 79% of the emissions  correspond to the use of direct energy (scope 1) and 21%  to indirect energy consumption (scope 2).  Principle 8 EN17 Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions,  by weight In all of GNCs manufacturing operations, the companies  meet legal contaminant atmospheric emission standards.  The inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GGE) is  being made. It is partially reported in this report (scopes  1 and 2).  The final report will include emissions associated with  the use of cooling gases (2012). Principle 8 EN18 Initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions and reductions achieved GNC is developing a project to face Climate Change.  It consists of quantifying the GGE emission inventory  and preparing the Carbon Fingerprint at corporate and  product levels. Several initiatives have been developed, such as the use of  Biomass, Co-generation. The inventory will be the basis for  designing the offset and mitigation plan in 2012. Principles 7, 8 and 9 EN19 Emissions of ozone-depleting substances,  by weight This indicator solely includes GGE emissions for scopes  1 and 2 (combustion processes and use of electrical  energy).  We are carrying out a Greenhouse Gas emission  inventory Project with Fundacin LogyCa and MIT CTL,  which is in its final stage of execution. That will be  reported by 2012.  Principle 8 EN20 NOx,  SOX and other significant air  emissions, by type and weight We are carrying out a Greenhouse Gas emission  inventory Project with Fundacin LogyCa and MIT CTL,  which is in its final stage of execution. That will be  reported by 2012.

In 2011 a log and a detailed report of such  initiatives will be kept and we are planning to develop  the Carbon Fingerprint for the products. That will be  reported in 2012. Principles 7, 8 and 9 EN27 Percentage of products sold and their  packaging materials that are reclaimed, by  category Returns of finished products close to ending their useful  life cycle or those with some non-conformity represented  0,65% of sales in Colombia in 2010 (packaging materials are  not measured separately). Each of the distribution centers  has zones for receiving the goods and quantifying returns.  The main indicator is calculated by consolidating the  measures from each one of those centers. The Colombian information is reported, except for La  Recetta and the companies acquired at the end of 2010. The companies abroad will be included after their SAP  information systems are implemented.
