Aware of the importance of its legacy,  the company has been working  to generate prosperity with social  responsibility and respect for the  environment. Commitments made to  its stakeholders direct the companys  action to establish best practices,  whether in terms of environmental  management, facing the challenges  of climate change, or valuing people  and communities. In 2011, Vale achieved record output  of iron ore, pellets and coal, while its  nickel and copper production levels  were the highest since 2008. The  companys investments, excluding  acquisitions, amounted to US$18 billion,  42% up on 2010. These indicators  demonstrate the companys enormous  potential in terms of generating value  for its stakeholders. Vales social and environmental  spending in 2011 came to US$1.5  billion, 36% up on 2010.

For the sixth consecutive year,  Vale obtained certif cation for its  internal controls provided for by the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in accordance with  requirements for public companies  with American Depositary Receipts  (ADRs) listed on the New York Stock  Exchange. Furthermore, for the  second year in a row, it was selected  as a member of the So Paulo Stock  Exchange (BM&FBovespa)s Corporate  Sustainability Index (known by  Portuguese acronym ISE).  Over the course of this report, which  demonstrates alignment with the  Principles for Responsible Investment  (PRI), Vale reveals not only the results  of its sustainability indicators in 2011,  but also the challenges, positionings  and commitments assumed by the  company in the light of topics of  relevance to it and its stakeholders.  As members of Vales Board of  Directors and on behalf of its  shareholders, I reiterate my satisfaction  with this process evolution. I would  like to thank the Executive Board and  all of Vales employees and partners  for the results achieved in 2011. I am  fully convinced that the companys  path and the path of sustainable  development will grow ever stronger  if planned jointly. I hope you enjoy  reading the report. 7 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  4  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report Message from the CEO Our goal is to develop our businesses  on solid foundations, based on  respectful relations with people  and the planet, and sharing  value with society At the start of this 2011  Sustainability Report, I would  like to address myself to all  readers who are interested  in understanding how Vale is  preparing for a new economy,  to leave a better world for  future generations.  When I took over as Chief Executive Of  cer  of Vale, I made a commitment to this  challenge, in line with my closely held  values: concern for life and the planet. The path I intend to follow together  with everyone who has a relationship  with Vale is challenging by definition,  but imbued with respect and  confidence in our capacity to  promote sustainable development,  prioritizing the value of life and  human rights.  I see that we now have the challenge  and opportunity to change health and  safety-related statistics in mining. We  will insist on our target of zero harm,  as it is the only acceptable target. It  is now our number one priority. We  cannot say we are a truly successful  company if we do not demonstrate  the same excellence in our health and  safety results that we have already  demonstrated in our business results.  I do not want there to be any doubt  that, at this company, life is more  important than production. If we have  to choose, we must choose life.   Vale strives to deliver its products  and services with quality and  ef  ciency. Without a shadow of  a doubt, we can be proud of our  business results in 2011. For example,  our operating revenue was 30% up  on the previous year. We are also  advancing in the implementation of  a structured sustainability agenda.  In 2011, our Action Plan on  Sustainability reached all company  operations, establishing targets for  fundamental indicators such as water  and energy consumption. Looking to the future, we revised our  Mission, Vision and Values, embarking on a  new journey that will reach its destination  when everything expressed there is  ref ected in all our behavior, with the aim of  everyone working together continuously  for a Vale that is ever more robust and  aware of the new world in which it  operates. In recent years, we have grown  a lot. We are now present in 38 locations,  whose cultures will guide our way. I do not want there to be any doubt that, at this company, life is more important than production. If we have to choose, we must choose life  Also in 2011, we joined the select  group of companies in the United  Nations Global Compact LEAD  platform, an initiative that aims to  spread sustainable practices initiated  by leading companies. Through our  involvement, we seek to mobilize the  value chain to adopt measures based  on complete respect for human rights,  rigorous combating of poverty, and  transparent management, among other  things. Vale encourages its partners  to engage with the Global Compact  and to respect its principles, as we  understand our role in the sustainable  development of our value chain. When conducting our activities, we  know that we af ect and transform  the regions where we operate, both  positively and negatively. Over the  course of this report, I made a point  that we should be very clear about  these impacts, as well as the challenges  that Vale faces. For us to grow on solid  foundations, we know that our relations  need to be underpinned by dialogue.  This is essential to the process of  strengthening societys trust in us and  our license to operate. Accordingly, this document sets out our  positions and commitments on subjects  of global interest, such as combating  climate change, diversifying our energy  matrix and preserving biodiversity. Our goal is to develop our businesses  on solid foundations, based on  respectful relations with people and the  planet, and sharing value with society.  I hope you all enjoy reading this report,  and I reiterate our interest in promoting  constructive discussion about the  topics covered in it.

This  edition refers to 2011 and, when  applicable, covers developments over  the period from 2009 to 2011. The report also follows the guidelines of  the International Council on Mining and  Metals (ICMM) and the United Nations  Global Compact, two international  initiatives to which Vale is a signatory. The  report serves as Vales Communication  on Progress (COP) for the Global  Compact. The correlation index (which  can be found online) allows readers to  f nd information on how the company  meets these commitments. The 2011 report has achieved GRI  application level A+, which covers all GRI  prof le items, management approach  information, essential performance  indicators and indicators from the  Mining and Metals Sector Supplement, in  accordance with the GRIs approach to the  materiality principle. This version is designed to illustrate the  companys positioning and its results  with regard to the demands of its main  stakeholders, as highlighted in the topics  def ned by the Materiality Matrix. In the  online version, complementary content  can be found, indicated throughout the  report by the symbol.   The organization of this report by  chapter enables readers to assess Vales  positioning and results in the company  Visions three main areas: People,  Planet and Creating value. Before  these three sections, there is a chapter  explaining the companys strategic  vision, based on its new Mission,  Vision and Values and its Sustainable  Development Policy. The methodology used to def ne  boundaries was the same as that used  in sustainability reports of previous years  (available in the online content). Information on companies acquired  in recent years, such as assets in  the fertilizer area, and new projects  that have started operating, has  been integrated into the reported  performance 1 indicators, in line with the  incremental approach adopted. External assurance  The information in the 2011  Sustainability Report was verif ed by the  independent audit f rm KPMG, as shown  in the declaration available in the online  version of this report. The assurance  scope included compliance with the GRI  methodology, assurance of information  on prof le items, management approach  and performance, and the application  level statement. In addition, KPMG  checked Vales adherence to the  ICMM principles, as indicated in the  declaration available in the online  version of this report. In total, Vale has reported 88 indicators,  of which 49 are core, 28 additional and  11 are from the Mining and Metals Sector  Supplement. Some of these indicators  were included in the print version.  Complementary content is available in the  online version on the Vale website. In terms of management approach, Vale is  globalizing its procedures and documents  in order to reconcile local culture and  the dynamics of each business, which  demands time and capacity building from  the teams involved.  Materiality In 2011/2012 Vale undertook a robust  process of validating its Materiality  Matrix. This consisted of identifying  those aspects of sustainability where  the company has the most signif cant  economic, social and environmental  impacts, and those with the greatest  inf uence on the decisions of its  stakeholders in various countries. These  were considered to be material topics.  With the support of the Brazilian  Foundation for Sustainable Development  (FBDS, in Portuguese), Vale mapped  those issues which are of the greatest  relevance to the companys senior  management and external stakeholders,  who were represented by specialists  in key topics: climate change, forests,  communities, human resources,  education and others.

I am sure that the company  faces complex educational  problems, as it is a very modern  company which requires a  qualified workforce. There is no way that Vale can  resolve the issue of education  by itself. The company needs to  look for better ways of interacting  with public authorities in the  educational sector. If Vale wants  to be a lever for sustainable  development, it has to continue  to be a lever for education  wherever it operates. Rosiska Darcy  de Oliveira Writer and journalist. Chairwoman of  the Rio Como Vamos movement Vale needs to work on the idea of  building together. It has to establish  formal mechanisms for an intra-company  dialogue and for a dialogue between the  company and its many stakeholders. Tasso Azevedo Forestry engineer.  Sustainability consultant Vale has a track record in climate change  and energy because of its participation  in the Letter on Climate Change. But  it needs to internalize the issue as an  element of competitiveness and assume  a public commitment and targets for  reducing its GHG emissions. Vale needs to assume its  role as a major player and  be committed to supporting  best practices to ensure that  Belo Monte is a sustainable  project. What today is a cost  can become, with excellent  management, a positive return. Srgio  Besserman Economist and ecologist.  Professor of the Economics  Department of PUC-RJ Vale can have an impact on the energy  supply system in Brazil, establishing  partnerships to promote a greater role  for renewables. If climate change is the hot topic  of today, tomorrow it will be  biodiversity. This means that Vale  has to position itself for this issue,  def ne a strategy and strive to leave a  positive net impact. Marina Grossi Economist. Chairwoman of the  Brazilian Business Council for  Sustainable Development (CEBDS) Water will soon come to be seen  as a limited resource, and this  will be exacerbated by climate  change. This is an issue that has  to remain a priority for Vale. Materiality A group of experts contributed  the views of stakeholders about  material topics for Vale  Vale needs to create close  links and enhance its relations  with these communities. Celso Castilho consultant to Vale who worked at  the company for 28 years The energy topic is closely linked  to climate change. Vale needs  to def ne its choices: how will it  position itself in relation to cleaner  energies? What is it doing to make  energy use more ef  cient? It is essential for Vale to have a social  license to operate. To achieve this, the  company needs to have a long term  commitment to the development of local  communities, guaranteeing investment  in education and encouraging  sustainable productive activities. Beto Verssimo Agronomist. Senior Researcher  of the Amazon Institute of People  and the Environment (Imazon) The educational def cit is an issue that  goes beyond Vale. It is not enough  for employees to have access to  education, if there is not this possibility  in their communities. Education is  also an issue for communities.

The company also decided  to review its strategic orientation and  def ne a new position, ref ected in its  Mission, Vision and Values, which aim to  align Vale with the sustainable development  agenda. This process was concluded in 2011  and the new Mission, Vision and Values  statement is now taking ef ect across the  company. This will represent a signif cant  challenge for Vale in the coming years.  Vale is a transformational company. It  transforms the environment where it  operates, the social context where it is  present, and the economies where it carries  out its activities. What does sustainable  development mean for Vale? It means  identifying the countless opportunities  for growth that are available, while also  recognizing the planets physical limits.  The immediate consequence of this  understanding is that Vale works in the  knowledge that natural resources are  f nite. The company is committed to  practicing and promoting the ef  cient  use of these resources, investing in clean  energy and acting to mitigate the impact  of its operations on climate change. For  Vale, sustainable development also means  sharing its opportunities and benef ts with  society, in particular with the communities,  governments and local institutions that  are directly and indirectly impacted by  the companys activities. To achieve this, it is essential for Vale to  measure and report the positive and  negative impacts of all its activities, in  order to recognize them properly. Only  on this basis will it be possible for the  company to generate a positive legacy  for its stakeholders. In this report, based on a methodology  that def nes material issues, Vale  assumes a range of commitments to its  stakeholders, including the following: People – To develop people,  guaranteeing education and health  and safety, building high-quality  relationships based on trust; Communities – To promote development  with education and health and safety,  leaving a positive legacy in the regions  where Vale operates; Value Chain – To promote the sustainability  agenda with its suppliers and clients, striving  to guarantee that human rights are not  violated within the supply chain and to  Entrance of Vales  headquarters, the  Baro de Mau  building in Rio de  Janeiro, Brazil 13 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  support the development of suppliers in  regions where the company operates;  Government – To act on promoting  sustainable development in  partnership with governments, based  on the companys participation in  public policy and at the created and  distributed economic value. Engagement In order to act on these commitments  and to reinforce the companys license  to operate and grow, Vale needs a new  way of engaging its stakeholders and  to develop ef ective mechanisms for  listening to them and responding to their  demands, handling sensitive issues with  respect. By treating its stakeholders as  equal partners in its relations with them,  Vale aspires to build relationships of trust  and conf dence, improving its capacity to  listen and using a range of mechanisms  and channels for communicating with  stakeholders, such as opinion surveys,  meetings with communities, and  participating in committees that address  social and environmental issues.  Vale aims to guarantee that its governance  structure incorporates the perspectives of  its stakeholders, by establishing processes  for listening to them and receiving their  feedback in a way that enables them to  make their opinions known.  The companys senior management  is committed to this new strategic  vision, which prioritizes people and  the planet. By constructing a dialogue  with society, Vale aims to be able  to understand and respond to the  aspirations of its stakeholders.  The companys strategic vision of  sustainability is based on a series of  commitments to the planet and to  people, and on open relationships  with its stakeholders.  Vale is committed to acting on this  vision in every part of the world  where it is present and in very diverse  cultures. This is perhaps one of the  companys greatest challenges. It is a  challenge that senior management is  very focused on meeting, leveraging a  system of governance that is aligned  with global best practice.

Target To reinforce relations with our  stakeholders that are built on trust, using  mechanisms for engaging with them 14  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  To enable the companys governance  to follow international management  standards for sustainability, Vale has  implemented a series of global policies.  The sustainable Development Policy 1,  which was created in 2009, provides  orientation for Vale in three areas: being a  Sustainable Operator, a Local Sustainable  Development Catalyst and a Global  Sustainability Agent. This Policy complements the companys  Climate Change Policy, created in 2008.  Since then, Vale has established other  global policies that are directly related to  sustainability, such as the Human Rights  Policy, the Accountabilities Norm for  Health, Safety and Environment and the  Health and Safety Policy, among others. One of the major challenges that Vale faces  today is to implement its main policies at  the same rate of growth as the company,  while also respecting local cultures. These  policies have resulted in management  systems that are monitored using  Governance To enable the implementation of the  companys strategic vision, Vale relies  on a governance structure that provides  support to the companys senior  management, defends the companys  values and follows international  benchmarks for corporate administration.  Vales Board of Directors has an Advisory  Committee that is dedicated to  Governance and Sustainability issues. The  Executive Of  cer for Human Resources,  Health and Safety, Sustainability and  Energy is responsible for sustainability  issues and is supported by dedicated  corporate bodies.  The organizational changes  implemented in 2011 were designed  to enhance the management of key  issues for the organization, such as  health and safety, with the creation of  a Global Department for Occupational  Health and Safety. Regarding  community relations, a Community  Relations Department was established  in order to enhance relations with the  people who live in regions where the  company operates.   1 The complete text of the Sustainable  Development Policy is available at www.vale.com,  in the Sustainability section.

The selected sustainability indicators are  related to the following aspects: energy  supplies, water, waste, mine closure,  local development and human resources.  Targets were established for all of these  aspects. These targets make a direct or  non-direct contribution to improving  Vales performance in these issues. For  example, the energy targets (EN3 and  EN4) have contributed to reducing  greenhouse gas emissions. More  information is available in the Planet  chapter, in the Climate Change and  Energy section.  The table on pages 18 and 19 presents  the results for variable remuneration  in 2011 and the targets set for  variable remuneration in 2012. In the  classif cation used by Vale, Target  Achieved corresponds to level 3 of  the target and Challenge Achieved  means the overcoming of level 3. Most of the 2011 results, a total of  25, were Challenges achieved, while  seven were Targets achieved and just  two were Targets not achieved. The  reasons for not achieving these targets  were as follows:   EN3 – target for reducing fuel  consumption: in the copper operation  in Brazil the increased depth of the mine  resulted in increased average transport  distances and hence higher consumption  of diesel. As a result, the target was not  achieved. The target for 2012 takes this  issue into account.  EN22 – reduction of specif c  generation of oily hazardous wastes:  in the copper area in Brazil, there  was an increase in sand and soil  contamination by oil and grease. This  was due to soil being transported  to the equipment washing yard of  the operations, and maintenance  work carried out on equipment in  unpaved areas. The business area has  implemented measures to mitigate  its generation of this waste and has  also planned to re-use the waste and  to classify it as a by-product. indicators to assess business performance  and to determine employees variable  remuneration. In 2011, the companys performance  in Health and Safety represented 10%  of the variable remuneration of Vale  employees in operational areas and  5% in corporate areas, to support a  health and safety-conscious culture. In  addition, the goals of the Action Plan  on Sustainability (PAS, in Portuguese),  described in the table, are also directly  linked to variable remuneration  payments, and represented 5% of  the variable remuneration of all  employees in 2011. This underlines the  companys commitment improving its  sustainability management and results. Action Plan  on Sustainability (PAS) Vale is working closely with its global  operations to implement and execute  the companys Strategic Vision, one of  Vales greatest challenges. The Action  Plan on Sustainability (PAS) is one  mechanism to help ensure that this  Vision is realized in Vales operational  practices, resulting in tangible  benef ts. Initially focused on standardizing  Vales sustainability indicators  and improving the companys  performance, in 2011 PAS was  extended to cover global coal, nickel,  Challenge To implement the main  policies at the same pace  at which the company is  growing, while respecting  local characteristics 16  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  All PAS indicators have  improvement action plans,  whether the targets and challenges  were achieved or not in 2011.  These plans are based on technical  visits, assessments and meetings  with those responsible for the  themes (water, waste, training,  local purchasing and others) at  operational and corporate areas. Vale invested over US$ 100 million  in 2011 in 270 actions to improve  its performance in sustainability,  especially in the areas of hazardous  waste, water resources, and  direct and indirect energy. Each  operational department manages  these investments. In the same  year, these indicators began to  be monitored in the monthly  performance management  meetings of each Vale department.  In 2012, in addition to the  indicators of 2011, PAS will include  an indicator on the Recovery of  Degraded Areas, with performance  indicators that will be monitored  over the course of the year. 2 Research and innovation Vales strategy for technology and  innovation is based on the actions  of the Vale Technology Institute  (ITV), one of whose main objectives  is to contribute to the development  of the technology economy in Brazil,  by investing in scientif c research  and disseminating innovation and  knowledge that can contribute to  socio-economic and environmental  development and support the  sustainable mining sector.  The ITV is putting into practice  one of Vales core values,  establishing partnerships and  working together with a common  goal: sustainable development. Based on this philosophy of  cooperation, in 2011 the ITV  organized a series of seminars with  the Brazilian and global science  and technology community which  discussed mining in the future and  the technological outlook for the  sector. Researchers and academics  from Brazil and other countries  participated in these seminars.  Participants discussed a range of  issues, including climate change  and natural phenomena, energy  production and use, integrated  planning and management of  natural resources, and sustainable  practices in the production chain.  The ITV is also working in  partnership with universities and  research institutions. There are  currently 55 projects underway  that are related to the environment,  health and safety and other aspects  of sustainability. These projects are  in the development stage and Vale  believes that they have the potential  to contribute to improving the  companys social, environmental and  economic performance.

To implement this vision successfully,  it is essential for the company to  act correctly and in accordance  with its values. Vale has a number of  instruments at its disposal to ensure  ethical standards in its activities,  such as the Code of Ethical Conduct,  which is also available in versions  for suppliers and the f nancial  markets (available at www.vale.com),  Sarbanes-Oxley Certif cation (SOX  Certif cation, since 2006), and a  Reporting Channel for complaints  and information. This channel  enables people to report complaints  about possible irregularities or  improprieties in accounting, auditing  and internal controls, as well as  irregularities in the areas of ethics,  human rights and the environment.  For more information about how  the company manages cases of  discrimination, please read the  People chapter.  Combating corruption Acting in the right way means that  corruption is intolerable. Vale follows  the best practices in the market to  prevent losses and investigate cases  that are possibly associated with  fraud, deviations, and illicit acts. Cases  that have been identif ed and duly  substantiated with facts and f gures  are treated seriously and in proportion  to the damages incurred or avoided.  People who have been proved to  be involved in these situations are  held accountable and are disciplined  with dismissal and legal proceedings.  Contracts with companies involved in  proven illicit acts will be terminated.  Companies will be removed from  the Vale registry and are subject to  penalties that are proportionate to  the damages caused. In 2011, the company identif ed 47  incidents of fraud, as shown in the  chart above. Vale continues to focus  on assessing risks of corruption  and preventing losses especially in  the supply chain, in contracts with  operational areas and in tenders  for suppliers, while it also acts to  Integrated risk management Vale believes that risk  management, aligned with its  commitment to sustainable  development, is essential for  the company to implement its  growth plan, strategic planning  maintain f nancial f exibility and  achieve a consolidated vision of  the risks to which it is exposed.   Legal compliance In 2011, Vale recorded the  existence of 293 signif cant legal  proceedings — 136 judicial and  157 administrative 3. During this  period, no f nes were paid, nor  were any non-monetary sanctions  imposed 4. The judicial proceedings  include 69 proceedings related to  civil actions concerned with the  legality of the privatization of Vale  and 52 tax cases in which Vale is  contesting undue demands for  Financial Compensation for Mineral  Exploration (CFEM). These cases  also represent the majority of the  administrative proceedings (145).   2011 2010 2009 105 49 47 I Cases of corruption were presented to company  administrators and those responsible for the af ected  areas, resulting in 120 actions to mitigate fraud risks,  warnings, deductions and f nes imposed with the  support of the Legal Department. II The number of employees dismissed/punished  in corruption cases was 83 in 2009, 23 in 2010 and 20  in 2011. In 2011, the main causes for dismissal related  to corruption were conf ict of interest/ inf uence  peddling (45%), fraud (25%) and the inappropriate  use of corporate resources (10%). 2009 2010 2011 Cases involving  other measures I 58 24 29 Cases of non- renewed contracts  24 10 6 Cases with dismissal  or punishment II 23 15 12 Total 105 49 47 3 Legal proceedings are considered signif cant  based on the following criteria: a) their value, including  compensation claims and f nes; b) whether they  involve a subject of interest to the company or  af ecting the general public, regardless of value; c)  those resulting from non-monetary sanctions. 4 In this report, Vale continues to disclose existing  cases to which the signif cance criterion applies.  However, the company now discloses only those  values acknowledged as owed or already paid by Vale,  to best meet the scope of the SO8 GRI indicator and to  avoid any distortion of reality concerning judicial and  administrative proceedings that, as they are awaiting  the f nal decision, cannot normally be accounted  for precisely. Vales Form 20-F report contains an  estimated provision according to accounting criteria. Incidents of corruption 20  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  controls. Furthermore, no situation  of corruption (active or passive)  of public of  cials or government  representatives involving employees  was recorded during this period. Vale acts to prevent corruption  in a number of ways, including  regular classroom training courses  to combat fraud, such as the Online  Course in Business Ethics. In 2011, 1%  of Vales employees received classroom  or online training. The companys  main challenge is to extend access  to this knowledge to its employees as  rapidly as possible. Vale is committed  to focusing its ef orts on engaging its  teams in this area.   Human rights Vale has established a series of guidelines  and principles that inform its projects and  operations on how to act in terms of respect  of human rights throughout the entire life  cycle of its activities, as well as in  the production chain in the regions where  it is present. Vale has also assumed the  signif cant challenge of raising human  rights awareness, in partnership with its  prevent losses in capital projects  and sustaining investments. In  partnership with other departments,  Vale carries out intelligence work  using data from the Shared Services  Organization (SSO) to identify  opportunities for preventing  losses in the operational areas and  investigate any issues that have  been detected in the work of the  companys Internal Audit services.

In 2009, the Vale Human Rights Policy  established principles and guidelines to  be followed. Vale acts in accordance with  local labor legislation, and is a signatory  to the International Council on Mining  and Metals (ICMM) and to the United  Nations (UN) Global Compact, as well  as other institutions that have adopted  respect for human rights as a principle.   In addition to the Human Rights Policy,  Vale also has a Human Rights Guide that  establishes the companys positioning  on human rights issues. In 2011, Vale  revised the guide and published a second  edition that aims to support not only its  employees, but also other stakeholders,  in understanding and respecting human  rights. The guide addresses issues such  as: respect for diversity; awareness of  harassment; relations with employees,  customers, partners, suppliers, communities,  governments and society; child labor  and forced labor; artisanal mining, and  others. The content of the human rights  guide is available at www.vale.com,in the  Sustainability/Human Rights section.  Institutional partnerships Vale knows that it faces challenges. The  company has established a range of  partnerships that help it exchange  experiences and discuss global best  practice. These partnerships include  its memberships of the ICMM, the  United Nations Global Compact, the  World Business Council for Sustainable  Development (WBCSD), Business for Social  Responsibility (BSR) and other organizations. Vale participates actively in national and  international entities and forums, such  as the Earth Moving Equipment Safety  Round Table (EMESRT), the Green Building  Council (GBC), the Brazilian Mining Institute  (Ibram), the Brazilian Business Council for  Sustainable Development (CEBDS) and  the Ethos Institute for Business and Social  Responsibility, among others, so that it  can contribute to global discussion on  issues such as health and safety, the green  economy, climate change and others.  In line with its Strategic Vision,  Vale understands that it is not  enough to respect human rights: it  must also contribute to promoting  them throughout the companys  sphere of inf uence An employee in the  control room of the  operations in Goro,  New Caledonia GRI Reference Indicators: SO5, SO6 Prof le: 4.12 22  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  As an example of its work in the public  policy sphere, in 2011 Vale was invited by  the Ministry of Mines and Energy in Brazil  to participate in developing the Sector Plan  for Mining for reducing greenhouse gas  emissions, as part of the National Policy  for Climate Change. The company supported  the initiative with the Brazilian Institute of  Mining and the Plan was delivered to the  Environment Ministry in 2012.  Vale seeks to maintain strict impartiality  with regard to political activities, and  acts in compliance with the laws of each  country where it operates. Employees,  as individuals and citizens, are free to  participate in such activities, provided  that any public statements they make  are clearly personal views rather than the  companys position. Vale S.A. does not  make donations to electoral campaigns,  but other companies in the group are  not prevented from doing so. Donations  made by these companies can be found  in the public records of the of  cial  institutions that are responsible for  elections in the countries and regions  where Vale operates.  Public Policies Vale maintains constant dialogue with  government authorities in the countries  where it operates. Considering that  mining is a closely regulated sector, Vale  strives to ensure that its points of view  are understood and taken into account in  public policy making processes. The company seeks constructive dialogue in  an attempt to reach a consensus with those  engaged in sustainable development policy  making and with the many stakeholders  in the mining sector. The company  bases its relations on transparency, trust  and clear objectives. In 2011, an internal workshop was held,  lasting two days, covering political and  institutional relations and aimed at  employees of the Institutional Relations  area. The workshop provided participants  with an opportunity to understand the  policy-making process and enhance their  knowledge of how public authorities  function, as well as looking for coherent  and harmonious relations with members  of state and federal governments and  representatives of civil society.

Qualif ed human  capital is essential if the company is to  ensure the expansion of its operations  and execute its growth strategy. Demand  for professionals is expected to continue  to grow signif cantly in the coming years,  which represents a major challenge for  Vale, whose activities often take place in  regions that are a long way from urban  centers and have a limited supply of  qualif ed workers.  It is a principle of Vale to recognize the  value of the people at the company,  which means that it must build high- quality relationships with employees and  contractors 1. The company understands  that it needs to undertake a series of  measures to achieve this aspiration,  especially in the very culturally diverse  areas where it operates. The company  is investing in internal education, of ers  benef ts aligned with best market  practices, assesses its employees  satisfaction by using working climate  surveys, and has an unwavering  commitment to health and safety. Prof le of Vales people In 2011, Vale had 187,700 workers,  including its own employees (with an  open-ended employment contract)  and contractors (service providers in  permanent activities and projects). This  represented an increase of 13,600 (7.8%)  compared with 2010. The company also  has 3,200 employees on f xed-length  contracts (15% up on 2010). Around 78%  of all employees work in Brazil.

The only acceptable target is zero  harm. This means that every day all of  its employees and contractors must be  able to return home intact and healthy.  Vale also believes that healthy and safe  communities are essential for a healthy  and safe company. Vales strategy for achieving zero  harm is based on developing a health  and safety culture and a culture  of prevention that is founded on  the engagement and commitment  of the companys leadership and  the continuous development of  people. The companys main focus  is on the permanent engagement  of its leaders in achieving cultural  change, the implementation of its  global health and safety management  system including measures to prevent  fatality risks, and the implementation  of its integrated health strategy  (occupational health, health  promotion and community health).  Vale supports technological  innovation in processes and  procedures by using benchmarking  and implementing best practices.  In 2011, Vale supported the promotion  of a health and safety culture through  actions such as Behavioral Dialogues,  the Day of Ref ection on Health and  Safety, and events such as debates at  the I Global Health and Safety Forum.  Vale also uses Fatality Risk Standards  (internally referred to as Critical Activities  Requirements or RACs) to help eliminate  fatalities. These essential health and safety  requirements mandate the adoption  of standards, procedures, training and  investment in infrastructure. There are  11 def ned standards that historically  represent 84.5% of fatalities 2.  People Health and safety 2  Critical activities are those that involve working  at heights, electricity, automotive vehicles, mobile  machinery, equipment lockout and tagout, cargo  handling, conf ned spaces, machinery protection,  slope stabilization, explosives and blasting, and  chemical products. The issue of health and  safety comes before any other  activity or priority at the  company. It is a permanent  commitment for all of us Galib Chaim, Executive Off cer of  Capital Projects Implementation 29 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  We are investing a lot in health  and safety and building a culture of  prevention and risk management  in our company.

II Figures include injuries with and without lost time.  The rate does not include occupational illness or f rst  aid treatment. For Vale Brazil, health and safety indicators  are based on monthly person-hours worked estimated  for its workforce. The f gures include mineral exploration  companies, including international ones. For Vale Canada  and its subsidiaries, Vale Australia and the Moatize Project,  actual person-hours worked are used. Investment of more than US$250 million  was made in 2011 to improve health  and safety, 150% up on 2010s f gure.  RACs are being implemented in Vales  operations and projects. About 84% of  the companys operations now apply  the RACs.  In 2011, compliance with RACs  increased by around 60% compared  with 2008, the f rst year in which  they were implemented. In 2008, the  compliance rate was 52%. In 2011, Vale carried out a global audit  for the f rst time. The RACs and Legal  Requirements were audited by Bureau  Veritas and Accenture. In total, 130  operations and projects in Brazil and  other countries and 13 critical suppliers  were audited in 2011.  30  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Campaign Behind one life there are  many others In 2011, Vale organized a Day of Ref ection on Health and  Safety to help promote the health and safety culture at the  company. Vale employees around the world discussed the  topic. This was the f rst such global mobilization of Vales  employees, and senior management played a major part.  In all over 138,000 employees participated in discussions  in 25 locations. As a result of the debates, each area  made a critical analysis of issues where there is room for  improvement in health and safety. Around one thousand  actions were discussed worldwide, and work plans are  being implemented for each area. Another initiative carried out in 2011 was a global internal and  external communications campaign spanning newspapers,  magazines and television stations across Brazil. The purpose  of the campaign was to highlight the importance of health  and safety to Vale and to encourage health and safety  improvements in the companys supply chain. Inspired by an  internal assessment of Proud to be Vale, the campaign had a  positive result, especially because it is not common practice  in the sector to discuss the topic externally. In addition, the  action reinforced the importance of health and safety as an  element of sustainable development. Unfortunately, despite all these ef orts,  there were 15 fatalities caused by the  following 11 incidents:  – Train collision in Colombia  (two employees);  – Cleaning vehicle fell into the  sea from a pier in Brazil  (one contractor);  – Malaria diagnosis,  in Guinea (one contractor);  – Material falling from a height  Brazil (one employee);  – Uncontrolled release of  rock and ore in an underground mine  passage in Canada (two employees);  – Car accident, in Brazil (two contractors);  – Person hit by train, in Brazil  (one employee);  – Person hit by bus, in Brazil  (one contractor);  – Compacting vehicle falling  of  the edge of a slope, in  Mozambique (one contractor);  – Vehicle falling into an open hole  in an underground mine, in  Canada (one employee);  – Collapse of a support beam  at a harbor construction site  in Brazil (two contractors). All the incidents involved employees and  contractors performing their activities in  operations and projects. Vale of ered full support to families and  conducted investigations to identify  the root causes of each event in order  to analyze all the risks involved, and  31 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Injuries and fatalities  in the workplace  are unacceptable  to Vale, whatever  their causes intensify ef orts to promote a culture  of prevention. Workplace injuries and fatalities are not  acceptable to Vale, whatever their causes.  The goal is zero harm, with a focus on  structured actions involving:  – risk assessment;        – employee and leadership;  – training;  – operating discipline;  – innovation;          – change management. In 2012, Vale is focused on  deploying its global health and  safety management system and  prioritizing areas that reduce the  potential for fatalities. As a ref ection of the companys  commitment to health and safety, the  new administration has established  an exclusive Health and Safety  Department with a global reach.

Integrated Health Strategy A major initiative launched in  2011 was the Integrated Health  Strategy, which establishes health  as a strategic component for  Vale, based on three pillars in the  companys programs and initiatives:  Occupational Health, Personal  Health (Health Assistance) and  Community Health.  The Integrated Health Strategy was  developed in line with the companys  strategic priorities in the health and  safety area, aiming for zero harm and  a healthy workforce at Vale.  Dif erentiated health  and safety actions The diversity of health conditions in  the locations where Vale operates  means that dif erent kinds of actions  are needed. As a result, in 2011 a  number of dif erent training, advisory,  risk prevention/control and medical  treatment programs were developed  for employees and their families  and to ref ect the needs of the  communities where Vale operates,  aiming to promote health and  encourage preventive attitudes.  Actions carried out at some of the  companys units are shown above.  Actions focused on community  health are detailed on page 55. 33 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  + online content More information about the  topics covered in this chapter can be found in the  online version of the 2011 Sustainability Report  www.vale.com/rs2011 Organizational learning To facilitate organizational learning  in the Health and Safety area, improve  processes and prevent incidents, Vale  shares best practices in company forums,  publications, regular meetings and in  other communications. In 2011, around 80 initiatives considered  to be examples of best practice were  communicated with operational areas and  projects. They included the establishment  of ten sub-committees to discuss and  def ne Health and Safety procedures, the  training of internal auditors in health and  safety, the development of behavioral  dialogues and others.   Award For the sixth time in the last seven  years, Vale has been awarded the John  T. Ryan Trophy by the Canadian Institute  of Mining in Montreal. The award was  based on the performance of the T-1 and  Birchtree mines, which had the lowest  reportable injury frequency per 200,000  hours worked in Canada. Innovation Based on a  pioneering agreement with state  research promotion foundations,  the Vale Technology Institute (ITV)  is supporting a range of research  projects. These include a project  focused on Health and Safety  in Mining, in partnership  with the Federal University of  Minas Gerais (UFMG).  The aim of this initiative, which is  currently being implemented,  is to establish procedures  and methodologies for analyzing  situations in the workplace and  assessing the workers know-how.  It includes training staf  in the skills  needed to research all aspects of  the workplace.  The project is expected to be  completed in the second half of  2013. It aims to create focus groups  and establish dialogue between  researchers from the medicine,  engineering, education  and psychology sectors  and Vale employees. Challenges Achieve zero harm Eliminate the def cit in education Create relationships  of quality and trust 34  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Vale has assumed the challenge  of eliminating def ciencies  in the basic education of its  employees at the technical and  operational level. Currently, 8%  of the companys employees in  Brazil, or about 4,800 3 people, do  not have a certif cate of completion  of elementary and/or high school  education. Vales goal is to reduce  this percentage to zero in  the coming years. To achieve this,  employees who have not had  the opportunity before are given  classroom education, in partnership  with local educational institutions. Another major challenge for the  companys growth is to ensure  that it has qualif ed workers for its  operations, most of which are in  areas that are far from urban centers  and hard to access. In an ef ort to engage company managers  in employee training, the capacity- building goals that until last year were  concentrated in Valer — Vale Education  (the corporate university) apply to all Vale  managers as of 2012.  Vale understands that it faces a signif cant  challenge in this matter. To address this  challenge, the companys education  strategy aims to train all its employees and  include the following educational models: People Education Technical, Management and Leadership  Development plans, Development Maps,  and Cross-Cutting Competencies.  Vale continues to provide its  employees with in company  courses and in more specif c cases  with f nancial support for external  training. The company is focused  on developing the critical technical  skills that its businesses demand  from its employees. Focus on education In 2011, US$68.6 million was  invested in education in Brazil,  92% in courses in the country,  enabling 78,342 professionals to  be trained, 27% more than in 2010.  The remaining 8% was invested  outside the country.  A signif cant  result of this investment is  the high percentage (90%) of  management vacancies that are  f lled internally. 3  Employees in Brazil with a labor contract of an  undetermined length. Target Guarantee that employees  at the operational  technician level have the  certif cate of completion  of elementary and/or  high school education 35 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Indigenous communities To ensure that Vale can meet the  challenge of anticipating problems  and mitigating any legal disputes with  indigenous communities, it is a strategic  priority for the company to provide  training to its operational areas. Vale  increased the number of employees  who manage relations with traditional  communities and held training sessions  and internal seminars. In November 2011, all Vale professionals  who work in the area attended  the International Seminar on Vales  Relations with Indigenous Peoples.  This pioneering event facilitated the  exchange of experiences and best  practices between employees and  helped to align the companys global  management of this issue.  The average number of training hours  at Vale increased by 39% (53 hours per  year) due to the companys enhanced  focus on training its employees and  the development of its Global Training  Management System, which improved  the recording of information on a  single database.  Human rights In 2011, to raise awareness about  the guidelines of the Human Rights  Guide, Vale initiated a cycle of training  for employees to debate and discuss  issues related to human rights abuses.  Initially, training was provided to  regional teams who work most  closely with this area (in particular, the  Human Resources, Legal, Security and  Community Relations areas). In 2012, as well as providing  classroom training to new students  in Brazil and overseas, the company  plans to launch an online course to  support the increasing visibility of  human rights at Vale. Corporate security Since 2008, Vale has provided annual  training in safety and human rights  to corporate security teams and  every two years it organizes refresher  courses for the area. This action forms  part of the companys Global Human  Rights Policy. In 2011, more than 4,030 corporate  security contractors and more  than 230 Vale security employees  completed these training courses.  This represents 80% of the companys  global security workforce.  In  Brazil, 89.5% of corporate security  professionals received training.  Courses were provided in Canada,  France, Norway, Mozambique,  Taiwan, Japan, New Caledonia, Peru,  Paraguay and Brazil.    A continued challenge for Vales  corporate security area is to extend  increased training to its units outside  Brazil and to support respect for human  rights in the highly diverse cultures  where it operates. GRI Reference Indicators: LA10, HR3, HR8 Prof le: 4.16 Training hours 2011 2010 2009 I The average number of hours a year is calculated by  dividing the total number of hours of training by the number  of employees. Employees covered by this indicator (LA10)  correspond to 95% (2009), 87% (2010) and 98% (2011).

This is  an issue that is extremely sensitive for the  companys employees. Vale has realized that  there is a signif cant dif erence between  having operations in many regions and  having a truly global culture. One of Vales  challenges currently is to understand,  respect and win the conf dence of  employees from all over the world.  The company has assumed the  commitment to actively seek to engage  all of its employees and to create high- quality relationships based on trust and  conf dence, which will help the company  and its employees Improve together. Ref ecting this commitment, in 2011  Vale carried out its f rst global survey of  employees, across the entire organization  (in eight languages), using both printed  questionnaires and online forms 4. 56,445 employees participated in the  survey and the f nal results showed  that 84% of participants felt a sense of  engagement. Despite this achievement,  Vale will continue to strive for more  positive results.  To guarantee that all areas for  improvement are addressed and resolved,  Vales managers met with their teams to  interpret the results and prepare action  plans. Already, more than 3,500 actions  have been implemented and have  been recorded online. These include  the following: improving dialogue  between dif erent company departments;  enhancing relations and demands made  between corporate areas (mainly in  Brazil) and business areas; improving the  guidance given to employees about their  performance; and developing a system  for collecting ideas and suggestions from  employees. The next global opinion survey  is planned for February 2013. As a Brazilian company with a global  reach, Vale is committed to respecting  local characteristics and cultures. In  Canada, where the rate of employee  4 Until 2010, only local surveys were  carried out. By investing in people and  identifying talent at all levels,  the company is preparing for  future challenges Maria Gurgel, Global Director of Human  Resources and Governance participation in the global opinion survey  was only 56%, and in Indonesia, where  it was 84%, Vale is aware that it has  experienced dif  culties and is working  towards a solution. Respecting dif erences Vale does not tolerate discrimination  whether based on ethnic background,  origin, gender, sexual orientation,  religious belief, union af  liation, political  and ideological conviction, social class,  disability, marital status or age. Vale always looks to employ local  workers whenever possible  (for more information about Vales  local hiring practices, see the  Community section, on page 52),  respecting and encouraging diversity  and equality in its workforce. This commitment to diversity is also  ref ected in the companys benef ts policy,  Vales Human Rights  Policy and the Code of Ethical  Conduct reinforce the  companys position of not  tolerating discrimination 37 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  which acknowledges same-sex partners.  In this and other areas, Vales commitment  to diversity includes establishing  dialogue with the culture of each  country where it operates. Vale progressed in 2011 by increasing the  proportion of women employed at the  company by 28%, to 12.3% of all employees.  This is a major achievement for a mining  company, a sector in which the workforce is  predominantly male. The largest proportion of women, 48%,  hold technical positions (operational  and administrative jobs), followed by  specialists (analysts, engineers, geologists,  etc.) with 45%. In supervisory and  management positions, the proportion  of women remained stable, at 3%.  Top management — the Executive Board,  Board of Directors and Fiscal Council 5 —  consists of 36 people (35 men and one  woman). Twelve of the members are in  the 30 to 50 age bracket, while 24 are  over 50 years of age.  In accordance with Vales Remuneration  Policy and Code of Ethical Conduct,  5 Position in 2011.

Directors  General Managers  Area Managers and Coordinators  Supervisors  Specialists  Operational Technicians there is no dif erence in the base salary  between women and men who occupy  the same role. The variation in the chart  above is due to the dif erent seniority  and experience of employees within their  employment category. Diversity Every person has unique talents and  possesses the capacity to strive for their  personal and professional development.  Achieving diversity in the workforce is one  way of creating long-term value.  Since 2004 Vale has been reinforcing  its commitment to respecting diversity,  through its Inclusion Program for  People with Disabilities, coordinated  by Valer — Vale Education and the  regional human resources areas. In  order to comply with Law no. 8,213  (July 25, 1991), which requires reserving  vacancies for people with disabilities,  Vale has a goal of hiring 140 such  professionals every year.  In 2011, it hired 185 people with  disabilities, fulf lling Vales Conduct  Adjustment Agreement with the Brazilian  Public Prosecution Ministry. In addition  to the opportunity to access the labor  market, these professionals have also  benef ted from theoretical and practical  training entirely f nanced by Vale. Recognizing  and promoting  the talent  and ability  of women,  reducing  their historic  and cultural  diff culties  in accessing  opportunities,  is one way  of fulf lling  Vales vision GRI Reference Indicators: LA13, LA14 38  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  After carrying out consultations with its  managers, human resources teams and  with disabled employees themselves,  Vale identif ed new opportunities and  reviewed and extended the scope of  action for disabled people, extending  the program to other functions at the  company, and not just to operational  and administrative roles. The aim is to develop and harness the  potential of people with disabilities and  to put into practice one of Vales core  values, which is to Improve together.  Currently, in operations and of  ces in  Brazil, 62% of disabled employees carry  out operational activities and 38% are  employed in administrative  and specialist roles.   The next goal of the program is  to eliminate physical barriers.  The company is already studying  an accessibility policy that will be  launched in 2012 and will be used in all  of Vales infrastructure and construction  plans and projects to ensure that the  companys global operations take into  consideration access for people with  disabilities. The f rst tangible results  should start to be seen in 2013. Gender Equity In 2011, Vale established a project  aiming to encourage ref ection  on the issue of gender equity. Vale  used workshops, debates, f lms, and  exhibitions of photographs showing  men and women working in the  same positions at the company, to  help it understand how its employees  perceive the gender topic. The  company believes that it will be  possible to implement its initiatives  and strategic actions in ways that are  aligned with the real needs of men and  women, and that make the most of the  capacities of every person at Vale.  Since its establishment, this project has  already carried out actions in 24 locations  in Brazil, involving the participation of  around 1,200 employees. A committee  consisting of representatives of Vales  leadership is responsible for multiplying  the ef ects of the project, stimulating  debate about the topic and proposing  and validating actions with a positive  impact on the company.  Integration Re-engaging  Employees in Canada The results of the employee engagement survey were not  as positive in Canada as in other countries.  Vale accepts  these results and acknowledges that the integration of its  Canadian operations over the last few years has resulted in  signif cant changes for its employees.  Vale recognizes the  importance of strengthening its understanding of the local  culture and local realities, especially during changes. Today, the company is well aware of the need to restore  trust.  Vale wants to re-establish full communications  between the company, its employees and union  representatives. The company knows this may take time  and is fully committed.   Vale has ambitious investment plans for Canada and  believes it is essential to build trust and continuously  engage its employees. An employee  at Big Nickel,  in Sudbury,  Ontario, Canada 39 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Fighting discrimination In 2011, 62 cases of discrimination were  reported: 34 in Canada and 28 in Brazil.  The company believes that the 23%  increase in the number of cases from  the previous year is due to improved  reporting channels.  In Canada, just one case of discrimination  has not been fully resolved, as the  employee is yet to complete a six- month orientation course. In every case,  measures were taken in response to  the discrimination identif ed, involving  investigations, guidance, training and  disciplinary measures. In Brazil, 14 cases were investigated  and resolved, while others are still  being analyzed. In some cases,  employees were dismissed.  Vale has a  Reporting Channel to also guarantee  human rights.  Remuneration and  Professional evaluation A major part of an employees  satisfaction is based on receiving fair  compensation. Each year, Vale carries  out a survey of salaries in regions  where it operates to ensure that its  compensation packages remain  attractive and competitive in the local  market. Vale respects the legal minimum  salary in each location. The companys  methodology and philosophy for  remunerating its employees are applied  in a standardized way across all regions  and are generally based on performance  rather than length of service.  The companys Total Remuneration  philosophy aims to provide its  employees with a competitive  remuneration package, comprising  monetary remuneration, benef ts and  a working experience that attracts  and retains the best talents.  In order to develop a culture that is  constantly driven by results, each  employees remuneration package  includes the payment of a variable  bonus. The bonus that an employee  receives is calculated in accordance with  his or her individual performance, that  of their team, department and company,  and is also determined  by issues related  Women in  Sohar, Oman,  where Vale has  operations GRI Reference Indicators: HR4, EC5, LA2 Vale understands that  working in different countries  and cultures is a challenge,  but also an opportunity, because  of the advantages of having  a diverse workforce 40  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  to sustainability, such as health and  safety, and the targets of the Action  Plan on Sustainability (PAS) which are  described in the Strategic Vision section  from pages 16 to 19.  Decline in employee turnover Employee turnover is a very important  indicator of the satisfaction of the  companys employees. The trend for  increasing retention of the companys  employees has been conf rmed by the  decline in the global turnover 6 rate from  6% in 2010 to 4.7% in 2011. Vales talent retention policy is based on  programs that support the development  of local infrastructure (health, education,  housing and leisure), continuous  education, and performance, career  and succession management. The latter  issue is based on a process of engaging  employees and providing them with  feedback on the results they have  achieved. By assessing an employees  competencies, performance and career  aspirations, the company aims to ensure  that the right person is in the right job.  The turnover rate for women (5%) was  similar to the rate for men (4.7%), and  their percentage of dismissals (13%) is in  proportion to their total share of the Vale  workforce (12.3%).  In Australia, the turnover rate increased  from 9.5% (2010) to 19.1% (2011) in an  extremely competitive labor market  in which there is a shortage of labor  and an imbalance between supply  and demand. The results of the latest  Resources Industry Turnover Analysis  (RITA) Report (April 2011) show that  employee turnover in the resources  sector increased from 13.8% to 20.9%  per annum in just six months since  the last survey.  In New Caledonia, the  increase in the turnover rate was due to  the hiring and then release of people  during the test phase before the start  of operations at the project. To achieve the companys goal of  becoming one of the best places to work,  to improve employees quality of life and  to reduce the employee turnover rate,  in 2012 Vale started to carry out a series  of actions aiming to improve the work/ life balance of its employees. The f rst  initiative in this ef ort was an internal  campaign that provided information  about the importance of taking breaks  and vacations, playing sport and  eating healthy food. 6 The employee turnover rate corresponds to the  total number of employees that left the organization,  whether voluntarily or not (including retirees), divided  by the total number of employees. We operate in various locations,  with a range of ethnicities and  cultures, and we must make the most  of this to become a better company Tito Martins, Executive Off cer of Finance and  Investors Relations 41 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Freedom of association and negotiation Vale respects the freedom of its  employees to form associations and  to participate in negotiations. Good  relationships with unions are a priority for  Vale and the multi-year agreements that  have been signed ref ect improvements  in these relationships.  Social dialogue with unions and other  labor associations is at the center  of Vales relations with its employees.  Over the last three years, Vale has  increased the range of its social  dialogue events with nearly all worker  representatives in Brazil. Decent working conditions Since 2007, Vale has been a signatory  to the United Nations Global Compact,  and it respects the laws of the  countries where it operates and the  eight fundamental conventions of the  International Labor Organization (ILO), in  accordance with the list of conventions  in the following table. Vale also  participates in global working groups  that aim to guarantee compliance  with the principles and fundamental  conventions of the ILO, such as the  abolition of forced labor and child labor  an end to discrimination. In 2012, the company intends to involve  all categories of workers in this dialogue,  both in and outside Brazil.  In 2011, the percentage of employees  covered by collective bargaining  agreements was 95%, the same level as in  the two previous years 7. In international  operations, such as Canada 8, Australia,  Peru and Norway, employees covered  by collective agreements are those  who opt to be union members. At Vale  Australia, 72% of employees are covered  by collective bargaining agreements. Due  to changes in local legislation, current  individual agreements are being replaced  by collective agreements and a collective  agreement with a three-year duration  was signed in 2011. In 2011, a major development was the  working agenda agreed in Canada 9 with the unions that represent  employees in the country.  Health and safety progress through  working with unions Vale will spare no ef ort to signif cantly  improve health and safety in the  workplace. Fatalities are not acceptable.  The company has adopted a number  of initiatives, and is working to improve  on practices that lead to tangible gains.   These include looking to engage trade  unions on matters of health and safety.  Specif c measures have recently been  adopted which have set the company  on a quest for zero harm. Discussions and engagement with  trade unions encompass the specif c  concerns and views of employees  representatives, which determine  mechanisms and requirements for  preventing incidents and occupational  diseases, such as machinery training,  the provision of personal protective  equipment, regular inspections and  the maintenance of joint health  7 Employees covered by this indicator (LA4)  correspond to  97% (2009), 96% (2010) and 95%  (2011) of total employees reported (LA1). 8 In Vale Canada and its subsidiaries, 78% of  employees were covered by collective bargaining  (in 2010, the proportion was 80% and in 2009, 81%). 9 In 2011, no new strike or lockout was registered.  The strike in Sudbury, Canada ended in July 2010,  although workers at the Voiseys Bay unit only  returned to work at the start of 2011.

The right to  refuse to work in unsafe conditions  is guaranteed and reinforced by  Vales Risk Analysis and Management  Instructions (INS-37). In 2011, two workshops were held with  unions that represent Vale employees  in Brazil, in order to guarantee a  transparent, open working environment  that is conducive to continuous  improvement. The planning  process for 2012 has maintained  and extended this dialogue.  Benef ts Vale of ers a range of benef ts, which  as well as complementing total  remuneration also provide increased  protection and security to employees  and their families. The purpose of these  benef ts is to attract and retain good  professionals in the company workforce.  In 2011, Vale approved and publicized its  Global Standard, which aims to ensure  that these benef ts are of ered on a  consistent basis in all of the dif erent  locations where the company is present.  This standard also aims to implement  the business strategic objectives in each  location, express the principles of the  companys human resources philosophy,  and guarantee that the countrys  legal requirements and local market  conditions are respected.  Vale provides medical insurance and  life insurance to 100% of its employees.  Benef ts such as accident insurance,  private pensions, transportation  allowances, education and training,  meals at work and or/food assistance  and the Employee Assistance Program  are of ered to a signif cant number of  employees (91%).  Pension plans Vale provides its employees with  complementary private pension  plans that aim to ensure they have  an additional income when they  retire, in accordance with the Global  Standard on Benef ts.

In this context, it is essential  for a large company such as Vale,  which is committed to sustainability,  to listen to local communities  and invest in their socioeconomic  development, respecting their needs  and requirements. Vales experience  conf rms that a social license to  operate is as important as an  environmental license, and is a critical  part of enabling the growth of Vales  operations and the development  of a regions communities. Every year, the company strives  to enhance its engagement with  communities and establish transparent  relations that are based on trust. Vale  establishes channels for dialogue,  identif es its impacts (both positive and  negative) and creates action plans to  improve its operations in these locations,  involving investments in health and  safety, education, infrastructure and local  income creation, and the preservation  of ethnic and cultural diversity. Vales presence in a region Vale carries out socio-economic  research and assessments to enhance  its understanding of the regions where  it is present. These assessments identify  the requirements and potential of each  territory and Vales participation in the  regions dynamics. Vale measures the  impacts of its operations using Social  Investment Management Plans  (PGIS, in Portuguese). These assessments have so far been  carried out in operations in Brazil,  Mozambique, Oman, Peru, Guinea,  Liberia, Australia and Indonesia. Based  on these assessments, the table on page  47 shows the main positive and negative  impacts that Vales presence in a region  can lead to.  Air emissions and noise Vale recognizes that its activities  generate emissions of particulate matter,  and noise and vibrations, which could  impact the quality of life of communities  that are close to its operations. The  company is committed to maintaining  these impacts at acceptable levels by  striving for the continuous improvement  of its processes for controlling these  emissions by using more ef  cient  technologies. In 2011, Vale spent US$165  million (16% of its total environmental  spending) in controlling and reducing  its air emissions. The company believes  that doing the right thing  and earning a social  license to operate is of  benef t to itself and also  to its stakeholders in the  community, enabling  prosperity and sustainable  development, in accordance  with the companys Mission GRI Reference Indicator: SO1, EN29 People Communities 45 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Vale has taken a number of steps to  reduce its air emissions, including  establishing a management unit for  air emissions, noise and vibration in  2011. The aim of this unit is to support  projects to control emissions, stimulate  research, develop alternative technologies,  participate in national and international  debates and contribute to the formation  of regulatory mechanisms.  Another important institutional change  in 2011 was the creation by Vale of the  Subcommittee on Air Emissions. This  is designed to facilitate relations and  the exchange of experiences between  corporate and operational areas and  to develop documents that support  the companys strategy for managing  air emissions. These include Vales  Management Standards for Systems (PGS,  in Portuguese), which establish guidelines  for Brazilian operations to manage their  air emissions, and the Global Instruction  of 2012, which will aim to improve the  management of air emissions in all  operational areas, in accordance with the legislation of each country in which  Vale operates. Vale discloses all of its emissions of sulfur  oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and  particulate matter (PM) from stationary  sources. These substances have no  global ef ect but impact on air quality in  operations regions.   The company has implemented a range  of initiatives to optimize its management  and control of particulate matter emissions  from dif use sources, which Vale believes  to be one of its greatest challenges. Vale  has completed the construction of wind  fences 1 in the stock yard at the Tubaro  Complex (Vitria-Esprito Santo), and  has also deployed this technology at its  pelletizing plant in Oman. At these units,  the company has installed equipment that  encloses the structures where material is  transferred from conveyor belts,  reducing dust emissions. Vale is also developing dust-suppressing  equipment in partnership with specialist  companies. This equipment will help reduce  dif use emissions in storing, handling and  transporting material. Case Study Clean AER Project  reduces emissions of SO2  and particulate matter Vale is heavily engaged in reducing its emissions of sulfur  dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter into the atmosphere,  as part of its commitment to people and the planet. As an  example of this commitment, the company is investing in  the Clean Atmospheric Emissions Reduction (AER) project  in Sudbury, in Canada.  With a total investment of US$2 billion, the project aims  to reduce sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from the nickel  smelter by 70%, bringing emissions down to 45,000 metric  tons per year. Thanks to Clean AER, Vales emissions will  be well below the maximum level of 66,000 tons per year  that the Canadian federal and Ontario governments are  establishing for 2015 and beyond. In the last four years, Vale has already invested about  US$100 million in the project in research and technological  innovation. Clean AER will also reduce emissions of dust  and metals by between 35% and 40%. It is expected to be  completed by the end of 2015.  This is one of the largest ever environmental investments in  the history of the province of Ontario, and the largest ever  in Sudbury. In addition to its investment in adapting the  smelter complex, Vale also expects that peak construction  work will employ 1,300 workers. These reductions in emissions are in line with Vales other  actions in its long history in Canada. Since 1970, the  company has worked hard to cut its emissions of SOx,  which have fallen by around 90% in this period.

This is a pioneering project  that uses a dust f lter in a closed  furnace instead of a conventional  gas scrubber. This reduces water  consumption, avoids treating  ef  uent generated, and reduces the  generation of waste in the process.  Dust from the f lter can be handled  easily, compared with the slurry  generated from the gas scrubber. The  estimated investment is US$17 million  and the system is expected to start  operating in 2012. At the companys nickel units  in Sudbury, Canada, the Clean  Atmospheric Emission Reduction (AER)  project is a US$2 billion initiative to  reduce particulate emissions by 40%  and SO2 emissions by 70% by 2015.  Read more in the case study on the  opposite page. Particulate matter, SOx and NOx Total particulate matter emissions  were 9,500 metric tons in 2011,  generated mainly by the pelletizing,  nickel and fertilizer units. This is a 43%  increase from 2010, due mainly to  the increase in pellet production and  the inclusion of the phosphate and  nitrogen fertilizer assets, which were  reported as of 2011.

It aims to support the implementation  of projects, guaranteeing alternatives  for each family and taking into account  the specif c characteristics of each case,  in order to improve and maintain  their quality of life. In accordance with this procedure, in 2011  Vale carried out 93 actions, mostly in Brazil,  involving the various forms of involuntary  relocation: resettlement, relocation with  compensation, or simple compensation.  Resettlement in Mozambique Vale Mozambique has carried out a  resettlement program for families who  The balance of particulate  matter emissions was obtained  by monitoring data on stacks at  operating units and, in certain  cases, through the application of  emission factors calculated based on  operating parameters. Mobile and  dif use sources were not included in  the report, since there is no specif c  and acknowledged methodology for  calculating or measuring them. Environmental Compliance Vale manages environmental  compliance based on continuous  monitoring and assessment. The  search for more agile solutions for  possible occurrences is also ever  present at the company.  Promoting development Vale understands the need not only to  provide support for its operations but  also to contribute to the development of  the regions around them and help these  regions develop an economic life that is  independent of mining.  Vale aims to stimulate the use  of the resources generated by  mining, such as higher tax revenues,  job creation, higher salaries and  household income, to generate  new opportunities in these regions,  ref ecting each regions characteristic  products and services. A major part  of this ef ort is focused on reducing  local def cits in qualif ed workers  and suppliers and diversifying the  local economy. Involuntary relocation The involuntary relocation of  communities is often inevitable in  mining and logistics activities. To  minimize the disruption and negative  impacts in such cases for any families  that are af ected, Vale has established  a document regulating these activities  in Brazil, which is used as a reference  in other regions where the company  operates: its Terms of Reference on  Relocation Processes, which establishes  the processes to be followed to manage  the social impact of involuntary  relocation of families in an economically  vulnerable situation.

This program, which  was based on regular dialogue with the  government and with local communities,  was concluded in 2010 with the  relocation of 1,365 families. Based on various studies, two areas  were chosen to receive the families:  Cateme, a rural area, and 25 de Setembro,  an urban area. The local community was fully  engaged in the process of preparing  the Resettlement Action Plan, with  three public hearings, 20 presentations  in the main local language (Nvungwei),  110 meetings with the community and  its leaders, using illustrated materials  and other aids, as well as 4,927 home  visits for mobilization and social care  (families and leadership) and 639  social services actions, by the start of  the resettlement. As part of the implementation of  the Moatize Coal project, in addition  to the houses that were constructed  in Cateme and in 25 de Setembro,  the following infrastructure was  also provided for the community:  a primary school, a library, houses for  teachers and the school director, a  secondary school, a computer room,  a laboratory, a health and maternity  center, and a police station, as well as  roads and electricity supply. For example, in Cateme, Vale has  constructed two schools that  are administered by the District  Education Department. One of these,  the Cateme Elementary School, has  capacity for about 1,200 children,  with 18 classrooms and a library.  Meanwhile, the Armando Emlio  Guebuza High School has capacity  for about 650 students, with twelve  classrooms, a library and a boarding  house for 270 students, as well as  a computer room and one hectare  that the Model Farm has donated for  classes in horticulture, composting  and processing manioc f our. Vale Mozambique recognizes that  improvements need to be made to the  infrastructure of these new settlements  and it is deeply involved in carrying  out actions to support these families,  in cooperation with governmental  authorities, to meet the needs of the  resettled communities. To respond to the issues that have been  raised, Vale has already begun to repair  homes, maintain drainage systems  and roads, improve the water supply  system and the electricity network and  build sports infrastructure, as well as  investing in health 3 and agriculture 4  and developing solutions to support  public transport. In addition, Vale is also  carrying out actions to help establish  alternative sources of income, such  as poultry and beekeeping, and is  investing in agricultural and  vocational training. Vale Mozambique remains focused  on enhancing its relations with local  authorities and communities and on  continuing with the social investments  it is making to support sustainable  local development. 3 Delivery of the Health Center for 25 de Setembro,  purchase of an ambulance, and infrastructure for  managing HIV/AIDS. 4 Delivery of an additional area for agriculture and  donation of fruit tree saplings and seeds.

The Vale Foundation acts to support  Public Management and Human  Development. There are two elements to  its work with the public sector; training  and technical advice. It acts in the  following areas: Institutional Support – The Foundations  goal is to contribute to modernizing the  administration of the municipalities in the  areas of planning and management, in  order to improve citizen services, update  the land registry, train municipal civil  servants, and other important areas of  local public policy. Urban Planning – The Foundations  goal is to prioritize initiatives that  enhance the capacity of municipalities  to plan integrated actions in housing  and basic sanitation (water supply,  sewage treatment, solid waste  and drainage). In these two areas,  the Vale Foundation carries out the  following actions: housing – Social Interest  Housing Plans: training and  The Vale Foundation The Vale Foundations mission  is to contribute to integrated  economic, social and environmental  development in the regions where Vale  operates, providing and leveraging  social investment, strengthening  communities human capital and  respecting local identities. The strategy of the Vale Foundation is  to make structured social investments  that are aligned with public policies  in partnership with civil society and  with a medium- and long-term  focus. The Vale Foundation is a  leader in establishing public-private  partnerships that serve to maximize  local potential. Public-private social partnerships The Vale Foundations strategy is based  on the concept of public-private  social partnerships. The purpose of public-private  social partnerships is to contribute  to community development by  combining the ef orts, resources  and know-how of governments,  companies and civil society around a  shared vision, generating structured,  sustainable social results in the  medium and long term.

In 2011, seven Brazilian municipalities  benef ted in this area from the  companys actions, which provided  support for the implementation of  projects of the Brazilian governments  Growth Acceleration Program  (PAC, in Portuguese) designed to  improve infrastructure and housing.  In municipalities, 59 projects  were approved and 29  are being  implemented, covering 7,954  housing units (2% of the total for  PAC2 in 2011) and representing an  investment of US$337.5 million (6%  of the total for PAC2 in 2011). In its work in the Human Development  area, the Vale Foundation acts in  the f elds of education, health, sport  and culture. In 2011,  the social programs managed  by the Vale Foundation invested  a total of US$78.3 million.   Social spending In 2011, Vale spent U$457.2 million  in the area of infrastructure, education,  sport, culture, income generation,  health and strengthening of social  capital, including programs of the Vale  Foundation, partnerships with the public  sector, sponsorship and donations in  Brazil and other countries. Of the total  spent in 2011, 89% was voluntary and  11% mandatory. Of the total, US$ 41.2 million  (9%) was spent in infrastructure  improvements, as illustrated in the  chart on the following page.

Local Hiring As part of its commitment to its value  of Improve together, Vale invests in  the capacity building and hiring of local  workers, which contributes to promoting  the socioeconomic development of  the locations where the company is  present. This can also generate benef ts  for the company itself, by reducing the  employee turnover rate.  In 2011, local hiring 5 represented  62% 6 of total hiring within Vale. For  leadership positions, the percentage  was 34%. Both percentages were lower  than in 2010, when they were 79% and  50% respectively.  This decline is due  to the amount of acquisitions made  last year. The companys growth  has led to increased demand for  leaders in specif c areas, while the  regions where the projects are located  are often unable to supply qualif ed  professionals in time for project  implementation. In Mozambique, for example, Vale  develops training programs for local  communities (see the Gateway  programs on the next page for more  information). In this country, the  percentage of locally hired employees  in 2011 was 80.6%, with 27.4% of  senior management coming  from the local community.  Vale recognizes that there is still  much work to be done to promote  signif cant development in the regions  where it operates. The company has  taken on the challenge of respecting  local realities and requirements, while  also identifying and implementing  more ef ective initiatives that ref ect  the specif c needs and vocations  of each region. 5 Although the indicator calculation considers  employees to be local if they were born in the state,  the hiring practice adopted, where applicable,  prioritizes residents of the state, and not necessarily  those merely born there. 6 Employees covered by this indicator (EC7)  correspond to 99% (2011) of total employees  reported (LA1).

GRI Reference Indicators: EC7, EC8 52  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Gateway programs As part of Vales commitment to build  the capacity of the people who work  in its operations, especially in the  communities where Vale is present,  the company has established gateway  programs which consist of a series of  actions and courses with specif c goals,  all focused on vocational training  to prepare people to join the  companys workforce. Since 2008, in partnership with local  institutions, Valer — Vale Education has  been of ering postgraduate to provide  specialist training to graduates, including  the following programs: Recruitment for capital projects  – Applied in Brazil, this program  aims to hire and train engineers  in the labor market to work on  implementing projects, supporting  Vales capital projects. Postgraduate Training in Ports,  Postgraduate Training in Railroad  Engineering, and Specialist Training  in Mining – This program is run in Brazil  and internationally, and aims to develop  engineers and geologists in the regions  where Vale operates, contributing  to supply the specialist professionals  required by the company. The program is  focused on mining, railroads and ports. For the technical/operational  segment, the Vocation Training  Program (PFP, in Portuguese), which  is run by Valer — Vale Education  in partnership with Regional HR  education teams, currently represents  the main gateway into the company  for young people looking for  operational and technical roles. The PFP has been run by Vale  since 2004. Its objective is to train  the workforce and to support  local development by providing  access to education, employment  The Professional Training  Program aims to qualify  the workforce and to  support local development  by providing access to  education, employment  and income Employee on a Vale  train on the Vitria  to Minas railroad,  in Vitria (Esprito  Santo), Brazil 53 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  and income. The program trains  technicians, mechanics and  operators. Its impact on the  communities where Vale operates  has been signif cant, contributing  to an increase of up to 60% in the  household income of participants  during the training process. In 2011 there was a 40.5% increase  in the number of technical and  operational trainees who were trained  by the PFP, with 3,066 participants  compared with 2,182 in 2010.  The proportion of PFP participants  joining Vale in Brazil was 76.9% in the  2011 intake. This percentage represents  the total number of students who  joined the company in 2011 following  the completion of the 2011 classes.  In Rio de Janeiro, one of the  Brazilian states where the program  was implemented, 27 people  participated in the 2011 intake,  with 81% of them joining the  company. This led to the program  being recognized with an award  from the Rio de Janeiro branch  of the Brazilian Association of  Human Resources (ABRH-RJ). The  award commemorates successful  practices in people management  that have had both quantitative and  qualitative results. The program also enabled 75 young  people from Mozambique to come to  Brazil to carry out on-the-job training  in the railroad operations of the  Centro-Atlntica Railroad (FCA). The  PFP was of ered to all Vale technicians  in Mozambique, where the company  is investing in improving the quality  of education in the provinces where  it has operations. Vale acted in  partnership with the government,  with the objective of training  residents of the region.  To address the challenge of growing  while being able to access a qualif ed  pool of labor, Vale fully understands the  importance of investing in vocational  training in the sector.

The  company understands that to meet  this commitment it must listen to  these communities and establish  transparent relations based on trust.  Vale supports projects that maintain  and construct relationships between  the company and local communities.  These include its recent decision to  improve the methodology of its Social  Dialogue initiative. For the company, it is a priority to  increase and deepen the methodology  of its Social Dialogues, which use  communication channels with  communities, enabling them to bring  their concerns and questions to Vales  attention in an increasingly quick and  easy way, which helps to mitigate  possible conf icts. These mechanisms  aim to improve relations between  communities and the company and  also to contribute to Vales social  impact management. A recent successful example of the work  of Social Dialogues is the Reference  Group in the state of Minas Gerais in  Brazil. This is a committee that forms  part of the Social Dialogue initiative and  serves to bring together on a regular  basis representatives from various  company areas, so that topics raised by  the community can be discussed and  analyzed. As of 2012, Vale is managing  its relations with communities using the  Community Relations Management Tool.  This enables the company to monitor the  demands and concerns of communities  and aims to improve its capacity for  responding to communities.  Health and safety in the community Vale believes that healthy and safe  families are essential to a healthy and safe  company, and it always puts life f rst in the  communities where it operates. Find out  more about Vales commitment to health  and safety in the People section of this  report on page 29. To promote health and encourage a  culture of prevention in the communities  where it is present, Vale carries out a range  Case Study Transforming lives  through education Vale understands that education plays a critical part in its  Improve together core value. Shared knowledge can help  transform lives. One example of the power of education  is the Model School project in the Brazilian state of Par,  which aims to contribute to young peoples academic and  professional development. In the Model School Project, students follow the  established curriculum, with regular lessons. Educational  support is also provided for after-school activities. From  the second year, these lessons are complemented with  technical and vocational courses, during which students  receive a study grant, a uniform and educational material,  as well as having their transport and food expenses paid. Each month, Vale meets with participating schools and  students to monitor the project and see how the classes  are progressing and how the students are performing.  There are also extra-curricular activities, such as chats  with Vales managers about the labor market and their  careers. Students also have the opportunity to see how the  company works up close, during visits to Vale facilities.  In 2011, the project benef ted 160 students in  Parauapebas, Cana dos Carajs and Ourilndia do  Norte, all in Brazil. By the start of 2012, this number  had doubled. Through the Model School project, Vale  is contributing to young peoples development and  citizenship, while also guaranteeing the development of  a qualif ed workforce that can work in its businesses or in  other economic activities.

The  Vale Foundation also has a Healthcare  Program in the state of Maranho, Brazil,  which is focusing on improving mothers  and infants health by training health  professionals, educators and community  leaders, through actions coordinated  with local public services, civil society and  higher education institutions.  In addition to prevention campaigns  against HIV/AIDS and other sexually  transmitted diseases, the company also  carries out programs to prevent and  control other sexual health risks, such as  its sexual education program (Vale Youth,  undertaken by the Vale Foundation)  focused on sexual guidance and actions  to prevent STDs. Artisanal and small-scale mining Vale is aware of the importance of  artisanal and small-scale mining, which  provides a signif cant source of work  and income in many countries around  the world. The practice is especially  widespread in gold and diamond  extraction activities. However, Vale has  also identif ed incidents in other mineral  extraction activities, such as copper and  cobalt, either inside company operations  or adjacent to them.  In 2011, evidence of artisanal and/ or small-scale mining was identif ed  near three Vale operations in Indonesia,  Chile and Itabira 7 (Minas Gerais, Brazil).  When the existence of illegal extractive  activities is found near Vale operations,  Vales Human Rights Guide states that the  appropriate action to take is to notify the  government authorities to regulate and  if necessary relocate the activity. This is  because illegal artisanal mining may be  damaging to the economic, social and  environmental development of certain  locations, in addition to increasing risks  to the lives of those who practice it.  It is necessary to establish and  monitor an effective and positive  social agenda, guaranteeing that  we generate a legacy Gleuza Jesu,  Environment Department Director GRI Reference Indicators: MM5, MM8 Prof le: 4.16 Research To study the history, culture  and socioeconomic characteristics of the  traditional communities that live along  the banks of the Capim River in the  northeast of the Brazilian state of Par,  the Vale Technology Institute is carrying  out multidisciplinary research with the  Emlio Goeldi Museum of Par, in the  villages of So Domingos do Capim,  Ipixuna and Aurora do Par. The research  project is studying the vegetation  and f ora of these communities and is  looking at how the local inhabitants use  these plants to support themselves. 56  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Vale aims to engage in dialogue  and have positive relations  with the indigenous  communities that live in areas  near to its operations, so that  there can be common interests  and transparent support for  ethno-development Preservation of  cultural and ethnic identity Vales relations with indigenous  communities are based on the concept  of ethno-development. The company  recognizes the opportunity to respect and  preserve local identities and cultures. Vale acts to prevent, mitigate or  compensate for any possible impacts on  these communities. It is committed to  reaching agreements with indigenous  peoples and to a long-term, integrated  vision of the development of the  traditional communities near its operations,  to help resolve any conf icts and avoid  recourse to legal actions. In 2011, Vales actions benef ted more than  10,000 people from eight dif erent ethnic  groups in Brazil alone.  In 2011, Vale interacted with 21 traditional  communities across all its businesses  including its railroads, complexes and  projects. Of these 21 communities, 12 are  located in Brazil, two in Australia, six in  Canada and one in New Caledonia. Formal  agreements have been established with 15  of these groups 8.

To preserve this heritage, an Educational Heritage  Program is being implemented in partnership with  the Emilio Goeldi Museum of Par (MPEG) and  the Foundation for the Development of Research  (FADESP). The project, which began in 2005, aims to  raise awareness of the archaeological discoveries that  have been made in the Amazon region, as well as to  increase and improve the content that schools teach  about this subject. Another aim is to develop self- sustaining craft practices and train local craftspeople  in ceramics production, inspired by the designs of the  archaeological discoveries.  Residents of the Paulo Fontele village, children and  teenagers from the village of Sanso and a group of  craftspeople from Parauapebas participated in the  workshops. Courses were also given to housewives,  smallholders and teachers and students from local schools.  One result of the program was that a group of  craftswomen from Parauapebas created their own  association, Clay Women, which produces bio-jewelry,  decorative ceramic objects and domestic utensils inspired  by the indigenous designs discovered in the region.  The program has now produced around 2,000 products  and will be wound up in 2012, with the production of a  book, a bilingual catalog of craft products and information  about the local archaeological discoveries, the launch of  the newspaper Dialogue, and an exhibition to showcase  the project and launch the products.

Currently, Vales positioning is included  in two documents: the Good Practice  Guide — Indigenous Peoples and Mining  published by the International Council on  Mining and Metals (ICMM) and an internal  guide for use in engaging the mining  industry and indigenous peoples. A goal of Vales for the coming years is to  support capacity-building and institutional  improvements in the communities that  it supports. This will enable indigenous  peoples to play a greater part in the  management of resources provided by Vale.  For instance, in the environmental licensing  process appropriate methodologies are  needed to carry out impact studies and  to propose joint programs between the  company and communities.

Resources spent on the environmental area In 2011, Vale spent more than US$1 billion  on environmental control and protection,  40% up on the level in 2010. Of this total,  70% (US$721 million) was allocated to  activities in Brazil and US$309 million went  to other countries where Vale operates.  Voluntary spending represented 15% of  this total, with the other 85% used for  costs associated with legal requirements.  Most of the voluntary spending (94%) was  used for environmental management.  2011 2010 2009 580 737 1,030 Environmental expenditure US$ million Resources invested and spent by activity 2011 Total = US$ 1,030 million 2009 2010 2011 Investment 319 461 661 Costs 261 276 369 Total 580 737 1,030 GRI Reference Indicator: EN30 29% 16% 14% 9% 8% 6% 6% 12% 63 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Commitment To reduce greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions by 5%  from their forecast  baseline level in 2020 and  encouraging the supply chain  to follow the same path To invest in renewable  energy sources,  energy eff ciency and  technological innovation 2005 was the year  in which Vale f rst  implemented its GHG  emissions inventory Vales target is  by 2015 to reach a level  of 20% of biodiesel  in the biofuel mixture  used in its Brazilian  operations 17% was the increase, compared  with the previous year, inthe  consumption of biomass,  a renewable fuel  Planet Climate Change  and Energy In 2011, Vale invested approximately  US$10 million in energy ef  ciency  and corporate projects in the f eld  of climate change. In addition, in  2012 the company established a  concrete emissions reduction target,  in order to reinforce its commitment.  The target is for Vale to cut its 2020  forecast emissions by 5%, using  similar methodology to that used  in the sector plans implemented  in the Brazilian National Climate  Change Policy.  Baseline emissions  are calculated using data from  strategic planning at Vale in a  business-as-usual scenario, reaching  33 million metric tons of CO2  equivalent in 2020. The reference  year from which the emissions are  forecast is an average of 2008, 2010  and 2011. 2009 was not included  because emission data were  distorted by the economic crisis. The  methodology used recognizes the  As an energy intensive company  and a coal producer, Vale  recognizes its impacts on climate  change as well as its exposure to  the risks generated by it, whether  these risks are regulatory, economic  (carbon taxation and higher price of  energy) or physical (extreme events  and higher temperatures). These risks  may af ect the companys businesses  and competitiveness. Vale is concerned about the destructive  potential of climate change for the  planet. According to the special report  by the International Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) on the management  of the risks of extreme events and  disasters, impacts are already being  seen, such as the melting of glaciers,  the rise in the sea level, intense rain and  major f ooding. Vale realizes that these  ef ects could af ect the integrity of  ecosystems and the well-being  of populations.  In this context, Vale assumes the  challenge of acting proactively. The  company is working in the area by  evaluating operational risks, minimizing  vulnerabilities and maximizing  opportunities — such as technological  innovation to reduce consumption  of fossil fuels and investment in clean  energy supplies — and developing  strategies for adapting to the risks of  physical impacts.  An ip-rosa tree  in Carajs National  Forest in Brazil,  one of the areas  that Vale helps  to protect 65 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  reality of growing countries and  companies and will allow for  changes to the target if the annual  strategic planning exercise at Vale  results in signif cant changes to  emission forecasts.  Coal Vale recognizes that  producing and burning coal  to generate energy causes  signif cant GHG emissions.  However, coal is a necessary  and important energy source,  and hence the company retains  operations that produce  and use coal. The company  has mechanisms for reducing  methane emissions in coal mines,  and is committed to investing  in carbon capture and storage  research and development  projects, as well as identifying  alternative energy sources. Climate change strategy  In a process that began in 2011 and  was completed in 2012, Vale updated  its Global Climate Change Policy. There  have been signif cant developments  in the topic since the f rst version was  published in 2008, and also major  developments in Vales commitments  and actions. The new Policy includes the  commitment to establish a global target  for reducing the companys emissions.  The Policy reinforces the companys  role in mobilizing its supply chain to  combat climate change in an integrated  way, among other commitments. The  target was established in 2012 (more  information can be found on page 65). The Vale Carbon Program is an integral  part of the companys Corporate Climate  Change Guidelines. It is a set of globally  coordinated actions to promote Vales  GHG emissions reduction strategy  through new technologies and less  carbon-intensive processes. The Program is  based on f ve pillars:  – Strategic evaluation of the impact  of climate change on business,  and capacity building across the  company to operate in the new  competitive environment; GRI Reference Indicator: EC2 Challenges Achieve an overall target to reduce  Greenhouse Gas emissions Invest in clean energy supplies Engage the  value chain Invest in  research and  development  for carbon  capture and  storage projects 66  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Main climate change risks  associated with Vales businesses  Regulatory risks Physical risks Opportunities Revenue  – In 2011, various international  commitments were made. In Brazil, the  National Climate Change Policy was  developed, which included the Mining  Plan and Industry Plan. These plans  may lead to changes in consumption  patterns in the medium term.  – Changes (positive or negative)  in production volumes and  origins, due to regional physical  impacts of climate change.  – Potential impact (positive or  negative) on logistics services due  to changes in production in the  companys areas of inf uence.  – Potential impact (positive or  negative) of higher demand for less  carbon-intensive f nal products,  inf uencing the entire value chain.  – Development of carbon credit projects as  part of the Clean Development Mechanism,  in industrial processes and forest projects.  – Development of carbon credit projects  as part of voluntary carbon markets, in  industrial processes and forest projects.  – Development of projects as part of  Reducing Emissions from Deforestation  and Forest Degradation (REDD). Investment  – It is possible that the company  will need to invest in production  process adaptations.    – Additional investment in  adaptation (of infrastructure) in  the medium and long term.  – Revision of timeframes for implementing  projects due to more frequent  occurrence of extreme climatic events.  – Production of climate change risk analyses  in the development of capital projects.  – Development of new businesses  in renewable energy.  – Research and development to  generate cleaner energy for Vale.  – Development of new forest businesses. Cost  – Potential impacts (positive or  negatives) on costs, depending on how  reduction programs are instituted.  – The introduction of obligatory  emission targets may directly af ect  the companys production.  – Potential imposition of customs tarif s  to prevent countries without taxes from  benef ting from competitive advantages.  – Potential additional demand  for social and environmental  actions in areas of inf uence.  – Additional cost of insurance  for production facilities.  – Potential impact (positive or negative)  on logistics services due to regional  physical impacts of climate change.  – Potential f nancial incentives to  generate cleaner energy.  – Potential for discovery of resources  as yet untapped due to climate  characteristics impeding extraction.  – Energy ef  ciency and GHG  emission reduction projects.  – Better understanding of the topic  may lead to best practices, reducing  the companys costs. This reality is  recognized by Vale through the creation  of its technology institutes, one of  them focused on sustainability.  – Support for and introduction of  initiatives for reducing GHG emissions  and sequestering carbon dioxide;  – Cooperation and partnerships to  research and develop technologies  and implement mitigation and  adaptation measures in the regions  where Vale operates;  – Engagement with governments and the  private sector to monitor and contribute  to the preparation of regulatory  frameworks necessary to respond to  climate change;   – Transparency and continuous  improvement in reporting of emissions.  Recognizing that climate change poses  risks to its businesses, Vale constantly  monitors the most signif cant risk sources,  as shown in the table above. The improvement of climate change  management at Vales businesses and  the execution of mechanisms to reduce  GHG emissions are the companys  main strategies for aligning energy  security with a low-carbon economy.  In part, this approach is a response to  the imminent expansion in its energy  consumption that will take place  as new operations come on line  and existing ones are expanded. Since 2005, Vale has been tracking  its emissions prof le through its  GHG inventory, enabling it to create  strategies and plans to follow a  development model based on a  low-carbon economy. 67 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  In 2011, Vales total GHG emissions,  def ned as the sum of its scope 1 1  and scope 2 2 emissions, were 16.9  million metric tons of CO2 equivalent 3,  15% down on 2010 values, as shown  in the chart to the right. The reduction in total absolute  emissions is basically due to the sale  of Vales aluminum operations and  the closure of its Carajs Pig Iron  unit. Alumina and primary aluminum  production represented approximately  30% of Vales total emissions. The main inclusions in the scope of the  2011 emissions inventory were the start- up of a new pelletizing plant in Oman,  the beginning of ferronickel production  in Par (Ona Puma), Brazil, the start of  phosphate production in Bayovar, Peru,  and expansion of Vales f eet of ships,  used to transport its products.  Making a comparative analysis  between Vales GHG emissions in  2011 and its recalculated emissions  for the base year 4 of 2010 5, total  GHG emissions increased, due to  the fact that the company achieved  record output in iron ore, pellets  and coal. The higher emissions  were directly associated with  higher consumption of fuels and  inputs in industrial processes. Approximately 62% of Vales total  emissions result from the use  of fuels for energy purposes (in  mining activities and internal  transportation in mines, logistics  services, thermal electricity  generation, steam production,  and heating of furnaces), 28% are  generated in industrial processes,  1  Scope 1: an organizations direct emissions,  encompassing emissions from fuel use and  production processes.  2  Scope 2: an organizations indirect emissions,  encompassing emissions from the purchase of  electricity and steam used in the production process. 3  CO2 equivalent: unit for measuring greenhouse  gas emissions, converting all types of GHG based on  their potential contribution to global warming.  4  The base year is the reference year for a consistent  comparison of GHG emissions over time, ref ecting  signif cant structural or methodological changes, such  as, for example, acquisitions, mergers and divestments. 5  Excluding emissions from discontinued  operations and including new investments and  sources of emissions.

Of the 28% of Vales emissions resulting  from industrial processes, pellet and  nickel production stand out. The chart  on page 68 shows a breakdown of the  companys total emissions (scopes 1  and 2) by type of source. The companys activities consume  a large quantity of renewable  electric power, as the majority of its  operations are located in Brazil, where  approximately 85% of electricity is  produced from renewable sources.  This is ref ected in low indirect  emissions (scope 2).  In line with the fourth pillar of the  Carbon Program, for the second  consecutive year Vale expanded  its inventory of other indirect  emissions (scope 3), which includes  its supply chain, as shown in the  chart on this page. With the publication of the f nal  version of the document Corporate  Supply Chain (Scope 3) Accounting  and Reporting Standard, new  scope 3 categories were included  in Vales inventory and the scope of  existing categories was considerably  expanded. The most important  categories in Vales supply chain are: I  the processing of products, in  this case iron ore and manganese  in the steel industry; II  the purchase of materials  and services, in this case the  purchase of process inputs; and; III  the purchase of energy inputs  related to the use of fuels. In addition to emissions management,  the companys strategy also includes  raising awareness and engagement in  its value chain, focusing on its suppliers.  Building on its work in 2010 to  diagnose GHG emission management,  in 2011 Vale trained 83 Latin American  suppliers, enabling them to produce  their own high-quality, secure and  robust GHG emission inventories (see  more in the case study on page 72).  2009 0.6 2010 91.2 2011 308.7 Indirect GHG emissions II Scope 3 — million metric tons of CO2e  Processing of iron ore  Purchasing of materials and services  Purchasing of energy inputs  Use of Vale products — thermal coal  Use of Vale products — fertilizers  Mobile sources used  Others III Processing of ore  77% Iron ore 73% Manganese  3% Nickel 1% Sources of indirect GHG emissions in 2011 Scope 3 — Total: 308.7 million metric tons of CO2e  77% 5% 2% 1% 6% 9% II The increases ref ect the  consecutive extensions to the scope  of the inventory of other indirect  emissions, covering Vales value chain. III There were no signif cant emissions  from theOthers item, whichrefers to  the categories of acquisitions of capital  goods, processing cobalt and copper,  businesstravel, losses from the electricity  network and mobile sources used. 69  In 2012, a new initiative is planned to track  the evolution of each supplier and share best  practices. It is expected that this initiative  will allow Vale to expand and improve the  quality of its indirect emissions management. The company continues to support the  joint mobilization of sector organizations,  governments and companies in the pursuit  of solutions to climate change. In 2011, Vale  participated in the development of the  Brazilian mining sectors plan to reduce GHG  emissions, together with the Ministry of  Mines and Energy and the Brazilian Mining  Institute (Ibram), among other groups.  It also participated in business working  groups run by institutions such as the  Brazilian Business Council for Sustainable  Development (CEBDS), the Ethos Institute,  the Getulio Vargas Foundation, and the  International Council on Mining and  Metals (ICMM), to produce studies and  research, including a study on adapting to  climate change conducted by the CEBDS  Energy and Climate Thematic Group.  On the path to  a low-carbon economy Vale is contributing to the promotion  of sustainable development,  and seeking to participate in a  low-carbon economy by structuring  projects to reduce GHG emissions  and capture CO2 in its operations.  In this area, important projects  were developed in 2011. More  information can be found in the  S11D and Carnalita: innovation  and technology case study, on  page 76, and other initiatives  included in the online report.  The Action Plan on Sustainability (PAS)  also establishes annual targets for the  specif c reduction of fuel and electricity  consumption. Both of these reductions  contribute to reducing Vales GHG  emissions from the burning of fuel  and from certain sources of electricity.  More information about the PAS can  be found on page 16. GRI Reference Indicators: EN3, EN4, EN18 Our rail operations are  major consumers of fuel, and  we need to invest in technology  and in the diversif cation of  our energy supplies Humberto Freitas,  Executive Off cer of Logistics  and Mineral Exploration 70  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Energy management As described on page 68, 62% of  Vales total emissions results from  the use of fuels for energy purposes.  Although there was a decline in  consumption in 2011, management  of this resource is becoming  increasingly necessary as the  company expects its demand for  energy to rise in the coming years.  For this reason, the company is working  to ensure reliable energy supplies at  a competitive cost, making projects  feasible while conserving the resources  and respecting the energy policies in  the countries where it operates. Vales strategy is to invest in its own  generation facilities, seeking specif c  energy solutions for each operation,  including the adjustment and  reinforcement of infrastructure in  each region. This initiative generates  benef ts for both Vale and its  locations, guaranteeing expansion  in energy generation capacity and  promoting economic and social  development in the regions where  the company operates. Energy consumption Due to the ending of some electric  power-intensive activities such as  aluminum production, Vales direct  energy consumption in 2011 (fuel  supplies) was approximately 10% lower  than in 2010, amounting to 179,000 TJ, as  shown in the chart above. However, on a comparative basis using a  base year(excluding the ef ect of the sale of  the aluminum business), fuel consumption  increased. For example, thermal coal  consumption increased by 53% following  the start of operations at the pelletizing  plant in Oman and the start of ferronickel  production at Ona Puma. In addition,  natural gas consumption increased by 30%,  also because of the start of operations in  Oman and the increased use of gas at the  nickel ref nery in Japan. Approximately 8% of total direct energy  consumed was accounted for by renewable  sources. Among renewable fuels, there  was a 17% increase in biomass use and a  13% rise in pure biodiesel (B100) use, while  consumption of B10 diesel rose six-fold  from 2010 due to higher demand at El  Hatillo coal mine, in Colombia.

Under the program, Vale is encouraging its suppliers to  build their own capacity to establish an emissions inventory  at their companies. The initiative aims to help them to f nd  new ways of improving their emissions management, to  carry out mitigating actions and improve any actions that  they already undertake. In 2011, the year in which the project began, 138 strategic  suppliers in Latin America were invited to participate  in the training and training was provided to 83 of these  suppliers. In 2012, suppliers from other continents will  be invited to join the program. The action is linked to the Vale Carbon Program, part of the  companys Corporate Guidelines on Climate Change and  Carbon and which includes dif erent actions to help global  climate change mitigation. Indirect energy consumption  (purchase of electricity and steam)  in 2011 was 12.4 TWh, around 35%  down on 2010, once more inf uenced  by the sale of the aluminum and  alumina businesses. Innovations in energy ef  ciency In order to f nd a balance between  energy security and climate change,  some important initiatives are  under way at Vale. These include  the mapping and implementation  of opportunities to reduce energy  consumption, both at existing  operations and in capital projects; the  development of energy consumption  information tools; the revision and  production of technical documents  focused on rational energy use; and  training for technical energy ef  ciency  groups at operations.  Guaranteeing operations energy  supplies is one of the main strategies  for the continuity of Vales businesses.  As a result, the company is investing  in its own generation, ef  ciency and  diversif cation of energy sources, with the  aim of expanding the share of demand  supplied by renewable sources and  thereby cutting GHG emissions. For example, in Clydach in the United  Kingdom, a project is underway to  use domestic waste to generate  approximately 10 MW of electricity  through pyrolysis (the decomposition  of waste at high temperatures).  Authors of  the case study:  Vivian Mac Knight,  Cristina Matos,  Miranda Braga and  Laura Albuquerque 72  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  In its actions Vale aims to reach a balance between  the need for energy security  and the mitigation of the  effects of climate change Although the plants average demand is  expected to rise from 4.5 MW to  5.3 MW, it will generate surplus power,  to be sold on the local market. It is  expected that the project will be  completed in 2012.  Diversif cation of energy supplies Vale has invested in energy generation  technology research, development  and innovation, focusing on  improving ef  ciency, reducing costs  and minimizing GHG emissions. As  shown in the Consolidated energy  sources chart above, 20% of Vales  direct and indirect energy supplies  come from renewable sources. The  company aims to extend its use  of clean energy sources such as  hydroelectricity, wind, biomass, solar,  and biofuels. The company is currently  evaluating projects in these areas.  In 2011, four of Estreito Hydroelectric  Plants eight generating units started  operating in the state of Maranho in  Brazil, with installed capacity of 1,087  MW, meeting some of Vales power  demand in the North of the country.  Vale has a 30% stake in the consortium  administering the project. In July 2011  in Indonesia, the Karebbe hydroelectric  plant, with installed capacity of 130  MW also began operating to supply  part of the demand from Vales nickel  operations in the country. Another share of Vales power demand  will be met as of the f rst half of 2015,  GRI Reference Indicator: EN7 20% 80% Consolidated  energy sources Total = 224 thousand TJ (2011) Renewable 20% Acquired electricity — renewable I 14% Hydroelectric 4% Biomass 1% Biodiesel (B100) and ethanol 1%  Non-renewable 80% Diesel 22% Natural gas 16% Fuel oil 12% Mineral coal 9% Shipping fuels II 6% Acquired electricity — others III 6% Others IV 9% I Hydroelectric and biomass.

In 2011, Vale acquired control of  Biopalma da Amaznia S.A, a company with which it had  formed a consortium the previous year to produce the  main raw material used to make biodiesel, palm oil.  Vales decision to invest in biodiesel production is part of  its strategy to diversify its energy sources and be a global  sustainability agent. From an environmental point of view,  this project will permit a reduction in greenhouse gas  emissions while restoring impacted areas. Through this transaction, Vale ended up with a 70%  interest in the company, which will be responsible for  planting 80,000 hectares of palm trees in the Moju, Tom- Au, Abaetetuba, Acar and Concrdia regions in the state  of Par, including 20,000 hectares of family-run farms, with  2,000 families expected to be participating by 2013.  In 2011, the total planted area stood at 35,000 hectares,  and the goal is to reach 60,000 hectares of plantations  by the end of 2012 and 80,000 hectares in 2013. These  activities are taking place in important parts of the  Amazon biome, which were previously used for pasture  before being abandoned. As well as recovering these areas by planting palm  trees, more than 70,000 hectares will be allocated for  legally required native forest cover and permanent  preservation areas. The companys investment in the sustainable  production of palm oil and biodiesel has already  received international recognition. At the start of 2012,  Vale was awarded the Sustainable Biofuels award by  World Biofuels Markets. when the Belo Monte Hydroelectric  Plant will begin operating in the  state of Par in Brazil. Why does the Belo Monte  Hydroelectric Power Plant  make sense to Vale?  Vales growth strategy calls for  investments in power generation  projects, such as participating in  the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Power  Plant. Vale is aware that the project  has caused adverse reactions with  regard to its social and environmental  impacts, and the well-being of the  indigenous communities in the  region during the construction and  operational stages. Vale believes  that the project will leave a positive  legacy for the region. Vale is acting  proactively, based on best practices,  particularly concerning issues related  to sustainability. According to the Brazilian  governments Ten-Year Energy  Expansion Plan (PDEE-EPE), the  countrys demand for electricity is  expected to grow at an average  rate of 4.7% per year over the next  decade, from the current level of 59  GW to 88 GW in 2020. The Brazilian power grid is largely  supplied by hydroelectric dams  (80%), complemented by thermal  plants, wind power and biomass.  Out of all the available energy  sources for generating electricity,  A palm tree  plantation for the  production of  biodiesel in Brazil 74  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Vale is contributing its  experience in major  projects to the Belo Monte  hydroelectric plant hydroelectric power of ers the most  favorable conditions for meeting  the socioeconomic growth forecast  for the coming years, in terms of  cost (economic competitiveness),  environmental feasibility, low  greenhouse gas emissions, and  supply reliability. Vales investment in electricity  generating assets, such as its  acquisition of a stake in the Belo Monte  hydroelectric power plant, is consistent  with its status as a major electric power  consumer and its growth strategy. It  also ref ects Vales commitment to  contribute to the development of  the countries where it is present, and  supports Brazils commitment to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions. Building the Belo Monte  Hydroelectric Power Plant will add  an average of 4,571 MW of power  to Brazils grid, enough energy to  supply 40% of the countrys entire  residential demand. It is therefore  a fundamental project for the  national energy expansion policy,  playing a major role in making  electricity available to Brazilian  society in the coming years while  satisfying the requirement for low  tarif s and energy security. Controversy surrounding  the project Vale recognizes that its decision to  invest in hydroelectric power plants  has provoked adverse reactions with  regard to its impacts on the region.  Before joining the project, the company  made a thorough analysis of its  Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)  and Report and Basic Environmental  Plan to be sure that Belo Monte is a  sustainable project in all aspects. The set of impacts gave rise to a wide- ranging Environmental Management  Program, divided into plans, programs  and projects, derived from expert  opinions and license conditions, with  the following objectives:  – Compliance with the expectations  of shareholders, employees, the local  community and society as a whole, in  the sense of minimizing the impacts  associated with implementing the  project, keeping these stakeholders  continuously informed, with  the proper transparency, of the  results achieved regarding the  treatment of these impacts; The great opportunity for Vale is  to invest in energy, in projects in  renewable energy, energy eff ciency  and technological innovation Joo Coral,  Global Director of Energy 75 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Sustainable projects S11D and Carnalita: innovation and technology Vales application of innovation and technology to mineral  production at two new projects, Carajs Iron S11D, in the  Brazilian state of Par, and Carnalita, in Sergipe, another  Brazilian state, ref ects the companys passion for people  and the planet. The S11D Project, which will increase iron production  at Carajs by up to 90 million metric tons per year, has  been designed from the start with a focus on conserving  biodiversity and preserving the social structures of the local  communities located where the project takes place. The  project will relocate a processing plant and waste rock to  an area that has already been impacted by human activity  and that lies outside the Carajs National Forest where the  mineral resources are located.  The initiative will enable a completely dry process for  processing the mineral, leading to a 93% reduction in water  consumption when compared with conventional processes.   In addition, 86% of the water used will be reused. Mining  operations will not feature trucks, but rather a truckless  system using in-pit crushing and conveying technology.  The replacement of trucks by conveyor belts will lead to a  signif cant reduction in diesel consumption and emissions  of particulate matter and will reduce the generation of  waste such as tires, f lters, lubricants and other items. This  system will reduce GHG emissions by around 118,000 metric  tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The Carnalita project for the production of potassium  chlorate, located in Sergipe, is expected to produce 1.2  million metric tons per year of potassium chlorate, with  operations due to begin in 2016.  The project will be constructed in an area of numerous  sugar cane plantations and so will have no impact on native  vegetation and will not require any families to be resettled.  It will also be self-suf  cient in electricity generation and  will use sea water so that it will not need to withdraw fresh  water from the local aquifer.  – Sustainable development and  the use of renewable natural  resources in the region where the  Belo Monte project is being built,  paying continuous attention to  the identif ed maximum capacity  of these resources in the light of  new demands created directly or  indirectly by the project;  – Protection of human health, cultural  heritage and biodiversity, the latter  including endangered species and  sensitive ecosystems;   – Respect for the lifestyles and non- material heritage of local people,  especially those who live in the  projects directly af ected area and  area of direct inf uence, and with  special emphasis on traditional and  indigenous communities;  – Strengthening of the projects  public image and reputation as a  result of proactive action to achieve  continuous improvement in the  quality of environmental attributes of  the ecosystems in the region, and in  the social attributes of those involved  in implementing the project and  those af ected. What Vale adds to the project Since 1995, Vale has invested more than  US$1.3 billion in electricity generation  in Brazil. The company now has nine  hydroelectric power plants and four  small hydroelectric power facilities in  operation to meet its demand for  electric power in Brazil. Vale is also  developing a number of wind farms  and biomass projects. In the last six years, Vale has invested  more than US$80 billion in projects  in its dif erent business areas,  developing a modern governance  and capital project implementation  management system. By deciding to use its experience,  especially that of building and operating  21 hydroelectric power plants across  the world, Vales aims to contribute to  the successful execution of the project,  guaranteeing the returns that society,  shareholders and partners expect from  such an investment. 76  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Energy production by Vale With regard to direct energy  consumed by Vale in 2011,  approximately 7 TWh were  generated by Vales own  hydroelectric plants (in Brazil,  Canada and Indonesia) and thermal  plants located in isolated units.  Vale generated 49% of its power  needs in Brazil, 96% of which came  from hydroelectric plants. Although the company is already a  signif cant user of renewable sources,  it recognizes its fundamental role  in actively pursuing greater use of  clean energy sources. Accordingly,  Vale is working to replace diesel with  biodiesel in its operations. In Brazil,  the target is to raise the share of  biodiesel used in biofuel blends from  around 5% now to 20% in 2015. Vale  has a 70% stake in Biopalma (see the  case study on page 74), a company  in Par, Brazil that processes palm oil  used to produce biodiesel. + online content More information about the  topics covered in this chapter can be found in the  online version of the 2011 Sustainability Report  www.vale.com/rs2011 The hydroelectric  plant of Karebbe,  in Indonesia, which  supplies energy for  Vales operations in  the country Vale recognizes  its major role  in actively  searching to  increase the  use of cleaner  sources  of energy 77 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Commitment To use water resources in a sustainable manner,  guaranteeing their  conservation, protection  and quality 1.5 Vale saves 953 billion liters  of water per year, equivalent  to around 1.5 times the  annual consumption of the  city of Rio de Janeiro, by  reusing water in its processes The Water Resources  Sub-committee  exchanges information  about water use  and best practices The f ow monitoring  plan identif es opportunities  to optimize water use and  to improve systems that  use and measure water  Planet Water Water resources are extremely  important inputs to Vales  processes. The company also  recognizes waters importance to  community subsistence. Accordingly,  Vale seeks to optimize water use by  reducing operational demand, reusing  water, and minimizing the generation  of ef  uents. In addition, the company  aims to understand and anticipate  potential water use conf icts through  forecasts, technological development,  and engagement and awareness raising  with key stakeholders.  The heaviest usages of water in Vales  operations 1 are in the dewatering  activities for mining operations in  saturated areas 2; in plants, where the  water is used to treat the minerals and  for cooling; and in the cleaning and  spraying of access roads and stockyards  of raw materials and products. Water  is also used in pelletizing processes,  ore transportation, and the washing of  equipment and components. Guidelines Vale recognizes the need to create  tools to promote ef ective water  management and, in 2011, it formulated  its Water Resources Instruction, which  are currently in the approval phase. The  company has established principles and  guidelines on the subject, and has def ned  responsibilities and the main tools and  structures required to properly manage  water resources, in line with international  regulations and technical references.  Besides the Instruction, the company  has a further 15 specif c documents  designed to provide orientation,  applicable to operational units. The aforementioned Instruction were the  result of joint work by Vales Environmental  Leadership Committee (known by Portugues  acronym CLA) and Water Resources  Sub-Committee. The CLA is composed  of representative leaders of company  departments (corporate and operational)  who meet periodically to discuss relevant,  high-priority environmental issues. Created in 2011, the sub-committee is  composed of representatives of various  company business areas who are  responsible for  the topic of water in their  respective areas. Reporting to the CLA  and holding meetings every two months,  the sub-committee is a forum for the  exchange of information on water use and  best practices, assisting the development  of corporate guidelines. In 2011, Vale invested approximately  US$90 million in water resource  management, which represents  around 9% of its total environmental  investment, including technological  1 All operations are licensed and have a water  withdrawal permit. 2 Hydrological zones in which all interstices (narrow  spaces) between geological material particles or all  cracks, fractures or dissolution channels in a unit of  consolidated rock are f lled with water at pressure  greater than the atmospheric pressure.

Research The Vale Technology  Institute, in partnership with  the Federal University of Minas  Gerais, is undertaking a project  to optimize water quality  monitoring in the So Francisco  River watershed. Using statistical  methods, this research aims to  assess trends in water quality  parameters and to propose a  methodology for collecting and  analyzing water quality data.  Vale also runs education initiatives  for both internal and external  stakeholders to raise awareness  and promote better use of  water resources. One example is  Environmental Attitude, a program  that aims to promote sustainability  principles through educational  actions designed for the internal  public (employees and contractors),  as well as communities and schools  close to the companys operations.  One of Environmental Attitudes  main themes is water. Water use monitoring During the project development  stage, water availability studies are  performed, taking into consideration  other users, in order to contribute  and guarantee conservation of  water resources. In 2011, Vales Water  Resource area revised the water usage  controls and f ow monitoring plan  for operational units 3 that are heavy  water users and/or located in water- stressed regions. 4 This plan also aimed to identify  opportunities to optimize water use  and reassess f ow measuring points  in order to verify the need to make  technical adjustments, replace  equipment and install new meters  at strategic points. innovation initiatives, diagnostic projects  and equipment. Since 2011, Vale has  had a corporate management area  dedicated to the theme, which is active  at all Vale units, developing guidelines  and conducting technology studies to  improve processes and practices. Engagement and  environmental education Vale seeks to work actively in discussion  forums about water resource  management and the establishment of  practices together with the community.  In Brazil, where concern for the topic  is demonstrated in the National  Water Resource Policy, the company  participates in discussion groups related  to organizations such as the National  Water Resource Councils Technical  Chambers and the River Watersheds  Committees for the Paraopeba, Velhas,  Doce, Piranga, Piracicaba and Santo  Antnio rivers, all located in areas where  Vale has operations. These committees  hold dialogues and seek to identify  risks associated with competition for  water use and availability. Notable  results of Vales work in this area include  3 Presents better details and more reliability of the  reported information. 4 High demand in relation to the production  capacity of water sources may generate a scenario  of competition for water use. Challenges Guarantee harmonious  coexistence with other  stakeholders in water use Reduce demand for  new water at the  operations, using  new or current  technologies GRI Reference Indicators: EN9 80  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  As a result of this diagnosis, the  corporate area has produced  projects to establish assumptions  and concepts that may be  developed by operational areas,  tailored to the needs of each unit.  Based on this survey, Vale has  produced projects to install and  adjust f ow meters in the units of  Carajs, So Lus and Vitria. In 2012,  there are plans to do the same work  for units in Itabiritos, Paraopeba and  Mangans do Azul in Brazil. In So Luis, water meters have been  installed at around 90% of the main  water consumption and monitoring  points in the Central Plant area. This  investment enabled a detailed analysis  of water collection and consumption.  In addition, the unit of So Lus now  has a continuous monitoring system,  enabling improvements in the water  management of large consuming  areas. This ensures rational use without  wastage and the achievement of  targets for fresh water use indicators. Through better understanding of the  quantity of water used and reused,  it has also become possible for 16  operational areas to adopt water  consumption reduction targets, and  for nine areas to adopt targets to  expand water recirculation. These  targets were included in the 2011  Action Plan on Sustainability (PAS).  Read more about the PAS in the  Strategic Vision section on page 16. Case Study Reusing water Vale is constructing new industrial facilities in Carajs,  including the Additional 40 Mtpa Project which will  intensify production in the companys so-called North  System in Brazil, which includes the units of Carajs, the  Carajs Railroad and the Port of So Lus. These construction works are applying sustainable  practices to the use of natural resources, such as  water reuse and recycling. In particular, the company is reusing the water that it uses  for producing concrete and for washing its concrete mixer  trucks, which are water-intensive activities. The water that is used to wash the trucks is full of  sediments and f ows into a decantation tank where the  recycling process begins divided into six sections. When  the clean water leaves the tank, it is then used in the  production of the concrete that is required to construct  new facilities at the site, and then to wash the trucks  again. Hence, 100% of the water used to clean the trucks  is reused. Vale invested US$24,000 in the system, which  involves ramps, tanks, pumps, piping and storage tanks  made from f ber. 20,000 liters of water are required to produce 100 cubic  meters of concrete. By the end of the project in 2013, 96,000  cubic meters of concrete will have been produced, which  will require 19.2 million liters of water. Vale estimates that  it will reuse 8.4 million liters of water during the construction  process, i.e. 44% of the total water required. In 2011 alone,  some 3.2 million cubic meters of water were saved thanks to  the reuse of water in the concrete production process. Authors of the case  study: Fernanda  Carneiro Neves and  Leno Brabo  81 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Optimizing water use Regarding the projects that identify  opportunities to optimize water  use, six operations in Brazil and one  in Peru were studied in 2011. As a  result of this initiative, which began  in 2010, plans were developed for 12  operational units in dif erent business  areas (iron mining and processing,  pelletizing and ports, manganese  mining and processing, and fertilizer  mining and processing). These plans  cover the companys most critical and  representative operations, including  locations with low water availability  such as Peru, for example. The projects  will generate estimated water savings  of 7.3 million cubic meters per year  (1.7% of all water withdrawn by Vale  in 2011) and will require an estimated  investment of US$5.8 million. Withdrawal,  reuse and discharge The change in reporting scope  (following the sale of aluminum  assets and the incorporation of units  not previously reported, such as Vale  Fertilizantes) had a signif cant impact  on the water use indicators for 2011.  Considering the common scope for  the reports of 2010 and 2011 (without  aluminum assets and incorporated  units in the indicator), there was an  increase in the total water demand  of 5%, while generation of ef  uents  expanded by 16%. This variation is due  to a rise in production at the majority of  operational units and greater reporting  coverage of some areas that have  improved their monitoring processes.  Part of the increase in water demand  was supplied by reused water. 2011 2010 2009 Total water withdrawn by source Billion liters/year 292.4 294.3 420.6 2009 2010 2011 Ground source 115.2 112.3 101.0 Surface source 128.7 132.2 251.1 Others I 48.5 49.8 68.6 Total 292.4 294.3 420.6 I Captured rain water, piped water supplied by water  companies and water from other organizations.

Hence the  value is dif erent from the value presented in the graph that  records total water withdrawn per type of withdrawal. 2009 2010 2011 Recycled and/or  reused water 913 (76%) 998 (79%) 953 (70%) Withdrawn  water 288 (24%) 269 (21%) 400 (30%) Total 1,201 1,267 1,353 1,201 1,267 1,353 GRI Reference Indicators: EN8, EN10 EN21, EN25 82  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  In 2011, analyzing the full scope, Vale  reused 70% of the water it consumed  in its production processes. As a result  of this saving, Vale did not need to  withdraw 953 billion liters of water  from natural sources. The greatest contributor to the fall in the  companys water reuse percentage was  the sale of the aluminum units, which had  a reuse rate of 92.3%. This accounted for  a seven-percentage-point decline out of  a total decline of nine percentage points  (from 79% to 70%). Regarding the generation of ef  uents,  it should be noted that the incorporation  into the 2011 reporting scope of new  business areas (Vale Fertilizantes) and  operations (Vale Colombia, Port of San  Nicols, Transbarge Navegacion, the  Vargem Grande plant, Taiwan Nickel  Ref ning, Vale Japan, and Bayovar), which  have dif erent characteristics of generation,  played a major part in the increase in  the total volume of ef  uents generated,  especially in the increase in ef  uents that  did not require treatment. This increase in the volume of ef  uents  also resulted in an increase in the total  suspended solids load.  Despite the increase in total volume, most  ef  uents are treated in comprehensive  physical and chemical systems that  improve their quality before discharge,  reducing any impacts on the bodies of  water that receive them. + online content More information about the  topics covered in this chapter can be found in the  online version of the 2011 Sustainability Report  www.vale.com/rs2011 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2009 114.0 76.1 109.2 2009 2010 2011 Industrial liquid  ef  uents  102.5 64.2 84.1 Oily liquid ef  uents 1.5 0.9 0.7 Liquid ef  uents without  need for treatment I 10.1 11.1 24.4 Total 114.0 76.1 109.2 Total discharge of liquid eff uents  generated by destination  % 2009 2010 2011 Oceans 10% 19% 14% Rivers, reservoirs and  tailings ponds  85% 76% 77% Others II 4% 5% 9% 1,298.8 787.6 1,032.3 Total volume of liquid eff uents  generated by type Billion liters I Liquid ef  uents without need for treatment  refers to water used in cooling and other  processes whose qualitative characteristics  are not altered to the extent that it requires  treatment before disposal.

The focus is on supporting these  regions and involving dif erent local  stakeholders in the theme. The company operates in parts of  the world where there are signif cant  reserves of natural forests. Although  vegetation removal is part of mining  activities in many cases, the company  recognizes the need to work  continuously to minimize impacts.  Vale compensates for this removal  via legally instituted or voluntary  mechanisms and by acting proactively  as an agent for the conservation of  biodiversity, and not only in the regions  where it operates. This is ref ected in  the fact that Vale protects or helps to  protect an area that is 3.5 times larger  than the area occupied by its operations,  which are often located in areas that  have already been impacted by human  activity or are used for industrial  purposes (see more on page 88).  Vale understands that this is a  challenging, long-term commitment.  As a result, it is focusing its ef orts to  enhance engagement with relevant  stakeholders, such as governments,  specialist institutions and  communities, seeking to inf uence  regional government alignment  through sustainability targets. Vale  believes that this will not only  enhance its local presence, but  also benef t its relationships with  various players, reinforcing trust  among communities. With regard to engagement with  stakeholders, the Vale Fund operates in  partnership with public institutions and  third sector organizations to promote  sustainable regional development. The projects supported by the  Vale Fund have helped to reduce  deforestation in the Amazon through  actions such as strategic monitoring  of the biome, assistance for the  development of sustainable municipal  economies (green municipalities)  and support for the conservation  of protected areas and biodiversity.  These projects contributed to a 40%  Planet Land use 1 When the results of actions conducted by  the company outweigh the negative ef ects of  their operations.

It also seeks to engage its  internal and external stakeholders  in these ef orts and develop  partnerships with them. Impacts Vales operations have impacts on  the regions where they are based,  resulting in changes to biodiversity  and ecosystem services.  These  impacts are intrinsic to the type  of activity performed by the  company, and are mainly related to  changes in physical environmental  components, which support  living beings. These impacts alter  the quality of the environment,  and may af ect local biodiversity,  especially indirectly. Signif cant direct impacts on  biodiversity are especially related  to removal of vegetation, which  may be necessary in the project  implementation phase and/or  during operational activities (such as  expanding areas to be mined).  Area impacted and restored Including the operations for which  Vale is responsible, the total area  reduction in the deforestation rate  in the Brazilian state of Par between  2009 and 2011. The area of forest  saved by this reduction during this  period was 1,000 km2 in size. For  more information about the Vale  Fund, see the online report or visit  www.fundovale.org.  Biodiversity Vale recognizes that biodiversity  and ecosystem services play a  fundamental role in the equilibrium  of the planet. Respecting them  is a company obligation. Conserving and using biodiversity  and ecosystem services sustainably  is essential to Vales business  continuity, as various processes  depend on products and/or  services supplied by these, such  as water and energy. They are  also essential to the quality of  life of the communities that live  near operations. Consequently,  the company aims to set the  benchmark in the mining sector for  the management and sustainable  use of the resources of the regions  where it operates. To achieve this goal, Vale invests in  technological innovation, establishes  Vale is a Brazilian company with  a global presence. Our guidelines for sustainable  development strive to share the value created  by our activities with the communities where  we operate, with the countries where we are  present and with all of society Jos Carlos Martins,  Executive Off cer of Ferrous and Strategy GRI Reference Indicators: EN12, EN13, EN14 86  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  af ected by the company in 2011 was  17.2 km. During the year, restoration  activities were started in a total area  of 25.2 km. These activities involved  both permanent restoration (29%  of the total area) and temporary  restoration (71%). Unlike in 2009 and 2010, the total  area undergoing permanent or  temporary restoration in 2011  was larger than the total area  impacted during the year. In 2011,  Vale invested US$64 million in  the restoration of degraded areas,  representing 6% of the companys  total environmental spending.  Opening and  closing balance In 2011, counting only mineral  extraction and production activities,  15.1 km2 of land were impacted  on the other hand, permanent  restoration activities were started  on 7.3 km2, resulting in a f nal  balance of 592.6 km2.  The opening balance in 2011  was lower than the f nal  balance of the previous year  due to the sale of assets related  to aluminum operations,  corresponding to 157.1 km of  areas to be restored by Vale.

The term undergoing restoration denotes  areas in which such activities have been initiated and are in progress (initial  restoration of certain ecosystem functions and gradual increase in species,  with the aim of returning the vegetation to as close to its original state as  possible). Undergoing permanent restoration corresponds to areas that will no  longer be af ected by the companys activities, while undergoing temporary  restoration covers areas that may be used again in operational activities. 87 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Innovation  To help minimize  the impact of mining on the  landscape, soil and vegetation, the  Vale Technology Institute is working  in partnership with the Federal  University of Viosa, in Minas Gerais,  Brazil on a research project that is  assessing the potential for using  tropical grasses for re-vegetation.  These species have been chosen  because they are very hardy and  fast-growing. This will enable  a natural ecological process to  start working at decommissioned  extractive areas and at deposits of  waste rock or tailings.   The Vale Technology Institute  and the Federal University  of Par are implementing a  research project into carbon  sequestration and the recovery  of deforested mangrove biomes  on the Ajuruteua peninsula in  Bragana, Par. The main aim of  the project is to restore degraded  areas of the mangrove swamp,  while involving the local riverside  communities and raising their  environmental awareness.

They contribute to the maintenance  of ecosystems, protecting and making  available natural resources on which  communities livelihoods and societys  economic growth depend. Nature reserves protect the sources  of the water resources that supply  cities and, in many cases, contribute  to the reservoirs of hydroelectric  plants, thereby participating in the  energy generation process; they  protect the soil against erosion  and degradation; they help to  maintain carbon stocks; they protect  remnants of native vegetation from  deforestation and its consequences  (such as emissions of greenhouse  gases); and they are home to  endangered animal and plant  species and the areas where they  reproduce (birds nests and f sh  nurseries, for example).  These areas are also often  important sources of plants with  medicinal and pharmacological  properties, as well as other  products of economic interest  (f bers, timber, resins, etc.),  contributing to the generation  of benef ts for the community.  All of these factors contribute,  directly or indirectly, to the  diversif cation and development  of the local economy, enabling  other activities such as tourism  and the sustainable use of naturally  sourced products 2.

This plan includes  a series of actions that will reduce the impact of mining  operations and contribute to the recovery of the mined area.  For four consecutive years, the initiative has been recognized  with the award by the government of Indonesia for the best  mine rehabilitation program. The plan could also serve as a  benchmark for other Vale recovery programs around the world.  A key part of the plan is to ensure that the company  optimizes its land disposal process, paying particular  attention to water run-of  issues and making sure that  Vale disposes of the most fertile soil it excavates into areas  that are being recovered and replanted. By applying soil  management and controlling the erosion and re-vegetation  process, the initiative is helping reduce the amount of earth  that is eroded, and also ensuring that the vegetation that is  planted in these areas will grow at a more appropriate rate,  from three to f ve years following the use of the land.   In addition, Vale maintains a nursery which has the capacity  for more than 700,000 trees, which will be used to replant the  land with native and multi-purpose tree species. Vales investment in the recovery of mined areas in  Indonesia was US$8.9 million in 2010 and 2011. As a result,  in 2011 about 200 hectares (2km2) of land was restored with  the planting of native vegetation, which is the same level as  was achieved in 2010.  The program is also focused on the mines environmental  and social legacy, and aims to ensure that once mining  operations in the region have been concluded, there will still  be opportunities for job and income creation. Vale currently protects nearly 13,700 km2  of natural areas, including conservation  units in partnership with local  governments (97%) and sites belonging  to the company (3%). This total is 3.5  times larger than Vales operational areas,  which cover 3,900 km2 in all. The areas protected by Vale include  regions in the Amazon Rainforest  (64%), Atlantic Forest (25%), Wallacea  (9%), Cerrado (2%), Boreal Forest  (<1%) and New Caledonia (<0.1%)  biomes. The company believes in  the importance of protected areas  for the conservation of species and  ecosystems, as well as the ecosystem  services provided by them.  Operational areas In 2011, the operational units for  which Vale was responsible covered  3,846 km2 3, representing an area smaller  than the Carajs National Forest in Par,  Brazil, which covers 4,119 km, and  which Vale helps to protect. Of this  total 3,846 km area, 99.5% is related to  surface operations and 0.5% relates to  underground operating units. Of the companys total operational  area, 4% is located within legally  protected areas (conservation units)  and 43% is located in areas of high  biodiversity value (outside protected  areas)  as def ned by the governments  2 Activities carried out inside protected areas  depend on the type of operation that is permitted,  which is def ned according to the protection  category for each unit. 3 In 2011, improvements were made to data  collection procedures (greater precision in the  delimitation of operational units and preparation of  geo-referenced data), and the criteria for including  future projects were adjusted (units are now only  included if they have received a construction license).

Despite this, in many cases  the companys operations were  established in locations that had  already been environmentally and  biologically altered by previous human  activities (such as timber extraction and  cattle raising), or that were exclusively  designated for industrial activities (such  as municipal industrial zones). This  applies to all types of Vales operations,  especially its industrial forests, which  are entirely located in previously  altered areas. The area occupied by this  activity represent around 70% of the  total operational area for which Vale is  responsible.  Regardless of each areas initial state  of conservation, Vale plans and  implements its operations to minimize  environmental impacts, and conducts  parallel environmental initiatives to  make a positive contribution to the  of each country. Considering  operations adjacent 5 to sensitive  areas, about 10% of the total  operational area is associated with  legally protected areas and 8% is  related to areas of high biodiversity  value as def ned nationally 6. The areas reported are used for mineral  extraction, industrial production  activities (processing), and product  transportation (railroads and ports),  as well as operations related to the  planting of industrial forests. Inactive  operational units in the Ferrous  Metals Area, the Simandou Iron  Project and bio-energy plantations  (Biopalma) were included in the 2011  reporting scope. Due to the sale of  the aluminum operations, the data  for these operations are no longer  considered in the 2011 report. A large proportion of the regions  where Vale operates is classif ed as  of special natural importance in a  global context. In all, 3,586 km2 of  Vales operational areas are located in  hotspots or wilderness areas 7. This is  equivalent to 93% of the total area of  the companys operations. Hotspots include operations in the  Cerrado (Brazil), East African Coastal  Forest (Mozambique), Forests  of Guinea (Guinea), Atlantic Forest  (Brazil) and Wallacea (Indonesia)  biomes, as well as areas in Japan and  New Caledonia (16% of Vales total  operational area is located in hotspots).  4 Functions performed by ecosystems  and species, permitting living conditions  on the planet to be maintained, including  the provision of support and regulatory  resources and services. 5 To calculate adjacent area, a buf er  zone measuring 10 km from the external  boundaries of protected areas and areas  of high biodiversity value was considered,  and its overlap with operational units was  assessed. When an operating unit was  associated with more than one protected  area or area of high biodiversity value, the  overlapping buf er zone was considered.  Areas related to indigenous lands were not  considered in this analysis. 6 Estimated data. 7 Hotspots and wilderness areas are  large geographical areas considered to  be important for world f ora and fauna  conservation. They are complementary  categories of biodiversity importance, and are  of  cially recognized by various international  organizations. Hotspots are more endangered  areas with high biological value for the planet  and a large number of endemic vascular  plants reduced to no more than 30% of their  original vegetation coverage. Wilderness areas,  in turn, are large areas of land (over 1 million  hectares each) with representative biodiversity  where there is little change or are unchanged  (wild areas), with over 70% of their original  coverage intact and human density lower  than or equal to f ve people per km2. Commitment Contribute to the conservation and  sustainable use of biodiversity and  ecosystem services4, promoting  engagement with communities,  governments and stakeholders GRI Reference Indicator: EN12 90  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Case Study Ecological blankets When it is recovering areas that have been degraded  because of its mining operations in Corumb and Carajs  (in the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso do Sul and Par,  respectively), Vale uses ecological blankets, also known  as bio-blankets. These are made 100% out of natural f bers  from coconut and the herbaceous plant taboa, woven into  large degradable nets using cotton and polypropylene. These actions are designed to mitigate environmental and  socioeconomic impacts in the regions. They ensure that  the earth remains stable and that vegetation can return  to near the state that it was in before these extractive  activities began. The covering reduces the possibility of  erosion and makes the location more stable, so that seeds  can germinate, the new vegetation can establish itself, and  sediments are not washed into bodies of water. The project in Corumb is being carried out in a  partnership with the Federal University of Mato Grosso  do Sul (UFMS) and with the riverside community of the  Cervejaria neighborhood in Corumb. Community teams  from the neighborhood have been trained in how to  produce and use the new kind of nets and in how to  handle the plant species.  In Carajs, the bio-blankets have been applied at a  distance of 35 km from the town center of Parauapebas,  on the border with the municipality of Marab (Par,  Brazil). The bio-blankets work together with the  sediment retention structures and materials for the  rapid growth of the plants. They also contribute to the  income of the community that lives by the rivers by the  Furnas Project, as well as resolving water use problems  in the local community.   The application of this technology could also be replicated  in other regions where the conservation of water  resources and the recovery of vegetation are required. maintenance and conservation of local  biodiversity. The company is reinforcing  its respect for biodiversity, recognizes its  impacts and is committed to acting in  line with its values. As a member of the International Council  on Mining and Metals (ICMM), Vale  has pledged not to begin to explore  areas classif ed by UNESCO as World  Heritage Sites and governed by the 1972  Convention Concerning the Protection of  the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.  These sites of outstanding global  importance are no-go areas for Vale. Biodiversity management plans The company deems it necessary  to conduct biodiversity management  actions at all its operations that have  negative impacts on species  and ecosystem services. Together,  these actions form each units  Biodiversity Management Plan  and are def ned for each unit  individually and in accordance  with their unique characteristics.  Targets To strengthen its  commitment to biodiversity  conservation and the sustainable  use of natural resources, in 2011,  Vale began a study of methodologies  for measuring the impact of  its operations. By analyzing and  weighting the negative and  positive ef ects of its activities on  biodiversity and ecosystem services,  the company will transparently  and consciously assume a global  positioning based on targets, so  that its operations have a net  positive impact. In 2012, the plan  is to determine the methodology  to be applied to all Vale. Governance  and engagement Vale recognizes the complexity  of the biodiversity topic and,  more specif cally, the issue of  environmental restoration, which  is fundamental to its ef orts to  minimize the main direct impacts  of mining on species, ecosystem  services and territory. In 2011, the  company established a management  area dedicated exclusively to  Authors of the case study —  Team in Corumb: Anderson  Polarini, Marcia Hindi, Jane  de Arruda, Cinthia Maria  Pereira, Benjamina Sorrilha  de Moraes, Marconi dos  Anjos, Rosilene Silva, Tlio  Nascimento (above).

When conducting its activities, Vale  follows government regulations  prevailing in the countries where  it operates and produces internal  requirements, adopting Brazilian  legislation as the operating  parameter in countries where  there are no specif c regulations  or if these are less restrictive.  Actions in 2011 To help it determine its biodiversity  strategy, in 2011, Vale and the  Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable  Development (FBDS) conducted  an engagement and consultation  action involving the companys  strategic stakeholders, including  representatives of Brazilian and  other organizations.  As a result of this initiative, Vale  identif ed gaps and opportunities for  action, above all concerning the need  to improve the communication of  initiatives under way and to maintain  clarity as to their impacts. Another important initiative in 2011,  conducted in partnership with  Conservao Internacional do Brasil  (CI-Brasil), was the development of  the Integrated Management Plan  for the Private Reserves of Natural  Heritage maintained by Vale in the Iron  Quadrangle region of Minas Gerais,  Brazil. The main aim of this plan was to  develop a strategy for the integrated  environmental management of  the reserves, in order to maximize  synergies between them and their  interaction with their surroundings,  strengthening their contribution to  biodiversity conservation. The plan  was designed for a f ve-year period  beginning in 2012. A third initiative in 2011, in partnership  with Accenture, was the development  of a Master Plan for a Biodiversity  Conservation Education and Research  Center at the Vale Natural Reserve in  environmental restoration of  mined and degraded areas. This  area has the objectives of producing  standards, establishing indicators,  conducting research, and looking  for and reporting best practices in  environmental restoration at Vale.  Besides ef ectively incorporating  the biodiversity theme in the  Environmental Management  System (EMS), a specif c global  regulatory document is being  prepared to guide biodiversity  management at Vale. This standard  is in the validation stage, and one  of the main targets for 2012 is to  approve it for global application.  The document sets out the  companys biodiversity management  strategy and, as a premise, highlights  the importance of the sustainable  use of natural resources, based  on f ve guidelines:  – Knowledge of the biodiversity  and ecosystem services present  in areas of interest and locations  where Vale operates;   – Evaluation, prevention, control  and minimization of operations  risks and impacts af ecting  biodiversity and ecosystem;  – Continuous monitoring of  operations ef ects on biodiversity  and ecosystem services;  Challenges Minimize land  use impacts Conserve and  restore areas 92  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  and aims for continuous improvements in  its processes and actions. In 2002, for example, on completion of  the Environmental Impact Assessment  at one of the units, concerns were raised  about the environmental programs  that were proposed. In response,  various independent governmental  organizations, such as the Institute  National de LEnvironnement Industriel et  des Risques (INERIS), the Centre Europen  de Recherche et dEnseignement des  Gosciences et de lEnvironnement  (CEREGE) and the French Environment  Ministry undertook their own  complementary studies.  These assessments resulted in a further 50  additional recommendations that have  been implemented by the company  and that VNC is currently monitoring  and analyzing, ensuring continuous  improvement in the companys  management of the environment and  of local biodiversity. For example, the  company has built a sediment basin in  the northern tributary of the Kwe River to  prevent soil from being washed into this  river, which f ows into the Merlet Reserve,  as happened in 2006. Engagement with local stakeholders 9  forms a major part of VNCs social and  environmental management program.  There is a framework that structures  this process, as ref ected in the Pact for  Sustainable Development of the Great  South that the company signed in 2008.  The Pact provides for an indigenous  consultative committee for the  environment and a corporate foundation  which is investing in social, cultural,  environmental and economic projects in  the region. It also includes a reforestation  program that aims to recover sites that are  relevant to the local community.  These activities are carried out with  the participation of representatives  from local indigenous communities  Linhares, Esprito Santo, Brazil. The  plans objective is to better develop  and strengthen the Reserves  vocation. The document establishes  the Centers concept, mission, values  and objectives, def nes its operating  scope in education and research,  and sets guidelines for management  and the establishment of national  and international partnerships.  Implementation of the Center at the  Vale Natural Reserve will start in 2012. In 2011, Vale continued its  partnerships for the environmental  rehabilitation of areas of importance  to biodiversity conservation and  local communities.  Respecting biodiversity  in New Caledonia Vale Nouvelle-Caledonie (VNC) or Vale  New Caledonia 8 is located in the South  Province of the territory and is home to  an ecosystem of unique biodiversity. In  recognition of the natural importance of  this region, this province is the location for  one of the World Heritage Sites established  by Unesco, Lagoons of New Caledonia:  Reef Diversity and Associated Ecosystems.  Vales operations are located next to this  area and are administered in a way that  is compatible with maintaining the value  that has made the site a World Heritage  Site. Vale is acting in accordance with the  commitments it has assumed at the ICMM  8 Since 2006 Vale has held a majority stake in this  company, although  operations started in the region  in 1969. 9 The local environmental authorities for South  Province, LObservatoire de lenvironnement en  Nouvelle-Caldonie (OEIL), the Biodiversity Conservation  Convention, and the Mines and Energy Department of  New Caledonia (DIMENC). Aerial view of Carajs  National Forest, in  the state of Par,  Brazil, one of the  areas which Vale  helps to protect 93 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  positive relations is a two-way process  and, in this endeavor, the company  counts on the participation of all  those interested in favorable results  for the planet and people.  Mine closure Vale understands that from the  moment a mining project is planned,  one should start to establish guidelines  for closing it, although the mine itself  may operate for decades. This is due to the fact that the ending  of activities at a mine is associated  with potential social, environmental  and economic impacts that must be  identif ed and evaluated in advance.  Actions need to be planned to  enable the ef ective mitigation of  impacts and construct a positive  legacy in the region.  All of the planning work for a mining  project should incorporate the concept  of the future use of the mined area,  considering the regions potential  and vocations, the sustainable use of  resources, protection of environmental  quality, and local and regional  socioeconomic trends.  To guide this process, Vale has a  set of principles and procedures in  force, some of which are expressed  in its Sustainable Development  Policy. The Mine Closure Guide and  Terms of Reference for Producing  Mine Closure Plans are important  references for the theme. The f rst,  which is more conceptual, contains  guidelines and best practices  adopted by Vale, to orientate the  professionals directly or indirectly  involved with the theme; the  second presents the content that  needs to be included in a mine  closure plan, serving to support  company units. The company has Asset  Demobilization Procedures and  Criteria for Financial Outlays,  which guide calculations of  cost estimates for closing  mines. The estimated values for  provisions are revised annually  and presented in the companys  f nancial statements. In 2011, the  that live next to the operations,  public administration and  non-governmental organizations  such as Rhb N, to ensure a  coherent integration of the project.  This process of engagement ref ects  VNCs commitment to understanding  local needs and expectations and to  providing transparent information  about its performance in questions  related to sustainability. Dialogue  is helping to establish increasingly  respectful and trusting relations,  supporting the companys positive  results in the region and strengthening  its social license to operate.  Land use conf icts In 2011, Vale was involved in 23 cases  considered signif cant due to the fact  that they involved lawsuits (nine cases)  or involved shutdowns of projects and  operations or the blocking of access  to them (14 cases). Vale recognizes  the challenge of f nding solutions that  meet the needs of both the company  and communities, and seeks to base its  actions on respect. The company regrets these conf icts  and has strived to establish more  ef ective communications with  society in general, as presented in the  Overview section. The construction of  GRI Reference Indicators: EN12, MM6 MM7, MM10 Aerial view of  Vales operations  at Voiseys Bay in  Canada 94  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Case Study Mine closure in Canada  The closure of a mine can have major long-term  impacts on the environment, on people and on the  company involved. Vale is very aware of this and  at the Sudbury complex in Canada the company is  working side by side with the local community in  the decommissioning of mining operations and the  monitoring of reclaimed areas in Sudbury.  When Vale acquired Inco in 2006, it became responsible for  numerous properties. Two of these properties, Whistle Mine  in the Sudbury area and the Shebandowan mine in North  Western Ontario, were entering the decommissioning stage.  Portions of the Copper Clif  Smelter slag pile were also  being discontinued, a project that was implemented while  the site continued to operate. Vale undertook various surveys and analyzed all the  alternatives in partnership with the local government,  environmental experts and indigenous communities  in the region to prepare for the decommissioning of  the two mines.  The Whistle and Shebandowan closed mine sites will  be monitored for the next 15 to 20 years. In 2011, the  companys work consisted essentially of collecting soil  and water samples, for monitoring data and carrying out  safety inspections. The recovery of the Smelter slag pile will  continue for the next f ve to seven years.  In 2011, Vale invested more than US$10 million in these  projects, recovering 994 hectares of land. During the  process for decommissioning the Whistle mine site regular  meetings were held with the community, including  representatives of the Wahnapitae First Nations who live  about three kilometers from the mine. As a result of this process of dialogue, the original plan  has been modif ed to respond to the concern of local  communities that the mining sites should return as much  as possible to their original pre-mine state.  estimated amount for provisions  to demobilize Vales assets was  US$1.77 billion. According to the  data on environmental spending  (see p.63), US$82 million was spent  on mine closure initiatives.  The perception of the dimensions of  a closure operation has evolved over  time within the company. With the  development of closure plans for all  mines, they have become important  management tools, making it  possible to generate alternative  options to be implemented over  the lifecycle of a mine to minimize  the risks of negative impacts and  maximize the local potentialities of  communities and the region.  For operations in Brazil, the multi-year  target plan envisaged completing  closure plans by 2013. In the case  of mines in other areas where Vale  operates, procedures produced for  operations in Brazil are adapted to  meet dif erent legislative requirements.  As a result, an evaluation is under way  at Vale to develop an international  standard covering the dif erent  situations faced by the companys  operations across the world,  contributing to the generation  of positive legacies for society by  promoting sustainability. Tailings and waste In 2011, Vale spent US$298 million  (29% of its total environmental  expenditure) in tailings dams, dikes  and waste rock piles, and US$61  million (6% of total environmental  expenditure) in non-mineral waste, in  order to reduce its impacts related to  the generation and disposal of both  types of waste.  Vale is working to reduce the amount  of non-mineral waste generated  by its activities. Part of this material  may also be recycled, making it  possible to add value to it and create  opportunities to generate income  for surrounding communities. Waste  of mineral and metallurgical origin,  such as tailings, waste rock and slag,  has dif erent characteristics and is  treated in specif c ways. Authors of the case  study: Lisa Lanteigne  and Quentin Smith 95 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Mining and mineral  processing waste The generation of mineral waste  such as tailings and waste rock is  intrinsic to mining activities and  occurs because the extraction of  minerals entails the removal of  mineral materials which are not  used. They are disposed of in tailings  dams (containing tailings, water and  sediments) and piles of waste rock  and ore. Vale also has metallurgical  operations in its manganese and  nickel businesses, in which waste  rock is generated and is then  disposed of in piles. Vale carries out projects to  reuse tailings and slag in other  industrial processes, such as the  production of cement, ceramics  and other aggregates. The systematization of information  provided by the Tailings Dams  and Piles Management System  (SGBP), implemented in 2009, has  enabled the consolidation of  data on geotechnical structures,  creating business risk indicators  and spreadsheets for operational  and corporate areas. The SGBP is  an important online management  tool, aiding decision making about  investments in new structures and  strategies for raising production.  The management of tailings dams and  waste rock piles includes a corporate  technical safety audit every three  years. In 2011, the fourth phase of  corporate audits took place, covering  Vale Brazils existing 241 tailings dams  and 173 waste rock piles, reaf  rming  its commitment to safe facilities and to  environmental controls. In addition to  the technical audits, the management  process is assessed periodically  through specif c audits of compliance  with Sarbanes-Oxley Act control  requirements.  In 2011, there was an increase of  approximately 19% in the generation  of tailings and waste rock, to 867  million metric tons, due to a rise in  production. Specif cally in terms of  iron ore, the amount of waste rock  generated fell by 13% per unit of  Case Study Innovating to  retrieve iron ore  Vale is committed to reducing the environmental impacts  of its activities in the regions where it operates, and is  investing in technology that enables it to use ultraf ne  iron particles that are deposited in the tailings dams in  Carajs following iron processing. The company uses this  technology in two tailings dams in the Carajs mining  complex in Parauapebas, in southeastern Par, Brazil. The initiative aims to retrieve the sediments and waste  that are generated during processes and which contain  iron content. Deploying innovative technology, Vale  is now able to reprocess this material and incorporate  it into its mineral production. Besides the f nancial  benef ts, this technology is also reducing the impact of  mining on the environment, as it reduces the amount of  waste sent to tailings dams. The process of retrieving the iron ore from the tailings  dam is a simple, low cost procedure, which does not  generate waste and which basically uses a f oating  dredging device to collect the material, which is then  stored temporarily in containment structures where  excess water is removed, before being sent to a sifting  station to separate organic material. In the Geladinho  tailings dam in Carajs, over two million metric tons of  iron ore have been recovered in this way. At the Mina do Azul manganese operation, the tailings  dam is a certif ed reserve of 4.5 million metric tons of  manganese particles with average content of 23.5% ROM  (run of mine, before processing), of which 0.2 million  metric tons of f ne particles have already been recovered.  International mine consultants Pincock & Runge certif ed  the company as the f rst mine in Brazil to have its tailings  dam of  cially recognized as a mineral reserve. In total,  approximately 2.5 million metric tons of f ne particles have  already been reprocessed.

Continuous improvement in the  productivity of iron ore processing  plants has generated greater ore  recovery from tailings in some of  Vales tailings ponds. With regard to slag generated  in metallurgical processes, the  company has been working to  develop new applications in areas  such as construction, paving and  the fertilizer industry.  Non-mineral waste Mining activity also generates  non-mineral waste. As in the case of  mineral waste, Vale is committed to  reducing the amount of non-mineral  waste it creates, and seeks to add value  to this material. The management strategy is to invest  in improving processes, recovery, reuse  and recycling, guaranteeing proper  disposal to achieve the objective  of maintaining the integrity of the  environment and the quality of life of  the communities near Vales operations.  In order to add value to waste, Vale  sees the opportunity to encourage the  development of the local economy,  generating employment and income by  reusing and recycling these materials. To encourage recycling and to reduce  the amount of hazardous waste  generated, all business areas in Brazil,  except Fertilizers, had targets to increase  the percentage of waste recycled and  reduce the quantity of hazardous waste  generated in 2011, as part of the Action  Plan on Sustainability (PAS).  Projects implemented by  Vale aim to make it possible to  reuse mining waste as  raw materials in other  industrial processes 2011 2010 Total ore and  metallurgic waste Million metric tons 598 726 867 2009 2010 2011 Iron ore Tailings 53 75 67 Iron ore Waste rocks 360 461 401 Other business  areas I 185 190 399 Total 598 726 867 I Including waste rock and tailings from nickel,  potash, manganese, coal and copper mines, as well  as slag (manganese alloy), red clay (alumina) and  Spent Pot Liner (aluminum). 2009 GRI Reference Indicator: MM3 97 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  88% 12% Generation of waste Total = 686,000 metric tons (2011) Non-hazardous (604,000 metric tons) 88% Miscellaneous  (e.g. electrical and electronic waste, wiring, PPE) 25% Metallic 21% Household waste 11% Sand, crushed stone and rubbish 10% Wood 6% Rubber and tires 3% Other non-hazardous waste 12% Hazardous (82,000 metric tons) 12% Sludge 6% Oil, grease and waste contaminated  by oil and grease 1% Other hazardous waste 5% GRI Reference Indicator: EN22 98  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Case Study Generating value  from waste At Vales nickel ref nery in Clydach in the United  Kingdom, a waste reduction project has leveraged  the engagement of the companys employees and  their innovation to deliver signif cant results. In 2011,  85% of all waste produced at the ref nery, including  hazardous waste, was recovered or recycled. The  ref nerys target is for 100% of its waste to be reused,  recycled, or used to produce renewable energy  within the next f ve years.  The initiative has reduced the disposal of waste in  landf ll or other sites, stimulated the local economy  and raised the environmental awareness of company  employees. Any waste material of value is sold, leading  to an average annual income of 55,000 pounds, or  about 88,000 dollars. This money is then invested in  maintenance of the ref nerys waste treatment unit.  In 2011, 60% of the maintenance costs of this unit were  paid for out of this income.  The Clydach ref nery has been operating since 1902.  It is located in a small village of the same name, about  300 km west of London, and has around 200 employees  and 100 contractors. The business unit is certif ed  for ISO 14001 and 9001 and OHSAS 18001, and has  adopted a strategy of continuous improvement in the  waste management area, in accordance with Vales  values of economic and environmental responsibility.   Before the project began in 2009, waste was separated  into four types: metal, wood, special and general. To  improve the system for managing the waste from nickel  production, changes were required. The company  decided to involve all its employees in this ef ort, using  the support of a specialist consultancy to help train  employees and change the culture at the ref nery.  The 70% target for recycling, in relation  to the total quantity disposed of, was  surpassed. A waste recycling rate of  73% was achieved, demonstrating  the development of joint work by the  companys operational service areas.  Of the operational departments with  targets for reducing the amount of  hazardous waste generated, around  80% achieved them. Regions with logistics problems and  a lack of waste disposal technology  present the greatest challenges in waste  management. This requires investment  by Vale in proper storage, transportation  optimization, technological development  and, above all, the construction of local  partnerships in line with local cultures  and standards of development. To tackle its main risks and dif  culties,  the company is active in research,  environmental education, the  development of technology projects,  and the construction of partnerships,  thereby helping to create new  business chains. Vale supports its suppliers to conduct  research of ering technological solutions  for waste management, which also  contributes to income creation and  the generation of local jobs. Projects to  make use of materials seek symbiosis  with other industries so that waste can  also be used as raw materials. Non-hazardous and  hazardous waste In 2011, Vale generated a total of 686,000  metric tons of waste: 88% of which was  non-hazardous and 12% hazardous. The  iron and nickel businesses generated  the most waste, accounting for  approximately 75% of the total.  Author of the case  study: PaulDavies 99 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Only considering units present in  the scope of the 2010 report, there  was an increase of approximately 48% in  waste generation. The main reasons for  this increase were a signif cant increase  in waste generation in the nickel  business through the incorporation  of new waste-generating processes,  and growth in waste generation  inherent to higher output. The expansion in the scope of  the report, with the entry of data  on operations in Mozambique, Peru,  Oman and New Caledonia, as well as  Vale Fertilizantes units in Brazil, also  contributed to the increase.  On the other hand, the iron  and manganese areas, the main  generators of hazardous waste at  Vale, did not produce more waste,  despite an increase in ore production,  implying a rise in the usage of this  material. About 99% of the hazardous  waste generated by the manganese  area is related to dust and slurry  generated in the systems of dust  collectors and gas scrubbers used to  control emissions.  The main generating units of hazardous  waste are Vale Manganese Norway and  Vale Manganse France, due to the  dif erent methodologies used to classify  waste in Brazilian legislation.  As in previous years, the waste  disposal prof le continues to  prioritize recycling and use  of materials. Approximately  40% of disposal takes place  in landf lls/piles.  Spills In 2011, eight occurrences involving  spills of hazardous products were  recorded. They were classif ed as critical  accidents 10, in line with Vales relevance  matrix. Compared with 2009 (f ve  spills) and 2010 (no spills), there was an  increase in this type of occurrence.  As spills can damage the  environment, the company has  ef ective emergency response plans.  All units acted to remediate the  impacts of these eight occurrences  and to investigate them, in order to  avoid further spills. All procedures  were followed, legislation was  complied with, and there was no  irreversible damage.  10 Signif cant spills as def ned by the GRI  correspond to the def nition of critical accident used  by Vale, i.e., accidents that go beyond the property  boundary of an operational unit and have a residual  impact on the environment and/or health and safety,  inside or outside the operational unit, after the  completion of mitigation procedures.

In Carajs, an innovative ore  screening process is used. Once  extracted, the ore is screened, adding  value to the dif erent products arising  from this process. In order to screen  iron ore, the use of water has always  been fundamental. However, a new  technology developed entirely by  Vale enables screening to take place  using the materials own moisture.  Besides cutting water consumption  by the equivalent of that used by  a city of 430,000 inhabitants (19.7  billion liters per year), the technology  also reduces power consumption  by more than 18,000 MW per year  and means that tailings dams do not  have to be built. In terms of controlling and reducing  the toxicity of production inputs,  Vale, in accordance with legislation,  does not use substances classif ed  as persistent organic pollutants —  which do not break down in the  environment — or that contain  more than a certain concentration  of benzene. The company also  follows guidelines prohibiting the  use of substances whose acute or  chronic toxicity test results exceed  specif ed values.  In addition, Vale works on  technological innovation,  seeking alternative ways of  reducing mineral and industrial  waste through studies on using  ore f nes from tailings, and utilizing  cleaner, more ef  cient energy  sources, among other initiatives. A concrete example of this is  provided in Moatize, Mozambique,  where waste from coal mines will be  used to generate electricity, which  will power Vales operations while  also contributing to improving  energy security and supplying local  people with energy. Prevention Vales business areas employ  pollution prevention principles  in operational processes by  implementing an integrated  strategy. Mass and energy are  measured in operations to  identify signif cant environmental  aspects involved and to quantify  losses through the generation  of wastes and emissions. Based on this approach, the  company replaces raw materials  and inputs, ref nes technological  processes, establishes best practices  for manufacturing, and proposes  + online content More information about the  topics covered in this chapter can be found in the  online version of the 2011 Sustainability Report  www.vale.com/rs2011 The priorities in waste  management continue to  be reducing the amount of  hazardous waste generated,  maximizing the reuse of waste  at Vale units, and minimizing  disposal in the ground 101 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  In this chapter Value chain Development of local suppliers Customers Value added 86% the share of local  suppliers in  purchases at Vale Creating Value The challenge of  being a transforming  company  Commitment To promote the sustainability  agenda among suppliers  and customers. In  particular, this means not  condoning violations  of human rights in the  value chain and promoting  the development of  suppliers in the regions  where Vale operates. 380 US$ 418.1 mn the number of  companies trained by  the Inove program since  its creation in 2008 the total loans and  f nancing provided by  the Inove program in the  last three years US$18 billion GRI Reference Indicators: HR1, HR6, HR7 the amount that Vale  invested in 2011  Creating value Value chain Vale depends on its supply chain  and customers. The challenge  lies in replicating the companys  sustainability agenda among these  stakeholders, especially on subjects  related to child and slave labor, as well  as environmental issues. As a global  company, Vale has the opportunity  to help spread best practices,  strengthening the process of change  in pursuit of sustainable development.  Guided by its policies on Human  Rights and Sustainable Development,  Vale seeks to establish relations with  suppliers, partners and customers that  share the same principles and values,  promoting awareness and practice  of human rights, and continually  improving evaluations of violation  risks. The company recognizes this  major challenge and knows that it has  not yet achieved its main objective,  which is to ensure that all parts  of the chain are engaged with the  sustainable development agenda.  Consequently, Vale is committed to  proactively taking measures  in order to strengthen its role as  a transformational agent. With regard to child labor, exposure  of young people to hazardous work,  and incidents of forced labor or labor  similar to slavery, Vales internal risk  may be considered non-existent. For  more details, see the Human Rights  section of the Strategic Vision. There  is, however, a greater possibility of  these risks occurring in the companys  value chain, specif cally in certain  sectors such as charcoal and pig  iron production in Brazil, which are  recognized as being critical sectors  in relation to this subject. To prevent these risks, Vale  constantly evaluates its suppliers  and customers contracts and  situation. Since 2008, the company  has included clauses in contracts  with clients in Brazil allowing it to  terminate iron ore supply contracts if  there is evidence of non-compliance  with obligations relating to  environmental protection,  and the  non-use of child labor or slave labor. In terms of analyses of merger  processes and new acquisitions 1,  social aspects are of extreme relevance  to the taking of strategic decisions,  considering possible social risks  and impacts. The themes analyzed  include the following: commitment to  human rights and analysis of possible  1 In all cases of acquisitions in 2011  (whether or not they went ahead), human  rights issues were evaluated. Employees at  the Maritime  Terminal of Tubaro,  Vitria (Esprito  Santo), Brazil 105 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  violations; resettlement processes;  identif cation of nearby indigenous  peoples; social impacts generated  by operations; and the focus of  social investments. All of Vales operations conduct  systematic risk analyses for child  labor and young people exposed  to hazardous work.  In Brazil, there is a monitoring  mechanism based on the list  published by the Ministry of Work  and Employment that identif es  cases of companies and/or individuals  reported for possible occurrences  of forced labor. Based on this list,  Vale checks suppliers records to  guarantee that none of them, whether  companies or owners, are involved  in such issues. In the event that a  violation of human rights is proved by  government authorities and through  instruments provided for in legislation,  the respective suppliers/partners or  customers are notif ed and instructed  to take the proper corrective measures.  Vale requires that all its  productive chain (suppliers  and clients) respect Convention  105 of the ILO, concerning the  abolition of forced labor Otherwise, Vale may break of  its  commercial relations with them. Focus on transformation of the pig iron  value chain In 2011, some of Vales customers  who use iron ore to produce pig  iron were accused by NGOs of  buying illegal charcoal 3. Following  a notif cation from Ibama, the  Brazilian Environmental Institute, Vale  suspended the sale of iron ore and its  transportation to three companies. Following these events, and to  ensure that Vale is not a participant  in deforestation, the use of illegal  charcoal or the abuse of human  rights, the company mobilized a  Challenges Develop suppliers  in the regions where  Vale operates Contribute to  the eradication  of child and  slave labor/labor  similar to slavery in  the supply chain  GRI Reference Indicator: HR2 Pig iron  Activities related to  the production of pig iron in Brazil  involve more than 30,000 people,  including direct and indirect  jobs, and generate US$360  million in annual income 2. Major  questions surround the pig iron  production chain, concerning  deforestation, illegally sourced  charcoal and human rights  violations. Vale recognizes that  the problem exists and assumes  the commitment to mobilizing  the relevant actors to f nd  solutions to these problems. 2 Analysis by Phorum Consultancy — with a  multiplier ef ect of 2.5 for employment and income,  and using 2012 data from the IBGE, the Brazilian  Statistics Institute. 3 Source: Report into Sustainability in the Pig Iron  Supply Chain, Observatrio Social Institute, Reprter  Brasil, Papel Social and Ethos Institute. 106  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  number of major players in this area,  to develop a Program of Independent  Audits in the Supply Chain.  The program aims to promote the  sustainability of the steel supply  chain, engage and assess producers  of pig iron for sustainable social and  environmental practices, and to  encourage an increase in the supply of  raw materials (wood and charcoal) from  renewable and legal sources, to meet  the demand from this sector.  The f rst stage of the program will  provide capacity building to orient  the companies that will be audited  under the program and to suggest  action plans for items that will be  assessed. The second verif cation  stage will score and classify the  companies on an annual basis.  By implementing this program, Vale  aims to guarantee that it supplies iron  ore only to sustainable operators.  It is important to note that as of  today, when the program is being  developed, the company is already  of ering a sustainability bonus to  companies that source over 80%  of their charcoal from their own  forests. This bonus is currently  received by two customers:  Queiroz Galvo and Plantar. Vales supplier selection and  registration processes are guided  by compliance with requirements  related to its Human Rights and  Sustainable Development policies, as  well as criteria of legal, f nancial, tax,  health and safety, and environmental  nature. The records are periodically  updated and verif ed in accordance  with these requirements.  Development of local suppliers Vale prioritizes the hiring of local  suppliers in order to boost the  economies of remote regions where  it operates and to qualify and develop  companies to operate in an increasingly  competitive market.  In line with the companys  sustainability strategy, since 2008  Vale has been carrying out its Inove  Good practices must be  replicated throughout the value  chain.

The results of  this work and Vales ef ort to develop  the local economy have led to the  participation of Brazilian suppliers in  Vales purchasing rising  to over 90% in 2011.  Vales supplier relationship  management encompasses three  stages: qualif cation based on the  companys values; evaluation of  compliance with legal and contractual  obligations; and monitoring companies  development and f nancial health.  Health and safety with suppliers Vale seeks to inf uence its value  chain in the health and safety theme,  encouraging the adoption of safety  measures, awareness campaigns,  inspections and audits.  In 2011, meetings for alignment  and exchange of practices and  experience were conducted with  approximately 20 of the companys  main suppliers of equipment and  new technologies. Meetings were  also held with 22 key general service  suppliers, for the same purpose.  At these meetings, participants  formulated an action plan that will  be tracked in 2012. The company has audited and  monitored improvements by 13  suppliers that have underperformed in  relation to the companys expectations  and need to improve their health  and safety results in areas such as  management systems, critical activities  requirements and legal compliance.  In order to improve management of  contractors, Vales stakeholders were  involved in revising the Contractor  Management Procedure in 2011. As mentioned previously, Vale  does not tolerate loss of life related  to the companys activities. The  challenge is great and the company  knows that it will not be able to  meet it in the short term, but Vales  top priority is to achieve the goal  of zero harm, and it is involving its  value chain in this ef ort.  Program (www.vale.com.br/inove),  which aims to strengthen the  suppliers for its units in Brazil, which  it believes are agents for sustainable  development in the regions where  they operate. Inove aims to develop  these local suppliers using capacity  building, lines of credit, and incentives  for businesses, making them  more competitive in the market.  In the three years since its  establishment it has awarded  around US$418.1 million in f nancing  and loans, while 380 companies  have signed up for classroom and  distance learning initiatives. In 2011, in partnership with the  Brazilian Service to Support Small and  Micro Companies (National SEBRAE),  A meeting  at work in  Sohar, Oman The expectation is that  Vales actions to develop local  suppliers will generate  increasing positive impacts  in the medium and long terms GRI Reference Indicator: EC6 109 Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  Customers Vale perceives that the successful  implementation of the sustainability  agenda will lead to long-term  competitiveness. For this reason,  Vales strategy to win and retain  new markets is to pursue  operational excellence to improve  the quality of its own products,  strengthen long-term relations with  its customers and f nd solutions  that meet their businesses needs,  in order to minimize impacts and  create value. Vale uses the same  approach in the various parts of the  supply chain, such as suppliers of  raw materials and service providers.  The supply and performance of  products is evaluated through  technical meetings and visits with  customers, generally with teams  from the Commercial, Marketing,  Research and Development, Planning  and Development, and Pelletizing  areas. Technical visits, interviews,  conference calls, trade fairs and  exhibitions, a customer service  center and regular satisfaction  surveys are other methods that Vale  uses to manage its relations with its  customers and other stakeholders. Solutions which focus  on meeting the needs of  customers add value to  products, develop businesses  and guarantee a long  lasting relationship Special attention is given to information  for customers related to the health  and safety impacts of products  (when handled and used). There are  standardized procedures for treating  customers complaints about product  performance. Depending on the  complexity of the problem, R&D  resources may be used to study and  enhance the product in terms of health  and safety (such as air emissions, danger  to health when used, and others). Some of Vales operations have programs  that provide for the management of risks  to safety, health and the environment  over the course of their life cycles, in line  with planned uses and the ef ectiveness  expected of their materials and products.  An employee  cleans copper  sheets in Tres Valles,  Salamanca, Chile 110  Vale 2011 Sustainability Report  These programs consider the dif erent  stages of design, production, distribution  and usage, and constantly seek to reduce  any indirect impacts on peoples health  and the environment.  More information about the maritime  transport of iron ore particles can be  found in the 20-F report, in the Investors  section of www.vale.com.  Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is another tool  used by Vale to produce signif cant  gains in the eco-ef  ciency of its  products. In this process, environmental  impacts are determined, especially  taking the following aspects into  account: energy consumption;  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; water  consumption; generation of ef  uents;  toxicity; and potential risk.  When appropriate, Vales production  processes identify products using  adequate methods throughout the course  of the production process, enabling them  to be tracked. This procedure allows the  control and unique identif cation of records  for monitoring and measuring products.  The Vale Manganese units, Barbacena,  Simes Filho and Ouro Preto, now  have this procedure.  In the nickel and cobalt operations  managed by Vale Canada, a product  awareness and responsibility  management area was recently  established. This area is staf ed by  risk management specialists, and it  reinforces the companys concern  for the theme. At the same time,  the marketing area has specif c roles  and responsibilities for product  management, whether in the  dissemination of information among  customers or in the identif cation  of specif c environmental needs  or expectations, such as product  environmental declarations. Reinforcing this positioning, in 2011  Vale Canada began developing its  Product Responsibility Management  System, with the aim of improving its  policies and procedures, and def ning  the roles, responsibilities and powers  in this area.  Vale maintains open, formal, technical  communications channels with its  customers, involving the participation  of multi-departmental teams. Vale  is engaged in numerous Technical  Cooperation Agreements (TCAs), visits  and technical consultancy assignments  to support customers, in order to mitigate  environmental impacts in the product  post-sale stage. The systematic compilation of absolute  f gures for reductions in greenhouse  gas emissions in the use and post-sale  stage of Vales ferrous metal products is  hampered by the highly extensive nature  of its portfolio of customers and products  and, in many cases, by conf dentiality  criteria attached to information shared by  Vale and its customers.  Vale also seeks to comply with all  prevailing standards and laws in  the countries where it operates.  In 2011, from the perspective of  regulations, there were no cases of  non-conformities or f nes related  to sponsorship, advertising and  promotion of Vales products, nor any  problems related to the supply and  use of products and services.

This procedure also involves describing  the risks associated with products  through Material Safety Data Sheets  (MSDS). These documents provide  customers with all necessary information  about products physical, chemical,  toxicological and eco-toxicological  properties, as well as procedures  for safe handling.  In 2011, Vale f nished evaluating the  risks and requirements for registering  all chemical substances exported to  or produced in the European Union,  in accordance with Regulation (EC)  1907/2006 (REACH). Since then, it has  been managing possible outcomes of  the registration process, together with its  customers, in particular to ensure the safe  use of its products.
