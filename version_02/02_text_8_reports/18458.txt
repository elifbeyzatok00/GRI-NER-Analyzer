United Nations Global  Compact Principles  Assessment, Policy and Goals  Implementation  Measurement of outcomes  HUMAN RIGHTS:  Principle 1 – Businesses should support  and respect the protection of  internationally proclaimed human  rights.  Principle 2 – Businesses should make  sure that they are not complicit in  human rights abuses  Camelot has a Code of Conduct which  requires that all employees must be  treated fairly and with respect and that  any form of discrimination or  harassment will not be tolerated. We  also have a number of individual policies  which go into the finite details of the  human rights of our staff (eg. Bullying  and Harassment Policy, Equality and  Diversity Policy).     Camelot actively supports the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights. Our Audit  and Procurement departments manage  processes and procedures which  highlight any potential risk of us working  with companies who do not respect  human rights. We will not form a  relationship with a business if they do  not comply with our human rights  values. We also have a Supplier  Conduct Review which looks into our  current suppliers conduct and whether  they are complying with our required  values (eg. human rights)  We have a number of HR policies  supporting and covering a spectrum of  Human Rights. These include policies in  harassment, bullying, equality, diversity  and grievance.    A grievance mechanism is in place which  enables staff to raise any grievances  that they may have fairly, consistently  and quickly. We also have an elected  staff forum which provides employees  with a platform to air their grievances  including any possible human rights  issues that they may have with the  company. Employees are also provided  with the telephone number of a  confidential external expert advice  company which facilitates staff access to  legal advice and allows them to discuss  any grievances that they may have.     Staff are required to complete a number  of online training courses which include  topics relating to human rights. For  example we currently have a training  course in equality and diversity and  health & safety. Staff are also given a  physical handbook of our Code of  Conduct which employees are  encouraged to read once they join the  company. This Code of Conduct gives an  overview of our human rights stance  and policies.     In the past year Camelot has not been  subject to any investigations, legal cases  or incidents involving human rights.     Any staff found to be committing  human rights abuses will be dismissed  from the company.     We also hold an annual Supplier  Conduct Review which allows us to see  if our suppliers are implementing the  correct standard of human rights.      We also frequently discuss the topic of  human rights with our stakeholders. For  example staff have recently participated  in a survey around organisational  health. Our stakeholder engagement on  human rights issues does not just lie  internally as we also go over the topic of  human rights with our stakeholders. For  example we have discussed human  rights issues with our Advisory Panel of  External Corporate Responsibility  Experts. We also mention the topics of  diversity and inclusion in our annual  stakeholder report.     The responsibility for the protection of  human rights falls under the  responsibility of both the HR and CR  departments.      LABOUR:  Principle 3 -  Businesses should uphold  the freedom of association and the  effective recognition of the right to  collective bargaining.  Principle 4 -  Businesses should  eliminate all forms of forced and  compulsory labour.  Principle 5 -  Businesses should  effectively abolish child labour.  Principle 6 -  Businesses should  eliminate discrimination in respect of  employment and occupation.   Camelot supports the ILO Core  Conventions and will not do business  with any organisation that uses forced  or child labour. To ensure that this stays  the case we have an annual supplier  conduct review which looks into our  current suppliers conduct including  whether they are using forced or child  labour.     Camelot complies with all relevant  health and safety legislation and  provides a range of different safety  related training to staff as appropriate  to their job role. We also ask staff to  complete an online health and safety  course so that they do not get into any  hazardous situations while working.    Camelot holds a monthly staff forum  where staff are given the opportunity to  liaise with the senior managers and the  CEO about a number of topics including  labour matters such the condition of the  workplace and staff bonuses.      We have a Bullying and Harassment  policy which states that any  discrimination in the workplace will not  be tolerated. This is compounded by the  fact that we have a thorough grievance  mechanism which enables staff to raise  any grievances that they may have. We  also have an online training course  which all staff have to complete on  equality and diversity.     We have just integrated a new  performance management process,   DPP (Developing Performance and  Potential) which rates employee  performance and act as a barometer on  whether an employee deserves a  promotion or bonus. It is also used as a  way to set individual objectives for staff.     In the past year Camelot have not been  subject to any investigations, legal cases  or incidents involving labour rights. We  also havent been subject to any health  and safety statutory notices or  prosecutions in the last year.     Agency workers are given a detailed  description of their employment within     Once an individual has been offered a  role within the business they are issued  a contract of employment which states  their terms and conditions including  their salary, overtime and annual leave  allowance. Employees are also given a  physical copy of the Code of Conduct  which includes information on what the  company expects from staff and the  rules and policies (grievance,  disciplinary etc.) that are in place.     All agency workers we employ are fully  compliant with the agency worker  regulations.         Camelot has a thorough health and  safety policy which contains a number  of procedures. Our Health and Safety  Manager also conducts regular audits of  the workplace to make sure that  employees are not under any risk when  they enter the workplace. We also  provide online health and safety training  for staff to make sure that staff stay safe  when in the workplace.   the company (eg. hours, working  requirements etc.). They are also free to  use all the facilities that we provide for  full/part-time employees such as  showers, canteen and rest areas.   ENVIRONMENTAL:   Principal 7:   Businesses should support  a precautionary approach to  environmental challenges.  Principal 8:       Businesses should  undertake initiatives to promote greater  environmental responsibility.  Principal 9:       Businesses should  encourage the development and  diffusion of environmentally friendly  technologies  Camelot has a thorough environmental  policy which is supported by senior  management and our CEO.     We have a number of annual  environmental key performance  indecators. These cover topics such as  reducing waste, increasing recycling,  reducing our CO2 emissions per  employee and reducing the amount of  paper used per 1,000 provided to good  causes.     We also have environmental targets  such as reducing our water usage,  making the vehicles in our fleet more  environmentally friendly and  encouraging employees to use more  eco-friendly ways to commute (eg.  shuttle buses from the local train  We regularly run environmental  campaigns to try and encourage our  staff to be environmentally aware in the  office. We mainly focus on energy usage  and recycling as these are the two  largest environmental areas that staff  have a bearing on. One example of an  environmental campaign that we have  run in the past year is the Switch it Off  campaign which encouraged employees  to switch their monitors off when they  left work.      In the past year we have redesigned our  mixed recycling stations to make them  more vivid and clear so that staff have  more confidence in recycling their  waste. We also ran a recycling campaign  alongside the implementation of the  new bins so that employees were clear  Camelot uses licensed waste companies  for the disposal of waste. In the  infrequent circumstance of us needing  to throw out IT equipment we follow  WEEE regulations and use the necessary  companies for electronic waste disposal.     We have half hourly automatic meters  in our offices in Watford and in our  warehouse in Northampton. These  meters enable us to monitor our energy  use online and discover any unexpected  trends in the data. We also have a  Footprint Tracker in our Watford Head  Office. This enables us to see which  work zones are using the most energy  and also gives us the opportunity to run  energy saving competitions between  different departments in our head  office.     station, car sharing or cycling to work)    In the coming year we will continue to  try and the meet the environmental key  performance indicators and targets  mentioned above. In addition to this we  will also continue to work closely with  our supplier to try and make our scratch  card composition more eco-friendly.   We will also try and make our  promotion material more eco-friendly.   about what could potentially be  recycled.      During the past year we have also  installed a voltage optimiser in our  Distribution Centre in Northampton.  This voltage optimiser has reduced the  amount of electricity used in our  warehouse which in turn means that we  have emitted less CO2 into the  environment.    We regularly ask our suppliers for  environmental data on the products and  services that we order from them. By  doing this we are able the compare the  different areas of business and see  where we could potentially make  improvements in the future.     All incidents which have environmental  repercussions are investigated and  procedures are put in place to prevent  incidents from happening again. For  example in the past a small amount of  waste in the outdoor recycling skips in  Northampton has been blown into the  surroundings area by the wind. To  eradicate this problem lids have been  put on the outdoor skips to stop waste  from being blown away and not  recycled.     In addition to tracking energy usage we  also collect monthly data in the  following topic areas (water, fuel, waste  – recycling and landfill, rail and air travel  and paper usage). This data is then used  to see how we have fared against our  environmental targets.   We have not been involved in any legal  cases, rulings or fines related to  environmental principles over the last  12 months. To make sure we are on the  right legal track we regularly update our  environmental legislation register to  ensure that we are complying with all  the relevant environmental legislation.       Anti-Corruption:  Principle 10 -  Businesses should work  against corruption in all its forms,  including extortion and bribery.  Camelot is compliant with the Bribery  Act and does not participate in any  corruption, bribery or extortion. We  support the UN Convention against  Corruption and do not operate in  countries or with organisations that are  The responsibility of dealing with anti- corruption falls with our Corporate  Assurance department.

Hospitality Register which is monitored  by HR and shared with the National  Lottery Commission (NLC). As a part of  our Corporate Gifts and Hospitality  Policy we inform employees that it is  not acceptable to accept gifts from  companies which we are currently not  doing business with. In addition to this  the policy states that any high value  corporate gifts or corporate  entertainment / must be passed onto  Head of Departments to decide if the  gift should be accepted.     Employees are also told to record all  offered and accepted gifts and  hospitality on the Gift and Hospitality  form and send this form to HR to record  onto the Register. Employees that are  found to be violating the policy will be  punished accordingly.
