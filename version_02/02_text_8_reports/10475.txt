K-waters green dream of handing over a clean earth  to the next generation is being realized.                                         02 CEO Message CEO Message K-water will provide green value services by upholding core values of purity, passion and creativity to create a more prosperous and happy world for the public and the next generation.   03 K-water 2010 Sustainability Report I would like to convey my deepest gratitude for supporting and encouraging K-waters efforts to create a more prosperous and happy world with water. I am also grateful for being able to present our 6th Sustainability Report that details our sustainable management activities and performance. Even in the midst of the global economic crisis, we were able  to establish a Green Growth platform. Ever since K-water constructed the first Korean multipurpose dam,the Soyang River Dam, in 1967, we have taken a leading role in national development and public happiness for the past 40 years by supplying abundant and clean water. In addition, to sincerely fulfilling our Social Responsibilities, we joined the UN Global Compact on February 2007. As such, we are committed to supporting and abiding by the 10 UN Global Compact principles. In 2009, even in the midst of the global financial crisis, we were able to establish a strong platform for global and continuous growth through various activities such as large scale national projects, low carbon new growth green business activities, and mutual cooperative & social contribution activities.  We have been improving management efficiencies by being the first public corporation in Korea to adopt an advanced annual payment system for all employees. We have also firmly established our mid-to-long-term strategy management plan to create a Water Strong Country by strategically implementing a new water management paradigm based on advances in technology and concepts. By declaring Purity, Passion, Creativity as our core values, we have established milestones to achieve Our Mission is to  Create a Happier World with Water.  K-water is leading the way with the low carbon,  green growth a new national development paradigm.    By successfully initiating and executing the 4-River Restoration  Project, the governments Green Deal Project, and the Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business, K-water has been playing a key role in the low carbon green growth which has developed into a new national paradigm strategic initiative. Going forward, by aggressively dealing with the climate change crisis through the future-oriented low carbon green growth paradigm, we are creating new growth opportunities. A good example of our commitment towards new & renewable energy development is the expansion of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) activities through the sales of carbon credits amongst corporates, the first of its kind in Korea. K-water has continuously achieved excellent performances results through global human resources Having being acknowledged having world class operational competencies for its water purification our plants received the 5 Star Certification from the American Waterworks Association, the first company to ever receive it outside North America,  K-water has been able to solidify its overseas business platform. K-water also received the highest Knowledge Management Corporate Award in Asia and the Sustainable Management Excellence Award for two consecutive years. In addition to receiving the grand prize for Low Carbon Growth and New & Renewable Energy, K-water was acknowledged for its leadership role in Environment-friendly sustainable management.This acknowledgement was based on K-waters global human resource pool in diverse sectors. K-water is committed to strengthening future competitiveness K-water will continue its effort to enhance water management capabilities under the belief that cultivating global human resources and developing core technologies are two essential components for establishing a competitive future. We will further strengthen our global competitiveness by further strengthening our corporate structure through sustainable management efficiency enhancements. Finally, we would like to request that you continue to support and encourage K-waters pure, passionate and creative efforts and challenges in order to create a new future. Thank You August 2010 President of K-water   Kun-Ho Kim K-water is creating new hope wherever water flows connect the hopes of future generations into one.  04 Strategy 06_ Forecast & Outlook 08_ Vision & Sustainable Management 12_ Business Strategy and Structure 14_ Sustainable Creative Innovation 16_ Sustainable R&D Investments  Approach Performances Challenges Strategy 05 K-water 2010 Sustainability Report Receiving clean air from beautiful nature as it embraces the world. K-water is leaping forward as the worlds best integrated water services corporation by achieving its Global Best on 3Water+ vision in order to embrace the values for today and tomorrow. Strategy  Diverse Stakeholders Forecast & Outlook As a corporation that has turned crises into opportunities, K-water will emerge as an integrated globally specialized water service provider by actively countering climate change and expanding new business opportunities in the midst of a fast-changing management environment. Strategy Changes in the Water Resources Management Paradigm The trend in global water resource management is towards strengthening the public role of corporations to meet the challenges of climate change from a water resource management and national security perspective. In addition, having acknowledged that water is not an abundant resource anymore, an integrated water resource management paradigm that takes into consideration water intake and supply is proliferating amongst advanced nations. Since the 1960s, advanced countries in Europe have enacted a Basic Water Laws and have been carrying-out integrated water resource management. While water demand is expected to increase and will continue to rise, the supply is limited, and in order to effectively manage water resources and counter-manage the effects of climate change, the role and importance of specialized public water resource management corporations are growing. As the domestic water resource management industry is evolving from simply solving water related problems to a new water management paradigm that integrates water utilization, regulation and the environment based on the governments low carbon green growth policy, the role of water resource management by the public sector is growing in importance. Outlook of the Global Water Industry The global population in 2050 is projected to increase to 9.4 billion, while the population in urban areas is expected to increase to 69.6% (6.5 billion) of the total global population. As the population continues to grow, water shortages due to climate change increases, and the demand to replace worn-out facilities in advanced countries in North America and Europe increases, the annual water industry is projected to expand to over KRW 1,000 trillion. The total population affected by water shortages due to global warming, such as climate change, is estimated to be approximately 1 billion. This figure is expected to increase to 3 billion in 2025 and 4 billion by 2050. Considering that 2 billion of the total global population did not have access to clean water, and that 2.6 billion suffered from lack of basic sanitation facilities in 2004, water supply facility investments are projected to increase continuously. Trends of the Global Water Industry To alleviate operational structural inefficiencies in the water industry stemming from small local self-governing bodies managing the water industry, major advanced countries, such as in Europe, are moving towards a strategy which focuses on managing the water industry on a larger scale. After the 1990s, 73% of all water & sewage treatment management consignment contracts are being implemented through an integrated operational structure, helping enhance efficiencies. As such, more and more integrated operations & management strategies are being initiated. Looking at world-class water-related corporations globally, the trend is to create vertical integration of the value chain to cover the entire water life cycle. Through vertical integration, corporations are achieving competitive superiority by securing economies of scale and scope. In addition, the population served by multi-national corporations is decreasing (Top 5 corporations market share: 73% in 2001  39% in 2008), while the population served by local corporations in developing countries is sharply increasing.  As there is a paradigm shift from a focus towards an abundant supply of water to improving water quality and efficiently managing the supply of water, the need for technological differentiation, such as the demand for more advanced technology standards, are continuously on the rise. As such, world-class global water-related corporations are concentrated on providing Total Solutions to the entire water treatment process, such as system planning, installation, operations, and management. | Worsening Water Shortage Situation |  Population Affected by Water Shortage  Total Global Population 2000 6.4 2025 7.8 2050 9.4 8% 38% 42% | Integrated Water Resource Management Structure | 06 Pluralistic Laws/ Regulations Expertise Required Water Related Disputes, Climate Change Water Management Duties, Decentralization of Organizational Structure Water Quality River Ecological Environment Dam/Lake (Unit: Billion Persons) Integrated  Water Resource Management Scientific Decision Making Professional Personnel & Organization Integrated Management Governance Integrated Management Policies, Legal Regulations River Sized Management Activities Quantity (Utilization/ Regulation)  Approach Performances Challenges Strategy K-water 2010 Sustainability Report Policies of the Global Water Industry  European countries, such as France, that have been developing their water industry over long periods of time, are more focused on providing support to domestic corporations that are expanding overseas rather than developing their own water industry. However, to overcome their own water shortage situation, Singapore is more concentrated on developing its own water industry over a short-period of time by getting their national corporations to participate in large scale projects led by the government. In the case of Israel, to overcome their water resource shortage situation, they have solely designated Mekorot as the sole comprehensive water management institution, while implementing a government-wide water industry development program through the NEWTech program. Japan announced its Multi-directional Future Water Industry Development Plan to develop its water industry. Recently, Japan established a Master Plan to develop its water industry so as to enter the waterworks & sewage treatment operations business. To achieve this, Japan is actively developing its government led water industry and establishing national strategies to expand overseas. One example is its effort to strengthen cooperation between private and public institutions.  Projected Domestic Water Demand In 2006, according to the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs Water Resource Long-term Comprehensive Plan, the domestic population is projected to increase to 57 million and the total water demand is expected to be 35.6 billion / annually by 2020. From the total expected demand, water for agriculture is expected to comprise 44% of the total, followed by river maintenance water and household water requirements at 8.4 billion / annually and 8.2 billion / annually, respectively. Looking at the supply and demand status of water in the future, by 2020, a 930 million / shortage is projected. Status of the Domestic Water Industry The domestic water industry is valued at approximately KRW11.2 trillion in size, with the waterworks & sewage treatment market taking up the largest portion at 91% of the total. Since the domestic penetration level of Waterworks & Sewage Treatment is at advanced country levels, the domestic water industry is at a stage of diverting its effort to construction and management. By 2011, construction of all domestic infrastructures will have been completed. With this, operations, management and facility replacement are steadily taking a larger portion of the market. The domestic water supply business is divided into the Multi-regional waterworks, Local Waterworks and sewerage business. The water business is 100% operated by K-water and local governing bodies, without the participation of private sector corporations. However, 64% of the total sewage treatment business is carried-out on consignment with the participation of private sector corporations. Governments Development Policy towards the Water Industry Based on the governments Water Industry Development Plan, the size of the domestic water industry is projected to expand to KRW 20 trillion. The plan is to develop the domestic water industry into a global water industry. According to the governments 2007 Water Industry Development 5-year Detailed Implementation Plan, 31 detailed tasks in 6 sectors, including implementation plans and investment size, have been outlined. However, since most of the governments water industry development plans have either been changed or delayed, the only current visible project underway is the waterworks & sewage treament facility upgrade business.  Trends in Overseas Expansion of the Domestic Water Industry Korean water industrys expansion overseas is mostly concentrated on the facilities & construction sector, while operations & management overseas still take up a small portion. From 2007 up until July 2009, the facilities & construction sector comprised of 88.5% of the total contracted amount overseas. As the operations & management sector takes up the largest portion in the water industry, there is a need to concentrate our effort to developing and entering the operations & management sector. | Domestic Water Demand Projection | Comparative Changes in Annual Emissions between  the Periods 1980~1999 & 2090~2099 07 * Korea: Water 5.1 Trillion, Sewage Water 5.1 Trillion, Industrial Water 1 Trillion  Source: Global Water Market, 2008  Source: Climate Change & Water (IPCC Technology Report-IV; 2008) 2011 355 2016 358 2020 356 1st USA 2nd Japan 3rd China 4th Germany 5th UK 6th France 7th Brazil 8th *Korea 9th Canada 10th Italy 100.0 65.1 39.2 28.7 20.9 19.7 12.8 11.2 10.9 6.9 (Unit: 100 Million /Annual) | Comparative Size of the Domestic Water Industry | (Unit: KRW Trillion)  08 Strategy Vision & Sustainable Management By 2017, K-water will have been in existence for half a century, establishing itself as a global comprehensive water service leader by harmoniously balancing public, growth and efficiency factors. K-water's Vision K-water has further supplemented the mid-to-long-term strategic management plans, enabling it to lead the paradigm of change in the water industry as climate change, has forced the industry to adapt, and to establish a new growth engine through the successful completion of the Green New Deal which includes the 4-River Restoration Business and the Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business. Since the vision that was established in 2006 and the strategic direction that was established in 2008 coincides with K-waters current management status and has a wide spread consensus, the vision and strategic direction will remain as part of K- waters management strategy. At the same time, the strategic structure, including the nine Implementation Strategies and Strategic Tasks, was further complemented, while the Action Plan was outlined in more concrete terms. K-waters core values, which form the Corporations mental and cultural foundation, were recently established to help achieve its visions and strategies. Based on a unified belief and core values that forms the basis for action, K-water will strengthen its leadership and consolidate its competencies company-wide. | K-water Vision  | | Core Value  | 3 Strategic Directions The 3 major sustainable management strategic directions enable K-water to achieve a strategic focus and act as a directional beacon for aligning organizational activities, allowing K-water to achieve effectively its vision. This will require expanding public services, achieving continued growth and securing global competitiveness.

Clean Corporation, Producing Clean Water Whoever works hard in a straight clean manner, will gain the trust of the citizens. I would like to stress the importance of sticking to the basics, while placing great emphasis on the happiness of the public and customers. (President Kun-Ho Kim, November 2009) K-water is aggressively pursuing ethical management as the basic foundation since it provides a strong competitive platform. In 2009, K- water especially focused on reestablishing its core values to help achieve its vision, accepting ethical management as its primary management target, and initiating its target of becoming a global ethical management corporation. K-water received the Anti-corruption Policy Evaluation Excellent Company Award from the Anti-corruption & Civil Rights Commission of Korea for 4 consecutive years. This was the result of strengthening internal policies such as revising principles of conduct by employees & executives, and advancing the ethical system by operating an Ethical Committee, the highest policy decision-making body for implementing ethical management, and a Clean Reporting Center, a place where employees can voluntary return received gifts. The efforts of both the employees & executives were also a pivotal factors.

Mid-to-long-term CS manage- ment strategies have been established to strengthen CS (Customer  Satisfaction) activities that are more systematic and professional. Throug hthese activities, K-water will be able to satisfy the growing public demand from a professional water service corporation, and will also be able to actively take necessary measures to adjust to changes in the customer satisfaction management environment. By significantly improving the internal / external service processes, K-water has been able to prevent customer dissatisfaction, resulting in enhanced customer loyalty. Simultaneously, amongst SOC public corporations, K-water was the first to adopt the Service Identity (SI) to be able to effectively provide special customer satisfaction services to customers, and to highlight how its services differentiate from other SOC public corporations. The service identity, Water-Pro Service, reflects K-waters strong intention to provide proactive and professional services to its customers. To achieve this, differentiated services are provided for each customer, while customer opinions and suggestions are actively adopted in K-waters CS management. Through these efforts, K-water is enhancing customer values. As a result, K-water received the highest rating for 3 consecutive years in the Public-service Customer Satisfaction Index(PCSI) evaluation, and was the first public corporation to be awarded the The people Sinmoongo (a big drum) Grand Prize. K-water was also selected as an Excellent Institution (the highest ranking) by the Civil Affairs Inspection Evaluation by the Ministry of Land, Transport & Maritime Affairs. K-water has received these awards as recognition for its CS  management as being of the highest standard in Korea. Established an Advanced  Service Quality Management Structure K-waters focus has moved away from result-based monitoring such as resolving customer complaints and carrying-out customer satisfaction surveys, towards continuously improving basic factors such as the concentrated management of core services quality, the prevention of errors in the entire service process (Before Service), and the minimization of customer dissatisfaction through quality improvements. To achieve this, K-water adopted the Service Quality Index (SQI), a strategic service evaluation system to create a general quality management system which utilizes service monitoring and data measurement methods. The SQI is comprised of error rates, observance rate of resolving customer's complaints through visits, level of satisfaction towards solving complaints through visits, and VOC complaint rates.

As such, it is necessary to identify, analyze and find solutions to meet the interests and demands of stakeholders. GRI demands that this kind of information be included in the Report. K-water established and maintains diverse communication channels which have enabled the company to collect stakeholder suggestions and opinions. The materiality of the demands by stakeholders are identified and reflected in the Sustainability report. Especially in case of the results stemming from the implementation of Sustainable management, which reflect stakeholders demands, the results are disclosed through K-waters Sustainability report. As such, K-water is pursuing various methods to communicate with stakeholders. To enable stakeholders to directly and indirectly participate in management or provide suggestions, K-water has established and operates diverse communication channels which include the VOC, where stakeholders can input their suggestions, customer participation committees & informal customer meetings, Sustainable management advisory councils, government personnel dispatches, and surveys. Stakeholders demands that have been collected through the various communication channels are first categorized before prioritizing them through the materiality matrix. Once prioritize, the materiality is evaluated.  The matrix evaluation is initiated through a two staged process. The first stage is evaluating internal and external interests. The second stage evaluation takes into consideration the impacts on businesses and management competencies. After the 2nd evaluation stage, implementation and performance results of the issues that have been identified as level 1 materiality are reported in the sustainability report in greater detail. As for level 2 & 3 materiality issues, they are succinctly reported in the Sustainable management report. Through the advice of a professional organization, K-water established and has utilized a materiality evaluation model since 2008.

Risk Management Structure K-waters enterprise risk management can be segmented into pre- and post-risk management, while risk are managed in 4 areas which include management, conflicts, disasters and PR. Risk management is a process of preventive measures to make sure risks dont develop into a real risk. The measures include managing counter-measures and continuously monitoring department risk indices. On the other hand, risk management is a post-management process of case risks that developed  into real risk.  In the case of a risk situations, recovery steps are to be taken, which includes deciding on the level of warning and setting up an emergency action headquarters based on the Counter-measure Manual by risk type.Risks are evaluated and segmented into a company-wide management (core, importance) risk or department management risk based on the frequency and impact level to K-waters management activities. The focus is on the pre-management of risks. Risk Management Structure K-water has established risk expansion prevention procedures by incorporating public corporation risk management principle into its risk management. As a result, 27 counter-measure working manuals for risk were published and cover the 4risk areas (management, conflicts, disasters, PR) making it possible for employees to easily utilize the manuals on-site.  Headed by the Senior Executive Vice President takes on the role as the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), and heads the Risk Management Committee which oversees the overall risk management of K-water. Establishing risk management strategies are the Business Planning & Coordinating Departments responsibility, while separate departments are designated to manage specific risk situations depending on the type of risk in order to effectively initiate counter measures.  |  Risk Concept Outline  | |  Risk Segmentation  | Risk Danger Potential of Occurrence 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 Affect Level Company- wide Manage- ment Risk Major Risk Core Risk Depart- ment Manage- ment Risk Risk:  As a Concept that Includes Risk & Crisis, crisis is when risks become a reality. } } Establish & Operate a Clean Water Management System (Dr. SafeWater) As the potential for water pollution has increased due to increased risk of water pollution disasters occurring such as the case in 2008 when phenol leaked into the water source and in 2009 when 1.4-dioxine was detected in the Nakdong River, K-water established and operates professional counter-measures, better known as Dr. SafeWater. Dr. SafeWater utilizes advanced technologies such as a Geographic Information System (GIS), enabling K-water to make decisive decisions using real-time information which is essential during a water quality disaster. Through the use of this system, K-water has advanced its disaster management platform, enabling it to manage risks more systematically and solve disasters professionally.  (Example) ) In the case of the Nakdong River water system, 1.4-Dioxine was detected. K-water was able to provide safe drinking water by strengthening water source & filtration quality surveys, while temporarily securing substitute sources. BEST PRACTICE Dr. SafeWater System  K-water 2010 Sustainability Report 29 As Part of the ERM System, K-water is Leading  the New Green Deal Project by Expediting the Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business The Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business, which was originally initiated in 1995 as a BTO (Build-Transfer- Operate) project, was delayed for a long period  of  time, making it inevitable for K-water to take-over the project after close discussions with the government to smoothly implement this national project. To solve the issue of expediting the project, the President directly headed a special task force team, which directly led the project. As a result, a new project implementation model was presented through a close cooperation structure headed by K-water. As a result of these efforts, the project timetable was drastically reduced from the normal 2 year period to 5 months. This will substantially contribute to the national economy by creating an innovative green distribution system through the construction of a distinct water way, and by providing dynamism to culture, tourism and leisure.  Continued Water Supply through  Systematic Drought Counter-measures Many areas around the world are suffering from severe drought. In the case of Korea, the drought that hit the southern area of Gangwon Province in 2008-2009 left the Gwangdong Dam reservoir area with 42% lower than average rain falls (473.1 mm). This was the worst drought recorded in weather observation history for this area. It exceeded Gwangdong Dams design frequency (10 years). K-water established a system to actively counter drought situations by systematically dividing the roles of the head office, divisions and management office. K-water established plans to counter drought situations by setting up a step-by- step process to supply emergency water to minimize the impact of the drought in areas supplied by the Gwangdong Dam. As a result of these efforts, K-water was able to supply a minimum of 50% of the required drinking water in worse case scenarios. To avoid these disasters from re-occurring, K-water has established and is implementing various plans such as reestablishing its dam operational plans in cases of floods, enhancing the safety level for water utilization, and constructing support dams. |  Company-wide Overall Risk Index (Examples)  | |  K-waters Crisis Management System  |  Metropo- litan 0.0  Gang won 8.8  Chung cheong 0.7  Jeon buk 0.0  Jeon nam 6.4  Gyeong buk 5.1  Gyeong nam 4.3  Sihwa 0.0  Normal(0~33%)  Caution(34~66%)   Danger(67~100%) Disaster Occurrence (Indication Identification) Countering  the Crisis After Management (Wire Reporting System) (Counter Measures Based on Crisis Level) (Concern, Notice)  (Caution, Serious) (Convocation: Department Head) (Composition: Department Head) Departmental Measures Concern / Notice Company-wide Counter Measurements Caution / Serious  Administrative Services Division 6.2  Direct Control Division 15.0  Company-wide 5.7  Water Resources Business Division 1.3  4-River Restoration Business Division 0.0  Water Supply Business Division 4.5  Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business Division 0.0  Land, Energy & Overseas Services Division 1.0 Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business Supplying Water to Drought Regions (Unit: %) Approach Performances Challenges Strategy On-site Depart- ment Head Crisis Level Decision (Regional Headquarters) Related Execu- tive Director Senior Executive Vice Presi- dent, Public Relations Director, Audit & Inspection Director Department Head Manager Risk Manage- ment Committee Auditor General President Emergency Measure Division Regional Executive Director(Depending on Whether it is Management or Not) On-site Regional Headquarters  30 Challenges        GREEN Economy 32_ Low Carbon New Growth Green Business 34_ Successful Operations of Local Waterworks 36_ Integrated Operations of Waterworks Facilities 37_ Water Friendly Green City & High Tech Green Complex 38_ Global K-water 40_ Promoting the Industrial Water Business  Approach Performances Challenges Strategy 31 K-water 2010 Sustainability Report K-water is moving towards a sustainable future by creating a new wind globally.

Challenges 34 Successful Operations of Local Waterworks Utilizing the best management techniques & technological capabilities, K-water is contributing to enhancing to the enhancement of competitiveness of the domestic waterworks industry by improving customer satisfaction and water quality through advanced local waterworks.  Local Waterworks Efficiency Enhancement Project The operation of domestic waterworks is divided into the multi-regional waterworks (K-water) and local waterworks (164 local governments). The lack of confidence in water (rust water, leakage, lack of services) by the public mostly stems from services provided by the local waterworks. Most of the local waterworks are small in size, lack the manpower and technology, and are financially weak, making it difficult to investment in facility improvements. This causes a vicious cycle of low quality and poor service.  Utilizing the experience and expertise gained from operating multi- regional waterworks, K-water is taking measures to enhance the efficiency of the domestic local waterworks business through consignment management of the local waterworks. By integrating the operations of multi-regional and local waterworks, and local waterworks, water resource utilization can be maximized, while redundant and excessive investments can be prevented. Project Implementation Status The opening of the Nonsan Water Supply Service Center was in April of 2004, as of May 2010 K-water has taken charge over all operations including water supply and management of 18 local waterworks from self- governing bodies. Some local waterworks are still in the process of transferring control over to K-water. The local governments that have transferred or that are in the process of transferring operations to K-water are Nonsan, Jeongup, Yecheon, Seosan, Chonan (industrial), Goryong, Geumsan, Dongducheon, Keojae, Yangju, Naju, Danyang, Paju, Hampyong, Gwangju, Gosung and Tongyong. In the next 20 to 30 years, K-water will invest a total of 835.KRW 3 billion in the 18 local waterworks, including the Nonsan waterworks which is currently under operations. The investment will help replace worn out pipes, establish IT-based integrated operating systems, and enable scientific pipe network management. This will increase water revenue and reduce costs, helping maximize management efficiencies. Local Waterworks Operational Performance From the 12 local waterworks (Nonsan, Jeongup, Sacheon, Yecheon, Seosan, Goryong, Geumsan, Dongducheon, Kojae, Yangju, Naju and Danyang) that K-water has taken over and has been operating for over a year from the local governments, approximately 7,000 cases of leakage restoration construction works were carried-out to reduce and improve leakage from worn out pipes. By systematically and strategically implementingwater revenue enhancement measures based on mid-to-long-term plans such as replacing 593 of worn out water pipelines and approximately 70,000 water meters, K-water was able to increase the average revenue water revenue rate from 57.7% to 76.3% for the 8 existing local waterworks and the 4 local waterworks that K-water took charge of in 2009. As a result, a substantial amount, KRW 8 billion in production costs was reduced.  | Status of Consignment Management on Local Waterworks | 2007 750 2008 1,250 2009 1,530 2006 560 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Geojae City Yangju City Naju City Danyang Gun Paju City Hampyong Gun Gwangju City Tongyong City Goseong Gun Geumsan Gun Dongduchun City Seosan City Cheonan (Industrial) Goryong Gun Jeongup City Sacheon City Yecheon City Nonsan City 11.1 Point Increase Expansion of Local Waterworks  Service Population (Accumulated) (Unit: People/Thousand) Yearly Revenue Water  Rate Status (Unit: %) 57.7 72.6 76.3 Under Management 2008 2009 64.7 2008 2009 Enhanced Customer Satisfaction (Unit: Points) KRW8 Billion/Annual, Cost Reduction through Decrease in Local Waterworks Leakage 75.8 75.4 Before Consignment  BEST PRACTICE K-water 2010 Sustainability Report 35 | Future Plans  | In addition, by providing differentiated services such as creating an exclusive leakage restoration team, operating a 24 hour call center, offering free indoor leakage inspections, and adopting water quality certification policies, and by making great efforts to improve water quality, the customer satisfaction level increased from 75.4 points in 2008 to 75.8 points in 2009. Through these efforts, K-water is contributing to the quality enhancement of water services. By integrating the consignment operations of 4 new local waterworks, Insacheon, Kojae, Tongyong & Gosong, not only has the management of the local waterworks improved, but a platform has also been established to enable aggressive measures to be taken to deal with the fast-changing waterworks industry and expedite the integration of consignment operations.

Strengthening Corporate-wide Counter-measurements  As the sense of crisis regarding climate change is increasing, a target was set to limit the average global temperature increase to 2 C was set at the Copenhagen Conference in December of 2009 to reduce green house gases. The government is also aggressively taking counter measures by enforcing Low Carbon Green Growth Basic Laws set in April of 2010. Green house gas reduction based on the Framework Convention on Climate Change can be used as a new trade barrier. New markets are expected to be created through carbon credit transactions and trade barriers using advanced reduction technologies by European countries and advanced nations such as Japan. Acknowledging the countering of climate change as a new stepping stone in the management of K-water, it is striving to enhance its capability to counter climate change and establish integrated counter-measures by securing sustainable water resources & integrated water management, developing low carbon environment-friendly technologies & establishing necessary infrastructures, and developing new & renewable energy. By establishing the Climate Change Counter Strategy Master Plan in December of 2009, K-water instituted its 5 major strategies and 26 action plans to reduce green house gases by 46% compared to that of 2005. Through these efforts, K-water is taking the lead in implementing the governments low carbon green growth policies.  Green House Gas Reduction Efforts To create a low carbon green management platform to counter climate change, K-water acquired verification from a global verification institution, Det Norsek Veritas, located in Norway (DNV). This was accomplished by researching and analyzing green house gas types and emission quantity that is produced during a projects entire life-cycle. Reduction technology and potential emissions quantity was also researched and analyzed. K-water also prepared and managed a statistical table. An Energy Utilization Efficiency Plan was established and implemented in May of 2009 to take measures to counter the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the rising price of oil. To prepare for the obligatory adoption of the Energy Management System in 2010, K- water enacted and implemented (UNIDO: United Nations Industrial Development Organization) ISO 50001 (2010). K-water also replaced its main computer server with a highly efficient and low powered server. By recycling the replaced server as an information resource, K-water was able to achieve a Green Data Center (GDC). K-water is creating a green waterworks business establishment by being the first domestic waterworks business and public enterprise to implement Carbon Labeling as a trial project. All K-water events are carbon neutral, making them Green Events. However, in the case that a major event is larger than a set size limit, K-water is required to obtain a Carbon Neutral Certification from the Korea Energy Management Corporation (KEMCO) before the event can be held. In addition to directly reducing green house gas emissions, K-water is managing the Carbon Cleanness Level (Total Green House Gas Emissions / Energy Utilization Amount) and Carbon Efficiency Level through Carbon Intensity Index management within energy efficiency and carbon efficiency improvement levels. The carbon Cleanness Level in 2009 was similar to that of previous year at 2.08 CO2, but lower than the domestic average. This refers to 2.08 CO2 tons of green house gases being emitted whenever energy ITOE is consumed. The carbon Cleanness Level is an index that shows the amount of carbon that is emitted when energy is consumed. A low carbon Cleanness Level means a low carbon emission and translates to the slowing of global warming. The 2009 carbon efficiency level increased by 5% compared to that of the previous year, to 24.23 tons. This means that to achieve KRW 100 million in revenues, 24.23 tons of green house gases were emitted. The major reason for the increase in the carbon efficiency level was the reduction in power generation, which led to a decrease in revenues. The total green house gas emission amount increased by 2.9% in 2009 compared to the previous year (485,877 tons CO2. This was due to the GHG Inventory Certification Action Plan:  5 Major Strategies,  12 Major Targets,  26 Major Action Plans 1.

Direct green house gas emissions due to the use of diesel fuel and gas was 4,459 tons CO2, whereas indirect green house gas emissions from the use of electricity was 481,418 tons CO2. The main source of K-waters green house gas emission is the energy used to operate the waterworks. That is why K-water utilizes two systems to regularly monitor green house gas emissions. The two systems are the Environmental Performance Evaluation (EPE) System and the recently setup Inventory System. At the same time, by operating energy savings implementation programs for each sector, K-water is reducing green house gases, improving the atmospheric environment and reducing water production costs. These efforts greatly contribute to enhancing corporate competitiveness. To convert to a high efficient consumption structure, K-water is carefully researching various equipments and evaluating the energy efficiency of equipment from the design stage. For existing facilities, energy unit costs are more carefully managed. To reduce green house gas emissions from the waterworks business sector, which is a major carbon emission source, the power unit cost is strictly managed.  Development of Green Technology &  Future Implementation Plans K-water is placing its effort to secure necessary core technologies to optimize the usage of operating equipment and water resource facilities in order to reduce green house gases and achieve green growth. To achieve this, K-water plans to invest a total of KRW 16 billion until by 2013. By adding supplementary functions to the current functions of the existing business, new energy will be developed, helping to maximize utilization value. K-water is also securing energy saving products & supply systems by optimizing the operational management of dams & waterworks equipment, and improving the performance of high energy consumption equipment. Currently 12 core technology projects are being carried, out including the commercialization of the strong current turbine power generator. Going forward, by acquiring a corporate-wide carbon labeling certification and low carbon certification, K-water will establish a low carbon water production system. Methods to link the Inventory System and EPE System, which is used for effective management of green house gas emissions, will be established. Through this, a detailed reduction potential assessment project will be initiated for each sector of K-water's business. By implementing carbon reduction programs that are appropriate and effective for K-water, like voluntarily establishing and implementing green house gas reduction targets, K-water will place a corporate-wide effort to countering climate change.

Sustainable Development Establishing Measures to Counter the Declining Environment- friendly of the Hantan River Dam's Daraktae Shooting Range The large flatland and natural purification plant situated downstream of the shooting range was utilized to treat pollutants (explosives, heavy metals, etc.) emitted from the large-scale shooting. By preventing pollutants from flowing into the Hantan River and purifying with the vegetation, hazardous factors have been eliminated in the Hantan Rivers ecosystem with an environment-friendly manner. These measures were initiated through a social consensus with related experts and organizations such as the army, Ministry of Environment, academia and K-water.  BEST PRACTICE | Sustainable Water Resource Development  | 48  Creating a Clear Clean Air Environment A dust protection cover was installed to reduce scattered dust and gas emissions as a result of K-waters project activities, while water is regularly sprayed to reduce dust and vehicle speed have been limited. At the same time, environmental training is held for K-waters employees.  Creating a Healthy Natural Ecosystem Major conservation of animals and plants in the area was researched. As a result, any trees that were  damaged due to K-waters projects are utilized in the landscape architecture. Eco-corridors are being built to prevent the discontinuation of the ecological network. Measures are also being taken to protect and conserve  various conservation animals such as otters and cranes. Through these efforts, K-water is creating sound ecological areas. Securing Clean Water Resources By installing basic environmental facilities upstream of the dam to treat domestic sewage and livestock waste water, and to cultivate a wetlands in the inflow areas of the reservoirs, the source of pollution can be and a 2nd buffer zone can be secured at the same time. In addition, through the Taking Care of Forest Project in the watershed, sources of watersupplies are being expanded and self-purification functions are being enhanced to ensure K-water supplies clean water.

Fishways and egg laying sites have also been installed to protect fishes' habitats. In addition, movement passageways (eco-corridors) for wildlife have been created using roads that have been relocated. Through the forestation of the rear side of dams, in concert with the surrounding forest vegetation, from an integrated perspective, severing or fragmenting the ecosystem can be avoided. By connecting the surrounding nature ecologically, the natural environments can be maintained as natural habitats. | Bio-habitat Environment Preservation Facility  | Forestation of Rear Side of Dam Fish Egg Laying Site Transplanting Damaged Trees Fish Habitat Eco-corridor Bird Habitat  K-water 2010 Sustainability Report 51 Ecological Restoration for Protective Species K-water established and is implementing its plans to restore the ecology by minimizing the impact to the surrounding environment due to water resource development projects, and by building substitute habitats in areas adjacent to dams to preserve the ecology. A substitute habitat (gravel fields, water insect habitats, diverse aquatic living organisms) within the Hwabuk Dam area was built for otters (Natural Treasure Number 220) and white necked plovers (Designated by the Ministry of Environment designated as a species in danger of extinction – level 2). Artificial wetlands are also being built for amphibian animals and reptiles. Various measures are being formulated to preserve the natural growth environment for Supple-jack shrubs (Berchemia berchemiaefolia) located around Sungduk Dam. When designing ecology restoration facilities, taking into consideration the ecological characteristics of species in danger of extinction, K-water acquired advice from domestic and overseas ecological experts, to make sure that the ecology restoration facilities are appropriate and environment-friendly. Monitoring for Environmental Changes in Project Areas When initiating projects, K-water monitors various sectors of the ecology, including water quality, air quality, animal & plant life (vegetation, mammalian, bird species, amphibiareptilia, insect species, Large benthos invertebrates, plankton, etc.), and noise vibrations to identify changes in the environment due to the project and to establish & implement measures to minimize any changes to the environment. An example is the Kunnam Flood Control Reservoir being constructed on the Imjin River. The habitat for the Red-crowned Crane, a natural treasure that comes around the Imjin River during winter, was researched. As a result, with the participation of local citizens, related organizations, environmental organizations and experts, the flood area was cultivated, feed was provided and a substitute habitat was built to preserve the habitat for the red-crowned crane. Through these efforts, the number of red-crowned cranes that comes around winter in the Imjin River area continues to increase. Establishing Red-crowned  Crane Preservation Measures The Red-crowned Crane is designated as a natural treasure and has a high treasury value. To preserve the Red-crowned Cranes that comes around the project areas, local citizens, environmental organization, and experts came together to put together a plan to build a substitute habitat where dragonflies exist, as a feeding ground, and to cultivate the flood areas to provide feed to the Red-crowned Cranes.

Upgrading the Water Production Process By adopting upgraded purification treatment technologies such as the Ozone and Granular Activated Carbon process, difficulties of eliminating tastes & smells can now be eliminated, while disinfecting by-products and minute quantities of pollutants can be treated, enabling K-water to enhance the quality of water. The upgrade technologies were adopted at 4 water purification plants (Bansong, Goryong, Banwol, Goyang) in 2009, and by the end of 2010, 12 more water purification plants are expected to adopt the new technologies. To utilize IT & Web technologies, K-water has set up a 2nd generation water quality rating system (K-water QPI) to evaluate the water quality of multi-regional water purification plants nation-wide on a real-time basis. Through the K-water QPI, 14 items, including turbidity, were selected for concentrated management. The 14 items were strictly evaluated using K- waters own standards, which are stricter than legal standards. This is to achieve higher quality water. In cases of turbidity, the QPI standard is targeted and managed at 0.1NTU, 5 times the legal standard of 0.5NTU. As a result, on June 2009, the Cheongju water purification plant became the first first plant to receive 5-Star certification, the highest ranking certification, outside the North American region from AWWA (American Waterworks Association) The AWWA carried out a sponsored purification operational management capability certification policy evaluation. By expanding the number of 5-Star standard water purification plants, K- water will provide the worlds best quality water to gain greater trust from customers.

To secure the worlds best water quality inspection analysis capabilities, through the Water Quality Analysis Research Center, 500 items for inspection were identified up until 2009. By receiving the Best International Certified Test Institution Grand Prize in 2008, K-water was able to further enhance the credibility of its analysis results.  Water quality information from all of K-water's water purification plants that it manages is disclosed on K-waters homepage (www.K-water.or.kr) in real-time, making it more accessible for customers. At the same time, in 2009, the supply process and water quality information was also added with the water purification plant data which is supplied on the company's homepage, widening the scope of disclosed information.  K-water 2010 Sustainability Report 53 Strengthening Quality Management in the Supply Process Even though water is safely processed at the water purification plant, the water can be polluted as it flows through rusted pipes before it reaches the tap. This is the major cause for reddish water (rust water). Every year K-water identifies worn-out pipe route sections and continuously replaces any worn-out sections, helping minimize water quality deterioration during the supply process. In 2009, by replacing a total of 19.5 of worn out pipe sections, the multi-regional waterworks average revenue water was maintained above 99%. The rust water index achievement rate was improved by 9% by developing and applying the newly developed rust water improvement process. Water Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) The Water Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a technique used to reduce and improve the pollution level in water by quantifying and evaluating the causes of environmental pollution from the entire process from water production to supply (from water source to tap). In 2009, the Environmental Evaluation technique was applied to the life cycle of water production by water purification plants at Gosan, Deokso, Boryong, Songnam, Ilsan and Choongju. After analyzing the contribution level using 6 categories that are affected, including resource exhaustion and global warming, the Global Warming category was affected the most. It was also found that green house gas emission management was the controlling factor in the water environmental evaluation. Water Labeling Certification: Realizing the First Waterworks Corporation to be Recognized as a Green Business Site Carbon Labeling is a policy of labeling products with the amount carbon dioxide that was generated during the life cycle of the product, including product, transportation, distribution, usage and discarding. K-water received the Carbon Labeling certification from the Ministry of Environment for its Cheongju Water Purification Plant Waterworks. K-water was the first waterworks corporation in Korea to be certified by producing and supplying 1 (ton) of water, 188g of carbon dioxide is emitted. Starting in 2010, K-water will replace its environment labeling with carbon labeling and expand its carbon labeling certification efforts to other facilities to improve water production by making the entire water production process low carbon and environment-friendly. | Quality Management during the Supply Process  | | Water Life Cycle Assessment  | Carbon Labeling Certificate U.S.s 5-Star Standard Water Purification Plant Operational Management Improve Water Corrosiveness Improve Local Waterworks Water Management System Stabilize the Management of the Water Quality Verification Policy Eco-friendly Process Management & Carbon Labeling Certification Expansion Optimize Operations of Water Discharge Treatment Facilities& Improve Discharged Water Quality Strengthen Measures to Counter Water Quality Accidents as a Result of the Water Quality Management System Operate an Early Water Quality Pollution Warning System for the 4-River Restoration  Project High Quality Water ProductionSupply & Credibility Enhancement Carbon Labeling Certification Implementation Plan (Unit: Cases) 1 7 15 16 2009 2010 2011 2012 Strategy Approach Performances Challenges_GREEN Environment Strategy Enhancing Water Processing Credibility Establishing a Green Water Purification Plant  Strengthening Measures to Counter Abnormalities in Water Quality  Challenges 54 Source Water Quality Improvement Clean tab water comes from clean source water.  We supply high quality source water through scientific management of reservoirs and the watershed. Strengthen Management of Pollution Source in Watershed Typhoons and concentrated heavy rains induce large quantities of soil and flood debris to flow into reservoirs, causing long term high turbid water phenomena and water pollution.  To overcome the insufficiency of water quality control after the pollutants coming into reservoirs, joint efforts with organization concerned such as pre-inspection and preventive measures for the pollutant sources are being taken. As a fundamental measure, integrated turbid water prevention plan for the drainage sections of the 5 major river watersheds was established. And for the better management of pollutant emissions source, Integrated Pollution Source Information Management System was established based on IT & GIS technology Expanding Participation to Improve the Water Quality in the Watershed Efforts to participate in the projects for water quality improvement in the watershed area, such as ecological wetland development project which is being implemented by K-water, are being taken to reduce pollution sources in the watershed area. K-water established an integrated management platform for management of domestic sewage and livestock waste water, which are the main sources of the dam's water pollution. K-water is constructing 8 waste water treatment facilities and operating 102 facilities. Technological Advancement in Water Quality Management and Control of Dam Reservoirs For water quality management of the dam reservoirs, it is necessary to scientifically forecast the future quality of water. However, since the dam reservoirs are huge, and there are diverse factors affecting each reservoir water quality including weather factors, it is very difficult to identify the exact causes & influences to water quality, making it imperative to use water quality forecast modeling techniques. For more rational decision- making and for the application of water quality improvement technologies, 3 dimensional water quality forecasting technologies are to be used, which is more advanced and accurate rather than 2 dimensional models. The 3 dimensional forecast technologies were applied at a dam as a trial in 2009. K-water has a plan to apply the 3 dimensional Hydrodynamic Water Quality Model to all at dam reservoirs. Efficient Algae Control Technology Adoption During summer, the eutrophication of reservoirs and rivers, results in causing water pollution and purification treatment obstacles. Various water quality improvement facilities are adapted to control algae bloom such as curtain weir (inflow current prevention layer), water circulation systems (aeration facilities) and selective intake equipment. To enhance operational efficiency, diverse research is being implemented such as efficiency analysis & the establishment of operational guidelines for each technique. In 2009, new algae control technologies, such as algae removing (harvesting) ship and curtain weir (and advanced multi-regional algae control facilities), were successfully introduced and applied.

Therefore, pollution source management is a very important factor to preserve high quality water resources. For efficient and systematic management of the information related to water quality and pollution sources, the integrated information management system based on GIS & IT has been established, which provides high definition aerial photos, 3 dimensional image of the reservoirs and a watershed, water quality status and water control facilities status. The user friendly interface of the system will make it possible for the users to manage the pollution sources and facility more easily and efficiently by providing optimal information.

GREEN  Society  Challenges 56 Respecting Human Rights & Diversity K-water is taking the lead in protecting human rights & interests by protecting the social minorities and respecting diversity. Efforts to Protect Human Rights K-water is protecting the rights of minorities within the corporation, while maintaining a policy of solving problems faced by employees & executives. Diverse policies such as programs to expand employment opportunities, maintain gender equality and protect workers during pregnancies are being initiated to protect the rights of minorities such as the disabled, female employees and contract workers. A Gender Equality Department has been established within the labor union, and efforts are being taken to provide the same benefits to contract workers as regular employees.  Human rights training courses are mainly carried-out to protect the rights of minorities. The training courses mainly consist of the company-wide sexual harassment prevention training and personal information protection training courses. Human rights training courses will be expanded to cover other areas. By guaranteeing the right to form collective agreements and initiate collective bargaining, there is no potential for rightsto be infringed upon at any of K-waters worksite. Achieving Gender Equality Since K-water announced Gender Equality regulations in 2004, discrimination factors in employment and promotion of female employees has been eliminated. At the same time, counseling for female employees faced with problems has been greatly promoted, and gender equality programs have been implemented by actively managing and supporting the female workforce through strengthened maternity protection. The basic salary is the same for male and female employees in similar positions and for those that have entered the corporation in the same year. Promotions and compensations are also equally provided to male and female employees. As of December 2009, there were 393 female employees, comprising 9.8% of total work force at K-water. The number of female managers is increasingly growing in numbers. At the end of 2009, there were a total of 24 female employees in managerial positions: 2 directors (level 2) and 22 managers (level 3). In 2009, 17% (18) of the new recruits were females. In accordance with article 17 of the Framework Act on Womens Development and enforcement ordinance article 27-2 of the same act, a sexual harassment prevention training program is held once every year and the results of the training program are reported to the Ministry of Gender Equality. To prevent any decreases in labor productivity at the worksites, a member from each department is required to complete a cyber training course once a year and disseminate the contents of the training program to his/her department. Handling Employee Problems Employee problems are solved by operating a problem counseling window at all times within the HR-Bank (An Integrated Human Resource Management System). The utilization rate of the problem counseling window and face-to-face counseling to solve problems faced by employees increased two fold to 98 cases in 2009. Out of the 98 cases, 67 cases were solved (a 68.4% solve ratio) through an investigations. Unsolved cases are continuously evaluated and considered at a later date. In addition, from the corporations perspective, various methods were considered to aggressively prevent and alleviate stress caused from employees not being able to adapt to the organization, overwork, and other sources of stress, by operating an Employee Assistance Plan (EAP), which is an expert counseling support program. As a result of K-waters diverse efforts to enhance the quality of employees' lives and satisfaction through a healthy and dynamic organizational life, 16% of the employees, or 584 employees, received counseling.

In regards to information provided by K-water, the collection of personal information is minimized. By utilizing i-Pin (Internet Personal Identification Number) rather than the personal registration numberon the company's homepage, discretion is maintained in protecting personal information. Personal information is systematically managed by establishing personal information protection standards. Toimprove the awareness about the importance of personal information and the seriousness of the potential damages it can cause, and to emphasize the discretion required when providing information, cases of actual information leakages and personal information infringement prevention training courses are held regularly for new employees, external trainees, information security personnel and relevant personnel at cooperative firms.   In September of 2009, K-water was the first public enterprise to receive the ISO27001 certification. Through this certification, K-water established a strict personal information security system so as not to infringe upon customer rights. As a result of these efforts, out of 86 institutions, K-water was selected as the best institution in the National Intelligence Services (NIS) Security Management Status Evaluation in November of 2009. Expanding Employment Opportunities for the Disabled A policy to provide additional points to the disabled has been adopted when hiring employees. In regards to testing, depending on the level of the disability, an additional 3~5% points are added to applicants who have a disability. As for employees that have been disabled due to accidents, 100% of their salary is provided as support. For those employees registered as having a disability, a 3 day paid leave and gifts of encouragement are provided around disability day. Various convenience facilities have been installed for the disabled, which include parking zones, elevators, rest rooms, stairways and roadways. The disabled employment rate was 2.3% or 104 employees in 2009. Since 2000, over the last 10 years, the disabled employment rate was above the compulsory legal rate of 2%. Maternity Protection Program A breast feeding area and female employee rest areas have been secured within the head office, and a corporate child care center has been established to assist female employees during maternity. The child care center has been expanded, while existing facilities have been remodeled to help alleviate the burden of raising their children, and to create harmony between work and family life. Diverse maternity protection programs are being carried-out such as the child care temporary leave and selective child care work time reduction policy. Breast pump support has also been expanded for female breast feeding employees.

To achieve this, K-water is securing global competitiveness for its personnel resources. K-water also strives to enhance work competencies by awarding employees for work merits, employees selected as model employees, employees with superior knowledge, and employees providing excellent suggestions. Competency-based HR Management & Information System K-water established a competency-based human resource management system that has helped to develop competency model (Common, Leader, Duty). A competency-based training system is being utilized to enhance current competency levels by identifying required competencies to generate performance. This kind of human resource management is implemented based on an advanced human resource management system such as integrating personnel management data through the HR- Bank (An Integrated Human Resource Management System), and by processing 100% of all HR management functions through the system. Capability & Performance-based  Compensation & HR Management The monthly salary of new employees is set at 212% of the minimum wage in accordance to the governments public enterprise advancement policy, and all employees and executives are evaluated on performance regularly. In the case of executives, compensation is based on performance in accordance to the management contract signed with the President. As the executives are paid annual salaries, level 1 executives compensation is based on the departments evaluation, while level 2 executives are compensated on individual MBO (Management by Objectives) evaluations. As for level 3 or below for general employees, performance compensation is based on the departments evaluation. However, to encourage employee competency enhancement, there could be a difference of more than 20% higher or lower in compensation depending on the individual competency evaluation. In addition, to provide greater competency development opportunities through diverse work careers, a policy enabling employees to exchange functions, especially with employees in the administration and technology areas.  Employee & Executive Career Development Since 2003, K-water established and operates a CRP (Competency Reinforcement Plan) system to help employees & executives in their career development. The CRP system helps in providing a balanced career development plan by appropriately reflecting the organizational and individual needs. Starting in 2010, selective learning for employees & executives is being strengthened, while various programs to enhance training effectiveness are being implemented, which includes Module- based Courses, and the Opening of All Training Courses to Employees & Executives.

To solve housing problems for employees that have been transferred to different areas due to work, employees are provided support in terms of living quarters and rental homes. Parts of a home purchase loan are provided for to assist in purchasing a private home to ensure stable housing and living conditions. K-water received the Family Friendly Corporation Certification on November 17, 2009 by operating family friendly welfare policies and programs such as recreational facility accessibility to all family members, cultural & arts experiencingopportunities, writing classrooms & English camps for employees children. Voluntary Learning Structure K-water is helping employees continuously upgrade their capabilities by providing diverse training programs. A representative program is the Competency Reinforcement Plan (CRP) which helps individual employees to enhance expertise in their specialized work functions on their own. The CRP is a T-shaped personnel development concept. A T- shaped employee refers to an employee that is not only specialized in ones traditional sector, but is also well-versed in terms of knowledge and insight in adjoining areas around the employee. It is a program that enables employees to acquire in depth knowledge in one area through expert training for a certain period of time when first entering the corporation. Once the employee reaches a managerial position, the employee is allowed to participate in training to expand his/her knowledge in a field that is relevant to the overall corporation. Welfare Safety K-water is creating a Great Work Place (GWP) for healthy people.The results of health examination in 2009, showed that 67.7% of employees were classified as healthy (class A, B group), while 32.3% were classified as those having comments on their health (class C2 group). In comparison to the previous year, class C2 group increased by 6.3%p. However, among those examined, the prevalence rate, which refers to the ratio of those diagnosed with a disease, stood at 5.9%, which was a decrease from 6.6% in 2008. In regards to this, to prevent adult diseases from occurring in healthy patients and to manage the health of employees on the health black list and employees with diseases, a non-smoking program, an obesity clinic and a mental health program (EAP: Employment Assistance Program) were initiated, receiving great reviews from employees. To reduce the number of employees with comments on their health examination, cerebrovascular & cardiovascular disease attack potential assessments were carried-out on all patients in 2010, and a health training session was included in the work training at the training center. Greater focus has been placed on supporting employee health programs by adding an employee (nurse) to the health management personnel and supporting on-site health management for small project sites. An MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) was concluded in October of 2009 with KOSHA (Korea Occupational Safety & Health Agency) to adopt the KOSHA 18001 (Construction Project Health Safety Management System) to secure the safety of on-site workers for national projects that have officially being initiated. KOSHA 18001 is currently being operated on a trial basis, but K-water plans to adopt it to all project sites by the end of 2010.

As a result of these efforts, through a successful agreement between labor and management, an annual salary policy was adopted for all employees. Since K-water was the first SOC-type public enterprise to adopt the most advanced annual salary model, 15 media firms, including Yonhap News and Maeil Economic Daily reported this as an exceptional case. Labor and management continue to cooperate as one to adopt advanced management techniques.

Through policy improvements, management briefing sessions and corporate-wide cooperative bodies, information sharing between labor and management has increased, while a corporate-wide consensus has been established by strengthening mutual trust.  Since 2006, the Labor-Management joint Committee, K-waters unique labor-management cooperative body, established and operates a policy improvement working committee to solve long-term management issues such as issues related to the organization of human resource organization, welfare policies, and waterworks integrated operations. As a result by the end of 2009, 96 improvement issues had been identified and are gradually being implemented. Specifically, in regards to the issue of expanding the annual salary policy to all levels of the organization, through an agreement between labor and management, the conversion to an annual salary model based on performance and competency was completed. Amongst the SOC-type public enterprises, K-water adopted the most advanced annual salary model. K-water abides by the basic labor law article 7, (Prohibition of forced labor), and tries to guarantee and improve the legal working conditions of laborers.

Performances  68 Performances Sustainable Management Performance Index (GRI) Economy Direct Economic Effects Economic Value Creation & Distribution The water resource business, which includes dams & waterworks business are require projects that are directly linked to the public economy. By utilizing limited resources efficiently, K-water is creating economic values. With the drought in 2009, power generation dropped, reducing revenues slightly. As a result, the distributed economic value also dropped slightly. Over 79% of the total revenue generated in 2009 was invested in sales expenses and capital expenses related to production activities. | Economic Value Creation & Distribution  | Retirement Grants In preparation for the possible retirement of employees, in accordance to Labor Standard Act, retirement provisions have been allocated. Taking into consideration the average wage of employees during their employment period and 3 months before retirement, K-water guarantees that the employee will be able to receive the retirement grant on the date of retirement. K-water is considering converting the current retirement grant system to a retirement pension policy. This will be carried-out after an agreement is reached with the labor union. Government Subsidy Benefits Since K-water is carrying-out national projects, parts of the project costs are supported by the government in a form of government subsidy benefits. For the past 4 years, K-water received government subsidy benefits for various projects including Water Purification Facility Upgrade Projects, which follow the Ministry of Environments model project, revenue water enhancement projects, and public rental apartment complex infrastructure construction projects. As for the construction project for the Innovation City, K-water received KRW 10,140 million in subsidy benefits from the government.  | Recipients of Government Subsidies | Market Status Legal Minimum Wage Vs. New Employee Wage Ratio The monthly wage for entry level employees with a university degree (level 5) is 212% of the legal minimum wage. Local Purchasing Policy Purchasing is carried-out through the electronic purchasing system. However, to promote local purchasing by field offices, a maximum value amount was set, making it possible to contract construction or purchase merchandise locally. Local Hiring in Domestic & Overseas Project Sites In general, K-water ensures equal employment opportunities for all new employees, eliminating limitations on academic background, regionalism, and age. However, for local waterworks meter reading personnel and water project operators, K-water hires locally. Since initiating local waterworks consignments in 2004, as of the end of 2009, K-water hired 223 personnel locally, contributing to the development of the local communities. Countering Climate Change Financial Impact from Climate Change, and Risk & Opportunity Factors As the sense of a crisis regarding climate change increases, a target to limit global temperature increases by 2 C was reached at the Copenhagen Conference on December 2009 to help reduce green house gases. The government is also actively taking measures to counter climate change by enacting the Low Carbon Green Growth Basic Law in April of 2010. Through the Framework Convention on Climate Change, green house gas reductions has become a new trade barrier, and new markets are expected to be created such as credit point sales and trade regulations utilizing advanced reduction technologies led by advanced nations such as countries in Europe and Japan. As such, it is perceived that countering climate change to be a new growth opportunity for K-waters management, K-water is doing everything possible to enhance  its capabilities to counter climate change and to utilize an integrated approach to countering climate change through strategic methodologies such as securing sustainable water resources & integrated water management, developing & establishing low carbon & environment- friendly technologies & infrastructures, and developing new & renewable energy sources.

Investments include KRW 427.3 billion in new dam construction projects such as the Hantang River and Sungduk River Dam Projects, water resource facilities such as the expansion of water resources in existing dams, KRW 259.3 billion in construction of waterworks facilities and water supply system control projects, and finally, KRW 570.4 billion was invested in the construction of new cities and development of industrial complexes. Dam Environment Improvements and the Opening of the Water Cultural Center The construction of a new dam takes into consideration environmental factors from the beginning. However, since existing dam facilities tend to be worn-out and obsolete, they are not able to provide much support to the local economy. Considering this, K-water is establishing overall plans to improve the environment of existing dams, while substantially renovating the surrounding facilities. Some of these efforts include setting up observation decks, elevators and promenades. Water Cultural Centers are also either being newly constructed or renovated to create a resting area and cultural space for visitors. Providing Support to Local Citizens in Areas Adjacent to Dams K-water continues to carry-out Dam Support Projects to help enhance the income level and welfare of local citizens in the areas adjacent to dams. In 2009 alone, K-water provided a total of KRW 55.6 billion as support to Local Support Projects such as installing joint farming facilities, paving farm roads, and constructing town centers, and to Local Citizen Support Projects such as providing medical, heating expense and tuition / scholarship support. Generation-based support projects such as providing native English speaking teachers for elementary students, supporting environment-friendly farming, and constructing filial piety sharing welfare centers are representative support projects that directly affect local citizens. being encouraged to be converted into environment-friendly farm land. Through this conversion, pollution sources are minimized, helping preserve dam water quality. In return, K-water is helping farmers acquire environment-friendly certifications for their agricultural products, while helping enhance their income by securing sales channels. Farmers in areas adjacent to dams that are carrying- out environment-friendly farming are cultivating potatoes, corn and other crops using organic methods and non-agricultural chemical methods. K-water is helping these farmers by providing environment-friendly farm equipment and natural compost depositaries. In addition, to enable the agricultural products produced in these areas to acquire environment-friendly certification, through a technology support agreement with Agricultural Technology Centers of local governments, K-water is providing environment-friendly agricultural technology. To secure objectiveness in the credibility of agricultural products produced in these areas, K-water is providing support in inspecting agricultural products for residual agricultural chemicals and heavy metals, and in acquiring environment- friendly agricultural product (no or low agricultural chemicals) certifications. By 2010, the model for environment-friendly agricultural complexes will be expanded to cover all areas designated as farm land. | Eco-friendly Farming Implementation Status & Plans  | Environment Materials For detailed information on the quantity of source water used to produce water and materials such as purification chemicals that are used to purify water, refer to page 53, Water Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Material Income & Expenditures.

Energy Saving  Energy Consumption Amount Total energy consumed in 2009 totaled 233,134 TOE, an increase of 2.8% compared to that of the previous year, while the energy was mostly used during the waterworks processes such as the intake and supply of water, and the operation of pumps in pumping plants. Direct energy consumed through diesel and gas was 1,579 TOE, while indirect energy consumed through electricity stood at 231,554 TOE. Supporting Environment-friendly Agriculture in Areas Adjacent to Dams Fertilizers, pesticides, and soil improvement works utilized for farming activities in areas adjacent to dams are non-point source pollutants resulting in water pollution including eutrophication, and turbid water in reservoirs. Fertilizers and pesticides used for farming in areas adjacent to dams, and soil brought from other areas tend to directly seep into the reservoirs during floods, causing eutrophication and turbid water, which are representative non-point source pollutants causing water pollution.

To convert to a high efficient energy consumption structure, equipment should be inspected and energy efficiency assessments should be carried-out during the design stage, while power unit costs should be managed carefully for existing facilities since power unit costs take up the largest portion in the waterworks expenses. Energy Efficiency Enhancement in Dams & Waterworks Facilities To reduce green house gas emissions and counter the energy crisis due to recent oil price hikes, improvements are being made to enhance energy efficiencies by deciding on optimal pump specifications, and optimizing internal coating & pump operational scheduling. Power consumption and green house gas emissions are being reduced through the increase of local waterworks revenue water. By enhancing the performance of multipurpose dam hydropower plants, K-water is contributing to increasing the supply of clean energy domestically and effectively countering climate change. Feasibility studies on the waterworks facility energy efficiency enhancement CDM projects were carried-out in 2008, and model projects were implemented in 2009. In 2010, K-water plans to receive verification of its model projects from a feasibility verification organizations, and in 2011, a registration registration from the UNFCCC will be requested (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). Water Usage Water Sources Affected by Water Intake K-water initiated the Gyungnam, Busan Area Multi-regional Waterworks Project to supply clean water to the Gyungnam, Busan Nakdong River main stream area where water conditions are vulnerable. Initially K-water had plans to supply water by developing the Namkang Dam water intake level and river bank filtration water. However, due to concerns over increasing the intake level, plans to secure a water source through utilizing surplus Namkang Dam water and river bank filtration water was revised and a feasibility test was contracted-out. The Daap intake facility located in Gwangyang City, Jeonnam, supplies natural and industrial water to the Gwangyang Port area by intaking water from the Seomjin River. To minimize the effect on the environment and damage from sea winds, sufficient water from the rivers was secured and an environmental impact survey initiated. Recently, as the Seomjin Rivers river mouth is converting into a sea, changes are occurring in the ecological environment such as ocean organisms inhabiting the river mouth. Surveys were carried-out as to the cause of the phenomena. Multiple factors, in addition to the Seomjin River water intake were the cause. Causes include a drop in river bed due to rock extraction, increase in tide level due to landfill of Kwangyang Bay, and Dam construction upstream. Through local citizens suggestions, K-water will initiate impact surveys on the damages caused to the fishing industry due to intake from Seomjin River and construction of Jooan Dam. Continuous monitoring of the changes in environment will also be carried-out. Reusing & Recycling Water Recycled waste water (graywater) is used in restrooms and gardens at the head office. For customers using recycled waste water, a rate reduction (30% off of water rates) policy is applied to increase the use of recycled waste water and to establish a circulation-type society. In 2009, customers using recycled waste water increased by 28% compared to the previous year, resulting in a rate decrease of KRW 7.6 billion. | Energy Savings Implementation Plan & Performance  | General Management Sector Energy Expense Reduction through Equipment Improvements  (Lighting Equipment) Operational Efficiency through Lighting & Air Equipment Improvements Energy Reduction through Rational Utilization of Electrical Appliances Energy Consumption Total Amount Policy Management & Energy Reduction Target Management Water Supply Sector Develop & Operate an Electricity Charge Calculation Program Revise Optimal Electricity Rate Contracts for each Project Site Apply & Improve High Efficient Equipment such as Improving Capacity of Transformers Dam Sector Equipment Improvement to Maintain a Load Power Factor over 95%  Target Establishment & Management of Dam Power Consumption Rate & Savings Rate Expanding the Applications of New & renewable energies Improve Waterworks Power Unit Cost (2008: 0.3182h/  2009: 0.3176h/) Power Generation Sector Energy Reduction  3,450h/ Please refer to page 95 for K-waters recycled waste water usage achievements.

Sewage Treatment Plants As of the end of 2009, the average water quality of discharged water from the 18 sewage treatment plants were BOD 2.2/L, COD 7.2/L, SS 3.5/L, which was similar to the public sewage treatment facility discharge water quality standards of BOD 10/L, COD 40/L, SS 10/L 22%, 18%, 35%. To be at the forefront of improving discharged water quality, K-water has adopted and operates a self-developed Sewage Treatment Program. Green House Gas Emissions Total Green House Gas Emissions Total green house gas emissions reached 485,877 ton CO2, a 2.9% increase over the previous year. This was mainly due to the increase in power consumption stemming from the expansion of new projects (Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business) and an increase in water supply. In 2009, direct green house gas emissions from the usage of diesel fuel and gas increased by 27.6% to 4,459 ton CO2, while indirect green house gas emissions from the use of electricity increased to 481,418 ton CO2, an increase of 2.7% from the previous year. In addition, indirect green house gas emissions from transportation of employees & executives to and from work, and business trips were 581,252 ton CO2 in 2009. Green House Gas Reduction Project & Performance Refer to page 31 of the main text for details regarding K-waters CDM projects & performance. Quantity of Ozone Layer Destroying Substance &  Air Pollution Substance Emissions  There are no processes in the production of water that emits ozone layer destroying substances such as Freon gas. There could be potential leakages from cooling facilities that contain Freon gas. To prevent this from happening, regular safety inspections are carried-out on all cooling facilities. At the same time, there are no production processes that directly emit air pollution substances at any of  K-waters project sites. However, there could be air pollution substances emitted while using oil to operate the project sites and facilities. To minimize this, by reflecting this into each department's environmental target, the departments implement diverse activities to reduce the consumption of kerosene. | 2009 Air Pollution Discharge Status  | Total Waste Water Discharge Quantity & Water Quality As the amount of discharged water from water purification plants and its quality directly affect the water quality of rivers and the ecological environment,  K-water applies management standards that are stricter than legal standards.

Discharging & Recycling Waste Products Sludge from Waterworks & Sewage Treatment Systems In 2009, the amount of sludge produced from purifying 1 of water was approximately 58.1g. The total amount of sludge produced at water purification plants in one year was 90,717 tons, and 100% of the sludge was recycled and used as cement material, earth filling material and planting soil. Sludge produced at sewage treatment plants operated by K-water was 26,307 tons. From the total amount of sludge produced, the percentage of sludge recycled increased by 17% to 31% of total sludge, or 8,276 tons. The sludge was mostly used for planting soil, cement material and compost. The reason for the increase in sludge recycling in 2009 was mainly due to using the sludge produced from the Hwaensong District as land fill. K-water will gradually increase the recycling rate of sludge by converting sludge into a resource and to prevent ocean disposals. any leakages of hazardous substances. However, to prepare for hazardous substance leakage accidents, K-water is enhancing its ability to take measures to counter potential accidents by establishing an accident manual and holding regular training activities. Waste Material Discharge Management As a result of the London Dumping Convention (1996) banning the dumping of waste materials into the ocean, there was an amendment of enforcement regulations in the Maritime Pollution Prevention Law (Ministry of Maritime Affairs & Fisheries Regulations No. 330 on February 21, 2006). As a result, disposing sludge from purification plants into oceans have been banned as of 2007. Since 2006, all sludge generated from purification plants has been recycled, and no sludge is exported. Products & Services Environmental Impact Reduction Activities & Performance K-water is continuously achieving environmental performance through a dynamic circulation process of P (Planning), D (Deed), C (Checking), and A (Amendment) that reflects the conditions of ISO14001. In 2009, 30 environmental targets in 30 categories were established. 99% of the targets were achieved. Recycling Construction Waste By promoting the environment-friendly treatment and recycling of construction waste generated as a result of K-waters water resources business, K-water is contributing to the green preservation of the country, resource reductions and public welfare enhancement. The total construction waste generated in 2009 was 140,537 tons and from this 95.6% or 134,353 tons was used as road pavement material, material for creating green tracts of land through mounding and soil covering, recycled rock, and wood chips. Going forward, K-water will minimize construction waste generation and create a resource recycling green society by initiating designs for an environment that can coexist with nature from the construction business planning stage, and realizing a productive construction site through the recycling of construction waste during the construction stage.  Effects from Hazardous Material Spillage,  Waste Material Treatment, Sewage Water Hazardous Material Discharge Management Hazardous materials such as waste oil and chemical substances discharged from the project sites can have a serious effect on the surrounding environment, bio-diversity and health of local citizens.

Filial Piety Sharing Welfare Center By selecting ways to solve problems related to the welfare of senior citizens living in the areas adjacent to dams as an activity theme, a Filial Piety Sharing Welfare Center was first established adjacent to the Hapcheon Dam in 2006. With the established of the Choongju Dam Filial Piety Sharing Welfare Center in 2008, there are currently 7 centers country-wide operated by K-water. Going forward, through the active participation of local governments, K-water will continue to try and solve welfare problems for senior citizens living in the areas adjacent to dams and to construct additional filial piety centers to enhance the local welfare. Education & Training Evergreen Program for Retirees To effectively prepare employees who are planning for retirement, an Evergreen Program is being implemented. K-water is trying to provide a 2nd opportunity to the retirees by providing training course related to change management & personal finances, real estate, and start-ups. Target for Performance Evaluation All employees & executives receive performance evaluations on a regular basis. For executives (Vice President), based on the performance & management contracts signed with the President, compensations are decided based on performance. As for employees below division heads, the departments management performance and evaluation are reflected in their personnel management and compensation. The evaluation items are segmented into a joint index and quantifiable and non-quantifiable indexes. The results are then divided into department evaluation, overall team evaluation, and team project evaluation, which are then used in personnel evaluation. Divisional, departmental and team evaluations also affect the calculation of compensations.

Human Rights Investment & Procurement Practices In the preamble of K-waters Ethical Principals, in addition to clearly stating the principles of respect for human rights, a clause is included that states that individual diversity and dignity are respected. It is stipulated so that all management activities are carried-out based on the principles of human respect. Human Rights Review on Investment Agreements Since the overseas projects that K-water is initiating are small investment projects that are mostly Official Development Assistance (ODA) projects and engineering (Survey & Design, Construction Inspection) technology export projects, the projects do not include a clause related to human rights protection. However, K-water will consider including the human rights protection clause in future direct investment projects and its decision-making process. Human Rights Review for Contractors By eliminating unjust firms by establishing contract review standards when transacting with K-water such as service contracts, K-water is able to substitute human rights reviews with an overall review with includes financial soundness & corporate credit rating, quality, and delivery performance. Especially in pre-qualification (PQ) reviews for large construction biddings, reviews in the sectors of human rights and labor, including disaster rates, have been strengthened. Firms with low disaster rates are given preference. In addition, to protect the rights of one-time construction laborers, social insurance rates (Health Insurance, National Pension) are reflected in construction costs to settle insurance payments once construction is completed. Through these efforts, K-water is trying to increase social insurance payment rates by contractors. Human Rights Training Currently, human rights training are concentrated on protecting the rights of minority employees such as the corporate-wide sexual harassment prevention training and personal information protection training. However, K-water plans to expand the contents of human rights training. For more detail, please refer to page56 of this report. Prohibiting Anti-discrimination  In K-waters Ethical Principles, it is clearly stated that individual personalities are to be respected, and that there should not be any discriminatory treatment. Through this, K-water is abiding by the ILO policies (No. 111, Convention on Discriminatory Treatment of Employment & Work). To protect the rights of minority employees such as the disabled, female, and & contract employees, various measures are being implemented, which include the expansion of employment opportunities for minorities, the reduction of working hours for child caring, and securing interim workers in case of child caring or maternity leave. A Gender Equality Department was created in the labor union to protect the rights of female workers. For further detail, please refer to page 56 of this report. Freedom to Form Organizations & Collective Bargaining Based on the 3 Labor Standard principles of the 10 principles of the Global Compact, the right to form organizations in collective agreements and collective bargaining is guaranteed. There are no grounds for infringing on these rights in any of the project sites. Eradicating Child Labor K-water prohibits the use of child labor at all project sites. There have been no cases of using child labor in any of K-waters project sites. To prevent child labor, based on K-waters youth employment regulation, anyone under the age of 15, or students in middle-school under the age of 18 are prohibited from employment. All new employees are required to provide documents proving their age. Through these efforts, K-water is faithfully abiding by the 5th Labor Standard principle from the 10 Global Compact principles.  Eradicating Forced Labor K-water is abiding by Koreas Labor Laws and ILO policies (No. 105, Convention on Eliminating Forced Labor) to prohibit forced labor. K-water is faithfully abiding by the 4th Labor Standard principle from the 10 Global Compact principles. Security Practices To protect individual rights and to prevent labor productivity from declining at the project sites, a cyber training course is held for 1 member from each department. That person has the responsibility to disseminate the knowledge gained from the cyber training program to his/her department. In addition, to protect against personal information being disclosed, K-water has replaced personal registration numbers with i-Pin (Internet Personal Identification Number). K-water is continuously searching for ways to enhance security measures. For more details, please refer to page 57 of this report. Rights of Local Residents As an SOC investment related public corporation that constructs dams, waterworks, and industrial complexes, there are inadvertent disputes with local residents in the process of implementing projects. Most are lawsuits related to property compensations. Out of the 13 lawsuit cases in 2009, 1 case has been solved, while 12 others are still in legal proceedings. Despite the proceedings, K-water is trying to protect the local citizens that have to leave their base of life, while expediently solving these cases. As part of a support package to provide support to local citizens that have had their base of life submerged after construction, K-water is providing diverse benefits to the to local citizens through the various support projects to areas adjacent to dams.  Strategy Approach Performances Challenges Strategy Before Project Initiation Society Influence on Local Communities Initiating Environmental Assessments for Each  Project Stage & Conducting Local Environmental Management By taking into consideration the environmental & social effects in each stage of a project, K-water is carrying-out sustainable water resource development. From the administrative planning stage of a K-water water resource project, suggestions & opinions from local citizens are collected. At the same time, a local council is established through the participation of local citizens and project related parties to alleviate various problems that might affect the local community. In addition, by participating in overseas water resource development projects, K-water is contributing to the sustainable development of those countries where the projects are being carried-out, by initiating environmental evaluations to implement sustainable development from the planning stage.  Strategic Environment Assessment As a strategic decision-making support measure taking into considering administration planning, which is the first stage in each development project, to environmental, economic and social effects, the environmental feasibility of a plan must be secured that contributes to an environmentally rational dam candidate location selection process achieved through strategic environment. Pre-environmental Review System As a policy to prevent any environmental impacts through the establishment of environmentally desirable administrative plans and development plans by reviewing the environmental effects and appropriateness of the selected development site based on administrative plans, which is the higher ranking stage in development projects, and development plans, the pre-environmental review helps in selecting an environment-friendly site when establishing basic plans for the construction of dams. When deciding on national projects such as the Youngju Multipurpose Dam and Bohyunsan Multipurpose Dam basic construction plans in 2009, a pre- environmental review was initiated. The review helped in decision-making by taking into consideration economical and technological factors, including environmental factors. Environmental Impacts Assessment As a policy to minimize any environmental impacts by projecting & evaluating the effects on the environment from the actual esigning stage of a development project, and by identifying methods to reduce the effects on the environment, K-water is trying to protect the local environment by searching for appropriate reduction methods through an environmental impact assessment when establishing actual plans for dam construction. In 2009, an environmental impact assessment was carried-out on large scale national projects such as the Youngju Multipurpose Dam and the Gyeong-in Ara Waterway Business. As a result, environmental impact reduction measures were established through the creation of ecological wetlands, fish ways and canals for desalinization.  Post Environmental Audit Through the environmental impact assessment, an environmental audit is carried-out from the start of construction at the 5th year of construction on the construction sites to make sure that agreements are strictly adhered to and any potential environmental impacts from construction and operations are prevented. Measures were established to minimize the environmental impacts by initiating post environmental audits on 16 projects including the Gunwi Multipurpose Dam, 4-River Restoration Business, Sihwa River Hydropower Plant, etc. Environment Restoration & Cultural Treasure Preservation Efforts are being taken to restore the local environment by creating environment-friendly facilities such as eco-corridors, fish ways and substitute habitats to prevent changes in the environment from water resource development projects, and to secure ecological soundness. As can be seen through the Jangheung Dam Seonsamun Cultural Park and the Daegok Dam Cultural Exhibition Hall construction, K-water is placing its effort on preserving local cultural assets that can be potentially submerged or damaged. Preventing Corruption Researching & Implementng Voluntary Improvement Measures  in Sectors which are Vulnerable to Corruption  Work transparency was been enhanced and anti-corruption internal controls were strengthened by identifying potentially vulnerable areas vulnerable in the face of corruption and by proposing measures to voluntary improve policies. 19 measures out of the 43 policy improvement implementation measures in 6 sectors were selected as excellent case measures by the Anti-Corruption & Civil Rights Commission. By reviewing the policy improvement implementation status quarterly, and regularly providing feedback on implementation performances, policy improvement measures are strictly reviewed to see whether they have been implemented. As a result, 100% of the measures have been implemented. Achieved 1st Place for Improvements based on  Overall Clean Index Evaluation Results K-water received 1st place in the overall clean index improvement status through various measures, including i) developing & operating a clean index assessment model for senior positions, ii) revising clean ethical regulations & strengthening punishment standards, iii) initiating a 3-dimensinal concentrated inspection on vulnerable sectors, iv) strengthening clean training for employees & executives (increased by 61% over the previous year to 15,958 people), v) establishing clean portals to increase the information flow between parties, vi) creating a clean activity differential compensation structure, vii) developing & operating a smart-type regular audit system, and viii) improving vulnerable work areas based on the diagnosis of corruption risks (BPR).
