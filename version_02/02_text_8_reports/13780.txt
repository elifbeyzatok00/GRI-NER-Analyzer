Arc International Sustainable Development Report 2010  Governance Arc International, l'Art de la Table 1825   Arc International employs 11,700 people worldwide, including about  7200 in France. The Group, which was founded in Arques in the  Pas-de-Calais region, achieved a turnover of 1.1 billion Euros in 2010.  With its know-how in glassware, it has grown internationally and to- day distributes a complete range of tableware concepts in over 160  countries.   The Group operates in consumer and hotel and restaurant mar- kets through its portfolio of brands, Luminarc, Arcoroc, Cristal  dArques Paris, Pyrex1, Chef & Sommelier. For over 40 years, the  Group has also served professional customers - industrialists, tra- ders, manufacturers of semi-finished and finished products, service  providers â€“ with a range of solutions tailored to meet their specific  requirements (for industry, advertising, premiums and loyalty pro- grams).   Arc International is active on five continents with production sites  (France, United States, China, United Arab Emirates), distribution  subsidiaries (France, United States, Spain, Australia, Mexico, Brazil,  Japan, South Africa) and liaison offices.   The Group has adopted a sustainable development approach to  balance economic requirements, social responsibility and respect for  the environment in all its activities, in particular, by joining the United  Nations Global Compact initiative in 2003.   1 Pyrex, a trademark of Corning Inc. is exploited by Arc International Cookware SAS  under exclusive license in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

The Group has been through an unfavorable period re- lated to a genuine industrial transformation. It has also  been heavily affected by the global crisis. Thanks to the  commitment of our teams, we have resolutely imple- mented our strategy to enable us to keep up with the  development of world markets. In a difficult economic  context, we have strengthened our positions in emer- ging countries, where we obtained very encouraging  results this past year. We also fulfilled our local commit- ments, particularly to the long-term future of our Arques  site. Has your transformation  strategy paid off?   Yes, we have strengthened the  influence of our brands (Luminarc,  Pyrex, Cristal dArques Paris, Arcoroc,  Chef & Sommelier), ramped up our pre- sence in emerging, high-growth countries  and continued with our major development ini- tiative which is essential to our progress. Thanks  to the continuous efforts of each of our employees  over the past few years, the Group has established  a solid foundation that means we can be confident  about our future. This year we demonstrated our abi- lity to take advantage of market upswings. Improved  industrial competitiveness, an ability to innovate and  a portfolio of strong brands are our key assets.   Why did you choose to include sustainable  development as a key principle for all the  companys major decisions?  Our social, societal and environmental performance  has become increasingly important, resonating with our  economic activity, with respect for our employees, cus- tomers, suppliers, partners, associations, communities,  etc. We are in the process of laying the foundations for a  far-reaching strategy with the objective of deploying tai- lored initiatives in all our business units on the five conti- nents. We will measure the effectiveness of each one, in  order to report back to groups such as the Global Com- pact and to all our stakeholders.   What role do your products play in your sus- tainable development policy? They are central to our work in that they unify it and  make it visible! Conveying French values in tableware,  Arc Internationals products are designed to make  a lasting contribution to the quality of life of millions of  families worldwide. Our new range of tableware deco- rated with organic-based inks is entirely consistent with  our approach. It not only offers innovative colors with  increased resistance to washing, but also avoids the use  of heavy metals and consumes less energy during ma- nufacturing. This new product line went down very well  with our customers, since it met their high expectations  for products respecting a natural balance. Interview with Guillaume de Fougires, Chairman of the Board  2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 5 Our products are central to our work in that  they unify it and make it visible!  Guillaume de Fougires  Since its creation, Arc International has sought to ba- lance economic requirements, social responsibility and  respect for the environment, through its commitment to  sustainable development. In 2003, and despite a difficult economic context, it  joined the UN Global Compact. This commitment trig- gered many initiatives on the part of employees in the  Groups various departments and units. These have  led to environmental and social progress, but have also  heightened awareness throughout the company.    Arc International now wants to go further in formalizing  its commitment, by introducing a structured master plan  to be deployed with specific goals and indicators to be  monitored. Over time this will enable sustainable deve- lopment to become more deeply entrenched in the cor- porate culture, as is already the case with the focus on  individuals and the search for energy savings. To successfully carry out this mission and strengthen its  commitment, Arc International appointed Caroline Bar- bier as Sustainable Development Manager in early 2011. Caroline Barbier, who has been with the Group since  2006, brought to this position her knowledge of the com- pany and an effective methodology that will combine  the Groups historical values with the need for a formal  framework, both internally and externally. This action is  part of the policy defined by Jos-Maria Aulotte, Director  of Human Resources, Communication and Sustainable  Development.  2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 7 Sharing the vision of a balanced future Arc International draws on a tradition of human values with continual innovation to ensure that  its future is built on a sustainable basis. The Group considers the welfare of its employees, the  environment in which its industrial facilities are set and the quality of life of its customers as of  paramount importance. Governance Governance Establishing  sustainable  deve- lopment in the corporate culture  and shaping a policy for the entire  Group is an exciting and full-time  activity. Whereas we still need to  reflect about which actions and de- cisions to implement in favor of sus- tainable development, they will no  doubt be natural reflexes tomorrow.  I know I can count on each Group  employees sense of responsibility  and commitment to achieve this.  Caroline Barbier, Corporate Sustainable  Development Manager Arc International Glass, a sustainable  product Resulting from the alchemy of mate- rials such as sand and the heat of fire,  glass is a natural and easily recyclable  material. It has many properties:   - Pure and clean, it is suitable for food containers,   - Resistant, it is ideal for industrial uses such as washing  machine windows,   - Transparent or opaque, all styles are possible,   - Resistant to both heat for cooking foods, then cold for  preserving them.   Arc International designs and manufactures a  wide range of products made of white glass, opal  glass, borosilicate, vitroceramic and even Kwarx,  Zenix and Diamax, new materials developed by  the Groups R&D teams. Some of these products  have become icons, such as the "balloon glass",  of which over a billion have been sold  2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 9 Governance Gouvernance Testimony Given the need to act for a future which embodies  more respect for people and the environment, and to  meet the expectations of our customers and consu- mers, we decided to systematize our efforts and moni- tor progress. Since the Group joined the Global Com- pact initiative in 2003, much has been done but we now  want to go further. Our goal is to deploy customized  initiatives in all our units, measure their effectiveness,  then report back to official bodies and share the results  with all our stakeholders. To ensure that our efforts are  based on internationally accepted practices and strate- gies, we have adopted the ISO 26000 standard, which  is the reference for corporate social responsibility and  which will help us to shape and guide our actions.  The  first step was to formalize our commitment and share  them with all Group employees.  We know that the task  is huge but that with perseverance time is on our side. Jos-Maria Aulotte, SVP of Human  Resources, Communication and Sustainable Development Arc International. Sytematizing our  efforts and  monitoring progress Since its creation, Arc International is watching to balance economical requirements, social responsibility and envi- ronmental respect, by registering its activities in a sustainable development approach.  Over the Group's commitments, sustainable development is taking a growing place in the overall economical activi- ties like for our suppliers, customers or partners.  Therefore, after a first step that we saw in 2003 to join the Global Compact of the United Nations, today, our ap- proach needs to be structured. Our goal is to display adapted initiatives in all entities, to measure its efficiency, to  report to official authorities and to share with all stakeholders.  We have chosen to make our products the unifying element in our sustainable development action. Both aesthetic,  resistant and accessible, there must facilitate the day-to-day life of our customers around the world while being res- pectful of our historic values of perpetuity, respect of women and men and the environment. To base us on practices and world-renowned approach, we have adopted the ISO 26 000 standard which is the  reference for corporate social responsibility and help us to shape and guide our actions.  We reject simple statements of intention and affirm our determination to act today and tomorrow. To ensure the  perpetuity and progress of our approach, a steering will be established and will include:  - Axes of work and objectives  - Indicators of progress and performance measurement  - Regular reviews  With the publication of our annual report and raising awareness actions we will associate always better employees  and partners.  We register our sustainable development policy in commitments in which everyone will meet: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT COMMITMENT  Respect the principles of   the Global Compact initiative Introduced by the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, the Global Compact initiative  defines the values to be taken into account to ensure that a companys activities com- ply with human rights and sustainable development. Since 2003, Arc International has  been committed to its ten principles on human rights, labor standards, respect for the  environment and ethics:  Human rights 1. Support and respect the protection of international law on human rights within their sphere of influence. 2. Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.  Labor standards 3. Uphold the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. 4. Eliminate all forms of forced or compulsory labor.  5. Abolish child labor.  6. Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Respect for the environment  7. Apply the precautionary approach to environmental challenges.  8. Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility.  9. Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.   Ethical standards  10. Work against corruption in all its forms.   This commitment, made on a global level, concerns all the Groups sites.

The past  year was a profitable one for the Group thanks to the de- ployment of its ongoing transformation plan and strong  brand awareness, especially in emerging countries  (Russia, China, Middle East and Latin America), which  now account for 36% of total turnover. The significant  sales growth in these countries (+26%) contrasts with  lower activity in Western Europe and is accompanied by  a stable balance between the different Group activities  (Consumer Goods, Food Service, BtoB). Current operating income amounted to 40.6 million  Euros, compared with -33.6 million in 2009 (IFRS com- parable data). Net income reached 10 million Euros. The  net debt/EBITDA ratio in 2010 was 0.67, its best level  in five years. Rigorous management of inventory and  control of investments improved the Group's cash flow.  The debt ratio is being monitored constantly to allow the  investments needed to pursue the Group's strategy and  expand its activities. The Group's development is focused on four major  strategic guidelines: innovation, market growth, brand  strength and adding value. Innovation Arc International maintains its position as leader in ta- bleware by continually introducing new products. This  requires significant investment each year accounting  for about 3% of turnover and came to more than 30  million in 2010. Research & Development employs 260  people, including 70 engineers, and involves over 700  people in the Group. A new laboratory was inaugurated  at the Arques site, in order to provide optimized working  conditions for all the teams. Forty projects were comple- ted in 2010, guided by four priorities:  - Development of breakthrough  technology, such as  new product materials (Zenix, Diamax, etc.);  - Reduction in production costs, such as a new tempe- ring process enabling savings of 20% in industrial costs;  - Flexibility to facilitate changes in product lines;  - Optimization of investments, such as improvement of  the molds, with an expected gain of 40%.  Economics Economics By strengthening its presence in emerging countries and improving the effectiveness of its organi- zations, Arc International emerged form the red and posted profits in 2010. R&D, the Groups  driving force  Every year 3% of turnover is  dedicated to R&D. 260 people work in the department, including 70 engineers. More than 40 projects are  undertaken every year.  2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 13 Economics Economics 2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 12 Market growth   Europe :  The year was a difficult one for the retail sector, with cost  reductions that that still failed to return to growth. Sales  rose slightly, but still suffered from significant pressure  on prices. To increase its market share in this region, the  Group made significant efforts to increase the supply of  entry-level products. This strategy proved successful,  with sales in distributor brands increasing from 9 mil- lion in 2009 to 11.5 million in 2010. Strong growth is  expected in 2011. This progress meant that the plant at  Arques was able to run at full capacity, with additional  production of 11%.  Americas:  Production capacity was exploited to the full and devo- ted primarily to high-margin segments. This strategy paid  off for both turnover (+2%) and profit (+70%). Growth  was particularly strong in Brazil, where sales were 30%  above target. International :   Performance was remarkable, with turnover up 19%.  The International division now covers 25 countries on  three continents, with a turnover of nearly $400 million,  accounting for a third of the Group's business, com- pared with a quarter two years ago. Its offer meets the  expectations of many emerging countries (China, India,  etc.) where consumption habits are changing rapidly.  Four synergy projects have allowed Arc International to  exploit this positive context:   - Increased production capacity: +50% in China with  the commissioning of the China 1+ furnace. A similar  approach is being conducted at the Ras Al Khaimah  site, with a new furnace becoming operational in 2011;   - Support for distributors: this enables more accurate  sales forecasts and more innovative products;   - Marketing of new reference products: 22% compared  with 15% in 2009;  - Reorganization of the sales force: four teams deployed  in four areas.

Luminarc constantly draws on your expectations and its products are  always fashionable. Inspired by current and future trends, designers and engineers are crea- ting modern, functional and original items. The world's leading tableware brand, Luminarcis supported by advertising campaigns in  several emerging countries.  Arcoroc embodies expertise for professionals. The brand is  renowned for its quality, durability and functionality. It covers all the needs of commercial and ins- titutional catering (Hotels-Restaurants-Communities). Arcoroc offers a complete multi-material  range: glass, porcelain tableware and stainless steel cutlery. The spirit of Cristal d'Arques Paris is a sophistica- ted mix of creativity, pleasure, tradition and quality,  with a twist of French elegance, the joy of giving, and always at affordable  prices! Everyday luxury and beauty for all is the philosophy behind Cristal  d'Arques Paris.  This has been the brand's philosophy for more than 40 years,  perpetuated through a brilliant innovation, Diamax. A material that respects na- ture, while offering exceptional qualities of purity, brilliance and strength. Specializing in cookware, Pyrex products are now found everywhere in the kitchen,  offering a complete multi-material range (glass, steel, metal,  microwave plastic and ceramic) and provides a solution tailored to  consumer needs.  The Chef & Sommelier brand evokes the tradition and heritage of French wine. Enti- rely expert-oriented, it encompasses all the lines dedicated to wine and gastronomy.  These collections, based heavily on innovative technologies, have all been tested and  approved by a panel of wine experts. Kwarx is a new high-tech material, developed  by the Research Center of Arc International and used exclusively by the Chef & Som- melier brand. Traveling through the diverse terroirs of the world, Chef & Sommelier  invites you to discover or rediscover the sensory richness of wines.

These fea- tures will be very practical in everyday life  but will also enable consumers to make  significant savings in water thanks to ea- sier cleaning, and in energy consumption  thanks to faster drying. The project will continue until 2014, in par- tnership with the Ecole Nationale Supe- rieure de Chimie in Lille and the University  of Lille 1. The aim of Atmosverre is to adapt a tech- nology already used for flat glass to hollow  glass. As well as its benefits in terms of the  products, this new technology could enable  environmental and social progress in terms  of reduced atmospheric emissions and  worker exposure to hazardous materials.   2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 14 Turnover (in billion euros) 2009 2010 1,0 1,1 0,5  1 1,5 This is the gross sales (in millions of Euros) mi- nus production, marketing, administrative and  structural costs.

Net debt is the amount owed to financial organizations  (banks, etc.). EBITDA means Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depre- ciation, and Amortization and represents the sum generated by the  companys business before these and other exceptional charges.  This ratio sheds a useful light on a companys capacity to reimburse  its debts. A healthy ratio is one where net debt is no more than three  times the EBITDA. At just 0.7, our debt ratio is at its most favorable for  several years. It enables the Group to satisfy its social commitments,  while still being able to invest heavily in the Arques site, as well as in all  its other production sites. The Group has defined a new business model, which  aims to reduce production costs in France to a level  sufficient to maintain significant regional activity, while  still investing in research, development and marketing.  Several actions undertaken in 2010 have furthered this  approach, such as payroll centralization for the French  companies and the rationalization of catalog publishing.  In Europe too, the launch of SAP modules for Supply  Chain and Sales is designed to further improve the per- formance of business units. Although it has made significant progress, the end-of- year result of the Arques site remains negative and is the  primary objective of the Groups transformation plan.  The actions already undertaken to add value have conti- nued, with increased efforts in inventory turnover and  the implementation of the announced restructuring plan.  The Ambition Arques program is aimed at the industrial  side and the reduction of manufacturing costs, whereas  the Profile program focuses on other functions. Recep- tion, courier services and the switchboard have been  outsourced at a lower cost and a guaranteed service le- vel. The site must achieve the planned competitiveness  gains of around 20% to ensure that business is profitable  over the long haul. For this, it can draw on its recognized  know-how and technological expertise. The best prac- tices developed will gradually be deployed, in order to  continuously improve the other production sites.   Adding value   Testimony  With its Better Tomorrow Plan, Sodexo has built its strategy and actions around sustainable deve- lopment. Our suppliers are key stakeholders and were taken into account when drawing up our plan  to give it the best chance of succeeding. Our intention is not to impose anything on them, but to build  a strong partnership of reciprocal benefit to our businesses, our communities and our planet. Today's consumers no longer hesitate to tell us how much they pay attention to the foods they eat and  the tableware they use. We need our suppliers to help us meet current demands and anticipate future  ones. Beyond the successes that we enjoy today, this will enable us to be a leader in the long-term, in a  constantly changing world. Arc International provides its expertise so we can define together the best  choices for the environment, while meeting market expectations. We are delighted to work with them  since we share the same values. To pursue our common goals, it is important that Arc International  continues to develop yet more effective measurement systems for its products and to help us to offer  the right choices to our customers.

Indicators have been developed to measure the tangible  results of the initiatives and energy consumption criteria  is being systematically integrated into calls for bids by the  purchasing department in order to acquire new, more effi- cient equipment.  Using less energy Substantive efforts have been made to improve burner  technology. This has led to energy savings of more than  50% for the same performance, between 2004 and  2010. The burners account for about 10% of the total  energy consumption at the Arques plant. Commissioning  of this new equipment has been supported by the R&D  teams who are training and educating operators on its  optimum settings. The deployment of these more econo- mical burners will be completed at the Arques site in 2011  and will then continue at other Group sites.    Training staff   Technology alone is not enough, the behavior of each  employee counts. Specific training in the correct use of  equipment, in order to reduce energy consumption, has  been included in the technical training of production per- sonnel. Around a hundred people were trained in 2010.  As a result of the continued mobilization over the past few  years, the various actions at the Arques site have led to  lower energy consumption, equating to a saving of 8  to 10 million Euros per year. Creating more energy-efficient furnaces  The AGMS company, a subsi- diary of Arc International spe- cialized in glass melting and  part of the Technology Cen- ter, has focused its expertise  on developing a new more  efficient furnace. The L furnace reached the end of its excep- tionally long life in September 2010 and has been rebuilt. Du- ring 2011, the new more modern, more ecological and more  efficient furnace will be fitted with an electrostatic filter that  reduces dust far below the maximum levels set by Europe,  it will also lead to energy savings of about 15%. This  furnace will consume less energy over its entire lifetime on  a constant basis, whereas the consumption of a traditional  furnace increases as it ages over the years. In the United Arab Emirates, AIME is not far behind. The ins- tallation on production lines of Kevlar conveyor belts not re- quiring preheating resulted in savings of $140,000 in energy  costs in 2010. Solar water heaters are expected to meet the water heating  needs of the plate cleaning unit before the decorative pat- terns are applied. Each year, this installation should be able  to heat about 730 m3 of water and thus save 60,000 kw/h.  Other solar installation projects are being considered.  Environment The Group continued its efforts to address the environmental aspects of its activities. Reducing  energy consumption, controlling emissions and waste recycling are integrated with product and  process development projects. Employees are increasingly aware of these environmental issues and  are adopting more fairer behavior and gestures.  AIME : Solar water heaters  2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 18 2010-2011 Sustainable Development Report - page 19 More and more waste recycling Waste sorting is now practiced daily by all our produc- tion units in France and abroad.  Three recommendations have been crucial for raising  the awareness of all teams of the importance of recy- cling waste: - Sort the waste according to the signs on the different  waste bins,  - Throw away as little mixed waste as possible, - Minimize production of waste as far as possible. These guidelines introduced over several years have  paid off because today the amount of waste has begun  falling significantly. It is increasingly recycled and seen by  staff as a source of income if sorted correctly. Efforts to  seek opportunities for recycling, reuse, sorting, etc. are  increasing in the Group.  The canteens at the  Arques site have set  up their own waste  sorting system. After  their meal, custo- mers are invited to  sort all their bottles  or cans. A second  sorting takes place  when  trays  are  cleared by the res- taurant staff. Waste from 1350 meals is thus sorted  every day.   Recycling Waste recycling also involves seeking  opportunities. Sodium carbonate, an  essential raw material in the compo- sition of glass, is used in fine powder  form. However, it must be kept dry as  it otherwise agglomerates into lumps  when in contact with the walls of the barges  that transport  it. As it is very difficult to  grind once hardened,  part of the cargo be- comes unusable. The  Arques unit contacted  a French company that  uses this sodium car- bonate as a degreaser  for mechanical parts.  Sixty tons were there- fore recycled in 2010. Precious metals such  as tin and molybdenum  are recovered by staff  and recycled as raw  material for other companies. Five tons of tin and 1.4  tons of molybdenum were recovered in 2010. All com- mon metals (iron, copper, aluminum, etc.) and metal  products are also targeted by this recovery and recy- cling system.  An oil recycling program was implemented to separate  used oil. Black oil cannot be recycled and is used as  fuel, whereas light oils are recycled and reused.  Athna Athna,  The  Groups  indus- trial machinery engineering and  construction division, is part of  the Technology Center which  offers technical expertise and  advanced know-how to external  customers. One of these is a  company specializing in the re- processing of waste from elec- trical appliances and television sets, based in the north  of France, which plans to create an automatic line for  reprocessing LCD screens. It employs people who are  suffering social and professional difficulties. Following a  feasibility study, it chose Athna to produce the machi- nery for the recycling.  New solutions   Improved waste management is synonymous with its  reduction at the source, but also with a greater choice  of environmentally-friendly products. The Equipment  workshop at the Arques unit has tested a new ecolo- gical and economic concept of an absorbent product,  used for accidental or residual spillage of oil on the floor  during manufacturing. This product, made from fiber, is  sprinkled on the ground and absorption is immediate.  The mixture is then collected and put into a container  fitted with a screen which captures the encapsulated oil.  The recovery of the surplus reduces both consumption  of the product and the amount of waste generated. As  the product contains no chemicals, there is no risk to the  environment or health of users. Environment Level of CO2 emissions The development of local production units close to new markets in the Middle  East and Southeast Asia has a strong impact on the Groups global CO2 emis- sions, by reducing transportation between production sites and customers. In reviewing its energy supply choices, AGN has managed to reduce its emis- sion rate by 38% since 2008. Thus for the same level of production, it has  avoided the emission of 84,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. Finally, fol- lowing the carbon footprint assessment of its business, AIC Chteauroux ini- tiated measures to optimize its manufacturing processes and its transport.  At Group level, the CO2 emitted per metric ton of top-grade glass produced fell  by 1.6% between 2008 and 2010.   Water savings at all levels Like the energy savings, water has become an important issue for Arc Interna- tional involving optimization of water consumption, leak detection, elimination  of unnecessary use, use of alternative sources, use of inferior quality water,  effluent recycling, etc. Water consumption was thus reduced globally in 2010, mainly due to innume- rable local actions often initiated by an individual team or employee, such as  the saving realized for a surface treatment in the decorative pattern preparation  workshop at the Arques unit. Water consumption was very high, about 2400  liters per day. A water recycling principle was proposed by an employee, with  a closed circuit treatment process. This system has reduced water consump- tion to 10 liters per day, i.e. 240 times less than the initial rate!  In China, at AGN, after a difficult 2009 due to the non-saturation of industrial  processes, water consumption decreased significantly in 2010 by -26%. At AIC, the reduction in water consumption continues. The actions taken are  supported both by the Cook n'Care project and also by the ISO 14001 certifi- cation process, which should be completed in September 2011.  All these actions saved more than 500,000 m3 in 2010 compared to 2009  for a comparable level of production!   Regular analysis of discharges Discharges, whether via water or air, are monitored regularly to ensure that  they are not toxic for the surrounding natural environment and to verify com- pliance with the standards in force. Manufacturing processes are reviewed  and improved to lower emissions, and studies on the composition of the glass  and the products used to make it are carried out to ensure that the most harm- ful substances are removed and replaced with more environmentally-friendly  substances. For example, a new dust collection system has reduced the amount of dust  emissions beyond the required thresholds. These air emissions are analyzed  five times a year. The quality of water discharged into the natural environment is also monitored  every month and compliance of the indicators is validated annually by an inde- pendent laboratory. At AIC in Chateauroux, the use of components such as boron has become  more effective, due to the implementation of safeguards to limit it being stirred  up in the truck unloading areas and ongoing research on ways to reduce the  amount used in manufacturing.  Color Vibrance,  an  example of how a more  environmentally-frien- dly product can also  be a technological and  aesthetic innovation.  Luminarc has launched  Color Vibrance, a new col- lection with decorative pat- terns made with organic- based inks. This full range  of glass tableware conveys  the Groups environmen- tal values to consumers,  respecting  their  health  and well-being more than  ever. The decorations do  not contain heavy metals,  typically used in the gla- zing methods. With a wide  range of bright colors, the  new organic decoration  process enables the crea- tion of new effects: woven,  optical illusions, photo- graphs, to reproduce the  colors and patterns found  in nature. Designed to be  dishwasher-proof,  they  retain their intensity and  brilliance.

However, it can be seen that the search for specific  waste recycling systems is an important objective for all            units.     2008  2009  2010 europe  2 969  1 464  1 660 International  119  123  120 north America  183  22  12 ToTAL  3 271  1 609  1 792 2008/2010      -45,2% Sorting and recycling metal  Metric tons of metal Testimony  At AGN, we launched the project to introduce organic-based inks in April 2010. The product development  and production teams have been made aware of the benefits of organic decorations and trained in the  new manufacturing processes. At the same time, the production machines and equipment for preparing  the inks were installed jointly by French and Chinese teams. Experts from AIF R&D and production came  to train the AGN staff, set up and regulate the start-up processes and share their experience.  With the organic-based inks, AGN has been able to save about 90% of energy for decoration and to reduce  the number of ink products in stock while offering a wider range of colors.  By the end of 2011, most of our  decorated products will have changed technology and will be made with organic-based inks. In China, consumers are increasingly sensitive to food and hygienic food containers and the government  has introduced highly effective measures for consumer goods. Customers like the 'organic-based' concept  and particularly the absence of heavy metals in the decorative patterns.  The project has been a success  for the French and Chinese teams who worked on it. Julia Xu, Project  Manager for New  Product Development Arc International In China, consumers are  increasingly sensitive to food  and hygienic food containers In 2007, Arc International launched the Dcouverre pro- ject, as part of the MAUD (Materials and Applications for  Sustainable Use) competitiveness cluster, with financial  support from the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and  Industry and the Nord-Pas-de-Calais Regional Council.  It was conducted in close partnership with the Labo- ratory of production processes for functional coatings  (PERF) and the Laboratory of organic and macromole- cular chemistry (LCOM) of the Materials and Processing  Unit at the Ecole Nationale Suprieure de Chimie in Lille  and the University of Lille 1. This project has developed a  new 100% organic method for polychrome decoration,  offering intense color and high dishwasher resistance.  The use of organic-based materials prevents harm- ful emissions, unlike with glazed decorations that use  heavy metals. In addition, firing decorations at 200C  instead of 600C for glazed decorations reduces energy  consumption and thus the carbon footprint of these pro- ducts. The use of organic-based ink decorations is up  sharply at the Arques site. They accounted for 30% of  decorated items produced in 2010.    and in China Faithful to its principles, Arc International is also deve- loping the best technologies at its international sites.  In 2010, after successful commissioning at the Arques  site, the organic-based ink decorations were deployed  in the Nanjing unit in China, with French collaboration.  The teams at the Arques site worked with their Chinese  counterparts to transfer the knowledge and experience  acquired in France. Concern for the environment is growing strongly with  Asian customers, particularly in China. In a recent sur- vey conducted in various Asian countries, 65% of res- pondents said they would "hold back from buying a pro- duct if they thought the company manufacturing it did  not respect the rules of environmental protection and  ethical practices. This included 89% in China, where  the concept of sustainable development is becoming for  consumers a symbol of a new status. By the end of 2010, the use of organic-based inks already  accounted for 24% of decorated tableware production.  The objective is to achieve 85-90% of organic designs  by late 2011, with glazing only being used for decorative  patterns that cannot be achieved with organic-based  inks.  The development of organic-based  decorative patterns in France ... 240 times less      water used The involvement and creativity  of one employee led to water  consumption in his workshop  being cut drastically. By propo- sing the development of a water  recycling principle with a closed  circuit treatment process, wa- ter consumption fell from 2400  liters to 10 liters per day. An ideal  example to follow!   Social 2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 23 Giving all employees the opportunity to help shape  their future By expanding its operations to new activities and new  geographical areas, the Group has reached a scale that  makes it essential to be able to reconcile the social and  human dimensions with the growth strategy. Aware of  the importance and wealth of human capital in the life of  the Group, Arc International attaches great importance  to its human resources policy. The Groups development and long-term future de- pends on its ability to create a balance between indus- trial professionalism, historical values, and the recent  changes to the Group. This modernization process is  accompanied by a human resources policy, which aims  to be proactive and sensitive to individual needs while  ensuring collective and individual development. Safety first   Employee safety is a priority for Arc International. Com- munication campaigns and programs on risk prevention  and reduction of harsh working conditions are conti- nuing, thus ensuring that safety becomes more deeply  rooted in the culture and daily life of employees.  Mana- gers, operators and safety departments are working  hand in hand to continually improve and capitalize on  best practices.  In the UAE, a major safety plan was implemented in four  areas:  Structure  The organization has been reassessed and the number  of staff responsible for safety has been increased five- fold, to improve expertise and coordination;   Visual safety measures  New signage has been intro- duced at the site and new uni- forms have increased the visibility  of personnel;  Safety culture A training program has taught the  'Golden Rules' of safety to mana- gers, safety delegates and all employees;  Improvement of all safety-related systems  At Arques,  the 21 buildings have now been fitted with  automatic fire detectors to ensure even greater safety  for people and property. In the United States, DGMC has continued to actively  promote "Priority Safety" at the Milville site, by deve- loping its challenge scheme to reward safety-related  initiatives. In 2011, a Group safety plan will be launched with ambi- tious targets for reducing rates of frequency and severity  of accidents. The plan will also facilitate sharing of best  practices.  Social In France, the Group has undertaken a project to support the development of the Arques site and its  company culture beyond the restructuring phase. For all Arc International subsidiaries and offices  around the world, the health and safety of employees remains a priority, as is developing the tech- nical expertise of local staff through training. At Arc International Cookware, the initiative entitled  a 'Great Place to Work' has been rolled out.   AIME : Hight visibility vests  Safety instructions  2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 25 Encouraging employees to take  care of their health Just like with safety, the health of our personnel is a ma- jor concern throughout the Group. Initiatives tailored to  each site and each cultural and political context, have  been implemented in the different entities. Even though  we have easy access to healthcare in France we should  not forget that this is not the case in all other countries.   The AIME site in the United Arab Emirates offers its  employees medical assistance, access to a clinic and a  health insurance system.  The Millville site in the United States has set up a free  individual Health Program, in partnership with private  healthcare organizations.    Arc International France, for its part, has continued its  activities to prevent alcohol-abuse. Between February  2007 and September 2010, the Tolrance Ecoute Res- pect Group organized nearly 600 information meetings  at Arques on addiction to alcohol. They have therefore  addressed 85% of the workforce, or close to 5650  people.     Engaging in sports Sport is essential for maintaining good health. Arc International France, with its many sports facilities  and its association, the Arc International Sports and  Cultural Association (ASCAI) is contributing to this. In  2010, AIF received the Corporate Sports Facilities tro- phy that rewards efforts made over almost 40 years to  allow employees to engage in as many sporting activi- ties as possible, under the best conditions. The award  was presented on January 18, 2010 at Roland Garros  by the Agora du Sport forum and the French Federation  for Corporate Sports.  Promoting the integration of people with disabilities or  difficulties The employment of disabled workers and the professio- nal integration of young people in difficulty are important  elements of social responsibility.   AIF For many years, Arc International France (AIF) has fol- lowed and supported these most vulnerable groups.  After being one of the first companies in its region to  sign an agreement for the integration of disabled wor- kers, AIF established the Lobel workshop in 1993, to  help disabled people to join the work mainstream. Jobs  have been found for 40 disabled workers in packaging,  forming small objects, printing, work on demand and  pressing. The creation of the Briqueterie workshop has broade- ned the scale of the Groups social action, by hosting  young people in difficulty, since 1997. The workshops  objective is to reintegrate these young people socially  and teach them a trade to give them a real chance of  working professionally. The courses are individualized  and built around full-time training in the industrial envi- ronment. As part of the 7th company agreement for the employ- ment of people with disabilities within AIF for the years  2010 to 2012, an audit was conducted by an outside  firm. This led to a diagnosis on job retention and pro- posed areas of action, such as training and specific job  development.   AIC Arc International Cookware in Chateauroux has worked  for several years with the vocational rehabilitation center  (CAT) in Richers-Les-Aubry. Following a discussion ai- med at integrating people with difficulties in a factory en- vironment, there are now ten disabled people working  in production as day labor. These people are already  familiar with the work but they had to become accus- tomed to working alongside other employees and in a  noisier environment. Three years on, there have been  no incidents or accidents and one of the jobs has been  transformed into a permanent contract.  Social Social Millville site   We are a family business, very atten- tive to the safety of our staff. When we  launched our Vision Zero project, we set  ourselves high goals which we would  not have been able to achieve without a  strong cultural emphasis on safety in the  company. We also felt that it would be a  great asset to let our customers join us  in this challenge. That's what happened  with Arc International. The company par- ticipated in all the discussions we held to  promote our program, and this even led  them to change their own requirements.  We have just completed 2000 days wit- hout a workplace accident requiring  stoppage or medical treatment. I am hap- py that Arc International are associated  with this performance. To continue in this  direction and go even further, I hope they  will remain as involved as they have been  in recent years.  Kenneth Brown, Director of Retail Logis- tics Solutions, Linfox Australia, partner of  Arc Distribution Oceania. Arc International is  strongly involved in  our safety program 2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 24 Develop ergonomic work stations Alongside the safety measures and supplementing risk prevention,  a greater overall effort is being made to improve working conditions  in the most arduous jobs.   Adapting the workplace   At AIF in Arques, the many projects to make our production lines  more competitive have been successful while also improving wor- king conditions in physically arduous jobs. For instance, on a vitroceramic dish production line, cleaning by  hand previously required the operator to carry heavy loads and  make difficult and repetitive gestures. These are now done by a  robot, with the operators role becoming one of enhanced quality  control. The added value of the human expertise has been retai- ned, while the arduous work has been transferred to the robot. The  same approach was applied to a production line for washing ma- chine windows. Faced with the highly positive results of these pro- jects in 2010, the company chose to implement them throughout  the site in 2011.  Rest areas In China, the heat  and humidity of the  climate add to the  arduous nature of  the work on furnaces  and machinery. Cool,  calm rest areas have  now been provided  for the production  staff to enable them to recover efficiently during work breaks.  In the supply chain too The AIF supply chain has also made worker safety and comfort a  priority. The warehouse road has been repaired to eliminate sources  of vibration for drivers of handling equipment. Ten order-picking ma- chines, about 30% of the fleet, were replaced in 2010, and now have  ergonomic seats and shock-absorbing mats. The new equipment  was chosen by working groups made up of users, the workplace  health and safety committee (CHSCT), an ergonomist and the occu- pational physician. The trains carrying goods from one warehouse to  another are now fitted with cameras and ergonomic seats to prevent  twisting of the operators torso during maneuvers. Some machines were virtually custom-made and adapted to specific  back problems and operator size. Training in the  Prevention  of  risks  associa- ted with physi- cal activity has  begun with 600  people  atten- ding courses in  2010. A total of  4000 people will  be trained within  three years.  These courses are designed both to prevent risks and to  give employees the possibility of proposing improvements  to their workplace. In 2011, studies on heat and noise are being conducted  to measure their impact and propose suitable solutions.  Ironing activity to  the Lobel workshop  2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 27 Better Living at Work   The far-reaching changes made by Arc International  France, which are indispensable to the survival of the  historic site of Arques, have been a source of stress  for some employees. In order to provide the necessary  support for its teams, the company has set up a preven- tion and action plan to combat suffering at work called  Mieux Vivre au Travail (Better Living at Work). A survey was first conducted by an outside firm to  measure the general situation. All employees received  a questionnaire and 38% of them responded. Over 80  individual and group interviews were also conducted  as part of this initiative. A steering committee of around  twenty people has been created to deploy the approach  throughout the company. The survey revealed that the  many changes and projects undertaken have stirred  up feelings of discomfort, stress or injustice in some  employees. However, Arc International is fortunate in  being able to build on its identified strengths such as  their pride in its business, a spirit of mutual assistance  and sharing of best practice and high motivation on the  part of its managers. In response to the results, a five-point action plan was  defined: - Provide psychosocial support to accompany the trans- formation program; - Instill a culture of wellbeing within the company; - Support the cultural evolution of the Arc International  model;  - Monitor the implementation of the human resources  policy and strategy; - Provide support for the organizational changes to the  work activity. Based on the projects results, a three-year agreement  on psychosocial risks has been signed with the labor  unions. It sets out consensus-based action plans and  how they will be monitored by a commission. Social Social 2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 26 Renewed memoranda of un- derstanding to improve working conditions  Constructive dialogue is in the interests of labor and ma- nagement and hence of the company, but primarily of  employees. Accordingly, two memoranda of understanding on profes- sional equality between men and women and the employ- ment of senior workers were signed at AIF in 2010. Gender equality The first agreement affirms AIFs commitment to promoting  equality in the workplace and gender diversity in all sectors  and at all levels of the company: access to employment, vo- cational training, working conditions, career development,  etc. It ensures the implementation of tangible measures to  guarantee that men and women are treated with the same  respect. Employment of seniors The second MOU was implemented on January 1, 2010  for a period of three years. AIF must ensure that it does not  deprive itself of a valuable asset by rejecting the skills and ex- perience of older workers. An important decision taken was  to continue the mentoring program whereby young wor- kers can benefit from the experience of older workers. The  tutor's status is thus reaffirmed and experience becomes an  asset. For the trainee, this is a different way of learning, which  supplements formal training. The MOU also addresses the  need to facilitate continued employment until the employee  decides to retire. Thus, all employees over 45 years old will  systematically be offered an interview to help them better  define the second part of their career.  Continued investment in training For Arc International training is a fundamental part of hu- man resources management. This is an important theme  that touches on the needs and interests of both the com- pany and its employees. Indeed, throughout their career,  employees must be able to train to improve, expand their  skills, change jobs or even acquire a degree. The rate of  training at Arc International France increased from 1.65%  in 2002 to over 3.7% in 2010 with a rate of 4.89% in 2008.  The 2009-2011 training plan has been developed  around four guidelines:   - Developing the employability of the least skilled  employees, by offering vocational training leading to qua- lifications.  The company has undertaken to implement  training leading to qualifications on a voluntary basis. From  September 2005 to September 2010, 352 employees sig- ned up to attend a diploma course. Each year, between 70 and 80 employees benefit from a  company-funded training contract leading to a new pro- fessional qualification. As a result of this investment, 70%  of employees earning diplomas have changed jobs since  2005. This measure accounts for a total of 40,000 hours  of training per year.   - Supporting the deployment of major corporate projects.  Priority has been given to employees with a supervisory or  leadership role to better train them in management, pre- vention and detection of psychosocial risks and to enable  them to implement more smoothly the organizational  changes planned for in the recovery plan for the Arques  site. - Maintaining professional expertise and skills that will  provide the means for employees to maintain a competi- tive edge so that Arc International remains on top. - Supporting employees with their plans for voluntary  redundancy, recognition of prior learning (VAE), creation of  spin-offs, etc. This ambitious training plan helped Arc International win  the Corporate Trophy - Training category awarded by  the newspapers La Voix du Nord/LEtudiant at the regio- nal vocational training fair held at the Lille Grand Palais.  Several employees also received awards in the Individual  Training Leave and Recognition of Prior Learning (VAE)  categories.   Basic knowledge Moreover, faced with an alarming statistic: 13% of em- ployees in France have great difficulty reading and writing,  Arc International and GRETA (the French vocational trai- ning network) have set up a support scheme to improve  proficiency in basic skills. Thanks to the ADELE project,  employees received 280 hours of refresher training in  2010. Some obtained a CFG (Certificate of General Edu- cation) and others access to a diploma course. A new  group of 27 employees will follow this training course in  2011.  Outside France, training has focused on the technical di- mension to give greater autonomy to our production units  and improve the level of skills of local staff.   Managerial training is provided within the Group in order  to give managers working tools and a common manage- ment culture. In 2010, 20% of Group managers attended  at least one management training course. The goal for  2011 is to increase training for staff outside France in parti- cular to support international development.   Testimony Did employees embrace the project? There was a real group commitment, including by staff representatives, from the very start of the project.  The 18 members of the Steering Committee all made themselves available, while allowing us total freedom  to carry out the survey. The people we met were very involved in the actions. Their personal investment  goes far beyond what we have seen in other companies. The Group's total commitment to the project  facilitated the study. It's an ideal example for this type of project  What was most striking for you? At Arc International there is a strong human culture, shared by all employees, production workers, local  supervisors, managers, etc. It is an essential touchstone. The difficulty is in abandoning the old paterna- listic protector model to become a player oneself in the company. Everyone wonders how to achieve this. A change in culture is envisaged in the long run, but without compromising human values. How can the company move forward? The study led to the implementation of action plans. This is very positive because it shows that there is a ge- nuine desire to support change. Apart from the action plans, it is above all the right attitude that is needed,  driven by senior management. But the priority right now is to move on from the restructuring. People have  had to put up with it for several years and everyone wants to start working on the next step. We can contri- bute to this new culture, but above all it is up to the company to write its own future. Arc International is  fortunate in being a family business, with shareholders who give it the means to achieve long-term stability.  Didier Logerais, Juliette Cauwel and Henry Clty, from the consulting firm Toit de  Soi, partner of Arc International France in the Mieux Vivre au Travail project.  The culture of human  value is vital for  the Group Training in AIME  Support the changes at the  Arques site   To safeguard the  Arques site over  the long term, AIF  introduced a com- petitiveness  and  workforce  reduc- tion plan in early  2004. This required  the number of employees to be cut from around 11,000  in early 2004, to 5750 by early 2012. True to its histori- cal social values, the company has made every effort to  avoid compulsory redundancy. Nearly 2600 employees  have retired or taken early retirement, and about 1150  have chosen the voluntary redundancy plan. The plan is supported by various measures: - A training effort well above the legal requirement to help  employees develop a career plan. - An Employment and Mobility Center offering persona- lized assistance: the possibility of training or retraining wit- hin the local business area, mobility solutions, etc. - Mobility Forums held periodically. Six forums presented  the industry sectors which are hiring such as healthcare  and construction or starting new businesses, while two  were dedicated to recruitment with the participation of  firms that are hiring. - Regeneration initiatives have been conducted in the local  area to attract new businesses and promote job creation. The plan moves to the rhythm of the companys business.  With production forecasts for 2011 revised upwards and  an agreement on flexible working time signed with the  labor unions, 110 jobs were saved in 2010. The voluntary  redundancy plan was extended in order to support the  566 people identified as no longer needed by the compa- ny at the end of 2011, in building their professional future.   An effective scheme for  retraining-mobility Arc International has continued to develop its retraining- mobility scheme. During the period from June 1, 2008  to December 31, 2010, more than 1000 people were as- sisted by the Employment and Mobility Center, of whom  over 400 were able to bring their mobility plans to fruition.  In addition, 301 employees were regraded with 90,000  hours of training. As part of the 2nd Professional Retraining Trophies orga- nized by the French Association for Adult Vocational Trai- ning (AFPA), Arc International was awarded  the Enterprise and Retraining Award. The  qualitative (support/tools in place for the em- ployees concerned) and quantitative (number  of employees regraded or retrained) aspects  of the performance of the Groups scheme  were eva- luated. For its part, Arc Interna- tional Cookware in Cha- teauroux won the Job  Saving Trophy awarded  by the Nouvelle Rpu- blique newspaper.  Social Social 2010 Sustainable Development Report - page 28 Testimony   Ive already had the opportunity to work for Arc International as part of my missions with Harsha. When  we were chosen to build their new furnace, we already had solid experience in applying their very strin- gent safety requirements. While drafting the contract, we jointly defined the global guidelines for the pro- ject: on time, at the defined price and in complete safety. We wanted to do even better than in the past.  To achieve this, our two key words were coordination and collaboration. Arc International guided us  through many project management meetings. We had up to 250 people on site, working together with  teams from many other companies Once again, we learned a lot from all of these safety requirements.

Lobel Workshop  A real moral commitment to policy of revitalization The Group continued with measures to revitalize the  local economy around its Arques site, in close colla- boration with local and regional partners. Since 2005,  Arc International has invested considerable resources  to promote the establishment of new businesses in  the Audomarois region. Around twenty have moved  here, creating over 1400 jobs in innovative sectors. The  Group has made a moral commitment as part of a col- lective effort with economic and political stakeholders  and employees. The current agreement is aiming to  create at least 580 jobs to offset the projected reduction  in the workforce by 2012. In this context, ADF Tarlin, a  regional subsidiary of the ADF Group, a leader in mainte- nance and related services for industry, has established  a workshop in Blaringhem with 30 new jobs. Another  company, the manufacturer of luxury glass, Alphaglass,  has set up an additional production line at its Arques  site, with 16 glass-maker jobs to be filled in addition to  the 300 initially announced.  A tradition of solidarity  Arc International continues a tradition of commitment  to solidarity with people in need. During the torrential  rains that struck certain towns in the Var dpartement,  the company provided help to victims of the disaster, in  partnership with the French Red Cross, by donating 300  complete tableware sets (plates, glasses, cutlery) which  were delivered to the site of the disaster. A collection was  also organized  for the French  Red Cross to  benefit  victims  of  the  earth- quake in Haiti.  In each canteen  at Arques, em- ployees  who  wished  were  able to donate  a 1 supple- ment on their  meals  at  the  checkout.  The  company  then  supplemented  the generosity of staff by doubling the total amount of  donations.    Arc International France also provided the new Ronald  McDonald Parents House, opened near the hospital  in Villejuif, with a collection of kitchen items worth more  than 6000.

At the request of our customers, our range of containers, which were initially  made of crystal polystyrene plastic, has been broadened to include glass verrines. This choice should  in no way affect the quality of our products or the safety of our consumers, which is defined according  to three types of hazards: physical, microbiological and chemical. Arc International has fully understood  our expectations. As a result of the working partnership between our companies, Arc International has  been able to respond to all of our needs and the offer has thus been built around our constraints. An  audit of the Arques site gave us full confidence as to the proficiency of the manufacturing processes and  management of the risks related to food safety. We are working with Arc International to optimize weight  tolerances and also to develop a new form of verrine.   Full confidence in the  management of risks related  to food safety  Camille Herbaux, quality manager. Glass is a clean, hermetic, inert, odorless, aesthetic and  reusable material, making it ideal for food containers ...  provided that its manufacture and quality are controlled.  In its BtoB business, Arc International supplies many  food industry manufacturers with containers for foods  such as mustard, spreads and ice cream. Product qua- lity must be irreproachable to ensure food safety for  consumers and the integrity of the food.   For many years and through a HACCP (Hazard Analy- sis Critical Control Points) approach, the Group has  increased its efforts to ensure the safety and hygiene of  its products. Throughout the manufacturing process, controls of va- rious kinds are made to meet the specifications of the  most demanding customers. Quality   Many controls of weight and dimensions are carried out  to verify compliance with the minimum requirements de- manded by industrial customers. Containers are sealed  to guarantee the integrity of the content.  Food safety for consumers Similarly, manual controls  and automatic camera  controls have greatly re- duced the risks of defec- tive items. Laser marking  in recent years has ensu- red traceability of items  in order to respond very  quickly to any manufacturing problem.  The guarantee of food safety In Russia, The 'Grant Life' organization was a partner in  the operation. This high-profile Russian foundation as- sists children suffering from cancer, leukemia and other  serious illnesses.  In the UK, Pyrex took part in Natio- nal Baking Week, which aims to help people suffering  extreme poverty.  Hygiene Gloves and headwear are mandatory for all workers on  production lines, which are themselves protected from  dust by a system of hoods.   Finally, every employee working in the food sectors  receives specific training on the risks associated with  these products, hygiene measures and safety precau- tions. Customer  require- ments help to chal- lenge the manufactu- ring processes each  day and improve them continuously. Audits  conducted by these  manufacturers at the  production sites are  valuable aids for continuous improvement and enable  constant progress to be made. These are genuine win- win working partnerships that have been established  over the  years.  Arc International Cookware launched Cook n'Care in early 2009. This project aims to build its  strategy around sustainable development. One of the highlights of Cook n'Care is the marke- ting of products symbolizing solidarity throughout Europe under its Pyrex brand name. For each item purchased, the company donates 0.50  to a mutual aid association. In France, 10,000 has  already been paid to the Secours Populaire.  In Italy,  the ABIO association has also benefited from the ope- ration. It helps children and their families in hospitals.
