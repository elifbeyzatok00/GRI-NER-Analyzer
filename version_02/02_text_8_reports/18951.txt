This Constitution includes, in its preamble, the full Declaration of the Rights of  Man and Citizen of 1789.  Generally, SOLYSTIC joins the principles of this Universal Declaration of the  Rights of Man and Citizen from December 1948.  SOLYSTIC engages suppliers and sub-contractors to respect theses Rights,  through its Charter for responsible procurement.     Action undertaken in 2012    Insert a "Charter for responsible procurement" in the  suppliers contract   P R I N C I P E S  1 7 2 1         SOLYSTIC SAS 2012 – Global Compact – Communication on progress 2012             7     Context    SOLYSTIC has been working to integrate sustainable development criteria into  its procurement strategy.  A charter for responsible procurement was written in 2011.  All the purchasers have been aware of this concept of responsible  procurement.  The implementation of this charter is an important step for the promotion of  the respect for human rights, and the sharing of best practices with our  suppliers.     Objective     Associate our main suppliers to the respect of the Human rights and labour  conditions, and formalize this commitment     Approach and implementation    Contracts are established with the main suppliers, especially for the following  services:    technical assistance for studies,    construction or maintenance on both facilities,    services associated to both facilities (cleaning, security, catering,  etc.),    installation of our products to the customers, potentially worldwide,    transportation and delivery of our products,    assembly sub-contracting.    These contracts are built from a  frame , mentioning a pre-determined  number of detailed provisions in each of the individual constituting items.    An article explains the requirements for risk prevention and persons safety;  another one, the requirements for the respect of the environment.    The principle used to formalize the commitment of a supplier to respect Human  rights was to complete the contract by a written article Responsible  procurement:    A copy of the charter for responsible procurement, dated August 31st, 2011, is  attached as an annex to this contract.    The supplier acknowledges having read this document and commits to respect the  principles set out in the different aspects of its relations with SOLYSTIC.    Compliance with legal requirements for Human rights, labour law, health, safety and  environment, as well as compliance with applicable standards, are essential elements  that must be taken into account in the implementation of products or services  provided to SOLYSTIC.              SOLYSTIC SAS 2012 – Global Compact – Communication on progress 2012             8    The charter for responsible procurement also mentions clearly the commitment  required by the supplier in respect with Human rights:     SOLYSTICs suppliers commit to respect Human rights and labour law in each country  where they produce or provide services for SOLYSTIC. They do not call undeclared or  illegal work. They commit to ensure these aspects throughout the duration of the  contracts with SOLYSTIC.    Becoming aware of the charter and the suppliers commitment to respect the  clauses are formalized by initialling each page of the contract, including its  annex.       Results    The document  Charter for a responsible procurement  is now in annex of  each new contract signed between SOLYSTIC and its suppliers.  As part of the strategy of follow-up of its suppliers, SOLYSTIC may, in  individual cases, conduct audits to ensure that the terms of the contract are  met.

Businesses should uphold the elimination of  all forms of forced and compulsory labour.  Businesses should uphold the effective  abolition of child labour.  Businesses should uphold the elimination of  discrimination in respect of employment  and occupation.    Our commitments, our policy  SOLYSTIC respect the French labour law, especially laws related to the  freedom of association and collective bargaining.    SOLYSTIC commits to inform and consult the Central Work Council about the  companys strategy at a 3/5 year-term and its foreseeable significant effects on  skills and employment.    SOYSTIC, responsible employer, acts in favour of diversity, for equal  opportunities and contributes to fight against any form of discrimination. As  such, it signed a three-year agreement on employment and skills management,  with all the representative trade unions. This agreement is built on an  innovative commitment on senior employment, renewed each year since 2009  and on principles outlined in the three-year agreement on professional equality  between women and men, the result of the work by the Professional Equality  commission.    The competence of this commission is, moreover, extended to other categories  of employees who may be subject to possible inequalities (seniors, disabled,  employee representatives, part-time employees, long-term sick persons, etc).    SOLYSTIC takes all necessary measures to prevent risks for health and safety,  and work in improving work conditions.        P R I N C I P E S  3 4  4 5 5 4  6 5         SOLYSTIC SAS 2012 – Global Compact – Communication on progress 2012             10       Action undertaken in 2012    Management awareness to discrimination prevention     Context    Thoughts from works from the Professional Equality commission composed of  employees and elected members from the Work council, from discussions from  negotiations from the senior and professional equality agreements, and the  implementation of the Corporate Social Responsibility led SOLYSTIC to focus  more specifically on discrimination.  The first senior agreement was signed on November 26th, 2009 and specified:  SOLYSTIC undertakes, in any external recruitment but also internally, not to practice  discrimination based on the age.    According to this agreement, hiring made allowed us to appreciate the difficulty  of keeping such a commitment.  Was there not a form of discrimination, even if unintentional or unconscious, to  the senior candidates?  The idea of providing a potential training to non-discrimination, among the  different persons involved in recruitment, has sprouted.  This training would aim, at first, to non-discrimination in hiring seniors.  In order to refine our thinking and understand the topic, we invited in 2011 a  representative from the HALDE (High Authority against Discrimination and for  Equality – Rights Defender) to inform thirty volunteer employees, members of  the Professional Equality commission, or from various employee representative  bodies.  This intervention allowed us to explore different types of discrimination. It was  particularly focused on the legal aspect. This organism vocation is to assist  victims of discrimination in their efforts to assert their rights.  Our aim is not exactly the same, because it is based on prevention; this  information was not communicated to the Managers.  However, this intervention has generated debates and has helped us refining  our expression of needs and expand the scope of the proposed trainings for  our Managers, to all discriminatory practices, concerning recruitment but also  on any action (behavior, speech, writing, non-verbal language, etc) which  could lead to a possible discrimination connotation or simply perceived like this  by a listener.  This have been beneficial to our Managers, often from technician and engineer  trainings, who do not have the human resources feeling, or were not trained  to understand such a subject in all its complexity.          SOLYSTIC SAS 2012 – Global Compact – Communication on progress 2012             11       Objective    Raise awareness all the Managers to the prevention of discriminations and give  them a legal and practical vision of the possible discriminations that may arise  in their workplace.  The aim is to help the Managers to have tools to identify possible  discrimination situations – if possible, before it happens – in their daily work;  whether they are actors (during meetings, individual evaluation interview, a  follow-up with a member of their team, or witness).     Approach and implementation      Project steering    The Human Resources manager, in charge of this approach, has developed the  specifications of the content of the awareness. To carry out this project, it was  decided to rely on an outside help, an expert firm, who could bring their past  experiences and real-life examples. Our need was to benefit from exact  guidance and to discuss operational practices objectively.    Key elements of the specifications of the sensitization    Provide basic legal concepts related to discrimination at work.  Give simple tracks to allow the Manager to have the reflex to change his  behaviour or the one of others.  Conduct a session, short, concrete, supported by real-life examples or likely to  be encountered.  Use educational and fun elements that can assist in the transmission and the  appropriation of the message.  Introduce the notion of direct or indirect discrimination.    Conducting of the sensitization    In June 2012, a first leading session was prepared and provided to nearly ten  volunteer Managers. It lasted a half day. This session was highly participatory  and allowed us to adjust with the external firm the content to the more  concrete requests from the Managers.  Role plays were inserted to allow everyone to practice to a possible  confrontation of a type of discrimination in the context of his missions.  The following sessions, lasting three hours each, took place in two parts:    notions  The definition of discrimination, criteria, legal context, direct or indirect  discrimination  notion,  equal  treatment,  protected  employees,  behaviours bearing potential discrimination.      situations  Works in little groups and synthesis on situations of discrimination,  appropriate behaviours.          SOLYSTIC SAS 2012 – Global Compact – Communication on progress 2012             12       Results    At the end of September 2012, all Managers, nearly 60 employees in four  three-hour sessions, were informed.  The preparatory work, realized with many internal and external actors, was  very rich for our company. It has allowed us to get onto a sensitive subject;  taking the dimension of the discriminations that were not necessarily  experienced at SOLYSTICs and measure risks.  It also gave us the opportunity to stop a moment with our Managers to discuss  a topic that does not seem priority at first, but ultimately, made us think about  our daily practices and the perceptions that anyone could have.  It is this new sensitivity, this acuity that we would like to develop with our  Managers, in order to develop teamwork, dialogue, and trust as an  improvement and a productivity benefit  It will remain to take stock of this sensitisation with the social partners and the  Professional equality commission at the end of 2012 and to assess the impacts  of this work in a medium term.

Businesses should undertake initiatives to  promote  greater  environmental  responsibility.  Businesses  should  encourage  the  development  and  diffusion  of  environmentally friendly technologies.    Our commitments, our policy  SOLYSTIC contributes to the fight against climate change by minimizing  emissions of greenhouse gas emissions and by saving energy for the operation  of its facilities or during travels of its employees.  SOLYSTIC acts preventively against all form of pollution, by reducing wastes,  among other actions.  SOLYSTIC limits the environmental impact of its products and services by the  implementation, from the design of innovative technologies, cleaner and that  use less energy.     Action undertaken in 2012   Energetic pre-diagnosis for the facilities of Bourg-ls- Valence and action plan implementation.     Context    Within the scope of its environmental policy, SOLYSTIC has the target to  reduce its energy consumption in its infrastructures.      P R I N C I P E S  7 3 8 7 9 7         SOLYSTIC SAS 2012 – Global Compact – Communication on progress 2012             14    SOLYSTIC participates in the works of a Sustainable development club, whose  aim is to share good practices and, as such, maintains regular contacts with  local stakeholders.    The Drme Territorial Chamber of commerce and industry (CCIT) provides its  support to these works through environment project Managers.    This relationship initiated the approach  energy visits , proposed by the  CCIT, for the Drme facility of SOLYSTIC.    This service is to achieve energy pre-diagnosis. It is part of the support actions  undertaken with local companies.    It is realised with the support of the Agency for Environment and Energy  Management (ADEME), the Rhne-Alpes region and the Drme CCIT.    All these organizations and institutions work together for a national action plan  to reduce energy consumption. This support is more specifically dedicated to  small and medium-sized companies in the industrial sector in the country.    The proactive approach of reduction of the energy consumption is not recent in  our company. Analysis and measures have already been implemented.  The updating of this analysis and the will to detect new possible sources of  reduction are part of our continuous improvement.     Objective    The energy pre-diagnosis contributes to the achievement of three objectives:    -  prepare an initial assessment of the energetic situation of the facility,    -  identify areas of elementary actions of energy savings,    -  raise awareness and support the company for a long-term commitment in  the control of energy consumption, to move toward an approach of energy  management.    SOLYSTIC intends to implement the recommended actions following this pre- diagnosis. For those requiring a specific budget, an opportunity study will be  made, taking into account budgetary constraints and returns on investments.     Approach and implementation    Energetic pre-diagnosis      Be informed of the work and the energetic constraints of the company  The definition of the business activity, its operation mode, schedules, etc  has contributed to a more detailed analysis.      Collection of existing data  This essential phase consisted in providing the maximum amount of data  about energy consumption: billings, previous studies, detailed records and  various measurements.  Communication of these data was facilitated because the CCIT is an  independent organization, not providing this kind of services.       Facility visit  It confirmed the various elements previously transmitted and helped  suggest obtaining information.      Preparation of the report and validation by SOLYSTIC          SOLYSTIC SAS 2012 – Global Compact – Communication on progress 2012             15    The report gave an overall result of the consumption of energy, water, gas  and electricity, as well as different pricing and more detailed, by use  (lighting, heating, cooling, etc). It describes the characteristics of the  system of production, distribution, control and regulation, all this supported  by associated consumption records. At this stage, potential energy savings  are released. These different elements were then collected into a list of  recommendations, categorized by use, hierarchically. Tracks were also  provided to go further into the energetic diagnosis approach.    This study was approved by the company before final transfer.      Presentation of the report and recommendations of savings to SOLYSTICs  management  In a consensual approach, this presentation has enabled the company to:  - appropriate the result of the study,  - discuss the advisability of a particular measure,  - decide on the application of the fastest priority measures to implement,  - trigger a further technical-economical study, for the actions with major  financial impact,  - not keep actions deemed impractical or ineffective.    SOLYSTICs action plan      Preparation of the action plan, selection of the actions and planning  This plan is developed and followed up by the department responsible for  the infrastructure maintenance.      Implementation of the actions   During the implementation of various solutions of economy savings,  information is regularly communicated to the employees, particularly  through the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee (CHSCT).     Results      Do an energetic diagnosis of the gas boiler by a third party, in order to  determinate the real heating needs and identify the best technical solutions    An assessment study was made as a proposal for future  budgets.      Identify the causes of residual electricity consumption, outside the activity     After further investigations, practical actions were carried out,  such as cutting air handling plants at night.      Recover heat from air compressors to heat the close buildings    The study is planned at the end of 2012.      Reduce heat loss when opening the access hatch of workshops    A first hatch has been optimized through a better design space  and the installation of a fast door. The second one will be done  at the end of 2012.      Check for leaks in the supply network of compressed air, and add stop  valves    Most of the leaks have been detected and stop valves  installed.      Reduce the consumption of conditioning air by solar protections on the  windows of the offices    External light-absorbing blinds or filters directly placed on  windows are progressively installed.

SOLYSTIC has set up an organization to deal any issues related to ethics  (Ethics department and open line for employees seeking advice or suspicion).       Action undertaken in 2012    Prevent any potential conflict of interest.     Context    The Ethics code of the group set out specific principles and rules of business  management as guide and reference to any SOLYSTICs employees.    In this code, a whole chapter deals with the relations with our customers and  suppliers.    Relation with customers       We expect them to choose our products for quality and price reasons;  we do not seek to influence their decisions improperly.       We manage our business in an honest and open manner as part of  our contract.      Any donation or grant offer in their favour is prohibited, as it could be  considered as a bribe.    10  P R I N C I P E          SOLYSTIC SAS 2012 – Global Compact – Communication on progress 2012             18    Relation with suppliers       We strive to maintain a procurement process that is objective and  effective in accordance with our procedures.      Our employees commit not to solicit or accept any donation, payment  or compensation from our suppliers.      Any significant financial interest held by an employee with a supplier  or a business seeking to become one, must be reported.    In addition, this code explains in detail the concept of conflict of interests as it  applies in the group:    A conflict of interest is a situation where an employee is influenced or is perceived to  be influenced by personal relationships; that is to say, any conflict between the private  interests of an employee and its duty, its actions and its loyalty to the company.  There is a conflict of interests when both parties in relation receive or grant an unfair  advantage or a preferential treatment in order to gain a personal advantage.    Situations of conflict of interests are also describes in order to clarify the  situations to avoid.       Objective    To prevent any potential conflict of interest, SOLYSTIC shall annually submit a  questionnaire to its employees.    The aim is:    to identify any conflict of interest or any situation likely to become a  conflict of interest,    to handle potential conflicts of interest by appropriate corrective  actions before they lead to a real problem.         Approach and implementation    Employees directly related to SOLYSTICs customers and suppliers are first  identified. They are mainly part of the Commercial, Purchasing, Project or  Financial Departments.  Any concerned person would be in contact with customers or suppliers (in  case of respond to tender, commercial prospecting, purchasing negotiations,  business management or equipment delivery, etc).  Each employee whose mission can cause a potential conflict of interest  receives:    a letter from the CEO explaining the concept of conflict of interest,  mentioning examples of situations for which personal, financial or  other interests are opposed to their responsibilities,    a declaration of conflict of interest with seven questions, concerning  different situations that could lead to a conflict of interest and for  which the answer is yes or no.  At the end of this questionnaire, the employee certifies having  understood his responsibilities and undertakes to apply the rules  governing the SOLYSTICs business management. If the answer is  yes for one of these questions, the document needs the signature  of the supervisor. Then, the document is analyzed by the Ethics          SOLYSTIC SAS 2012 – Global Compact – Communication on progress 2012             19    correspondent to determine if a conflict of interest really exists, and  how to treat it.  The seven questions deal with these situations:    case of a SOLYSTICs employee, who is also employee, representing  or manager of an entity, who maintains or seek to maintain trade  relations,    case of an employee with a substantial financial interest in an entity  being in business with or wishing to be with SOLYSTIC,    case  of  advantages  (gift,  travel,  invitation,  gratification,  remuneration, etc.) received directly or indirectly, in a potential trade  relation context,    case of debtor / creditor relationship with a business,    case of disclosure of information, property of the company, to  unauthorized persons or use of information, property of the  company, to promote specific economic activities of an employee, or  his personal interest,    any case where an employee would have an interest or would be  involved in an agreement that could lead to a violation of the  principles and rules of the business management, or that could lead  to a conflict of interest, real or perceived.     Results     With a workforce of around 500 people in 2011, 115 employees, by their  positions within the company, potentially exposed to situations of conflict of  interest, were solicited in the context of this action of awareness and census.
