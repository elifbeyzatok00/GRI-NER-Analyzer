In 2007, before the  nancial crisis and the  recession , we had an ambition to reach NOK 20 billion in pre-tax operating   pro ts before write-downs in 2010. We are therefore proud that we sur- passed this target and also achieved strong pro ts for the year. Volume  growth, wider spreads, a rise in stock market-related income, reduced costs  and lower losses contributed to the healthy performance. Write-downs on  loans were reduced by as much as 61 per cent. In 2010, we created signi cant value for our shareholders and also received  positive feedback from our customers. During the year, we launched a num- ber of new products and services, such as home mortgages for young adults  below the age of 34 at the best market terms, and we are the  rst bank in  Norway to be open 24/7. I am also proud that we are the  rst large bank in  Norway to launch index funds, which are mutual funds with very low costs.  In addition, the Norwegian personal  nances magazine Dine Penger gives  our index funds top marks. Our customers became more satis ed with us  in 2010. Customer satisfaction levels among our large corporate customers,  both Norwegian and international, were further improved from a good level  in 2009. DnB NOR was ranked as the best  nancial institution in a survey  conducted by Greenwich Associates among the 200 largest companies in  Norway. Surveys show that our corporate reputation also improved in 2010.  The Groups employees made a fantastic contribution in 2010, a year when  the organisation went through major changes. A new, common platform  was established, comprising a vision, values, leadership principles, strategic  priorities and a target position. Parallel to this, extensive efforts were made  to reach our targets for 2010. Losses were limited, existing customer  relationships  were cultivated and new ones were established. More than 80 per cent of DnB NORs income stems from our operations  in the domestic market, and we have clear ambitions to grow in Norway.  At the same time, DnB NOR is becoming increasingly international. Our  most important industry sectors are shipping, energy and seafood. In 2010,  DnB NOR was the worlds largest arranger of syndicated loans to the ship- ping industry. The bank has also expanded signi cantly within energy, both  in Norway and internationally. The most important segments are renewable  energy, primarily within the power sector, the oil and gas sector and the  supplier industry to the oil and gas sector. Seafood is also growing strongly,  particularly within  sh farming. An extended presence outside Norway and  a greater number of products adapted to the international market will help  DnB NOR strengthen its global position in these sectors. DnB NORD is now 100 per cent owned by DnB NOR after the Groups  acquisition of the remaining shares in the company. The integration process  is well under way, and during 2011, the operations in Poland and the  DnB NOR IS BETTER EQUIPPED than ever to meet  its customers expectations and needs. GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVES STATEMENT   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     13 DnB NOR IN BRIEF   Baltic States will become an integrated part of our total business. A strategy  for further growth will be drawn up. Looking ahead, these countries are  expected to have a higher growth rate than the rest of Europe, and we  envisage  exciting prospects for the future.  As the market leader in most segments, DnB NOR has a unique vantage  point for observing the Norwegian economy. According to our corporate  barometer, there is a rising level of optimism in the business community.  Norwegian households are bene ting from low unemployment levels and  high purchasing power. The global economy is expected to grow by approxi- mately 4 per cent in 2011. As a raw material producer, Norway shares many  similarities with the emerging economies, and this also has an impact on  DnB NOR. With China and India at the forefront, these economies have  shown strong growth in the wake of the  nancial crisis and are expected to  achieve the highest global growth rates. Nevertheless, uncertainty still pre- vails regarding the debt burden of certain countries, particularly in Europe.  At the end of 2010, DnB NOR had a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.1 per cent, up  from 9.3 per cent the year before. We have strengthened our position rela- tive to other banks and are now ranked among the best capitalised banks  in the world. This gives us good access to funding in the markets, which in  turn makes us competitive and well positioned for the future. Healthy pro ts  further strengthen our position, enabling us to adapt to future regulations.  DnB NOR is preparing to adapt to Basel III, the new international rules for  banks and  nancial institutions. The most important capital adequacy and  liquidity requirements will be introduced by 2015 and 2018. The aim of the  new regulations is to promote a strong and healthy banking system. How- ever, it is vital that all market participants are subject to equal framework  conditions. It is positive that this is an international process, which opens  up for establishing the same competitive conditions both between countries  and between  nancial institutions.  In 2011, we will simplify our brand structure, change our name to DNB and  introduce a new visual expression. The  rst step is the full integration of  Postbanken with the rest of the bank. Customers will gain access to a wider  range of products and to DnB NORs branch network. The name change to  DNB will be gradually introduced across the Group.   In 2010, we strengthened our corporate reputation in Norway, also  compared  with our competitors. From being a rather unpopular bank, we  became a rather popular bank. Our target is clear: DnB NOR is to become  a very popular bank. Our vision, Creating value through the art of serving   the customer, will be our guiding star. This will encourage everyone  throughout the organisation, every day, to make an extra effort to perform  even better in every single meeting with our customers, whether they are  large companies or private individuals.     Rune Bjerke Group chief executive OUR  TARGET  IS CLEAR:  DnB NOR is  to become a  very popular  bank.   DnB NOR Business Review 2010   14 CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK Changes in  the regulatory framework   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     15 CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK Basel III 16 Important IFRS amendments 18  Regulation of remunerations in the  nancial services industry 19 Report from the Financial Crisis Commission 19      DnB NOR Business Review 2010   16 CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BASEL III In December 2009, the Basel Committee launched new proposals for  capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. After an extensive consultation  round and quantitative impact studies, and after the main principles were  endorsed by the leaders of the G20 countries, the  nal recommendations  were presented in December 2010. The collective term for the recommen- dations is Basel III.   Based on the recommendations from the Basel Committee, the EU  Commission  will present a proposal for new rules for the  nancial services  industry in the EU in the course of 2011. The rules will have an impact on  the Norwegian  nancial services industry through the EEA agreement.  The main elements of Basel III are described below.  New capital adequacy requirements for banks Experience from the  nancial crisis identi ed a need to improve the quality  and increase the size of banks primary capital and introduce stricter report- ing requirements.  Thus, a number of new requirements have been proposed concerning the  various components included in total capital adequacy. Capital adequacy  is a ratio whereby the banks primary capital is measured against a risk- weighted calculation base which expresses the inherent risk in the banks  lending and other activities.  A new component in capital adequacy calculations is a so-called capital  conservation buffer of 2.5 per cent. For practical purposes, this buffer will  be included in the minimum capital adequacy requirement. The description  of the minimum requirements below thus includes the capital conservation  buffer. This implies that the minimum capital adequacy requirement is to  be increased from 8 to 10.5 per cent of risk-weighted volume. Minimum  8.5 percentage points of this must represent Tier 1 capital, whereby Tier 2  capital can represent maximum 2 percentage points of the minimum  requirement.   Tier 1 capital requirement Tier 1 capital may include common equity Tier 1 and other Tier 1 capital,  so-called hybrid capital.  The new proposal implies that the common equity Tier 1 requirement will  be increased from the current 2 per cent to 4.5 per cent. However, the  common equity Tier 1 requirement for Norwegian banks was 3.4 per cent  up until year-end 2010. With effect from 2011, the Norwegian rules have  been harmonised with EU rules with respect to the use of hybrid instru- ments. In consequence of Basel III, the increased access to use hybrid  instruments will be of no practical signi cance for Norwegian banks.   The above-mentioned 2.5 per cent capital conservation buffer comes in  addition to the 4.5 per cent minimum common equity Tier 1 requirement  and will in practice be regarded as part of the minimum requirement. The  new minimum common equity Tier 1 requirement will thus be 7 per cent.  Common equity Tier 1 capital must be fully loss absorbing and can only  consist of common share capital or retained earnings. The rules concern- ing deductions from equity have also become stricter, though this is of less  signi cance for Norwegian banks, which already follow strict rules.   Furthermore, up to 1.5 percentage points of Tier 1 capital may represent  hybrid capital, which brings the minimum Tier 1 capital requirement to  8.5 per cent. The hybrid capital must be fully loss absorbing, which means  that it must be possible to write down the capital or convert it to common  equity Tier 1 capital without consequences for the banks ordinary opera- tions. In addition, the hybrid capital must be perpetual and offer banks no  incentive to redeem. Under Basel III, there are much stricter requirements  governing the actual loss absorbing capacity of hybrid capital than under  previous and current regulatory frameworks.   It has been announced that a requirement may be presented whereby  systemically important banks must increase Tier 1 capital beyond the  above-mentioned minimum requirements.   THE FINANCIAL CRISIS IDENTIFIED A NEED TO INCREASE THE REGULATION of the  nancial services  industry in a number of areas. Proposals from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to strengthen banks  capital and liquidity, the so-called Basel III framework, constitute the core of the many regulatory initiatives.  Parallel to this, a number of changes have been announced in the International Financial Reporting Standards,  IFRS, in order to make  nancial reporting more robust against economic  uctuations and ensure more correct  long-term reporting and improved valuation of balance sheet items. Against the same background, an interna- tional standard for the regulation of remunerations in the  nancial services industry has been approved, which  has been followed up in Norway through approved regulations and guidelines. In June 2009, the Norwegian  government appointed a commission to evaluate Norwegian  nancial market regulation and describe the under- lying causes of the  nancial crisis. The commission presented its report in January 2011.  CHANGES IN THE  REGULATORY  FRAMEWORK   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     17 CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK Tier 2 capital requirement Tier 2 capital may represent up to 2 percentage points of the minimum  requirement and can include term subordinated loan capital or correspond- ing instruments which should provide loss absorption in a situation when the  bank is declared insolvent. Among other things, the instruments must have  a minimum original maturity of  ve years. The Tier 2 capital will be required  to provide loss absorption also in a situation where the bank can continue to  operate as a going concern after being recapitalised by the national authorities.  Countercyclical capital buffer  In addition to the above-mentioned capital conservation buffer, a so-called  countercyclical capital element will also be introduced, ranging between  0 and 2.5 per cent. This element should consist of common equity Tier 1  capital, and the size of the buffer will be determined by the national supervi- sory authorities. It will later be considered whether the countercyclical capi- tal buffer may also include other fully loss absorbing capital. This element  will be of particular relevance during periods when total private sector credit  exposures relative to GDP are above the long-term trend. During weaker  economic periods, this element may be set at zero.  The total common equity Tier 1 requirement will thus range between 7 and  9.5 per cent, representing the minimum common equity Tier 1 requirement  of 4.5 per cent plus a total buffer requirement, comprising the capital con- servation buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer, of between 2.5 and  5 per cent, depending on the size of the countercyclical buffer.  If a bank fails to fully satisfy the buffer requirement, limitations will be  placed on dividend and discretionary bonus payments etc. The limitations  will be stricter the further the banks capital base is from meeting the formal  8 per cent minimum requirement. Leverage ratio As a supplement to the risk-weighted capital requirements and as a  measure  against creative adjustments and gaps in the regulations, a non- risk based capital requirement, leverage ratio, will also be introduced.  This requirement implies that Tier 1 capital must be minimum 3 per cent  of the total of balance sheet items and off-balance sheet risk exposure. Off- balance sheet items are converted to on-balance sheet items according to  further speci ed rules.   Improved measurement of counterparty risk In addition to the capital adequacy regulations, stricter and more exhaustive  rules are proposed for the risk-weighting of exposures through derivatives,  repurchase agreements and any indirect obligations related to securitisation.  According to the new rules, such counterparty risk will be estimated based  on assumptions of stressed market conditions as well as a weakening of  counterparty creditworthiness. Due to the highly complex and not very transparent derivative market,  measures have also been proposed to increase standardisation in the  derivatives market and the use of clearing houses.  New liquidity requirements for banks Prior to the onset of the  nancial crisis, there were two clear market trends:  the  nancial systems increased dependence on money and capital market  funding and on short-term funding instruments. In addition, contingent  liquidity obligations had been accumulated, partially through securitisation   activities and obligations relating to so-called margin requirements in  derivative  transactions.    In consequence of the liquidity problems during the  nancial crisis, two  liquidity requirements have been proposed to achieve two separate, but  complementary objectives. The  rst objective is to promote the short-term  resilience of the liquidity risk pro le of banks by ensuring that they have suf-  cient high-quality liquid assets to survive an acute stress scenario lasting  for a month. The liquidity coverage ratio, LCR, was developed to achieve  this objective.  The LCR liquidity requirement is calculated as follows: Liquidity coverage ratio: Liquid assets > 100% Net cash  ow over 30 days in a  stress scenario The requirement entails that the banks highest-quality liquidity reserves  must exceed the net payments from the bank over a 30-day stress period.  The highest-quality liquidity reserves can be in the form of cash and central  bank deposits, as well as securities issued by public entities with a zero per  cent credit risk weight. In addition, 40 per cent of the reserve may consist of  securities issued by a public entity with a maximum 20 per cent credit risk  weight, and corporate and covered bonds with a rating of at least AA- which  have not been issued by the bank itself. For all securities, there is a qualita- tive requirement that they are traded in large and active secondary  or so- called repo markets even during stressed market conditions.  Net payments during the stress period are estimated by, among other  things, assuming a decline in deposits. The extent of the reduction  depends on the type of deposits. A further assumption is larger draw- downs on the undrawn portion of credit facilities and no renewal of short- term capital market funding which is due during the stress period. These  stress effects come in addition to ordinary cash in ows and out ows,  including planned lending growth.  The LCR requirement should be met for each currency of signi cance for  the banks. With respect to countries with inadequate access to securities  which meet the LCR in local currency, the Basel Committee has drawn up  three alternative solutions. Final details and a speci cation of the countries  this will apply to will be considered during the observation period for the  LCR up until mid-2013.  The second objective is to strengthen the liquidity pro le over a longer  time horizon by creating incentives for banks to fund their operations with  more stable sources of funding on a permanent basis. The net stable  funding ratio, NSFR, was launched to achieve this objective and has  a time horizon of one year.   The NSRF liquidity requirement is calculated as follows:  Net stable funding ratio: Available amount of stable funding > 100 % Required amount of stable funding The net stable funding ratio sets requirements for banks funding struc- tures relative to lending, investments and other assets. The objective is  to limit banks short-term funding of illiquid and long-term assets. The  requirement is based on a comparison between the banks available  Countercyclical buffer range Tier 2 capital Hybrid capital Common equity Tier 1 capital Capital conservation  buffer 0 3 6 9 12 15 Per cent Calibration of the capital framework 2.5 2 1.5 2.5 4.5 4 2 2 Current requirement New requirement from 1 January 2019 1 2 3 1) Common equity Tier 1 capital including conservation buffer (minimum 7 per cent) 2) Tier 1 capital including conservation buffer (minimum 8.5 per cent) 3) Total capital (minimum 10.5 per cent)   DnB NOR Business Review 2010   18 CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK amount of stable funding and the estimated required amount of such  funding. Calculations of the banks available amount of stable funding  include all contractual funding obligations with residual maturities of  12 months or greater and non-maturity deposits. However, deposits will  be subject to a run-off factor of between 10 and 50 per cent, depend- ing on how stable they are considered to be. Calculations of the required  amount of long-term funding entail that all assets with maturities greater  than one year that are not particularly liquid, must be backed by long-term  funding. Home mortgages which meet certain requirements and do not  serve as collateral for the issue of covered bonds require only 65 per cent  long-term funding. Loans with maturities shorter than one year must be  backed by 50-85 per cent long-term funding. In addition, 5 per cent of the  undrawn portion of credit facilities must be covered by long-term funding.  Supplementary requirements for systemically important banks Systemically important banks and the close ties between them reinforced  the extent of the crisis. To limit such risk, the G20 has initiated a process  to de ne further supplementary requirements for these banks. In addition,  changes in the regulatory framework are being considered, aiming to  establish systems for the dissolution of banks which make it possible to  allow even the largest banks to fail.  Introduction of Basel III The new capital adequacy requirements will be gradually phased in over a  six-year period starting on 1 January 2013, whereby the new requirements  will have full effect from 1 January 2019.    Unless changes are approved in the leverage ratio requirement during the  observation period, which lasts from 2013 to 2017, this will be included as  a minimum requirement with effect from 1 January 2018.  Following an observation period starting in 2011, the liquidity require- ments LCR and NSFR will be introduced with effect from 1 January 2015  and 1 January 2018, respectively. According to the Basel Committees  recommendation, the LCR should be reported at least monthly, while  the NSFR should be reported at least quarterly within 1 January 2012.  In addition, there will be extended reporting requirements in relation to  liquidity. The extent of possible changes in the requirements after the consideration  by the EU remains uncertain. In order to ensure that the Basel III frame- work will have the desired effect, the Basel Committee has considered  that a fairly long observation period is required. DnB NOR agrees that this  period is important to re ne the  nal requirements and avoid undesirable  consequences. Among other things, there is no past experience related  to the effects of global liquidity standards, and the new requirements will  entail a need for signi cant adjustments for a number of banks. For this  reason, and with regard to the competition with international banks, it  is important that the introduction of the regulatory framework in Norway  takes place parallel to the introduction in the rest of Europe.   IMPORTANT IFRS AMENDMENTS A number of new International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, must  be expected to be introduced over the coming years. The amendments  are expected to become effective for Norway after being considered by the  EU Commission and the Norwegian authorities. Some of the new account- ing rules are due to a wish for improvements which was expressed in the  wake of the  nancial crisis, while others are based on other improvement  initiatives, not least in connection with the wish to coordinate international  and US  nancial reporting rules.  The amendments which are expected to have the most pronounced  impact on the Norwegian  nancial market are new accounting rules for  the assessment of loans and new rules for the assessment of insurance  contracts. In this connection, the International Accounting Standards  Board, IASB, a standard-setting body, has drawn up an exposure draft  for the assessment of credit losses, issued in November 2009. At end- January 2011, the IASB and the US Financial Accounting Standards  Board, FASB, presented a supplement to the original exposure draft on  an impairment model for  nancial assets. At the beginning of 2011, the  standard-setting bodies were still discussing the accounting treatment  of the impairment of  nancial assets, and additional changes may thus  be made to the original exposure draft. The  nal draft for a new IFRS on  amortised cost and the impairment of  nancial instruments is expected  to be presented by end-June 2011. If the amendments are implemented  in their current form, they may have major consequences for the banking  industry and the market in general.   Current rules for measuring loan losses According to prevailing rules, the value of a  nancial asset shall be written  down if there is objective evidence of impairment, i.e. when a loss has  occurred. Standard-setting bodies, auditors and users have criticised the  impairment rules based on the following:    Interest income is overstated during the period before a loss event  occurs. Write-downs can partially be regarded as reversals of over- stated income in previous periods. Equity may also be overstated.    It is sometimes unclear when a loss has actually occurred, which results  in differences in the way the rules are practiced. Losses may also have  to be recorded even if there are no changes in the original expected  losses.    In some cases, the rules have resulted in delayed recognition of losses,  as a loss event must have occurred in order for the loss to be recognised  under current rules.  New rules for measuring loan losses In the exposure draft presented in November 2009, the IASB proposed an  expected loss model which entails that expected losses upon initial recog- nition of a  nancial asset, including loans, are included when determining  the effective interest rate underlying the recognition. This implies that the  part of the interest rate which compensates for expected losses, should  not be recognised as income.  In the supplement dated 31 January 2011, the IASB and the FASB  presented a joint model for recognising impairment of  nancial assets in  portfolios where assets are added and removed during the life of the port- folio, so-called open portfolios. The impairment model includes elements  of the IASBs original proposal, as well as adjustments which are intended  to make the model easier to use. Among other things, expected losses are  not included in calculations of effective interest rates to be used as a basis  for interest income recognition. In addition, a minimum provision level for  loan losses in the balance sheet will be introduced, which harmonises with  the impairment model originally proposed by the FASB. According to the exposure draft, the accrual of expected losses over the  life of the assets should be determined by the characteristics of the assets.  The  nancial assets in the portfolio should be divided into two groups  based on the companys internal risk management systems. Expected  losses relating to doubtful commitments should be recognised immedi- ately. Provisions for losses on other loans should be recorded at the higher  of the losses expected over the remaining life of the portfolio, based on  the ratio of the portfolios age to its expected life, and credit losses that are  expected to occur within the foreseeable future, minimum 12 months.   After responses to the exposure draft have been received, the IASB will  consider whether the open portfolio model should also apply to other   nancial assets.  The intention behind the new methods is to better re ect the underlying  economics in a lending transaction. There should be no need to identify  triggering events in order to estimate changes in expected losses. Accord- ing to the IASB, this method is intended to ensure greater consistency  between various reporting entities. The standard-setting bodies expect that  the rule changes will present useful information to users of  nancial state- ments for their assessment of original loss estimates and possible changes  in estimates over the life of an asset.  It is highly questionable whether the new rules will actually give the  desired effect. It will be very challenging to assess future expected cash    DnB NOR Business Review 2010     19 CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK  ows for all loans,  nd good and stable expected loss estimates and iden- tify changes in the originally expected losses on each reporting date. The  life of each loan must be determined, including the life of roll-over credits  and overdraft facilities. There will be considerable uncertainty related to  these estimates.  The new rules are expected to cause great volatility in  nancial reporting.  Due to limited experience and the lack of relevant and reliable statistics ,  adjustments will regularly be made to the assumptions underlying  expected loss measurements. Such changes will be re ected in the  accounts on a cumulative basis, which means that the full effect of new  estimates must be recognised immediately for all commitments affected  by the changes. However, adjustments in the new exposure draft may  nevertheless result in somewhat lower volatility in  nancial reporting.  Once the new rules are implemented, a reduction is expected in the equity  of most  nancial institutions, as there will probably be a need for higher  loan-loss provisions in the accounts. Credit risk margins which up until the  implementation of new rules are taken to income through the recognition   of interest income on loans, will have to be reversed and recorded as  provisions in the accounts. In light of the introduction of Basel III, the con- sequences may be challenging unless capital adequacy requirements and  accounting rules are coordinated. The original preliminary implementation  date for the new loss reporting rules was 1 January 2013. However, this  will be delayed due to coordination with the US rules.   The effective date of IFRS 4, Insurance contracts, was originally planned  for 1 January 2013. The new rules imply that insurance liabilities will be  measured at the fair value of the cash  ows arising from the insurance  contracts, plus a risk margin. According to current rules, liabilities are  measured according to rules which are further de ned in the Act on Insur- ance Activity. The assets are thus measured at a combination of amortised  cost and fair value, depending on the characteristics of the assets. The  accounting rules must be expected to result in greater volatility in pro t  measurements for life insurance companies in the longer term.    REGULATION OF REMUNERATIONS IN  THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY The regulations on remuneration schemes in  nancial institutions, mutual  funds and management companies for mutual funds entered into force  on 1 January 2011. Bonuses earned in 2010 or earlier which are paid in  2011, are not encompassed by the regulations.  The regulations are based on the EUs CRD III directive, which was  nally  approved on 30 September 2010. In 2011, Finanstilsynet has issued  supplementary guidelines to the regulations in the form of a circular. The  regulations are based on the guidelines from the Committee of European  Banking Supervisors, CEBS, dated 10 December 2010. With effect from  1 January 2011, the CEBS functions and responsibilities have been taken  over by the European Banking Authority, EBA. In line with the purpose of the regulations, DnB NORs remuneration  scheme should help promote and give incentives to sound management  and good control of the companys risk, counteract excessive risk taking and  help avoid con icts of interest.  DnB NOR will work on the implementation and follow-up of the regula- tions through and beyond 2011. In this connection, the Group will prepare  revised group remuneration guidelines to ensure compliance with the  regulations and appurtenant guidelines.  DnB NORs guidelines will determine which groups of employees belong to  the following categories: 1. senior executives 2.  employees whose responsibilities are of great signi cance to the  company s risk exposure (risk takers) 3. employees engaged in control functions 4.  employees whose remuneration places them in the same bracket as  senior executives  In accordance with the regulations, the remuneration scheme will include  special rules for the above-mentioned groups. For these employees,  DnB NORs remuneration scheme will ensure a balanced mix of  xed and  variable remuneration. The variable salary of CEOs and senior manage- ment team members in banks should not represent more than 50 per cent  of  xed salary.  REPORT FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS COMMISSION In light of the international  nancial crisis and the experiences gained  during this period, the Norwegian government appointed a Financial Crisis  Commission in June 2009 to evaluate the Norwegian  nancial market.  Among other things, the Commission was asked to describe the under- lying causes of the crisis and to examine whether there were any speci c  national factors that contributed to its development in Norway. The  Commission s report was presented on 25 January 2011. Norway is among the countries that fared best during the  nancial crisis.  However, the failure of international  nancial markets nevertheless led to  acute liquidity challenges for Norwegian banks, and extensive government  measures were initiated. The monetary and  scal policy framework in  Norway provided a sound basis for stabilising the economy and mitigating  the effects of the  nancial crisis. Past experience has shown that  scal  manoeuvrability and con dence in government  nances must be built  up in good times in order to be well prepared to meet possible periods of  recession.  According to the report, various taxes and fees may be suitable for supple- menting  nancial market regulation and promoting  nancial stability. The  commission proposes that a new stability fee be imposed on Norwegian   nancial institutions based on the institutions debt in excess of equity  and guaranteed deposits. In addition, the report proposes to examine the  basis for introducing a new tax on  nancial institutions pro ts and salary  payments to compensate for the fact that  nancial services are exempt  from VAT.  The Commission recommends that key features of Norwegian  nancial  market regulation be re ned and proposes that the Norwegian authorities  work to strengthen the regulatory cooperation in the Nordic area relating  to  nancial markets. Cooperation on stricter capital adequacy and liquidity  requirements for banks and special requirements for systemically impor- tant  nancial institutions are particularly emphasised.  The Commission proposes various measures with a view to improving  consumer protection in the  nancial markets. The Commissions report  was sent on a three-month consultation round in January 2011.  The Financial Crisis Commissions proposal concerning taxes and fees is  presented parallel to the work on possible sector-wide rules on fees for the  European  nancial services sector. In the opinion of DnB NOR, it is ques- tionable whether the premises underlying the Commissions tax proposals  are relevant for Norway, as the Norwegian Banks Guarantee Fund is fully  funded even after the  nancial crisis. Norwegian banks have paid sizeable  levies to the Fund, thus fees applying solely to Norwegian  nancial institu- tions seem unreasonable. Such fees could also distort competition in  favour of institutions which operate under different framework conditions.  The Norwegian  nancial services industry is not particularly large, and  there are no indications that  nancial services are excessively used.  Thus, it does not seem appropriate to introduce fees to reduce the use of   nancial services, which would contribute to higher product and service  prices for end users. Nor should the impression be given that Norwegian   nancial institutions pay little tax. Only the oil sector pays more tax than  the  nancial services industry in Norway.

The business areas operate as independent  pro t centres and have responsibility for serving all of the Groups customers and for the total range of products.  At year-end 2010, DnB NOR took over the full operations of DnB NORD in the Baltic region and Poland. These  operations have been organised under Large Corporates and International, but will continue to be regarded and  reported as a separate pro t centre. Operational tasks and group services are carried out by the Groups staff  and support units.  ORGANISATION  AND MANAGEMENT  OF OPERATIONS OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE The Groups operational structure is adapted to its business operations and  deviates from the functional organisation. Operations should be organised in  a manner which ensures good customer service, further product develop- ments and the streamlining of operations.   The business areas are responsible for customer relationships, for pro table  and loyalty-building customer service and for ensuring that the Groups  products and services are adapted to market requirements. These respon- sibilities include customer relationship management, distribution, product  development, production and product pricing. The business areas operate  as independent pro t centres.  Retail Banking serves personal customers and small and medium-sized  businesses  through the branch network in Norway, while Large Corpo- rates and International is responsible for the largest Norwegian corporate  customers  and international operations. DnB NOR Markets is the Groups  investment bank, while responsibility for the Groups insurance products,  including pension savings, life and non-life insurance and asset management  operations, is organised under Insurance and Asset Management. In October  2010, DnB NOR entered into an agreement to acquire 100 per cent of the  shares in DnB NORD. The transaction was completed in December 2010.  Central staff and support units carry out infrastructure and operational tasks  which provide cost ef ciencies when undertaken for several business areas.  Operational and production tasks for the business areas are coordinated  and should as far as possible be based on joint solutions which ensure  ef cient operations, good service and high-quality deliveries. Centralised  support functions aim to ensure the coordination, consolidation and  professionalisation of deliveries across the various units in the DnB NOR  Group. The support unit Operations is responsible for important production  functions for the Groups banking operations, such as collateral and credit  administration, account administration and payment services. The unit  contributed strongly to the Groups cost programme in 2010 by improving  its work processes and streamlining the Groups procurement routines and   oor space ef ciency. Operations is responsible for the new headquarters   project in Bjrvika in Oslo. IT has group-wide responsibility for the  development  and operation of IT systems and was involved in the further  development and launch of new services in 2010, including the Norwegian  and international corporate Internet bank, the new customer portal and a  number of applications for mobile devices. The consolidation and renewal  of IT solutions ensured cost savings as well as improved operational stability  for customers and employees. HR is responsible for important personnel  policy issues and provides support in connection with employee recruit- ment and development in the Group. The support units play a key role with  respect to streamlining operations. The staff units perform group functions  Marketing and Communications Corporate Centre Retail Banking Large Cor- porates and  International DnB NOR  Markets Insurance  and Asset  Management Operations HR IT Group Finance  and Risk  Manage ment  DnB NOR DnB NORD Business areas/pro t centres Staff and support units   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     23 BUSINESS AREAS for governing bodies and group management. The business areas are able  to in uence staff and support units by changing their demand patterns and  requirements. INTERNAL MANAGEMENT OF OPERATIONS  Differentiated  nancial and operational targets have been set for the various  business areas to help DnB NOR realise its ambitions. The business areas  contributions to value creation in the Group are assessed by monitoring  developments in economic pro t, de ned as pro ts after write-downs and  taxes less the estimated required return on risk-adjusted capital for each  business area. In addition, return on capital, de ned as pro ts after taxes  relative to risk-adjusted capital, is one of the key  nancial targets for the  business areas. Risk-adjusted capital for the business areas is based on  DnB NORs model for calculating capital requirements for the various risk  categories. See further description under Capital management and risk  categories on page 49.  Cooperation between the business areas is an important part of DnB NORs  strategy. A wide range of products, services and distribution channels  enables the Group to offer customer solutions across business areas.  DnB NORs  nancial management model and operational organisation  facilitate sale of the entire range of products and services offered by the  Group. Transactions between the business areas are regulated by inter- nal agreements, and pricing is based on market terms. Developments in  total customer  and segment pro tability are vital when making priorities in  the Group. In order to encourage cross-sales, pro ts stemming from key  products  are presented in a manner which re ects the cooperation. Income  and costs relating to transactions which require extensive cooperation  between several units are recorded in their entirety in all units involved in  such transactions. Such income from cross-sales is shown on separate lines  in the income statement as income and expenses from product suppliers.  Services provided by staff and support units are scaled according to the  business areas demand, and intra-group services are charged according to  use at market prices. Costs relating to the Groups strategic initiatives, direct  shareholder-related expenses and costs concerning the Groups governing  bodies are not charged to the business areas.

DnB NOR aspires to be a local bank for the whole  of Norway while offering the expertise of a large bank. Pre-tax operating pro ts were NOK 6 719 million in 2010,  down 7.2 per cent from 2009, mainly due to narrower interest rate spreads and a rise in the cost of long-term  funding. There was a positive trend in volumes, and non-performing commitments and write-downs on loans  showed a satisfactory development.

BUSINESS AREAS   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     25 Average lending increased by 3.9 per cent from 2009 to 2010. In spite of  low interest rate levels, the rise in home mortgages was lower than in 2009,  while the growth in lending to the business sector picked up through 2010.  There was  erce competition for deposits. Average deposits were up 2.1 per  cent compared with 2009, primarily due to growth in the retail market. The  ratio of deposits to lending was declining and stood at 50.9 per cent on  average in 2010. Covered bonds based on home mortgages in DnB NOR  Boligkreditt were an important source of funding, supplementing customer  deposits. At the end of 2010, close to 90 per cent of lending volume in  Retail Banking was funded by deposits and bonds. The weighted interest rate spread, de ned as total margin income on loans  and deposits relative to total loans and deposits, averaged 1.25 per cent in  2010, down from 1.30 per cent in 2009. The weighted spread was affected  by  erce competition in the Norwegian market and lags related to noti ca- tion periods for interest rate adjustments. Rising long-term funding costs  also contributed to lowering net interest income.  In consequence of changes in the principles for recording advertising  expenses  within real estate broking, both expenses and income rose by  approximately NOK 200 million from 2009 to 2010. Adjusted for these  changes, net other operating income remained relatively stable compared  with 2009. Income from real estate broking, non-life insurance and asset  management gave a rise in operating income, while income from insurance  savings and payments transfers was lower than in the previous year. There  was a positive trend in housing sales, and the market share of real estate  broking in Norway was maintained at approximately 19 per cent.     Strict cost control and the implementation of various measures gave effects  which exceeded the targets in the cost programme and contributed to  limiting total operating expense growth to 1.9 per cent compared with 2009.  Costs reductions realised under the Groups cost programme had an annual  effect of more than NOK 220 million, while changes in principles, higher  IT expenses and greater depreciation on operational leasing due to volume  growth resulted in an increase in total operating expenses. Retail Banking  recorded impairment losses for goodwill related to investments in Sweden  totalling NOK 194 million in 2010, which was due to a change of strategy for  lending operations in the Swedish market.  The quality of the loan portfolio was sound, with relatively low net write- downs for both personal and corporate customers. Net write-downs relative  to average net lending were reduced from 0.22 per cent in 2009 to 0.17 per  cent in 2010. Net non-performing and doubtful commitments were roughly  unchanged from 2009, totalling NOK 7.2 billion at year-end 2010. OPERATIONS DnB NORs goal is to be the leading bank in Norway. Retail Banking sup- ports this strategy by functioning as a local bank while giving customers  access to all the expertise and solutions a large group can offer. Retail  Banking has competitive products and wishes to offer attractive prices to  customers who use a wide range of the Groups products and services.  The business area is divided into seven geographical divisions. In addition,  DnB NOR Privatbank, Telephone and Online Banking and DnB NOR Finans  are organised as separate divisions. The subsidiaries Nordlandsbanken,  DnB NOR Eiendom and Postbanken Eiendom, together with Svensk  Fastighets frmedling and SalusAnsvar in Sweden, are also part of the  business  area. In the course of 2011, the Postbanken brand will be gradually integrated  into the DnB NOR brand, which is an important step to strengthen  DnB NORs position in Norway. The aim is to improve customer satisfaction  and build a strong common corporate culture. Customers will thus gain  access to an even more extensive distribution network and product range  than before.  Norways largest distribution network DnB NORs distribution network is by far the largest within banking and   nance in Norway. An extensive physical presence, well-developed tele- phone and Internet banks and mobile banking solutions represent important  assets for the Group. During 2010, customer needs for  nancial advisory  services, products and services were met through 220 branch of ces  and customer service centres, 42 SAGA investment centres, 54 corporate  advisory services, DnB NOR Private Banking, 24-hour tele phone customer  service, online and mobile banking services. In addition, customers are  served through 179 post of ces in Norway and 2 234 in-store banking and  postal outlets. Satis ed customers who wish to use as many DnB NOR products as  possible  are vital to the Groups further expansion and pro tability, and  DnB NORs vision and values focus on customer needs. Customer  satisfaction  surveys conducted in the autumn of 2010 showed a clear  improvement for important customer groups compared with previous  surveys. More customer contact and competitive terms contributed to the  positive trend. Information from frequent customer surveys will enable Retail  Banking to meet customer needs and changing market conditions swifter,  thus aiming to further improve customer satisfaction. Retail Banking will  maintain a high level of activity to defend and increase its market shares  and achieve healthy growth based on pro tability and acceptable risk. An  increase in cross-sales and more cooperation with other units in the Group  are key elements  in this strategy. Competitive products adapted to customer needs A wide range of high-quality products and solutions meet the different  needs of customers and offer freedom of choice. At year-end 2010, 1.4 mil- lion customers had customer loyalty programmes and product packages.  The total customer concept was introduced in November 2010, offering  customers who use a wide range of DnB NORs products the best terms  and conditions. Home mortgages are an important product, representing a total lending   volume  of NOK 488 billion at year-end 2010, of which DnB NOR Bolig- kreditts portfolio accounted for NOK 389 billion. The company is  BUSINESS AREAS 0 100 200 300 400 500 31 Dec. 2009 31 Dec. 2010 Mortgage between 60 and 80 per cent  of collateral value Mortgage within  60 per cent  of collateral value Mortgage above 80 per cent  of collateral value NOK billion Home mortgages 397 432 51 20 52 28 0 30 60 90 120 150 1) Based on DnB NORs risk classification system.

The credit rating agencies have given the bonds  issued by DnB NOR Boligkreditt an AAA rating, and the good classi ca- tion secures the bank access to lower priced funding and thus greater  competitive  power. DnB NOR Finans was merged with the bank in September 2010, but will  continue its operations as one of Norways largest  nance companies as  a separate division in Retail Banking. The main products are leasing, ICT  equipment leasing, factoring, vehicle  nancing and  eet management under  the brand name Autolease, along with credit card and consumer  nance  services. In addition, DnB NOR is licensed to issue American Express per- sonal customer cards in Norway. DnB NOR Finans has operations in both  Sweden and Denmark. Real estate broking is an important channel for the distribution of home  mortgages and savings products. At the end of 2010, DnB NOR Eiendom  was represented at 92 locations in Norway. Postbanken Eiendom had  36 of ces, and Svensk Fastighetsfrmedling, involved in real estate broking  in Sweden , had 221 of ces. SalusAnsvar is an independent distributor of  life and pension  insurance, non-life insurance and banking products to  members of associations  and trade unions in Sweden.  DnB NOR gives priority to the development of digital services, and in  Novembe r 2010, a brand new and more customer-oriented Internet portal,  dnbnor.no, was launched, enabling information and knowledge sharing  between customers and the bank. The new portal makes it possible for cus- tomers to carry out even more services online. New savings products were  introduced in the autumn of 2010, and special employers liability insurance  products were developed in cooperation with Insurance and Asset Manage- ment. High priority will continue to be given to savings and non-life insur- ance in 2011. Special home mortgages for young people were well received  by the target group, and the offering to newly established companies was  improved through an updated Partner Start solution and a new loan product  for entrepreneurs. With effect from year-end 2010, DnB NORs telephone  customer service (+47 915) 04800 became a 24/7 service. The extended  opening hours have been well received by the customers and represent a  competitive advantage for the Group.  FUTURE PROSPECTS The Norwegian economy is approaching normal activity growth, and unem- ployment levels have stabilised. Private consumption is rising, and com- modity prices, which are vital to Norwegian exports, are high or increasing.  Corporate credit demand has picked up and is expected to increase further.  There has been a signi cant rise in housing prices since September 2010,  which will contribute to an increase in household debt while making some  customers vulnerable to future interest rate increases.  Retail Banking expects that home mortgages will still account for the major  part of lending growth, though there are signs of rising growth in loans to  businesses. The price pressure on low-risk home mortgages is expected  to continue. Write-downs on loans are expected to remain relatively low.  Competition for stable deposits will continue to be strong, re ecting the  introduction of new liquidity requirements for banks.    BUSINESS AREAS   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     27 BUSINESS AREAS LARGE CORPORATES AND INTERNATIONAL SERVES large Norwegian companies and is responsible for  the Groups total international operations. Norwegian and international businesses are offered a wide range of   nancial services adapted to prevailing market conditions, and operations are based on sound customer rela- tionships. In 2010, pre-tax operating pro ts were NOK 6 124 million, an increase of 8.0 per cent from 2009,  resulting from lower write-downs on loans. Activity levels in the markets picked up through the year, with an  increase in both corporate loans and deposits.

DnB NOR Business Review 2010   28 BUSINESS AREAS     The general interest rate level in Norway was relatively stable in 2010.  Ordinary  lending and deposit activity generated an increase in net interest  income of NOK 551 million due to rising activity levels through the year.  Funding costs were high, and it was necessary to increase lending spreads  relative to the money market rate to cover these costs. Measured against the  money market rate, lending spreads improved in all segments from 2009 and  widened by an average of 0.16 percentage points from 2009 to 2010 for the  business area as a whole. The deposit spread narrowed by 0.05 percentage  points compared with 2009, with a decline in all segments. There was strong  competition for deposits in 2010, and spreads were thus under pressure.  Average lending to customers declined by 6.1 per cent from 2009 to 2010,  but rose by 4.4 per cent from year-end 2009 to year-end 2010 due to  increasing market activity. Exchange rate movements were the main fac- tor behind the reduction in average lending, and for important industries  such as energy and shipping, the majority of loans are denominated in US  dollars. DnB NORs strategy to maintain a low risk pro le in the portfolios  served as a guiding principle for the granting of credit throughout 2010. Average deposits from customers declined from 2009 to 2010, but showed  an increase towards the end of 2010, re ecting brisker activity in the  markets  and the banks strong focus on deposits. In addition, movements  in the NOK exchange rate affected deposit volumes. In 2010, income from payment transfers showed a stable trend compared  with 2009. Cross-sales between Large Corporates and International and  the Groups product areas were affected by customers levels of activity ,  and income was stable from 2009 to 2010, but rose throughout the  year. Income from product suppliers resulting from cross-sales totalled  NOK 2 006 million in 2010 and contributed NOK 1 200 million in net  income to Large Corporates and International. There was a rise in operating  expenses from 2009 to 2010 due to higher activity levels in the business  area and a rise in costs from product suppliers.  The level of net write-downs on loans declined from 2009. Relative to  average lending volumes, write-downs stood at 0.17 per cent, compared  with 0.30 per cent in 2009.  The business areas lending policy was in accordance with the Groups  strategy and desired risk pro le. The quality of the portfolio was satisfactory  in all sectors and showed a signi cant improvement towards the end of 2010.   OPERATIONS Large Corporates and International serves the largest corporate customers  in Norway and is responsible for the Groups international operations. Long- term customer relationships based on sound industry and product expertise  play a central role. International initiatives are based on long experience  within the business areas strategic priority areas, which are shipping,  energy and seafood. Operations are managed along both an industry  dimension and a geographic dimension. Following the full acquisition of  DnB NORD in December  2010, these operations have been organised  under Large Corporates and International in the Baltics and Poland division,  but will continue to be regarded and reported as a separate pro t centre.

DnB NOR is recognised for its expertise within complex international  transactions and is one of the worlds leading shipping banks. The Groups  long-term strategy within shipping remains  rm, and activity levels have been  rising, especially in the second half of 2010. The analysis company Dealogic  ranked DnB NOR as the worlds largest arranger of loans to the shipping and  offshore industry in 2010. The long-term energy strategy targets companies  within both fossil and renewable energy sources and will offer opportunities  for growth in both Norway and internationally. The seafood strategy remains  unchanged, and DnB NOR is well positioned to expand within these seg- ments based on its sound customer relationships and geographic presence.  The subsidiary DnB NOR Nringsmegling is Norways largest commercial  property adviser and broker. DnB NOR Nringskreditt manages portfolios  which can be used to obtain long-term funding for the Group through the  issuance of covered bonds. The Groups corporate clients are offered services internationally through  of ces in New York, Houston, Santiago, Rio de Janeiro, London, Copen- hagen, Hamburg, Helsinki, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malm, Luxembourg,  Athens, Singapore, Shanghai and Mumbai.

A new, global corporate Internet bank was introduced  in 2010 and provided customers with a greater range of self-service options.  The Group launched a number of new SMS and alert services for compa- nies on mobile phones during 2010. The use of these services is steadily  increasing.  FUTURE PROSPECTS There was a rising level of optimism in the  nancial markets through 2010,  though at the onset of 2011, uncertainty continued to prevail regarding  future market developments. Large Corporates and International believes  there are sound growth prospects in the business areas strategic priority  areas, both in Norway and internationally. In order to build a robust portfolio,  it is a prerequisite that the business areas expansion is in line with the  Groups credit strategy and is based on experience, expertise and long-term  relationships. Some customers in certain segments may still be affected by  the repercussions of the recession. Customers should perceive the bank to  be a good long-term partner, irrespective of the state of the market.  Operations in 2011 will depend on opportunities offered by the market, and  higher activity levels are anticipated compared with 2010.    DnB NOR Business Review 2010   30 DnB NOR MARKETS IS NORWAYS LARGEST INVESTMENT BANK, serving customers in Norway, at the  Groups international of ces and via electronic channels. Customer service takes place in close cooperation  with the Groups other business areas. DnB NOR Markets achieved pre-tax operating pro ts of NOK 3 638 mil- lion in 2010, down 31.8 per cent from 2009. Extraordinary volatility in exchange rates and interest rates at the  beginning of 2009 generated a high level of income, while the normalisation of the markets in 2010 resulted in  a reduction in income compared with the previous year. DnB NOR Markets was the largest investment bank on  Oslo Brs within equity, bond and commercial paper trading and issues in 2010.

DnB NOR Business Review 2010     31 Due to the normalisation of the markets, DnB NOR Markets total income for  2010 declined by 24 per cent from the previous year. The most pronounced  reduction was seen in income from market making and other proprietary  trading, which was particularly high in early 2009 due to strong market   uctuations. The reduction in customer-related income from foreign exchange and  interest rate and commodity derivatives mainly re ected reduced income  from foreign exchange. Though there was a high level of activity in 2010, an  increasing share of electronic trading with lower margins contributed to the  decline in income. Low long-term interest rate levels caused rising demand  for interest hedging products through 2010, especially from small and  medium-sized businesses. This trend gave an increase in income towards  the end of the year.  Customer-related revenues from the sale of securities and other investment  products were reduced compared with 2009. There was increasing compe- tition from international market players. Electronic equities trading became  increasingly important, causing pressure on prices. DnB NOR Markets  maintained its position as the largest brokerage house on Oslo Brs and was  the undisputed number one within bond and commercial paper trading.  Income from other investment products remained low.   A high level of activity within equity issues, combined with a sound trend  for advisory services and the arrangement of bond issues, resulted in a  strong increase in customer-related revenues from corporate  nance com- pared with 2009. New records were set on Oslo Brs with respect to both  equity and debt capital issues. DnB NOR Markets was the leading market  participant in this  eld. The international units established in New York and  Stockholm in the course of 2010 generated sound income already in their   rst year of operation.   Customer-related revenues from custodial and other securities services  showed a positive trend from 2009 due to rising market values and higher  activity levels in, for example, the new issue market. The rise in income  mainly stemmed from Norwegian customers, while there was a sharp drop  in income from international customers due to Oslo Brs introduction of  central counterparty clearing.    Income from market making and other proprietary trading was reduced by  36 per cent compared with 2009 due to the normalisation of the markets,  with less volatility in exchange rates and interest rates. The liquidity portfolio  of bonds generated income on a par with 2009.   OPERATIONS  DnB NOR Markets aims to be the best partner for Norwegian customers  within investment banking and securities services, as well as for interna- tional clients requiring services relating to Norway and the Norwegian krone.  In selected  elds and customer segments such as shipping, energy and  seafood, DnB NOR Markets will engage in international operations together  with other units in the Group. DnB NOR Markets seeks to achieve competi- tive returns and high cost-ef ciency through diversi ed operations with  a moderate risk pro le. Leading position in the Norwegian market DnB NOR Markets will re ne service concepts and  nancial advisory  services which create value for customers. DnB NOR Markets is committed  to customer proximity and provides a wide range of products and services.  Customer service is provided by 13 regional sales desks in Norway, of ces  in Stockholm, London, New York, Singapore and Shanghai, and via elec- tronic channels. The business areas main customer groups are Norwegian  retail and corporate clients and the public sector. Other important customer  groups are DnB NORs international clients and others requesting  nancial  services in Norway or services related to Norwegian kroner products. To better identify and meet current and future customer needs, coopera- tion with the Groups other business areas is important, and these provide  an important sales channel for DnB NOR Markets products. DnB NOR  Markets has a large team of equity, credit, currency, commodity and interest  rate analysts who along with other specialists play a key role in advising the  business areas customers. DnB NOR Markets further strengthened its leading market position in  Norway in 2010. In addition to its strong position within FX and interest rate  trading, DnB NOR Markets increased its market share within bond trading  and was the largest brokerage house on Oslo Brs in 2010 for equities,  equity options, equity futures, bonds and commercial paper. DnB NOR  Markets also arranged the greatest number of bond and commercial paper  issues in the Norwegian market in 2010. DnB NOR operated as registrar for  54.4 per cent of the companies registered in the Norwegian Central Securi- ties Depository, VPS.  Customer satisfaction is measured and followed up through surveys and  evaluations carried out in-house and by external parties such as Prospera.  The surveys generally show good customer satisfaction levels. Results for  individual product and service areas are used for management and follow- up  purposes.  Again in 2010, DnB NOR was named best Norwegian foreign exchange  bank by Global Finance Magazine. In addition, the Global Custodian  magazine  ranked DnB NOR as the best custodian bank.   Key products include foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity prod- ucts, securities and other investment products, debt and equity  nancing  in capital markets, research and advisory services, as well as custodial and  other securities services. Value creation in DnB NOR Markets is ensured  by highly skilled employees, sound customer relations, a broad distribution  network and a diversi ed range of products and services.

Priority is given to continual development of products and  services. The main focus is on customer activities, while trading activities  should support customer activities with products and prices. The range of commodity derivatives and risk management services offered  to customers was expanded in 2010. There is rising demand for various  exchange-traded investment products, and DnB NOR was the  rst player to  launch Exchange Traded Notes on Oslo Brs in October 2010. At year-end  2010, DnB NOR had a 20 per cent market share, offering products with  exposure within oil service, electric power and oil price. During 2010, corpo- rate  nance operations within debt  nance were expanded in New York and  Stockholm.  FUTURE PROSPECTS General market developments and economic activity levels will be decisive  for DnB NOR Markets  nancial performance. A high level of customer satis- faction provides a sound basis for the further development of the business  area. With respect to foreign exchange and interest rate and commodity  derivatives, DnB NOR expects economic developments to cause a certain  rise in volumes, while a further shift to electronic trading and stronger  competition from international banks will put pressure on prices. There are  prospects of a higher level of activity within bond and equities trading and  within property investments, though there will be strong competition here  as well. It will be vital to develop new products geared to demand. Within  corporate  nance, DnB NOR Markets has a good platform for increasing  revenues outside Norway.  Income from the bond portfolio is expected to decline due to adaptations to  the Basel III requirements concerning the composition of the portfolio. The  fact that Norway has its own currency is expected to continue to represent  an advantage for DnB NOR Markets. Markets operations in the Baltic region  and Poland will be integrated with operations in DnB NOR Markets.

Vitals interest result improved relative to 2009 due to a positive trend in the  return on  nancial assets. Both the corporate portfolio and portfolios subject  to pro t sharing generated healthy revenues in 2010. A sound risk result for  disability and improved margins for pure endowment risk in the corporate  market ensured the owner a positive risk result of NOK 96 million, in spite  of an increase in reserves for higher life expectancy. NOK 973 million was  charged to the risk result to re ect an upward adjustment of life expectancy  assumptions within individual pension insurance. The owners share of this  adjustment was NOK 341 million, which was charged to pre-tax pro ts. The  risk result within individual pension insurance is divided between the owner  and the policyholder, who receive 35 and 65 per cent, respectively. Transfers to Vitals policyholders totalled NOK 11.1 billion in 2010, of which  NOK 6.6 billion represented the guaranteed rate of return, while the policy- holders share of the return on  nancial assets in excess of the guaranteed  rate of return was NOK 4.1 billion and transfers to additional allocations  represented NOK 0.4 billion. The company has reached its target to reduce  resource utilisation, and costs are well under control.  There were healthy returns on equities eligible for the tax exemption model  in 2010, and taxable income for 2010 totalled NOK 672 million.

DnB NOR Asset Management recorded pre-tax operating pro ts of NOK 276  million in 2010, an increase of 27.2 per cent from 2009. Commission  income, including performance-based revenues, rose by NOK 42 million or  5 per cent from 2009. The increase was mainly attributable to the NOK 38  billion rise in assets under management from year-end 2009. Positive market  developments gave a NOK 34 billion increase in assets under management,  while a further NOK 11 billion increase stemmed from exchange rate move- ments. Negative net sales gave a NOK 7 billion reduction in assets under  management.  DnB NOR Skadeforsikring  DnB NOR Skadeforsikring is in a growth phase.

In order to reach this position, a key tool is  the development of a customer-oriented and cost-effective organisation with  strong distribution power. Insurance and Asset Management will achieve  pro table growth while ensuring that the owner and customers receive  competitive  returns on their funds. Reaching all customer groups  Insurance and Asset Management has a strong distribution network reaching  all customer groups. Products are sold through the DnB NOR Groups dis- tribution network, external partners, the business areas own sales force and  electronic channels. Sales through independent agents represented 27 per  cent of Vitals product sales in the individual market in 2010, while sales  through the Groups own distribution channels represented 73 per cent. In  the corporate market, Vitals products are distributed mainly through its own  sales force and brokers, though account of cers in DnB NOR are also an  important point of contact for the sale of Vital products in this market.  In Norway, DnB NOR Asset Managements products are primarily distributed  through the bank, as well as through external partners. DnB NOR has sales  activities in Sweden and Luxembourg to market mutual funds in the Euro- pean market. In addition, DnB NOR Asset Management has of ces in Hong  Kong and India which are responsible for equity management in emerging  markets. Non-life insurance products are sold mainly through the banks  distribution channels.  Vital is Norways largest provider of individual and group life insurance and  pension savings. At year-end 2010, Vital had approximately one million retail  customers with individual and group agreements. Agreements with compa- nies, municipalities and public enterprises numbered approximately 26 000.  Vital offers group pensions in the form of de ned-bene t and de ned- contribution schemes to businesses and the public sector. At end-December  2010, de ned-bene t schemes represented 93 per cent of policyholders  funds, while de ned-contribution schemes accounted for the remaining  7 per cent. Competition in the paid-up policy segment remained  erce in  2010. Continued strong growth in the market is expected, not least due to  the move from de ned-bene t to de ned-contribution schemes. At year-end 2010, Vital had 64 municipalities and one county municipality as  clients in addition to a number of public enterprises. All nine of the munici- palities that invited tenders in 2010 entered into agreements with Vital.  Vital retained its position as the largest provider of individual pension savings  in 2010. The main products are guaranteed-rate savings and mutual fund  savings through unit linked products.   DnB NOR Asset Management is a leading market participant within asset  management for retail and institutional clients in Norway and has a promi- nent position in the institutional mutual fund market in Sweden.  DnB NOR Asset Managements 556 000 retail clients had entered into  277 000 savings schemes at year-end 2010, generating annual contractual  savings of NOK 2.7 billion. At end-December 2010, 55 of DnB NORs mutual  funds, representing 45.5 per cent of the mutual funds, had received four or   ve stars from the rating company Morningstar. DnB NOR Asset Manage- ment is one of the countrys leading providers of mutual funds and discre- tionary asset management. The company had a market share of 24.6 per  cent of the mutual fund market for Norwegian retail and institutional clients  at year-end 2010.

The company primarily offers products to  the retail market. FUTURE PROSPECTS Vital has adapted its product portfolio to the new pension reform, and the  product development process continued into 2011. Greater interest is  expected in savings in traditional mutual fund and insurance products. Vital  expects a positive effect of its new savings product, Investment Account.  The product gives customers the opportunity to compose their own share  portfolio, and gains on the sale of individual shares are not subject to capital  gains tax until money is withdrawn from the account. Vital expects continued growth in de ned-contribution pension schemes,  partly due to a conversion from de ned-bene t schemes. Vital is also taking  initiatives in the municipal sector, and growth in the sale of risk products is  expected to continue.  Vital has implemented a cost programme which will have an annual effect of  NOK 210 million from January 2011. The company will continue to focus on  cost ef ciency measures to prepare for strong competition ahead.  As Norwegian life insurance companies offer life-long pension payments,  higher life expectancy in the population is one of many risk factors. Vital  strengthened its reserves in 2009 and 2010 to re ect higher life expec- tancy for individual pension insurance. The remaining required increase in  reserves is NOK 770 million, which will be covered in 2011 and 2012. The  life insurance industry has also started a process to update life expectancy  assumptions in the calculation base for premiums and reserves for group  pension insurance. An updated calculation base for group pensions will be  introduced in close dialogue with the authorities.    Vital and DnB NOR Skadeforsikring have made good progress with their  preparations for Solvency II, which are new solvency capital regulations for  insurance companies, replacing the current solvency margin requirements.  The preparations include assessing the consequences relating to capital,  organisational and system requirements. The requirements resulting from  Solvency II will necessitate extensive adjustments in insurance companies  IT systems and infrastructure.  Earnings in DnB NOR Asset Management are directly affected by changes  in the volume of assets under management. These volumes re ect both  the companys net sales of mutual fund products and developments in  the equity, currency and interest rate markets. Competition for savings  will necessitate ongoing development and the adaptation of products and  services, and DnB NOR Asset Management has adjusted prices on certain  funds and removed subscription and redemption fees on all funds to  become more competitive. DnB NOR Asset Management has developed  new products to meet customer needs and launched two new index funds  towards the end of the third quarter of 2010. The expectations of investors  regarding developments in  nancial markets together with investor con - dence in the stock market will have a strong impact on pro t performance  in the business area.  DnB NOR Skadeforsikring is well positioned to become an important player  in the Norwegian market in a longer term perspective. Extensive measures  have been initiated to improve pro tability in the company. Though the  company plans to raise premiums within certain sectors, continued expan- sion is expected.

Operations are  mainly concentrated in the Baltic States and Poland. 2009 and 2010 were challenging years for DnB NORD as  it was strongly affected by the global  nancial crisis, which hit the Baltic States particularly hard. However, the  Baltic economies and DnB NORDs  nancial performance showed signs of recovery through 2010. A pre-tax  operating loss of NOK 1 481 million was recorded in 2010, compared with a loss of NOK 4 289 million in 2009.

DnB NOR Business Review 2010     37 BUSINESS AREAS Average lending, measured in Norwegian kroner, declined by close to  25 per cent from 2009 to 2010, of which approximately 7.5 percentage  points was due to the transfer of a portfolio to DnB NOR in 2009. From year- end 2009 to end-December 2010, lending was reduced by just over 12 per  cent. The Danish portfolio, which is in the process of being downscaled,  showed the largest percentage decline, though there was also a reduction  in lending in the Baltic region. Exchange rate movements had an impact on  lending volume, and measured in euro, the decline in lending in 2010 was  6.9 per cent. In Poland, lending volume rose by 17 per cent during the year,  measured in Norwegian kroner.  Competition for deposits was  erce, resulting in narrowing deposit spreads.  However, there was a positive trend in deposit volumes towards the end of  2010, and the ratio of deposits to lending was 40 per cent at the end of the  year, up from 28 per cent at end-December 2009. Ordinary operating expenses were reduced, re ecting measures to downsize  operations, including the closing of DnB NORDs branches in Denmark  and Finland during 2009. The write-downs on intangible assets in 2010  re ected changes in the IT development plan, which required that the value  of systems investments be written down.   In 2010, a high level of write-downs on loans characterised DnB NORDs   nancial performance, though there was a signi cant reduction from 2009.  Measured against average lending, write-downs declined from 4.70 per cent  in 2009 to 2.89 per cent in 2010. Write-downs in the Danish and Finnish  portfolios, which are being scaled down, represented a relatively large share  of total write-downs in 2010. Write-downs in the Baltic States and Poland  represented 2.40 per cent for the full year 2010.  OPERATIONS DnB NORD became wholly owned by DnB NOR from year-end 2010.  Operations in the core markets of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland will  continue to be a separate pro t centre, named the Baltics and Poland divi- sion, organised under the Large Corporates and International business area.  Immediately after the full acquisition of DnB NORD, the process to ensure a  smooth integration of operations into the DnB NOR Group was initiated. Pro- jects were established, with balanced participation from the DnB NOR and  DnB NORD organisations, to address a number of issues. These range from  business challenges in various product areas and market segments, to the  integration and streamlining of internal operational and support functions.  At the end of 2010, DnB NORD had a total of 166 of ces in the four coun- tries, offering a wide range of products to both corporate and retail custom- ers. DnB NORD intends to build a strong position as a full-service bank in  the region and wishes to offer its customers effective service and simple and   exible solutions. At year-end 2010, DnB NORD had some 915 000 customers. DnB NORD  was the third largest bank in Lithuania and number four in Latvia in 2010,  based on total lending, with market shares of 15.8 per cent and 10.7 per  cent, respectively. In Estonia, the bank was number  ve, but had a small mar- ket share of 1.8 per cent. The market shares were relatively stable from 2009,  with the exception of Lithuania, which experienced a 1 percentage point  decline. In Poland, DnB NORD was a relatively small market participant. At the end of 2010, DnB NORDs operations in the Baltic region were  evenly distributed between the personal customer market and the corporate  market, with an exposure of approximately 50 per cent in each segment.  The corporate loan portfolio mainly comprised small and medium-sized  enterprises. In Poland, the share of lending to personal customers was  28 per cent at year-end 2010, an increase from just over 10 per cent a year  earlier. Priority will be given to developing products and services for these  customers to achieve a stronger market position in this segment. There was  a healthy rise in home mortgages in Poland during 2010.  DnB NORD is committed to providing high-quality customer service,  which had good effects in both Lithuania and Latvia in 2010. In Lithuania,  DnB NORD was named best customer service provider in the banking  sector by Spect-Dive, a company which specialises in mystery shopping,  a method which uses anonymous test customers. In Latvia, the bank was  ranked as the best among leading banks in providing service to savings cus- tomers by Latvia Dorus LTD, a company which carries out regular customer  surveys. DnB NORD is working continually to coordinate cross-border activi- ties by harmonising processes and making optimal use of joint solutions. FUTURE PROSPECTS After several years of economic growth far above average levels in the  EU area, the Baltic economies experienced a sharp cool-down during 2008  and 2009. In 2009, gross domestic product declined by between 14 and  18 per cent in the Baltic States. In 2010, there were clear signs of recovery.  From the second half of the year, the Baltic region experienced weak growth,  driven by a rise in exports, and future growth is expected to again surpass  average European levels. Unemployment levels have been and continue to  be very high in the region, though there was a positive trend towards the  end of 2010. The rise in employment is expected to have a positive effect on  both customers debt servicing capacity and on growth in domestic demand.  DnB NOR will focus on consolidating and integrating the operations in the  Baltic region, reducing losses and improving cost-ef ciency, while acquiring  its share of the renewed growth in the region within a prudent risk pro le.  Macroeconomic developments in Poland have been relatively robust com- pared with the Baltic States. DnB NOR sees considerable future opportuni- ties in the Polish market, and will develop new products and services for  retail customers. A further reduction is anticipated in write-downs on loans, though the level  of write-downs is expected to remain relatively high in 2011 compared with  the level in the Groups other operations. Rising growth in the region will  ensure a positive volume trend, and combined with lower write-down levels,  this is expected to raise pro tability in the DnB NORD operations. 0 20 40 60 80 Latvia Lithuania Estonia Poland Other units 2009 2010 NOK billion Development in lending volumes 8 6 14 3 21 16 12 3 25 19 Private individuals 40% Real estate 13% Manufacturing 11% Services 7% Trade 7% Transportation and communication 3% Building and construction 6% Agriculture and related services 3% Central and local government 6% Other sectors 3% As at 31 December 2010 Lending to principal sectors   DnB NOR Business Review 2010   38 GOVERNANCE IN DnB NOR   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     39 GOVERNANCE IN DnB NOR Group management 40 Corporate governance (summary) 42  Risk management and internal control 43  Capital management and risk categories 45 The DnB NOR share 57  Governance in DnB NOR   DnB NOR Business Review 2010   40 GROUP MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE IN DnB NOR 4 LEIF TEKSUM (born 1952) Group executive vice president Large Corporates and International  Teksum has been head of Large Corporates and International since the reorganisation  on 1 July 2009 and was previously head of Corporate Banking and Payment Services.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE    DnB NOR Business Review 2010     43 A description of risk management and internal control in the Group is given  below. The Board of Directors reporting of the main features of internal con- trol relating to  nancial reporting is described in the Annual Report 2010, in  the Corporate governance chapter, section 10.  BOARDS OF DIRECTORS Organisation and responsibilities The Board of Directors of DnB NOR ASA, the holding company board, has  principal responsibility for the Groups business operations, which includes  ensuring that operations,  nancial reporting and asset management are  subject to adequate control. The Board of Directors carries out a review  of developments within the Groups most signi cant risk areas every four  months and makes an annual review of its internal control system.  The pro tability of DnB NOR will depend on the Groups ability to identify,  manage and accurately price risk arising in connection with  nancial ser- vices. The Board of Directors of DnB NOR ASA has a clearly stated goal to  maintain a low risk pro le. The banking group aims to maintain an AA level  rating for ordinary long-term debt. The Groups risk is measured in the form of risk-adjusted capital require- ments, calculated for main risk categories and for all of the Groups  business areas. Cf. further description under Capital management and  risk categories. In addition, risk is followed up through supplementary risk  measures adapted to operations in the various business areas, for example  monitoring of exposure relative to limits, key  gures and portfolio risk  targets.  The holding company board carries responsibility for ensuring that the  Group is adequately capitalised relative to the risk and scope of operations  and that capital requirements stipulated in laws and regulations are met.  Rules have also been worked out for internal control and operational risk  management at group level.    Internal and external reporting shall be of high quality, and the Group shall  comply with relevant laws, regulations and internal guidelines, including the  Groups values and rules governing ethics and corporate social respons ibility .  The organisational structure of DnB NOR aims to ensure independent risk  reporting.  The board has approved rules governing ethics and corporate social  responsibility which should help raise awareness of and ensure compliance  with the ethical standards required in the Group. According to the Groups  code of ethics, employees must promptly inform their immediate superior  or the group executive vice president, Group Audit, if they obtain knowledge  about circumstances that are contrary to prevailing regulations issued by the  authorities or about major breaches of internal regulations. The Groups credit policy is laid down in a joint meeting of the Boards of  Directors of the holding company and DnB NOR Bank ASA. The banks  Board of Directors determines credit strategies and annual limits for liquidity  risk and market risk for the banking group. Market risk re ects equity, cur- rency, interest rate and commodity exposure.  The Boards of Directors of the other operative companies in the Group, e.g.  Vital, set limits for relevant risks pertaining to their operations.  Implementation and monitoring  The holding company board annually reviews the Groups principal risk  areas and internal control. The review, which is based on reporting from the  group chief executive, aims to document the quality of the work performed  in key risk areas and to identify any weaknesses and needs for improve- ment. The review should ensure that changes in the risk situation are identi-  ed, so that the necessary improvement measures can be implemented.  The Audit Committee monitors the Groups internal control and risk man- agement systems and makes sure that they function effectively. The Audit  Committee also evaluates the quality of the work performed by the internal  auditors. The Boards of Directors of DnB NOR Bank ASA, Vital and other  signi cant subsidiaries annually evaluate the companies key risk areas and  internal control.  Every four months, the Audit Committee and the Boards of Directors of the  holding company and the bank receive a report on developments in the  Groups de ned risk categories. The Board of Directors of Vital receives  periodic reports analysing the companys risk situation.  Information about the Groups risk situation is made available to the market,  shareholders and the authorities through quarterly reports. In addition,  information is released about DnB NORs adaptation to and compliance  with the capital adequacy regulations, including information on processes  and models and quantitative information about the various risk categories.  Information is made available on the Groups website, dnbnor.no.  The holding company board has approved a capitalisation policy to ensure  that the Groups equity is adapted to the scope and risk pro le of operations,  RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL MONITORING AND MANAGING RISK is an integral part of  nancial operations. In DnB NOR, sound risk man- agement is a strategic tool to enhance value generation. Internal control should ensure effective operations and  prudent management of risks that could prevent the Group from attaining its business targets.  GOVERNANCE IN DnB NOR   DnB NOR Business Review 2010   44 based on the authorities capital adequacy requirements and DnB NORs  internal estimated capital requirements. The Board of Directors continually  monitors the Groups capital situation.  GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND EXECUTIVE BODIES  Organisation and responsibilities The group chief executive is responsible for implementing risk management  measures that help achieve targets for operations set by the holding com- pany board, including the development of effective management systems  and internal control.  The group management meeting is the group chief executives collegiate  body for management at group level. All important decisions concerning  risk and capital management will generally be made in consultation with the  group management team.  The group management meetings are attended by the group executive vice  presidents in charge of the business areas and staff and support units. A  number of advisory bodies have been established to assist in preparing  documentation and carrying out follow-ups and controls within various  specialist areas:    The Asset and Liability Committee, ALCO, is an advisory body for the chief   nancial of cer and handles matters relating to the management of mar- ket and funding risk, risk modelling, capital structure and return targets.    The Group has three central credit committees: the Group Advisory  Credit Committee, the Advisory Credit Committee for Large Corporates  and International, and the Advisory Credit Committee for Retail Banking .  The Group Advisory Credit Committee approves credits which affect both  business areas according to assigned authorisations and advises the  group chief executive and the Board of Directors in connection with large  individual credit proposals and other credits of an extraordinary nature.  The committee plays a key role in formulating the Groups credit policy,  credit strategies and credit regulations, as well as in assessing portfolio  risk. The Credit Committees for Large Corporates and International and for  Retail Banking approve credits according to assigned authorisations for  the respective business areas.    The Investment Committee is an advisory body with respect to the Groups  purchases and sales of equity instruments in the banks strategic and   nancial equity portfolios. Decisions on purchases and sales are delegated  based on authorised amounts and trading limits. Decisions on transac- tions in excess of NOK 250 million must be presented to the banks Board  of Directors.    The Operational Risk and Compliance Committee helps ensure effective  and consistent monitoring and reporting of operational risk throughout  the Group. A key task is to make sure that the Groups routines relating  to internal control and quality assurance are designed to provide added  value relative to group operations.  Implementation and monitoring  The basis for risk management in DnB NOR is that individual managers in  the Group are responsible for risk within their own area of responsibility and  must therefore have the necessary insight into and understanding of the  relevant units risk situation, thus ensuring that the management of such  risk is  nancially and administratively sound.  The group chief executive has issued more detailed guidelines concerning  the implementation of the group credit policy and credit strategies. Each  business area manages its own credit processes based on such guidelines.  Risk in Vital is monitored by measuring the overall decline in value which  Vital would be able to cover while meeting statutory minimum capital  requirements.   All units carry out an annual risk review which includes:  comments to the units work on risk management and internal control   risk assessments  an evaluation of compliance with external and internal regulations  planned improvement measures Reporting takes place at department level and forms the basis for aggregate  reports for business areas and support units, which in turn are included in  the group chief executives reports to the holding company board. Where  assessments identify particularly serious risks, these should be reported  along with an indication of relevant improvement measures.  GROUP FINANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT Organisation and responsibilities Group Finance and Risk Management has overall responsibility for risk  measurement and management and internal control and for assessing and  reporting the Groups overall risk situation. The Group Risk Management  division is organised in Group Finance and Risk Management and is headed  by the Groups chief risk of cer. All of the Groups risk entities are organised  in this division.  Implementation and monitoring  Group Risk Management prepares periodic reports to the Boards of  Directors of the holding company and the bank regarding developments in  the various risk categories. The group chief credit of cer presents a report  to the banks Board of Directors regarding the trend in the banking groups  credit risk. The Groups risk is measured in the form of risk-adjusted capital  requirements. Calculations of the business areas capital requirements are  based on the Groups internal risk model, see Capital management and risk  categories . Return on risk-adjusted capital is a factor in product pricing ,  pro t calculations and in monitoring performance in the business areas. GROUP COMPLIANCE  Organisation and responsibilities DnB NOR shall comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the  Groups operations, hereinafter referred to as compliance. The Board of  Directors has approved a compliance policy which describes the main  principles for compliance and how the compliance function is organised  in the Group. The compliance function is an independent function which  identi es, evaluates, gives advice on, monitors and reports on the Groups  compliance risk. In all business areas and support units, as well as in  large subsidiaries and international entities, compliance of cers have  been appointed with responsibility for ensuring compliance with relevant  regulations .  Implementation and monitoring  The group compliance of cer is responsible for the Groups overall control  of and reporting of compliance risk and any breach of laws and regula- tions pertaining to the Group. The group compliance of cer is organised  the Group Risk Management division and reports to the Board of Directors  through the group chief executive at least once a year. Compliance of c- ers in the business areas and support units issue periodic reports on the  current status and on any violations of regulations to the group compliance  of cer and to the heads of their respective units. The identi cation, assess- ment and monitoring of the Groups  nancial compliance risk is carried out  by Group Financial Reporting on behalf of the chief  nancial of cer.  AUDIT  Organisation and responsibilities Independent and effective audits will help ensure satisfactory risk manage- ment and internal control as well as reliable  nancial reporting. Group  Audit receives its instructions from the holding company board, which also  approves the departments annual plans and budgets.   Implementation and monitoring  As a quality check to ensure compliance with the conditions set by the  Board of Directors, Group Audit carries out independent risk assess- ments of and checks on group activities. The results of the audit activities  are reported to the Boards of Directors of the relevant companies in the  DnB NOR Group, the holding company board, the Audit Committee and  group management. Reports from Group Audit are also presented to the  Control Committee and the statutory auditor. Group Audit monitors that the  necessary measures are initiated and implemented.   GOVERNANCE IN DnB NOR   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     45 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT Group policy for risk management  DnB NORs group policy for risk management should serve as a guide  for DnB NORs overall risk management and describes the ambitions for,  attitudes to and work on risk in the DnB NOR Group.  According to the group policy for risk management, DnB NOR aims to  maintain a low risk pro le and will only assume risk which is comprehen- sible and possible to follow up, and which will not harm its reputation. The  Groups corporate culture shall be characterised by transparent methods  and processes which promote sound risk management. All managers are responsible for risk within their own area of responsibility.  Responsibility for entering into agreements which entail risk for the Group  will be delegated to the organisation through personal authorisations and  limits. Risk management functions and the development of risk manage- ment tools shall be organised in units which are independent of the units  which engage in business operations. Assessment of risk pro le and capital requirements Pursuant to the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act, all com- panies must at all times have an equity which is sound, based on the extent  of the companys activities and the risk they involve. The capital adequacy  regulations set a minimum primary capital requirement, encompassing  credit risk, market risk and operational risk. In addition,  nancial institutions  are required to complete an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process,  ICAAP. Finanstilsynet (the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway) has estab- lished guidelines for what such a process should include. The capital  adequacy assessment process should encompass risks which are not  included in the calculation of the minimum requirement. In addition, it  should re ect the fact that risk quanti cation and capital requirements are  based on methods and data which entail uncertainty. Capital requirement  assessments should be forward-looking and take account of business plans,  growth and access to capital markets. The capital base should be adequate  to get through a recession characterised by negative results and dif culties  in obtaining new capital. The ICAAP is reported to Finanstilsynet. As part  of the capital adequacy assessment process, DnB NOR has prepared a  capitalisation policy approved by the Board of Directors.  The capitalisation policy is aimed at ensuring that DnB NORs equity is  adequate to secure effective and optimal use of equity relative to the scope  and risk pro le of operations. The capitalisation policy shall balance the  need for a competitive return on equity with the need for stability required  by the supervisory authorities, bondholders, market players and other stake- holders, including rating companies. The capitalisation policy sets out a target of minimum 8 per cent Tier 1  capital upon full implementation of the IRB system, Internal Ratings Based.  As risk-weighted volume is affected by cyclical  uctuations, this means that  the Tier 1 capital ratio must be well over 8 per cent in good economic times  and minimum 8 per cent during an economic downturn. Based on the  signi cant changes which are expected in future regulatory requirements  governing the size and composition of  nancial institutions primary capital,  DnB NOR will review and update its capitalisation policy during 2011.    As part of its supervisory process, Finanstilsynet prepares an annual overall  risk assessment for the Group, including feedback on the capitalisation of  the Group. Processes have been established in DnB NOR to assess capital require- ments relative to the Groups risk pro le and the quality of established risk  management and control systems.

The Groups capitalisation target is an  important element in the budget and strategy process. Risk is quanti ed by  calculating risk-adjusted capital. Capital required will generally exceed the  measured risk.  A process for assessing the risk pro les and capital requirements of the  parent company DnB NOR ASA and all major subsidiaries is completed  each year, based on both risk-adjusted capital and qualitative assessments.  Stress tests for credit and market risk are other important references. The  Boards of Directors of the subsidiaries make independent assessments of  capital levels and future capital requirements based on guidelines in the  Groups capitalisation policy. The results are veri ed with the specialist units  in the respective subsidiaries and in DnB NOR ASA. The process and the  result thereof are documented in writing in an ICAAP report. DnB NORs  ICAAP report was sent to Finanstilsynet in May 2010. The Groups CFO is responsible for ensuring that the ICAAP process is  completed.   Basel II implementation  The Basel II regulations entered into force on 1 January 2007. The capital  adequacy regulations imply greater consistency between the authorities  capital adequacy requirements for  nancial institutions and the method  applied by the institutions themselves in calculating capital requirements.  For credit risk, capital requirements can be calculated according to the  standardised approach or based on internal models, IRB. The standardised  approach is largely based on previous regulations, Basel I, assigning risk  weights to claims on various debtors. Use of the IRB approach is subject to  approval by Finanstilsynet. DnB NOR has been granted permission to use the IRB approach for credit risk  to calculate capital adequacy for that part of the portfolio for which use of this  approach has been approved by Finanstilsynet. The table shows which port- folios this applies to and the Groups implementation plan for new portfolios.  Approximately 68 per cent of DnB NORs portfolio is reported according to  the IRB approach, measured by exposure at default. Practially all of the Groups mortgages secured by real property and a large  part of the corporate portfolio are reported according to the IRB approach.  This means that the banks models for expected default frequency, loss  given default and exposure are used for both internal management pur- poses and capital adequacy calculations.  The basic indicator approach, the standardised approach and the advanced  approach can all be used to measure operational risk under Basel II.  DnB NOR Bank ASA reports according to the standardised approach, while  some subsidiaries use the basic indicator approach. A shift to the most  advanced reporting standard, Avanced Measurement Approaches, AMA,  will be considered at a later date. The use of the most advanced approach  is subject to approval by Finanstilsynet.  Market risk can be reported according to the standardised approach or  based on internal models, the Internal Model Method, IMM. DnB NOR  reports according to the standardised approach.  Capital adequacy Risk-weighted volume included in the calculation of the Groups formal  capital adequacy requirement declined by NOK 24 billion in 2010, to  NOK 1 028 billion. The risk-weighted volume could not be reduced below  80 per cent of the Basel I requirement in 2010. In December 2009, this  rule was extended to apply till year-end 2011. Without the transitional rules,  risk-weighted volume would have been NOK 965 billion.

GOVERNANCE IN DnB NOR   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     47 The Tier I capital ratio was 10.1 per cent as at 31 December 2010, while  the capital adequacy ratio was 12.4 per cent.  Calculations have been made of the effect of full future implementa- tion of the Basel II regulations for all of the Groups portfolios, excluding  DnB NORD. The calculations showed a potential Tier I capital ratio of  12.3 per cent at end-December 2010 based on such implementation.  No similar reduction in capital can be expected, as the framework also  takes other factors into account. Risk-adjusted capital  Calculations of pro tability are based on internal calculations of economic  capital – risk-adjusted capital. Risk-adjusted capital is a measure of the risk  of losses generated by various business operations. Risk-adjusted capital  makes it possible to compare risk across risk categories and business  areas. Average losses over a normal business cycle represent expected  costs which should primarily be covered through correct pricing of the  Groups products. Risk-adjusted capital should cover unexpected losses.  The quanti cation of risk-adjusted capital is based on statistical probability  calculations for the various risk categories on the basis of historical data. As  it is impossible to guard against all potential losses, DnB NOR has stipulated  that risk-adjusted capital should cover 99.97 per cent of potential losses  within a one-year horizon. This level is in accordance with an Aa level rating  target for ordinary long-term debt.   Risk-adjusted capital and average losses over a normal business cycle are  elements in calculations of risk-adjusted return, which is a key  nancial  management parameter in the internal management of the DnB NOR  Group. The calculations are included in the  nancial planning for the  business areas and are reported each month. Risk-adjusted return is a  measurement parameter in the pricing model and is reported monthly in  automated management systems. Risk-adjusted capital is also used as  decision  support for risk management.  The similarities between the framework for risk-adjusted capital and the  capital adequacy regulations increase as a greater part of the Groups  portfolios are reported according to the IRB approach. The underlying risk  drivers for credit, and in part operational risk, are largely the same. Never- theless, the con dence levels differ, and risk-adjusted capital provides a  more conservative calculation. DnB NOR quanti es risk-adjusted capital for the following risk catego- ries: credit risk, market risk, market risk in life insurance, insurance risk,  operational risk and business risk. The risk-adjusted capital for the various  risk categories is calculated separately. In addition, risk-adjusted capital is  calculated for each business area. A signi cant diversi cation or portfolio  effect arises when the various risks are considered together, as it is unlikely  that all losses will occur at the same time. An economic downturn will  normally have a negative effect on most areas, but there will be a diversi-  cation effect, as not all areas will be hit equally hard. The diversi cation  effect between risk categories and business areas implies that the Groups  risk-adjusted capital will be much lower than if the business areas had been  independent companies.  Risk measurement is a  eld in constant development, and measurement  methods and tools are subject to continual improvement. During 2010,  insurance risk in life insurance was de ned as a separate risk category in  calculations of risk-adjusted capital. As part of the IRB introduction process,  new models have been implemented for caculating expected default  frequency , loss given default and exposure at default.  Estimated risk level At end-December 2010, net risk-adjusted capital for the Group was esti- mated at NOK 59 billion, a decline of NOK 3 billion from end-December  2009. Risk-adjusted capital for credit was NOK 45 billion, down NOK 5 bil- lion from a year earlier. The reduction re ects a general improvement in the  economy and a lower probability of default in the credit portfolios.  Risk-adjusted capital allocated to the business areas is based on the same  framework as for the Group. Risk-adjusted pro tability measures risk- adjusted pro ts relative to allocated capital. This enables comparisons of   nancial performance across business areas. Stress testing Stress testing is an important part of the risk and capital assessment process  and a key tool for analysing the Groups risk pro le. The stress tests should  identify aspects which could have a negative impact on the Group. An impor- tant part of stress testing is to investigate how susceptible the Groups IRB  system and the reported risk-weighted volume are to cyclical  uctuations. In the planning process, stess testing is used to identify possible negative  consequences of changes in macroeconomic conditions. RISK CATEGORIES   Risk measurement and monitoring constitute an integral part of DnB NORs  management processes. For risk management purposes, DnB NOR  distinguishes between the following risk categories: credit risk, market risk,  liquidity risk, market risk in life insurance, insurance risk, operational risk  and business risk. See description below.  Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of losses due to failure on the part of the Groups counter- parties or customers to meet their payment obligations towards the DnB NOR  Group. Credit risk refers to all claims against counterparties or customers,  including credit risk in trading operations, country risk and settlement  risk. The credit portfolio includes loans, liabilities in the form of other extended  credits, guarantees, leasing, factoring, interest-bearing securities, approved,  GOVERNANCE IN DnB NOR 0 20 40 60 80 100 Credit risk Market risk Market risk in  life insurance Insurance risk in life insurance Non-life insurance risk Operational risk Per cent Risk-adjusted capital per business area, 31 December 2010 Retail Banking Large Corporates and International DnB NOR Markets Insurance and Asset Management DnB NOR Group DnB NORD Offshore 51 208 Tanker 20 162 RoRo/ Container/ PCC 27 948 Dry bulk 29 460 Other shipping 17 546 Other (non-shipping) 16 388 Gas 18 924 Logistics 11 909 NOK million Segments in the Shipping, Offshore and Logistics division ) 1) Measured in terms of exposure at default.

Settlement risk arises in connection with pay- ment transfers as not all transactions take place in real time. Credit policy According to the Groups credit policy, approved by the Boards of Directors  of DnB NOR ASA and DnB NOR Bank ASA, the principal objective for credit  activity is that the loan portfolio should have a quality and a composition  which secure the Groups pro tability in the short and long term. The quality  of the credit portfolio should be consistent with DnB NORs low risk pro le  target.  Developments in credit risk in 2010  Credit growth in the corporate market, both in Norway and internationally,  increased somewhat during 2010 compared with 2009. Parallel to this,  credit quality improved in terms of both reduced probability of default and  a decline in actual loan-loss provisions. Shipping losses remained low in  spite of signi cant deliveries of new vessels in most segments. China and  other Asian countries maintained economic growth and ensured satisfactory  utilisation of the  eet.  Credit quality improved in that part of the portfolio which depends on  developments in the Norwegian economy, primarily loans to private indivi d- uals and small and medium-sized businesses in Norway. The international   nancial crisis had little impact on Norwegian private households. 2010 saw  continued low unemployment, healthy wage growth, low home mortgage  rates and an increase in housing prices. There was stable growth in the  home mortgage portfolio during 2010.  The Group is to some extent affected by the continued weak trend in the  international economy, especially in the Baltic States. However, write-downs  in DnB NORD were reduced in 2010, and the Baltic economies show signs  of stabilisation. There was a moderate level of write-downs on the portfolio  of loans to Norwegian companies, while there was a very low level of write- downs on loans to personal customers in Norway.  During 2010, the Group made extensive efforts to ensure the value of prob- lem commitments. A number of problem commitments were restructured,  with a positive result.  The uncertainty relating to DnB NORD will continue, and economic develop- ments in the Baltic States will be vital to the level of write-downs.   Credit risk management The Groups credit policy regulates credit activity in DnB NOR Bank. The  customers debt servicing capacity will be the key element when considering  whether to approve a credit. If the customer has not proven a satisfactory  debt servicing capacity, credit should normally not be extended even if the  collateral is adequate. The value of collateral should be assessed based on  estimated realisation value. The portfolio should be suf ciently  exible and  liquid to permit sales, syndication and securitisation of credits and the use  of credit derivatives. Credit operations must comply with business, credit and industry strategies  approved by the Board of Directors. According to DnB NORs corporate  social responsibility guidelines, DnB NOR has undertaken not to offer prod- ucts and services or perform acts representing a material risk of involvement  in unethical conduct, infringement of human or labour rights, corruption or  harm to the environment.  The Group aims to reduce large risk concentrations, whereby signi cant  changes in one or a few risk drivers may markedly affect the Groups  pro tability. Risk concentrations include large exposures to a customer or  customer group as well as clusters of commitments in high-risk classes,  industries and geographical areas. Credit exposure within shipping and  commercial property is monitored closely.  Credit approval authorisations are personal and graded on the basis of cus- tomers risk class. For large credits, there is a two-layered decision-making  procedure where credit approval authority rests with the business units  while  nal credit approval requires endorsement by a credit of cer who is  organisationally independent of the business units.  Commitments showing a negative development are identi ed and followed  up separately. All corporate customers granted credit must be classi ed according to risk  in connection with every signi cant credit approval and, unless otherwise  decided, at least once a year. In the personal banking market, where there  is a large number of customers, the majority of credit decisions should be  made on the basis of automated scoring and decision support systems. Risk  classi cation should re ect long-term risk associated with each customer  and the customers credit commitment.  The unit responsible for the classi cation system is organisationally  independent of the operative units. The classi cation models have been  developed to cover speci c loan portfolios.

All overrides must be well  founded and be made only in exceptional cases based on a thorough assess- ment. The effect of overrides is tested by an independent unit once a year. The risk classi cation systems are used as decision support, risk monitoring  and reporting. The risk parameters used in the classi cation systems are an  integrated part of the credit process and ongoing monitoring, including the  follow-up of credit strategies. Detailed rules are in place for the use and monitoring of collateral, including  guidelines for the valuation of various pledged assets and guarantees. Such  valuations are part of credit decisions and are reviewed in connection with  the annual renewal of the commitments. A procedure has been established  for the periodic control of collateral.  DnB NORD At year-end 2010, DnB NOR owned 100 per cent of DnB NORD after the  Group acquired NORD/LBs 49 per cent ownership interest in December  2010. DnB NORD has a network of branches in the Baltic region and  Poland. A project has been initiated to integrate DnB NORD into the Group  in 2011. Classi cation models and the IRB system The DnB NOR Group has extensive experience with classi cation systems  as support for credit decisions and monitoring. Data and analytical tools are  an integrated part of risk management.  The Groups credit risk models provide a basis for statistically based cal- culations of expected losses in a long-term perspective and risk-adjusted  capital in a portfolio perspective. The calculations are based on several risk  parameters, with the most important being:   Probability of default, PD, is used to measure quality. Customers are clas- si ed based on the probability of default.    Exposure at default, EAD, is an estimated  gure which includes amounts  drawn under credit limits or loans as well as a percentage share of com- mitted, undrawn credit lines.   Loss given default, LGD, indicates how much the Group expects to lose if  the customer fails to meet his obligations, taking the collateral provided by  the customer and other relevant factors into consideration.  The risk classes are de ned on the basis of the scales used by international  rating agencies. There are ten risk classes for performing loans. In addition,  impaired and non-performing commitments are placed in classes 11 and  12 respectively for reporting purposes.  DnB NORs models for risk classi cation of customers are subject to  continual improvement and testing. The models are adapted to different  industries and segments and are regularly upgraded to ensure that the  variables used in the models have high explanatory power at all times  based on key risk drivers for the individual parameters included in the  models. If an external rating has been given, such rating may be taken  into consideration when classifying individual commitments. The clas- si cation of institutional and country risk is based on classi cations by  external rating agencies. In 2007, DnB NOR was granted permission to use the Groups own clas- si cation systems as a basis for capital adequacy reporting for parts of the  credit portfolio. This has subsequently been extended to include use of  the Groups own models for severity and credit exposure, and an increas- ing share of the portfolio is included. Use of the Groups own calculations  of risk parameters in capital adequacy reporting is part of the IRB system,  de ned as the models, work processes, decision-making processes, control  mechanisms, IT systems and internal guidelines and routines used to clas- sify and quantify credit risk. The IRB system thus affects a major part of the  Groups operations, also across business areas and support and staff units.  Extensive efforts have been made over a number of years to establish the  IRB system. In addition, the bank has long and extensive experience from  the use of risk models and systems and maintains sound credit control. The  introduction of the IRB system has contributed to better credit risk manage- ment through improved follow-up systems. Validation is a key element in assuring the quality of the IRB system and  can be divided into quantitative and qualitative validation. The quantitative  validation tests the risk models, whereas the qualitative validation tests the  structure of the IRB system and whether it is used as intended. At least  once a year, the Board of Directors should be presented with a validation  report providing a basis for considering whether the Groups credit risk  is adequately classi ed and quanti ed. Responsibility for all validation  has been assigned to the chief  nancial of cer, while Group Credit Risk  Management  has responsibility for carrying out the validation process.  Credit risk measurement Credit risk is monitored by following developments in risk parameters,  migration and distribution over the various risk classes. Developments in  risk concentrations are monitored closely with respect to exposure, risk  classes and allocated risk-adjusted capital. Large customers and customer  groups are followed up based on risk class and allocated risk-adjusted  capital. In the corporate segment, all commitments which are considered to require  special follow-up during the credit approval process are identi ed. This  ensures management attention and follow-up. The models calculations of estimated probability of default should show  the average probability of default during a business cycle.

Conse- quently, stress testing is also used to assess the effects of a recession  on capital requirements. The stress tests should identify possible future  changes in economic conditions which could have a negative impact on  the Groups credit exposure and ability to withstand such changes. These  assessments are taken into account in the Groups risk and capital assess- ment process to determine the correct level of capital. Risk-adjusted capital for credit risk is aggregated based on individual com- mitments, where each commitment is classi ed with respect to quality in  the form of expected default frequency and the amount of loss experienced  in the event of default. The portfolio classi cation provides a basis for sta- tistically based calculations of normalised losses and risk-adjusted capital.  Calculations of risk-adjusted capital include the effect of industry concentra- tions, diversi cation effects and large exposures.   Market risk  Market risk is the risk of losses or reduced future income due to  uctuations  in market prices or exchange rates. The risk arises as a consequence of the  banks unhedged positions and exposure in the foreign exchange, interest  rate, commodity and equity markets. The risk level re ects market price  volatility and the positions taken.  A distinction is made between trading and banking actitivites. Trading  activities include trading and positions in  nancial instruments, aiming to  achieve a pro t by capitalising on differences and  uctuations in interest  rates and exchange rates, typically in a short-term perspective. Banking  activities include the Groups ordinary funding and lending operations,  where mismatches in  xed-rate periods for assets and liabilities represent  sources of market risk. In addition, DnB NOR also had investments in equity  instruments which are included in banking activities. The portfolio of  xed- income securities in DnB NOR Markets, the majority of which are classi ed  as held-to-maturity investments, is de ned as credit risk in the internal  measurement of risk-adjusted capital. Market risk in the trading portfolio arises through trading activities in the  interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity and equity markets. The risk  relates partly to customer business, though there is scope for moderate  risk-taking within proprietary trading in foreign exchange and  nancial  instruments. Positions will be generated by trading in balance sheet prod- ucts such as bonds and commercial paper, as well as  nancial derivatives  such as interest rate swaps, options, forward contracts and future rate  agreements. Such instruments are used to hedge positions in the trading  portfolio. Market risk arising in Vital is de ned as market risk related to the ownership  of the life insurance company. Due to current parameters for life insurance  operations, which entail risk sharing between policyholders and the owner  of the life insurance company, it is necessary to measure market risk in life  insurance separately. Market risk arising in DnB NOR Skadeforsikring is  insigni cant and is thus included in the insurance risk measurements. Overall, market risk represents a small share of the Groups total risk. Developments in market risk during 2010 Risk-adjusted capital for market risk rose from NOK 3.7 billion at the end  of 2009 to NOK 4.9 billion at end-December 2010. The increase mainly  re ected a revaluation of equity investments.  Interest rate risk was moderate throughout the year, representing a  NOK 348 million decline in value in the event of a parallel one percentage  point shift in the interest curve in an unfavourable direction in all currencies   at year-end 2010. Currency risk and the risk on equity instruments also  remained moderate through the year. Market risk management Limits established for the Groups market risk exposure also encompass  market risk in Vital and in DnB NOR Skadeforsikring. Responsibility for all trading activities in the DnB NOR Bank Group rests  with DnB NOR Markets. Limits and guidelines for managing market risk on  trading activities are reviewed at least once a year and are determined by  the Board of Directors of DnB NOR Bank. A unit independent of brokerage  operations checks positions in relation to limits and results on a daily basis.  Limit utilisation is reported through the Groups risk report. The Treasury function in the DnB NOR Bank Group handles interest rate  risk on the banking book. As for trading activities, limits and guidelines  for managing market risk are reviewed by the banks Board of Directors  once a year. Principles, methods, limits and follow-ups are based on the  same guidelines as trading activities, which includes daily measurement of  interest rate risk. Interest rate and currency risk in the banking group is cen- tralised, as all units in the banking group must hedge their positions through  the Treasury function.

Limits for equity instruments are determined by the Board of Directors of  DnB NOR Bank ASA. The limits are reviewed at least once a year.  Primary responsibility for following up, further developing and reporting all  types of investments in and purchases of equity instruments, including the  monitoring of mutual fund holdings invested in through DnB NOR Asset  Management, rests with Group Investments, which is organised under  Group Finance and Risk Management. The unit is part of the banks contin- gency team handling non-performing commitments as it is also responsible  for credit commitments where the bank takes ownership positions. Follow- ups take place on a monthly basis. Market risk measurement When measuring market risk, a distinction is made between measurements  of risk under normal market conditions and measurements which focus on  extreme market conditions.  Several tools have been established to quantify and measure the Groups  total market risk exposure under normal conditions. Interest rate risk is  measured as the change in value resulting from an interest rate adjustment  of one basis point. Limits for foreign exchange, equity and commodity risk  represent nominal amounts for individual positions. In addition, Value- at-Risk calculations are used in operational management and control in  DnB NOR Markets. Risk measurement under extreme market conditions includes stress tests  and calculations of risk-adjusted capital. Stress tests are also used to follow  up non-linear instruments and interest rate risk.  Risk-adjusted capital for market risk is calculated by simulating potential  losses on the basis of expected maximum exposure, liquidation periods for  positions and correlations between the portfolios. Correlations are based on  a stressed scenario. The liquidation period ranges from 250 trading days for  equity instruments in the banking book to two trading days for positions in  the most commonly traded currencies. Calculations of risk-adjusted capital  distinguish between trading and banking activities. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its obligations  as they fall due, and risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liquidity   obligations without a substantial rise in appurtenant costs. In a broader  perspective, liquidity risk also includes the risk that the Group will be unable  to  nance increases in assets as its funding requirements rise. Risk pro le In line with the banks other operations, liquidity risk should be low and  promote the banks  nancial strength and ability to withstand various events  and developments. This implies that the bank should seek to have a balance   sheet structure that re ects the liquidity pro le of an international bank with  an Aa level long-term credit rating from recognised rating agencies. Developments in liquidity risk during 2010 Throughout 2010, the short-term funding markets were sound and stable  for banks with good credit ratings, and the access to funding volumes with  different maturities was close to normal. However, as the group of interna- tional banks which were considered to be well quali ed grew during the  year, competition for funding increased somewhat.  Financially strong banks generally had good access to long-term funding.  At times, however, uncertainty regarding European sovereign debt had pro- nounced effects on price levels, and the markets were thus still challenging  at the end of the year.  In December 2009, the Basel Committee launched proposals for new,  global standards for quantitative regulation of liquidity and funding in the  banking sector, Basel III. Even though the proposals were moderated some- what during 2010, they remain conservative and may be challenging to  ful l for a number of banks. The requirements will entail future changes in  banks balance sheet structure, and both DnB NOR and other international  banks are in the process of preparing for the changes by securing more  long-term funding.  The cost of long-term funding in 2010 was considerably higher than during  the period prior to the  nancial crisis for both DnB NOR and other banks.  Though the  nancial crisis is becoming more of a distant memory, funding  costs remain at a relatively high level due to stricter long-term funding require- ments for banks, cf. the above-mentioned regulatory proposal. Along with  uncertainty regarding sovereign debt in a number of European countries, this  may still cause some instability, especially in the long-term funding markets.  DnB NOR enjoyed a sound liquidity situation at year-end 2010. The  average remaining term to maturity for the portfolio of senior bond debt  was 3.6 years at end-December 2010, an increase from 3.0 years a year  earlier. The Group aims to achieve a sound and stable maturity structure for  funding  over the next  ve years.    Liquidity risk management  The Board of Directors regularly reviews the banks liquidity risk and deter- mines limits and guidelines.

Group Finance and Risk Management has divided the responsibility for  determining principles and limits for liquidity management and for arrang- ing long-term funding between the Asset and Liability Management unit  and the IR/Long-term Funding unit. The Treasury function is responsible  for modifying the Groups total short-term liquidity risk and for ensuring  that liquidity requirements are within the short-term limits established by  the Board of Directors. The unit also has operative responsibility for long- term bond debt in Norwegian kroner, while the operative responsibility for  liquidity management in other currencies lies with DnB NOR Markets. The  Asset and Liability Committee, ALCO, is the advisory body for DnB NORs  CFO with respect to principles and methods for liquidity risk measure- ment.  Overall liquidity management in the DnB NOR Bank Group is based on  DnB NOR Bank ASA providing funding for subsidiaries such as Nord- landsbanken and international branches and subsidiaries. Liquidity risk  is managed through both short-term limits which restrict the net re nan- cing requirement within one week and one month, along with a long-term  manage ment target which speci es the share of lending to be  nanced  by customer deposits or funding with a residual maturity of minimum  12 months. Liquidity risk limits reduce the banks dependence on short- term funding from the money and capital markets in Norway and abroad.  The limits have been established as funding from such sources is generally  more unstable than ordinary deposits. Liquidity management in DnB NOR implies maintaining a broad deposit  and funding base, representing both retail and corporate customers, along  with diversi ed funding of other operations. As an element in this strategy, a  number of funding programmes have been established in different markets.  DnB NOR has a commercial paper programme of USD 18 billion in the US  and a commercial paper programme of EUR 10 billion in Europe. The short- term funding sources are further diversi ed through a so-called Yankee CD  programme, where commercial paper are issued by DnB NORs New York  branch. The bank also has a European Medium Term Note Programme of  EUR 45 billion and a USD 8 billion long-term funding programme in the US  market.  An important instrument for long-term funding is the issue of covered  bonds. The bonds are issued by the banks subsidiaries DnB NOR Bolig- kreditt AS and DnB NOR Nringskreditt AS, and are secured by the com- panies home mortgage and commercial mortgage portfolios, respectively.  During the  nancial market turmoil, covered bonds proved to be a more  robust and considerably lower priced funding instrument than ordinary  bonds. Over the next few years, DnB NOR will thus seek to cover a large  share of its long-term funding requirement through the issue of covered  bonds. As an element in ongoing liquidity management, DnB NOR Bank needs to  have a holding of securities that can be used in various ways to regulate the  Groups liquidity requirements and serve as collateral for operations in the  main currencies in which the bank is active. The securities are used, among  other things, as collateral for short-term loans in a number of central banks  and serve as liquidity buffers to ful l regulatory requirements. The bank has  chosen to meet its need for liquid securities by holding international bonds  of superior credit quality. At end-December 2010, the international bond  portfolio totalled NOK 115 billion, of which 96 per cent were securities with  an AAA rating, while 3 per cent had an AA rating. In addition, the bank had  a portfolio of Norwegian Treasury bills totalling NOK 112 billion at year-end  2010. DnB NOR gives priority to maintaining sound business relations with a large  number of international investors and banks and to promoting the Group in  international capital markets.         Liquidity risk measurement  Liquidity risk is managed and measured using various measurement tech- niques, as no single technique can quantify this type of risk. The techniques  include monitoring re nancing needs, balance sheet key ratios, average  residual maturity and future funding requirements. DnB NOR also uses  stress testing, simulating the liquidity effect of a downgrading of the banks  international credit rating following one or more negative events. The results  of such stress testing are included in the banking groups contingency plan  for liquidity management during a  nancial crisis. The re nancing requirement limits re ect that the bank should be self- suf cient with regard to liquidity for a minimum period of one month in an  acute situation. The limit for structural liquidity risk implies that minimum  90 per cent of lending to the general public should be  nanced through  customer deposits, long-term funding and primary capital.  The bank regularly reviews the premises underlying liquidity management.  This includes considering whether assets which are classi ed as liquid, may  be realised or used as collateral in accordance with the underlying prem- ises, and to what extent assumptions regarding stable funding are realistic  in a bank-speci c crisis or in a deteriorating market. Market risk in life insurance  Market risk in life insurance is the risk that the return on  nancial assets  will not be suf cient to meet the obligations speci ed in insurance  policies .  According to current parameters for life insurance operations in Norway,  Vital carries the risk of ful lling the companys commitments in contracts  with policyholders. The return on  nancial assets must be suf cient to meet  the guaranteed annual return to the companys policyholders. If this is not  the case, additional allocations will have to be used, representing buffer  GOVERNANCE IN DnB NOR 31 Dec. 2005 31 Dec. 2006 31 Dec. 2007 31 Dec. 2008 31 Dec. 2009 31 Dec. 2010 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 Years Average term to maturity for the bond portfolio, senior debt 0 200 100 400 300 500 600 700 0 20 10 40 30 50 60 70 Total customer deposits (NOK billion) Total ratio of deposits to lending (per cent) 31 Dec. 2007 31 Dec. 2008 31 Dec. 2009 31 Dec. 2010 NOK billion Per cent Customer deposits and ratio of deposits to lending   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     53 capital built up from pro ts in previous years. Alternatively, the shortfall  could be charged to equity. Market risk in life insurance is the chief risk category in Vital. Developments in market risk in life insurance in 2010   At the end of 2010, the average annual guaranteed return was 3.3 per cent.  The yield on Norwegian 10-year government bonds declined from 4.2 per  cent at year-end 2009 to 3.7 per cent at end-December 2010. In conse- quence, overall long-term  nancial risk in Vital increased somewhat.  The DnB NOR Group reported risk-adjusted capital for market risk in life  insurance of NOK 12.9 billion at the end of 2010 and NOK 10.3 billion at  end-December 2009. A signi cant increase in equity exposure contributed  to the rise in risk-adjusted capital. Management of market risk in life insurance Risk management in Vital is part of the companys strategy, which has been  approved by the Board of Directors. Through regular assessments by the  Groups Asset and Liability Committee, ALCO, the risk situation in Vital is  reviewed relative to the Groups overall risk pro le. Vitals chief executive   and Board of Directors are to help ensure that Vitals strategy and risk  management are consistent with the DnB NOR Groups risk pro le. The  Risk Analysis and Control unit is organised independent of the companys   nancial management and business areas and is responsible for reporting,  monitoring and follow-up of the companys total risk. Every four months,  the unit prepares a risk report for the companys management and Board  of Directors. Risk reports to Vitals management and Board of Directors include stress  tests and sensitivity tests to enable continual monitoring of the companys  total risk. The Risk Analysis and Control unit oversees  nancial market  developments on a daily basis and issues weekly reports on the level of risk  relative to the risk limit for asset management. Compliance with laws and  regulations and internal guidelines is reported monthly.  The asset management strategy aims to reduce earnings  uctuations. In  order to comply with the need for minimum diversi cation, limits have been  set for each asset class. The limits also restrict concentration risk relative  to individual issuers. Separate limits have been established for derivatives  within asset management. All asset management limits are determined each  year by the Boards of Directors of DnB NOR ASA and Vital.   Solvency II Solvency II are new EU regulations which, among other things, will replace  the current minimum requirements for capital adequacy and solvency mar- gin. The framework directive was approved in May 2009, and  nal imple- mentation in national regulations is scheduled to take place by end-October  2012. Supplementary provisions to the framework directive are currently  under consultation and are expected to be approved in 2011. The regulations are based on the same structure as Basel II, with three  pillars. This implies that in addition to minimum capital adequacy require- ments, Solvency II will also include qualitative requirements regarding  operational and risk management, the internal capital adequacy assess- ment process and more stringent external reporting requirements. The  new requirements will be more risk-sensitive and ensure better insight into  insurance companies actual risk pro les. Vital has participated in the quantitative studies implemented for the Euro- pean insurance industry. The company has also performed a gap analysis. The Group has initiated a programme for developing new solutions and  implementing Solvency II. The programme aims to ensure that the Group is  in compliance with the regulations by 1 January 2013. A good dialogue has  been established with government and industry bodies to ensure the best  possible adaptation of the Norwegian regulations during the period until  they enter into force. Measurement of market risk in life insurance   Measurement of market risk in Vital includes stress tests and sensitivity   analyses. The internally developed stress test calculates the total loss  potential for market, insurance, credit, operational and business risk.  When determining the overall investment risk tolerance, this loss potential  is measured against the companys buffer capital in excess of the regula- tory requirement. This method is also used as a basis for measuring and  determining the limit for market and credit risk in asset management.  Calculations of the loss potential associated with market and credit risk  include stress tests for equity, interest rate, property, spread and counter- party risk, respectively.  Sensitivity analyses have been established which estimate the change in  value and effects on pro ts of a 20 per cent fall in equity prices, a 1.5 per- centage point rise in interest rates and a 12 per cent reduction in property  prices. The sensitivity analyses are carried out separately. Risk-adjusted capital re ects the ownership risk associated with the  DnB NOR Group, as owner of the life insurance company, having to  report a net loss from these operations and possibly being required to  inject new equity. In the calculations of risk-adjusted capital, develop- ments in the value of the insurance companys  nancial assets are  simulated. In the simulations , a distinction is made between policy- holders funds and company funds, whereby the companys capital is  managed separately at the owners expense and risk. Value developments  are simulated on a daily basis for all portfolios, taking account of the level  of correlation between the sub-portfolios. The values are tested against  limits which indicate when DnB NOR will have to record losses.

The calculations   also include the effect of a possible rebalancing of the portfolio, i.e.  dynamic adaptation of risk. Insurance risk  Insurance risk in DnB NOR comprises insurance risk in life insurance and  risk in DnB NOR Skadeforsikring. Insurance risk in life insurance is the risk related to changes in future insur- ance payments due to changes in life expectancy and disability rates.  Risk in DnB NOR Skadeforsikring includes insurance, market, credit,  operational and business risk. Insurance risk is the risk of losses if insur- ance premiums fail to cover future claims payments. The non-life insurance  company is exposed to market and credit risk in investment operations, and  reassurance agreements encompass credit risk. However, based on the cur- rent business model for DnB NOR Skadeforsikring, these risk categories are  of little signi cance compared with pure insurance risk.  Developments in insurance risk in 2010   The DnB NOR Groups risk-adjusted capital for insurance risk was NOK 1.8  billion at year-end 2010, compared with NOK 1.6 billion at end-December  2009. Insurance risk in life insurance primarily relates to the need for provi- sions for higher future insurance payments due to an increase in average  life expectancy. At year-end 2010, risk-adjusted capital was estimated at  NOK 1 billion, virtually unchanged from year-end 2009. Risk-adjusted  capital  in DnB NOR Skadeforsikring was estimated at NOK 0.8 billion.  Due to growth in the insurance portfolio, there was an increase in non- life insurance risk during 2010. The premium portfolio totalled NOK 1.1  billion at year-end 2010. More than 90 per cent of the premium portfolio  represents insurance coverage for individual customers. A limited range of  products is offered to small and medium-sized companies. Management of insurance risk In 2010, Vital worked out a special strategy for insurance risk management,  which includes the scope and type of reassurance contracts to be entered  into and measures to meet higher life expectancy. The risk results are peri- odically monitored, and in the longer term, developments will be re ected in  prices, products and market strategies.  DnB NOR Skadeforsikrings Board of Directors has established a strategy   and principal guidelines for market and insurance risk, including the  premises for the companys reinsurance hedging. Through the reassurance  programme, the total risk is geared to the capital base. The reassurance  programme also contributes to pro t equalisation by hedging catastrophe  risk. Credit and market risk is managed through the investment plan, which  is considered by the companys Asset and Liability Committee and Board of  Directors once a year.  Insurance risk in DnB NOR Skadeforsikring is continually monitored by  tracking pro tability on all products. In addition, the claims reserve is  reviewed on a quarterly basis. Measurement of insurance risk Risk-adjusted capital for insurance risk in life insurance is measured as the  potential need to strengthen insurance provisions due to changes in life  expectancy, mortality and disability. Risk-adjusted capital for non-life insurance risk is measured on the basis  of Finanstilsynets stress test for calculating total risk and is also calibrated  against DnB NORs con dence level. Operational risk  Operational risk is the risk of losses due to de ciencies or errors in  processes and systems, errors made by employees or external events.  Operational  risk is a consequence of DnB NORs operations.  Developments in operational risk during 2010 The registration of operational loss events started on 1 January 2005. The  Group thus has data on operational loss events dating back  ve years  and experience from just under 2 700 events. Operational losses average  approximately NOK 25 million each quarter, though major individual events  could have a signi cant impact on the loss level. A total of 454 operational loss events were reported during 2010, causing  an overall net loss of NOK 182 million. Potential losses relating to the same  events represented just under NOK 1.3 billion, which was roughly on a level  with previous years.  The majority of events and the largest losses are still in the category pro- cessing and routine errors relating to the Groups products and services.  This underlines the importance of having high-quality processes and  well-documented routines which are evaluated and reviewed on a regular  basis. As in 2009, there was a continued rise in the number of fraud-related  events. However, the effects of most of these events are recorded as credit  losses even though operational risk constitutes the underlying cause.  At end-December 2010, risk-adjusted capital for operational risk was  estimated  at NOK 7.7 billion. Operational risk management  The Board of Directors has laid down a policy for the management of opera- tional risk in the Group. Operational risk should be low, and risk manage- ment should ensure that the risk of unwanted losses is reduced.

This is to be ensured through risk  assessments of everyday operations, of all major changes in operations  as well as of particularly critical functions. When a need for improvement  measures is identi ed, special follow-ups are initiated. In order to limit the  consequences of serious events, operational disruptions etc., comprehen- sive contingency and business continuity plans have been drawn up to  be able to handle a crisis situation in a rational and effective  manner, thus  contributing to limiting damage and restoring a normal situation .  In all business areas, special groups have been established to support  management in managing operational risk. Responsibilities include assess- ing and reporting identi ed risks and helping to prevent operational losses.  To ensure independence relative to business operations, these persons  are organised in the business areas respective staff units. Their work also  includes making sure that operations are in compliance with relevant laws  and regulations. All reporting is a two-way process, both through the line  organisation and through the Groups central risk unit. Operational risk  management and compliance at group level is organised in a separate unit  within Group Risk Management, which is organised under the staff area  Group Finance and Risk Management.  The Groups insurance coverage is an element in operational risk manage- ment. Insurance contracts are entered into to limit the  nancial conse- quences of undesirable events which occur in spite of established security  routines and other risk-mitigating measures. The contracts will typically  provide coverage against criminal attacks, damage to the Groups assets,  various types of business liabilities, operational disruptions etc. The insur- ance programme also covers legal liabilities the Group may face related  to its operations, i.e. professional liability. The insurance programme is  cost-effective and primarily aims to cover serious loss events in line with  the Groups insurance policy. The deductible risk is handled through the  Groups captive company, DnB NOR Reinsurance SA. Operational risk measurement  Operational loss events in the Group which result in losses of more  than NOK 50 000 and near-events with a loss potential of more than  NOK 100 000 are registered, reported and followed up on an ongoing basis  in the Groups event database. Information about operational risk and loss  events in the Group is provided in the Groups risk report. Undesirable  events which cause, or could have caused,  nancial losses for the Group,  represent valuable information and learning about necessary improvement  needs. In addition to learning from internal events, the Groups membership  in an external database, Operational Risk Exchange, ORX, as from 2011 will  ensure access to external events which will strengthen the work on opera- tional risk management. The Board of Directors is kept updated on the status of operational risk  through the Groups periodic risk report, which provides a basis for analys- ing the risk situation and for considering the capitalisation of the Group. In  addition, the Board of Directors is kept updated on the Groups operational  risk in the annual status report on ongoing management and control of  operational and business risk. The status report includes a presentation  of key group-wide risks, relevant improvement measures and a detailed  GOVERNANCE IN DnB NOR   DnB NOR Business Review 2010   56 qualitative assessment based on the Groups ambitions within key areas for  risk management and quality assurance. The conclusion in the report for  2010 was that the Groups operational risk was at a satisfactory level and  that operations, management and control were of high quality.   Risk-adjusted capital for operational risk is calculated based on external  capital requirements, where income and the type of business operations are  the drivers for capital volumes, and is adjusted upward to re ect DnB NORs  risk tolerance.  Business risk  Business risk is the risk of losses due to external factors such as the market  situation or government regulations. Such risk includes loss of income due  to a weakened reputation. Business risk is manifested in an unexpected decline in pro ts. Such a  decline can be caused by competitive conditions resulting in lower volumes  and pressure on prices, competitors introducing new products, government  regulations or negative media coverage. Losses arise if the Group fails to  adapt its cost base to such changes.  Negative media coverage may be a consequence of other risk factors, but is  handled as business risk in DnB NOR. A damaged reputation can have an  adverse impact on all business areas, independent of where in the Group or  in the rest of the  nancial industry the original incident occurred. Developments in business risk in 2010 Risk-adjusted capital for business risk represented NOK 4.5 billion at year- end 2010, up from NOK 4.1 billion a year earlier.   Business risk management and measurement As business risk may arise due to various risk factors, a broad range of tools  is applied to identify and report such risk. Sound strategic planning is instrumental in reducing business risk. Repu- tational risk is managed through policies and business activities, including  compliance.  The Groups active commitment to corporate social responsibility and the  code of ethics for employees also have a positive impact on business risk.   Reputational risk is followed up by monitoring media coverage, while  the competitive situation is followed up by analysing market trends and  developments  in market shares.   The Group has developed a model for calculating business risk per business  area. The model is based on past  uctuations in income and costs and is  structured so that if all other factors are kept constant, high income volatility   raises the risk level and thus risk-adjusted capital. Vice versa, a highly   exible  cost structure will reduce risk-adjusted capital.  GOVERNANCE IN DnB NOR   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     57 DnB NOR had a market capitalisation of NOK 133 billion at end-December  2010 and was the third largest company listed on Oslo Brs (the Oslo Stock  Exchange). The Groups market capitalisation was NOK 102 billion at year- end 2009.  The DnB NOR share is covered by 13 Nordic-based and 14 international  brokerage houses. It is in the interests of DnB NOR that high-quality equity  analyses are published. Emphasis is thus placed on providing relevant,  complete and high-quality information and on ensuring that all analysts,  regardless of their assessments of the DnB NOR share, receive equal treat- ment at all times. A list of analysts following the DnB NOR share can be  found on dnbnor.no. Daily contact with investors and analysts is handled by  the Investor Relations/Long-term Funding department. A further description  of DnB NORs shareholder policy can be found in the chapter Corporate  governance in the Annual Report 2010. RETURNS AND DIVIDEND POLICY The price of the DnB NOR share increased by 33 per cent during 2010,  including dividends, and a dividend of NOK 1.75 per share was paid for  2009. The positive development re ected less uncertainty in the global  economy in general combined with a very healthy trend in the Norwegian  economy. The Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of NOK 4.00 per  share for 2009.  DnB NORs primary objective is to create value for shareholders through an  attractive and competitive return relative to comparable investment alterna- tives, partly through increases in share price and partly through dividend  payments. The Board of Directors has approved a dividend policy for the  company which aims to ful l this objective. DnB NOR intends to distribute  approximately 50 per cent of net annual pro ts as dividends provided that  capital adequacy is at a satisfactory level. Dividends will be determined on  the basis of expected pro t levels in a normalised market situation, prevail- ing economic parameters and the Groups need for capital.  SHARE TURNOVER  The total trading volume for the DnB NOR share on Oslo Brs was NOK 88  billion in 2010, a 38 per cent increase compared with the previous year.  The number of transactions was 800 867, up 18 per cent. The average daily  trading volume for the DnB NOR share was 5 million shares in 2010 (table  2), which represented approximately 4 per cent of the total trading volume  on Oslo Brs.   Derivative contracts on the DnB NOR share are also traded on Oslo Brs.  In 2010, options related to the DnB NOR share were sold on 215 of the  252 trading days for a total value of NOK 37 million. In addition, forward  contracts for NOK 307 million, warrants for NOK 10 million and Exchange  Traded Notes for NOK 0.4 million were traded.    At the beginning of 2011, the DnB NOR share is weighted on all relevant  Oslo Brs indices, with 9.5, 7.9, 11.9 and 8.6 per cent, respectively, on  the benchmark, all-share, OBX and mutual fund indices. DnB NOR is also  represented on various global indices, but with relatively low weights.  2010 WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR for the DnB NOR share, with a 33 per cent rise in the share price, adjusted  for dividends. This was signi cantly better than the 19 per cent unweighted average increase in the share prices  of the Groups Nordic peers.

The object of the Savings Bank Foundation is to manage its long-term  ownership interests in DnB NOR and support the company in its efforts to  continue the savings bank tradition. The Foundation donates a portion of  annual pro ts to non-pro t causes. The Foundations governing body is the  general meeting, with members elected among the banks customers and  by county councils in eastern Norway. The general meeting has elected a  board with six members.

Corresponding losses on the sale of shares are not tax deductible.  The tax exemption model applies to corporate shareholders etc. resident in  Norway and to corresponding business entities resident in other countries.  The tax exemption on dividends received by foreign corporate shareholders  applies only within the EEA and only if the corporate shareholder is genuinely  established and carries out genuine economic activity in an EEA country. Shareholders eligible for the tax exemption model must nevertheless record  as income 3 per cent of income on shares comprised by the tax exemp- tion model. As the normal tax rate is 28 per cent, such income will thus be  taxed at a rate of 0.84 per cent. This tax liability does not apply to foreign  corporate shareholders. The taxable income will be calculated on the basis of net tax-exempt income  according to the tax exemption model. The tax base thus represents tax- exempt income on shares in the form of dividends and gains on the sale of  shares, minus non-deductible losses on the sale of shares. When calculat- ing gains and losses, a deduction is made for acquisition and sales costs.  A possible negative tax base from one year cannot be carried forward to  subsequent  scal years. Natural persons as shareholders The tax exemption model applies to shareholders who are natural persons  resident in Norway. This implies that dividends on shares and gains on the  sale of shares in excess of a shielded amount (the shielding deduction)  are taxed at a rate of 28 per cent, with a corresponding deduction right for  losses on the sale of shares.  The shielded amount should correspond to the return on an alternative  risk-free investment. The shielding deduction is computed by multiplying the  shielding basis by a shielding interest. In principle, the shielding basis repre- sents the amount the shareholder has paid for the share, with the addition of  any costs accrued upon acquiring the share. Moreover, any unused shielding  deduction carried forward from previous years should be added. For shares  acquired prior to 1 January 2006, RISK adjustments during the period of  ownership should be used to adjust the shielding basis up or down. A shielding basis should be calculated individually for each share. Thus, if  shares in the same share class owned by a shareholder are acquired on dif- ferent dates and at various prices, the shielding deduction may vary. When  selling shares, the FIFO principle applies (First In First Out), whereby the  shares that were acquired  rst, are sold  rst.  The shielding interest is based on the average three-month yield on Treas- ury bills after taxes. The Norwegian Directorate of Taxes calculates and  announces the yield for each  scal year in January/February the year after  the  scal year in question. The shielding deduction is calculated annually and is assigned to each  share on 31 December of the  scal year. Shareholders may require that the  shielding deduction be deducted from dividends on the share or gains from  the sale of the share. The deduction is calculated individually for each share  and can only be deducted from dividends and gains on the same share.  Thus, it is not permissible to deduct unutilised shielding deductions relating  to one share from gains on another share. Unutilised shielding deductions  may be carried forward, and shareholders may require that such deduc- tions be deducted from dividends or gains on the same share in subsequent  years. If the sale of the share has resulted in a loss, a claim cannot be made  to deduct the unutilised shielding deduction.   The Norwegian Tax Administrations register of Norwegian limited compa- nies and their shares, called the shareholder register, contains the above  information about shares in Norwegian companies, including DnB NOR  ASA. The register is based on information from the Norwegian Central  Securities  Depository, DnB NOR ASA and the shareholders themselves.  Each year, statements from the register are sent to all Norwegian share- holders to be used in preparing their tax returns.     Foreign shareholders Gains on the sale of shares are, as a rule, not taxable in Norway when the  shareholder is a person or a company resident outside Norway. As a general rule, dividends received by foreign shareholders are subject to  tax in Norway. For shareholders who are natural persons resident outside  Norway, withholding tax should always be assessed and deducted at a rate  of 25 per cent. However, Norway has entered into tax treaties with a number  of countries, whereby the withholding tax rate is often reduced, normally to  15 per cent. Shareholders who are tax resident in other EEA countries are  entitled to a shielding deduction. If the withholding tax deducted is higher  than the tax payable on dividends after the shielding deduction, the share- holder may reclaim the excess withholding tax. If the shielding deduction  exceeds dividends received during the relevant year, the unutilised shielding  deduction may be carried forward and be deducted from dividends on the  same share in subsequent years. If a shareholder does not claim repayment  of excess withholding tax based on the right to a shielding deduction, the  part of the shielding deduction that does not exceed the years dividend pay- ments, is annulled. The same applies in cases where the shielding deduction  cannot be used as the withholding tax under the relevant tax treaty is lower  than the tax assessed on dividends after deducting the shielding deduction.  As mentioned above, foreign corporate shareholders resident in an EEA  country are eligible for the tax exemption model and thus exempted from  withholding tax on dividends. The tax exemption is conditional on the  foreign limited liability company etc. being the real bene cial owner of the  share dividends.   The company distributing the dividends is responsible for making advance  tax deductions to cover the income tax on such dividends. In cases where incorrect or too much withholding tax is deducted upon the  distribution of dividends, the foreign shareholder may apply to the Central  Of ce - Foreign Tax Affairs for a refund.  GOVERNANCE IN DnB NOR   DnB NOR Business Review 2010   62 SOCIETY AND EMPLOYEES Society  and employees   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     63 Corporate social responsibility 64 Employees 68  SOCIETY AND EMPLOYEES   DnB NOR Business Review 2010   64 SOCIETY AND EMPLOYEES As Norways largest bank, DnB NOR plays an important role in society. The  Group provides  nance, enabling companies and households to realise their  plans and ambitions, secure jobs and develop products and services. In  addition to providing credit, DnB NORs role is to contribute towards a com- mon infrastructure for payment transfers and offer payment services, while  managing and insuring both  nancial and non- nancial values.  One in two Norwegians has a private customer relationship with DnB NOR.  With 200 000 corporate customers, the bank helps secure jobs and pro- motes value creation in both Norway and internationally. The Groups vision,  Creating value through the art of serving the customer, aims to highlight  that contact with customers plays a decisive role in creating  nancial values  and in understanding and safeguarding corporate social responsibility. TRANSPARENCY DnB NORs CSR policy follows Norwegian standards, as well as international  guidelines and initiatives, including the OECDs guidelines for multinational  companies and the UN Global Compact. DnB NOR emphasises transpar- ency and is committed to maintaining an open dialogue with its stake- holders. All communication to all target groups should be open, honest  and unambiguous. The Groups code of ethics for employees and elected  representatives is further described in the chapter on employees. The Groups reporting of CSR topics is based on the Global Reporting Initia- tive framework. In the spring of 2010, DnB NOR issued a separate report on  the Groups CSR practices during the two preceding years, including targets  and measures for 2010 and 2011. The report was reviewed by an external  auditor. Moreover, the Farmand jury named the annual report for 2009 best  in class for listed companies in Norway. In 2010, DnB NOR quali ed for inclusion, for the second year in a row, in  the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World). This  means that the Group is considered to be among the top ten per cent in  its industry in the world in terms of contributing towards sustainability.  DnB NOR is also included in the FTSE4Good Sustainability Index. CLIMATE AND THE ENVIRONMENT  Sustainable environmental management and measures to reduce the scope  and effects of climate change are prerequisites for long-term value creation  for the DnB NOR Group. DnB NOR will contribute both by implementing  measures within its own operations and by in uencing customers and sup- pliers to make environmentally-friendly choices.  In 2010, DnB NOR became part of the Global Compact Caring for  Climate  initiative. By endorsing the Caring for Climate statement, DnB NOR  commits itself to developing practical solutions to meet the climate chal- lenge, in uencing the authorities to draw up environmentally-friendly legisla- tion and framework conditions, and contributing to shaping public attitudes  on climate change. In 2010, DnB NOR participated again in the Carbon  Disclosure Project, a climate reporting project, both by being among the  534 investors who are the formal signatories of the survey, and by answering  the survey on behalf of its own operations. The Carbon Disclosure Project  collects and publishes information about the emission of greenhouse  gases from businesses and about the strategies and measures imple- mented by companies to reduce their emissions and manage the effects of  climate  change. DnB NOR is building new headquarters in Bjrvika in Oslo for some 4 000  employees. In 2010, an environmental plan was approved for the building  complex. The environmental targets for the new headquarters are ambitious  and include reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions  per employee by more than 50 per cent. In addition, it is planned that sup- plied energy in the new building will not exceed 120 kwh/m2 and that actual  energy consumption will be less than 140 kwh/m2. The energy sources will  be chie y renewable, including thermal energy from seawater. Waste per  employee is to be reduced by 30 per cent and paper consumption is to be  halved. With respect to transportation targets, the aim is that new technology,  new procedures and proximity to collective means of transport in Bjrvika will  reduce employee commuting by own car by 50 per cent, the number of taxi  journeys by 50 per cent and business  ight travel by 10 per cent. Environmental criteria have also been set for all procurement to the new  headquarters, entailing that priority will be given to not buying more than is  necessary, since all purchases have an environmental impact. A life cycle  perspective should underlie all product purchase decisions, and environ- mentally-labelled products and suppliers will be preferred. Employees will  also be centralised in new buildings in Trondheim and Bergen, and the  intention is to apply the same ambitious environmental targets. At the end of 2010, 29 of the buildings which DnB NOR uses for its own  operations in Norway were environmentally-certi ed. A total of 59 per cent  of all employees work in these buildings. One environmentally-certi ed  building was vacated during the year. The environmentally-certi ed build- ings have plans and environmental targets for energy, transportation, waste,  procurement, aesthetics and for the physical working environment. No new  buildings were certi ed in 2010, but several buildings were re-certi ed,  including the main headquarters at Aker Brygge in Oslo. Continual efforts  are being made to reduce the Groups energy and material consumption. CORPORATE SOCIAL  RESPONSIBILITY DnB NOR WISHES TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT and long-term value creation through  responsible business operations which focus on environmental, ethical and social aspects.   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     65 SOCIETY AND EMPLOYEES During 2010, applications for private loans were digitalised, which resulted  in a signi cant reduction in paper consumption. It is also a deliberate choice  that the Group no longer distributes a paper version of the annual report to  all its 43 000 shareholders after this was permitted according to the Public  Limited Companies Act. The number of annual reports printed was reduced  by approximately 90 per cent compared with previous years. Due to the nature of its operations, DnB NORs direct effect on total  greenhouse gas emissions and environmental harm is marginal. However,  by in uencing its customers, investment objects and suppliers by making  demands, creating good incentives and entering into cooperation, the Group  seeks to signi cantly increase the impact of its work in this area.  The Group continued to offer loans with discounted interest rates for low  emission cars. Leasing customers can also make car  eets carbon neutral  through the purchase of UN-approved CO2 quotas. In total, 1 564 tons of  CO2 were neutralised through this scheme in 2010.  Fox and Pia is the name of DnB NORs savings club for children between  0 and 13 years. As a further development of the club, a collaboration agree- ment has been entered into with the World Wildlife Fund, WWF, to increase  childrens knowledge of endangered species. A game on the Fox and Pia  website will trigger contributions from DnB NOR to WWF.  Real estate brokerage and property management are a signi cant part of  the Groups operations. In 2010, Vital Eiendom, which is Norways largest  property manager, was one of the companies behind the establishment of  the Nordic Green Building Council. The organisation promotes high environ- mental standards in Norwegian buildings by applying the BREEAM 1) clas- si cation system. As from 2010, the aim is that rebuilding and rehabilitation  projects managed by Vital Eiendom must qualify, as a minimum, for the  second best classi cation Very Good, and all new investments must meet  the classi cation requirements for Excellent, which is the highest level in  the classi cation system.   CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS DnB NOR neither wishes to contribute to the infringement of human and  employee rights, nor to be involved in corruption, serious environmental  damage or other acts which could be perceived to be unethical. DnB NOR has developed a diligence matrix to be used by account of cers  in lending activities to highlight and evaluate relevant social, environ- mental and ethical aspects. By registering information about, for example,  customers  ownership structure, counterparties, areas of operation and geo- graphic af liation, account of cers are given information about relevant risk  factors. The matrix is currently being reviewed to ensure that it includes all  relevant factors and provides the best possible basis for risk classi cation .  For large loan commitments, it must also be registered whether social and  environmental factors have been evaluated.   The Group has adopted the Equator Principles, a voluntary set of guidelines  for managing environmental and social issues in project  nance. For 2010,  DnB NOR reported two projects where the Equator principles were applied.  Projects subject to the Equator Principles in 2010 Equator  Principle category   Number of projects  evaluated according to the  Equator Principles Number of  projects which have  received funding A B 2 2 C Total 2 2 DnB NOR does not wish to invest in companies involved in the production  of tobacco and/or pornography, anti-personnel mines and cluster weapons,  or in companies which develop and produce central components for use  in weapons of mass destruction as a key part of their operations. Weapons  of mass destruction are de ned as ABC weapons (atomic, biological and  chemical). In addition, the Group exercises active ownership by engaging in  dialogue with companies which are considered to have an unacceptable risk  of contributing to the infringement of human rights, abuse of individuals in  war and con icts, violation of labour rights, serious environmental damage   or corruption. In 2010, it was speci ed that the guidelines also apply to  external managers and mutual funds. The most extreme consequence is that companies can be excluded from  the investment universe. At the end of 2010, 57 companies were excluded  from the portfolios and the Group was engaged in active dialogue with sev- eral companies. An overview of the number of companies excluded from the  investment portfolios and the criteria upon which the exclusions are based  can be viewed on dnbnor.no.

Understanding customer needs and interests is a prerequisite for reaching  the Groups ambitious targets. Customer satisfaction surveys and reputation  surveys are therefore conducted each quarter. There was stable progress  throughout 2010, and in the third quarter, DnB NOR achieved its best cor- porate reputation score ever and overtook its closest competitor. Corporate  social responsibility and ethics are two of the seven areas surveyed.  Customer satisfaction shows a positive trend, but continues to be at a lower  level than the average score for the  nancial industry. In 2010, DnB NOR  established several new channels of communication in social media,  such  as Facebook and Twitter. The intention is to increase the Groups  dialogue  with customers and other stakeholders, increase accessibility to  its customer service , participate in discussions concerning DnB NOR and  invite customers  to participate in product development. At the end of 2010,  DnB NOR had more than 14 000 Facebook followers. The group chief executive and his management team are assessed based  on a number of factors including reputation and customer satisfaction. This  entails that corporate social responsibility is also indirectly measured and  forms part of the basis of group managements remuneration. EMPLOYEES DnB NOR is committed to having a working environment characterised  by diversity, respect and consideration. In 2010, a process was initiated to  determine targets and measures to increase employment and integration  of persons with functional disabilities. A process has also been started to  develop a new employee policy, which will cover areas such as equality and  diversity. DnB NOR wishes to give each employee development opportunities adapted  to individual needs. Varied training is offered by the Group. Costs related  to internal courses and training activities, external course fees and travel  expenses in connection with courses and training amounted to NOK 139.1  million for 2010. This corresponds to NOK 10 410 per employee.  The Group has extensive security routines and training measures to prevent  injuries caused by robberies and threats. Training activities and HS&E and  equality initiatives are described in the chapter on the Groups employees.  CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY DnB NOR makes important contributions to society through its expertise ,  resources and innovative ability. For example, the Group imparts its  knowledge in the  elds of personal  nances and macroeconomics in  customer  meetings, through its own publications and in the press,  in addition to a wide variety of lecturing and education activities.  DnB NOR supports sporting, cultural and charitable organisations and  other non-pro t causes with considerable amounts, cf. graph. In 2010,  the Group decided to increase the share of  nancial support allocated to  humanitarian organisations to 15 per cent as from 2011. As a consequence  of this decision, a three-year collaboration agreement was entered into with  the Norwegian Red Cross to strengthen its social work across Norway. The  agreement entails annual  nancial support of NOK 4 million. Micro nance is an effective tool to help resourceful people out of poverty.  Since 2008, DnB NOR has been involved in the Norwegian Micro nance  Initiative and has supported micro nance projects in Rwanda through CARE  since 2006. In 2010, a three-year agreement was entered into with CARE  in Norway to develop new micro-credit institutions in Rwanda. DnB NOR  will annually contribute NOK 1 million to be used for training, equipment  and project support. In return, CARE will share its knowledge about micro-  nance both with DnB NORs own organisation and the general public.  The DnB NOR Savings Bank Foundation is the second largest shareholder  in the DnB NOR Group and donates a share of its pro ts to non-pro t pro- jects. In 2010, the foundation made donations totalling NOK 100 million.  In addition, DnB NOR makes a substantial contribution to society in the  form of direct and indirect taxes and employers national insurance contri- butions.

An investor initiative in partnership with  UNEP FI and the UN Global Compact   DnB NOR Business Review 2010   68 SOCIETY AND EMPLOYEES VALUES In 2010, the Group launched a new vision, Creating value through the art of  serving the customer, and a set of joint values: helpful, professional and show  initiative. Several mandatory training tools were used to explain and highlight  the signi cance of these values to both managers and other employees.  New leadership principles were approved in 2010. The principles empha- sise that managers must be evaluated, recruited and followed up based on  how they create results, develop individuals and teams, set direction and  drive change. During 2010, the leadership principles were a central part of  the Groups management development programmes. In 2010, the group chief executive started to write a blog addressed to  all employees on DnB NORs intranet. Through the blog, the group chief  executive wishes to share his experiences and re ections about his work- ing day, business trips and customer meetings etc. The blog is a valuable  contribution in af rming the Groups vision and values, facilitating dialogue  across geographical and organisational units. It has been well received by  the employees and promotes debate and involvement.  ETHICS The importance of high ethical standards and compliance with the Groups  principles for corporate social responsibility is emphasised in all parts of the  organisation. Training in ethics is therefore obligatory for the whole Group. In 2010, a process to revise and update the Groups code of ethics  was started to ensure that these rules are adjusted to re ect increasing  internationalisation  and new external parameters.  The Groups ethics programme and dilemma training continued in 2010.  In addition, the programme was launched in English and implemented  at DnB NORs of ces outside Norway. The purpose of the programme is  to increase employee awareness of the ethical dilemmas which may be  encountered in contact with customers and in connection with internal  processes. A new e-learning course on money laundering was developed in  2010. The course is compulsory for all employees in the Group and is part  of the authorisation scheme for  nancial advisers.  RECRUITMENT DnB NOR is one of the most popular employers in Norway both overall  and within the  nancial industry. Vacant positions at all levels attract  highly-quali ed applicants. In 2010, DnB NOR retained its second place in  Universums business student survey, which ranks Norways most attractive  workplaces. Such a ranking is an important success factor for attracting the  best candidates to the Group.  In 2010, the DnB NOR Group recruited 649 employees, compared with  259 in 2009, of whom 275 were women and 374 men. The average age  was 32 years. 560 new employees were employed in Norway in 2010, of  whom 243 were women and 317 men.  The business area Retail Banking recruited 355 new employees in  2010 and was the business area which recruited the highest number of  employees during the year. Recruitment was particularly strong in the  Telephone and Online banking division, with 94 new employees. The large  increase was partly due to the fact that the Group introduced 24-hour  telephone customer service. In addition, Retail Banking recruited employees   to the branch of ces, particularly in Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim and  Oslo. This was part of the Groups initiative to increase its market share in  the largest cities in Norway, which was launched towards the end of 2010.  Recruitment related to this initiative supports the Groups vision: Creating  value through the art of serving the customer. DnB NOR Markets recruited 57 new employees in 2010, mainly due to  extended activity outside Norway. DnB NOR Markets recruited four newly- quali ed employees to a training programme for young brokers within   xed income, currencies and commodities. The training programme has  been a success over several years and further recruitment is planned  in 2011.  The business area Large Corporates and International recruited 18 new  employees in Norway and 74 new employees at the international of ces in  2010. The increase in the number of employees was due to the Groups  initiatives within the energy sector and stricter international compliance  requirements. In Vital Forsikring, 58 new employees were appointed in 2010. Most of the  appointments represented temporary staff who were offered permanent  positions to retain expertise within the company.  The newly-appointed employees generally had college or university  education . There was limited recruitment in the Groups other units in 2010. At the end of 2010, there were 13 365 employees in the Group, of whom  8 974 were based in Norway. The gender distribution in the Group remains  unchanged. DEVELOPING MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES In 2010, the Groups competence development measures were evaluated  and changed to meet requirements related to higher innovation speed,  internationalisation, digitalisation and regulatory change. A new model for  EMPLOYEES DnB NORS EMPLOYEES are the Groups most important resource in developing and maintaining good cus- tomer relationships and creating values together with customers. The Groups employees are competent and  motivated, and DnB NOR is perceived to be an attractive workplace offering tailored development opportunities.   DnB NOR Business Review 2010     69 SOCIETY AND EMPLOYEES leadership development was implemented in 2010. The model consists of  three specially-adapted programmes for top executives, middle managers  and  rst-line managers. The new programmes are practical, innovative,  educational and offer tools that can be used in daily work tasks.  The programme Effective and well-functioning management groups aims  to ensure more targeted interaction and better dialogue in management  groups. In 2010, 71 management groups completed module one, while  31 management groups completed module two.  A separate programme which aims to promote good communication   techniques between employees and extend networks across the  DnB NOR organisation was completed by 65 managers and other  employees  in 2010.  The Groups talent programme for particularly competent employees within  leadership, various specialist disciplines and project work was evaluated  and further developed in 2010.  The group trainee programme is an initiative to promote DnB NOR as an  attractive employer for new employees. The two-year programme gives  trainees valuable insight into the Groups business areas and staff units.  In 2010, the Group appointed seven trainees.  A new introduction programme for new employees was developed and  implemented in 2010. The aim is to ensure that new employees in  DnB NOR gain a comprehensive and standardised introduction to the  Group. Topics such as the Groups history, vision and values, code of ethics  and corporate social responsibility and the signi cance of a good corporate  reputation are covered in the programme. The Group arranged  ve semi- nars for 298 new employees in 2010, two of which were held in English.   DnB NOR Business Review 2010   70 SOCIETY AND EMPLOYEES The national authorisation scheme for  nancial advisers which was intro- duced in 2009 entails a considerable increase in competence levels in the   nancial sector. The purpose of the scheme is to strengthen the sectors  reputation and ensure that each individual adviser satis es the competence  requirements which are made by the sector. The advisers must pass a theo- retical test and a practical test which include analysing ethical dilemmas  and good advisory practices. In DnB NOR, the scheme comprises 1 200  advisers and managers. The theoretical test was passed by 916 managers   and other employees in 2010, and a total of 561 managers and other  employees have become authorised advisers.  In 2010, DnB NOR joined the insurance industrys authorisation scheme  for sellers and advisers who offer non-life insurance solutions. 1 600  sellers and advisers and 250 managers are comprised by the scheme.  The authorisation  scheme consists of an exam testing knowledge about  insurance legislation, rules, products and routines. In addition, a practical  test must be completed which mainly focuses on customer communication,  how to identify customer needs and good advisory practices. In 2010, 1 115  employees passed the professional exam. A process has now been started  to enable relevant DnB NOR employees to take the practical test.  To improve interaction in the Group, in 2010, new IT tools, rules and training   modules were introduced to better facilitate knowledge sharing, improve  resource utilisation and ensure more  exibility in the employees daily work.  EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION  The employee survey which was carried out in February 2011 showed that  the process of de ning a strategic direction and establishing a clear and  unambiguous vision for the Group has had the desired effect. The main  employee satisfaction index rose as high as 76.6 points in 2011, compared  with 74 points in 2010.  The survey showed that the employees are inspired and encouraged by  the Groups good results and that group management is perceived to be  trustworthy. The Group is considered to be an attractive employer with good  opportunities for professional and personal development. The survey also showed that the employees consider the Group to have high  ethical standards. The employees know what is expected of them at work  and are committed to being good ambassadors for DnB NOR. The surveys results will be followed up with improvement measures and  targeted processes in each unit in the Group. REMUNERATION  The Groups remuneration schemes are based on new regulations and new  guidelines governing the remuneration schemes of  nancial institutions.  The purpose of the remuneration policy is to support the Groups prevailing  strategy and core values, and help the Group reach its targets. The policy  should also encourage conduct which promotes the desired corporate  culture, i.e. with respect to performance and pro t orientation, teamwork,  mobility and corporate image.  A common scorecard system has been developed based on the Groups  primary targets. The scorecards form the basis for variable remuneration,  which should be given based on an overall evaluation of the Groups  nan- cial performance, the relevant units results and the individual managers  contribution to value creation. The scheme should be performance-based  without exposing the Group to unwanted risk, nor should it pose a threat to  DnB NORs corporate reputation.  In connection with the closing of the accounts for 2010, it was decided to  make a bonus payment of NOK 20 000 to each employee.  The average  xed salary for women and men in the Groups operations in  Norway in 2010 was NOK 454 300 and NOK 582 800, respectively. INTERNATIONALISATION  DnB NORs acquisition of the remaining shares in DnB NORD entailed  that the Group, at the end of 2010, gained 3 200 new employees from  DnB NORDs of ces in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Denmark.  The integration of DnB NORD employees contributes to greater diversity  and a further internationalisation of the Group. DnB NORs vision and  values, leadership principles and code of ethics play a central role in the  integration process.  The acquisition of DnB NORD means that one in four employees in  DnB NOR works outside Norway. This entails a greater need for training in  multi-cultural communication, foreign languages and cultural understand- ing. In 2010, several of the Groups competence measures, particularly for  managers, were conducted in English.  DnB NORs activities outside Norway have resulted in a further increase in  international assignments for staff and managers in the Group, the majority  of these being of short duration. Some 50 employees worked under long-term contracts outside Norway in  2010. This  gure has remained stable over the past few years. Different tax  conditions in the various countries have entailed a greater need for adminis- trative assistance to those on international assignments.  MOBILITY AND RESTRUCTURING The Group wishes to encourage greater internal mobility and to facilitate job  transition. During 2010, 127 employees changed jobs between legal units  in the Group. The Job Transition Management unit established in 2009 continued its work  in 2010 to assist managers and other employees in extensive restructuring  processes. In addition, a collaboration project was established with the Nor- wegian Red Cross, the Norwegian Church City Mission and the Norwegian  Heart and Lung Patient Organisation. The purpose of the project is to help  employees on long-term sick leave or affected by extensive restructuring  processes to return to work within or outside the Group as quickly as pos- sible. The results achieved have shown that this cooperation has been very  positive both for the organisations involved and for DnB NOR.

DnB NOR Business Review 2010     71 SOCIETY AND EMPLOYEES In 2010, demand increased for the units expertise within career  advice and coaching. The unit assists employees who have been made  redundant or who are on long-term sick leave, as well as employees who  require help to increase their self-awareness of their career situation.  Employees follow a tailored programme where a clear competence  pro le is drawn up. Thereafter, they receive advice and guidance on  their further career progression. Some of these employees accept new  challenges internally or externally, whereas others return to their former  job in the Group. In 2010, 185 employees received assistance from the  advisory unit, of whom 47 assumed a new position in the Group, 11 took  up a new appointment outside the Group, 110 returned to their previous  job and 17 were granted a redundancy package or retired. Since 2003,  more than 1 700 employees have received career guidance from the  unit.  EQUALITY DnB NOR is committed to giving men and women the same oppor- tunities for professional and personal development, salary and career  progression. The Group has  exible schemes which facilitate the  combination of career and family life. One of the targets set by the Board  of Directors is that at least 30 per cent of the positions at the top four  management levels in the Group should be  lled by women. The proportion of women in the group management team was 40 per  cent in 2010, unchanged from 2009. At the top four and  ve manage- ment levels, female representation also remained virtually unchanged at  27 and 33 per cent in 2010.  HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT In 2010, a total of 58 managers and safety representatives completed  the Groups internal programme on statutory working environment train- ing. The programme is tailored to the needs of managers with personnel  responsibility, safety representatives and members of the working envi- ronment committees. The aim of the training is to provide the necessary  insight and knowledge to comply with the Working Environment Act and  DnB NORs HS&E requirements.  I 2010, DnB NORs emergency response agreement with the Norwegian   Church Abroad was renewed. The agreement gives access to a global  network of resources within crisis management in the event of an  accident or crisis affecting the Groups employees and their families  outside Norway, or employees on business travel. In connection with the  earthquake in Chile, the Norwegian Church Abroad was contacted, and  professional assistance was provided to contact the Groups employees  in Santiago, who were not harmed during the earthquake.  In 2010, an extensive exercise was conducted for employees who have  been assigned to the Groups Next-of-Kin Centre, which will take care  of relatives and colleagues in the event of acute crises. The Next-of-Kin  Centre is operated by DnB NOR in cooperation with the Norwegian  Church Abroad. DnB NORs joint consultation and working environment committee  structure was changed in 2010 and adjusted to meet changes in the  Groups organisation. The changes entailed that a working environment  committee was established in each business area and subsidiary. In  addition, geographically-organised HS&E meetings were established to  help promote group-wide systematic HS&E initiatives.   DnB NOR has separate guidelines addressing harassment, bullying  and other improper conduct in the Group. The guidelines ensure that  any reported event is assessed swiftly, predictably and consistently.  Anti-harassment and bullying measures are followed up with speci c  questions in the annual employee survey.  In 2010, systematic initiatives were implemented to reach the targets in  the inclusive workplace agreement to reduce sickness absence levels,  improve working conditions for employees with special needs and  increase the retirement age in the Group. The lifestyle project Frisk  yt (Fresh Flow) was established in 2010  as a preventive measure for a group of employees in Retail Banking  to promote health and well-being and thus reduce sickness absence.  The project focuses on involving managers and other employees and  motivates individuals to be more health-conscious.  Another preventive working environment measure implemented in 2010  was exercise during working hours for employees at risk of repetitive  strain injuries, RSI. The measure contributes to keeping the employees  motivated and also results in a reduction in RSI and other health prob- lems. Some 350 employees are comprised by the measure.  In 2010, sickness absence levels were reduced to 4.27 per cent in the  Groups Norwegian operations, an improvement from 5.12 per cent in  2009. The reduction indicates that the preventive measures had the  intended effect, and the target to reduce sickness absence to below  5 per cent in 2010 was reached.  The average retirement age declined from 61.8 years in 2009 to 61.5  years in 2010. The reduction was partly due to the fact that some  employees chose to accept the opportunity to retire under the prevailing  contractual early retirement scheme in 2010. In addition, there was  an increase in the number of young employees receiving temporary  disability bene t compared with previous years. It is probable that  several of these young employees on work clari cation bene t from the  Norwegian Labour and Welfare Organisation will return to work when the  bene t period ends. The Groups target is to achieve an average retire- ment age above 62 years.
