In 2011 we  launched the construction of the third blast furnace. With a total in- vestment of KRW 3.25 trillion, we are constructing a third blast fur- nace that has an annual capacity to process four million tons of crude  steel. When the third blast furnace is completed in 2013, the total an- nual capacity of the three blast furnaces combined at our integrated  steel mill will be 12 million tons. When we include the existing electric  arc furnace, upon the completion of the third blast furnace, the com- panys annual capacity will surge to 24 million tons of crude steel. Launched as the House Remodeling for Hope in 2009, the program  expanded its scope to include enhancing the energy efficiency of  houses in 2011, thereby reducing their CO2 emissions. As a result, the  project contributed to reducing CO2 emissions on average of 1.11  tons per house—the equivalent of planting 190,000 Korean pine  trees. Hyundai Steels Incheon Works participated in the Energy Manage- ment System certification project instituted by the Korea Energy  Management Corporation (KEMCO) and became the first in the Kore- an steel industry to win the energy management system certificate in  December 2011. Hyundai Steel offers various programs to our partners, including fi- nancial aid, technical partnerships, and education and training to as- sure continual mutually beneficial growth.

In retrospect, 2011 was a significant year for Hyundai Motor Group. Following the unprecedented  success of blast furnaces No. 1 and 2 in 2010, Hyundai Steel is currently constructing a third blast  furnace. When completed, the third blast furnace will allow for an annual production capacity of 24  million tons, laying the foundation for the company to become one of the worlds top 10 steelmakers.  With its more diversified product portfolio, ranging from steel sheets for automobiles and heavy plates  for shipbuilding to reinforcing bars for construction and H-beams, Hyundais domestic production  will replace the import of such products, thereby contributing to the national economy. Additionally,  Hyundai Steel plays a critical role in realizing the Groups ambitious plan to create the worlds first  eco-friendly resource circulation business structure. This creation of perpendicular systems will  allow Hyundai Motor Group to become self-sufficient by manufacturing and forging steel products  used by its car manufacturers. Along with this, Hyundai Motor Group has also acquired Hyundai Engineering & Construction and  is thus gaining momentum towards maximizing synergy among the group affiliates. Hyundai and  Kia Motors, for their part, have sold 6.6 million cars to the world, consolidating their position among  the worlds top 5 carmakers. Most economic forecasts indicate another challenging year ahead. The European financial crisis and  global economic recession are expected to spread to the sluggish end-use industries economies while  global competition intensifies. Undaunted by these unfavorable market conditions, Hyundai Steel  plans to push forward with its management policies-sustaining solid growth, enhancing customer  value, and expediting organizational innovation-and continue endeavoring towards our vision of  leading a new era of steel. To this end, the confidence of our stakeholders is critical to our efforts to  enhance our global competitiveness. Following our 2020 vision of together for a better future, Hyundai Motor Group will remain  attentive to our stakeholders voices. To that end, every employee will internalize and practice our five  core values-customers, challenge, collaboration, people, and globalism.  responsibility as a leading global company respected for its contribution to the national economy and  social development. Chairman Hyundai Motor Group  Mong-koo Chung Together  for a better future Message from  the Chairman HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 006 007 Message from the Chairman  Highlights Hyundai Steel is continuing to invest in its future and working  towards the creation of a resource circulation business structure.  This resource circulation structure encompasses the entire  value chain, from steel-making and car-making to recycling  steel scrap as construction aggregates. Our commitment to  upholding mutual growth and making social contributions has  remained steadfast throughout 2011. By providing upgraded  products and services to our customers, we will take the lead  in the new era of steel as a globally competent, eco-friendly  resource circulation business. h - steel H HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Highlights 008 009  Distinguished stakeholders, I am proud to present to you the fifth sustainability report of  Hyundai Steel. The year 2011 witnessed severe exacerbation in the overall  stagnating business environment, with the European financial  crisis contributing to the global economic slowdown. In 2012,  uncertainty is still lingering in the overall global economy. Slug- gish demands by the end-use industries will intensify competi- tion in the steelmaking business and likely lower profitability. Despite this, by looking back at past successes Hyundai Steel  has created the slogan: Vision 2020: leading a new era of  steel, with the aim of the creating a better tomorrow over the  next ten years. This is also to demonstrate the determination of  Hyundai Steel towards providing better products, services, and  global competitiveness.  Through all of these efforts, Hyundai Steel remains steadfast in  its commitment to sustainability management. As a prospective  global steelmaker, Hyundai Steel is paving the road towards a  better world for all.   Steel resembles the passion of youth. Even during the global economic crisis Hyundai Steel contin- ued to make investments and completed the construction of the  second blast furnace with an annual capacity of 4 million tons  in 2010. Adding that to the previous 12 million ton-capacity  electric arc furnace, the gross annual production currently to- tals 20 million tons per year. When the third blast furnace that  we began constructing in 2011 is completed in 2013, the figure  will reach 24 million tons per year, a capacity that will enable us  to become a globally competitive steel company. The completion of the integrated steel mill has enabled us to  create a comprehensive product portfolio, ranging from rein- forcing bars to flat steels. Backed by these achievements, sales  Hyundai Steel is    paving the road towards    a better world for all.    Message from  the CEO HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Highlights 010 011  Steel shares its warmth with the world. Another important mission is to contribute to society by sharing  the warmth of both our steel and our commitment to commu- nity. To that end, Hyundai Steel both works to maintain trust- based relations with local communities and translates this com- mitment into action through a variety of activities. For instance, the House Remodeling for Hope is our signa- ture CSR program, where our employees have been chipping  in matching grant funds to cover the expenses for weatherizing  houses for the low-income bracket since 2009. In 2011, we ex- panded the scope of these activities to include enhancing the  energy efficiency of these houses, renaming it House Remod- eling for Hope—Energy Efficiency. The number of beneficiaries of this project will surpass 1,000  houses in just ten years, realizing a CO2 emission reduction ef- fect equivalent to 1,800 tons of CO2 emissions, by 2020. The  program will not only help reduce energy expenses but also  have the additional benefit of creating jobs for the community. Furthermore, Hyundai Steel has been cooperating with univer- sity student volunteer corps Happy Yes in a number of com- munity engagement programs since 2009. We also sponsor  scholarships and provide equipment to our allied schools, fos- tering steel-making technology masters and creating jobs for  qualified students.  Distinguished stakeholders, Hyundai Steels endeavors towards sustainability management  also include co-prosperity and cooperation with our stakehold- ers. We strongly believe this will also contribute towards creat- ing and maintaining a sustainable business. With clear recogni- tion that benefiting our customers is the ultimate goal of our  corporate activities, we practice customer-oriented manage- ment across the board, while working in order to prosper to- gether with our partners through relationships based on trust  and collaboration. Hyundai Steel will continue its efforts to realize growth together  along with all of our stakeholders. I ask for your continued sup- port in these endeavors. Thank you. and operating profit grew by 49.6% and 24.0% each to reach  KRW 15,259.9 billion and KRW 1,306.7 billion, respectively. Behind all of these phenomenal achievements were our dedi- cated, hard-working employees, who strove diligently to suc- ceed in the face of an unfavorable business environment. We in- creased the proportion of strategic products such as steel sheets  for automobiles, heavy plates for shipbuilding, thick H-beams  and very low temperature-resistant products in our product  portfolio. Synergy between the products from electric arc fur- nace and those from blast furnace strengthened our overall  profitability. Cost reduction efforts include the process innova- tion that established the technology of minimal basic unit oper- ations and the enhancement of raw materials mixing ratio.  Completed in May 2011, the new research center continues to  advance research activities for customized new steel products  and steel sheets for future automobiles, significantly reinforcing  our global competitiveness as a manufacturer of steel sheets for  automobiles. Steel is in harmony with the environment. Hyundai Steel also practices environmental management. As  Koreas largest steel recycling company, Hyundai Steel institut- ed the worlds first eco-friendly resource circulation business  value chain. The hot-rolled plates that we manufacture follow  the life cycle of cold-rolled plates, acting as a valuable compo- nent in automobile production and being recycled when the au- tomobile is scrapped.  The steel scrap from this process is used to make construction  materials, and the waste from these construction materials is re- cycled as steel scrap. In addition, Hyundai Steel has adopted an  enclosed raw material processing system, which has succeeded  in the successful creation of an eco-friendly steel mill with mini- mal impact on the environment. At each of our steelworks in Incheon, Pohang and Dangjin,  Hyundai Steel has environmental & energy departments,  which are in charge of environmental management strategy- building, environmental facility maintenance, maintaining  compliance with environmental regulations and technical  R&D. They also formulate and implement long-term develop- ment plans for technologies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)  through the accurate measuring of GHG emissions, while si- multaneously proactively responding to climate change  schemes such as the GHG energy target management and car- bon trading scheme and playing an active role within the indus- trial response to climate change.  The company also operates a program known as Green  Guardians, who are child environmental guards, and main- tains a paper cup-free office campaign in the everyday office. CEO & Vice President Hyundai Steel    Seung-ha Park HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Highlights 012 013  Media Analysis Hyundai Steel analyzed 570 news articles (overlapping) on the companys sustainability management  practices from January to December 2011 in order to identify material sustainability issues in each sector. Materiality Test Process Hyundai Steel has been conducting materiality tests since 2010. This is instrumental in identifying and  keeping track of the sustainability issues that are of great concern to our stakeholders and that heavily im- pact our business. Hyundai Steel is sophisticating the process of the materiality test based on our external  and internal experts opinions and recommendations. The report content was compiled based on the  materiality test results.  For this report, we categorized sustainability issues into 100 small groups under 32 sub-groups and 8 gen- eral groups. To measure the level of stakeholder interest with regard to each issue, we added a global CSR  standards analysis and peer review process to the previous media analysis and surveys. For a more accu- rate measurement of their impact on our business, in addition we analyzed our organizational operations  such as our company-wide committee operations and discussions.

Hyundai Steel and its partners are jointly consolidat- ing their resources to become a competitive leading  global steelmaker. Hyundai Steel will share the fruits of  its success through win-win partnerships with our sup- pliers. Core values seminar March2011 Hyundai Motor Group announced  management philosophy   HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Strong Sustainability 026 027  Strong Sustainability   What does Hyundai Steel  do to ensure sound corporate                    governance? Good  corporate governance is the foundation upon which we build and achieve our goals. Hyundai Steel ac- tively consults with external experts on its management to realize transparent management and sustainable  growth.  Board of Directors  The board of directors of Hyundai Steel consists of four inside and five outside directors. Assigned from each  sector of construction, metal, taxation, business administration, and environment, outside directors contrib- ute their expertise to management decisions by providing professional advice regarding basic management  policies and strategies. They also help management by acting as a check to assure transparency and ethical  management practices with the goal of maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Hyundai Steel BOD  members are appointed at the general shareholders meeting under Korean Commercial Law and the Articles  of Incorporation of Hyundai Steel. Outside directors are appointed at the general shareholders meeting from  the candidates recommended by the Outside Director Recommendation Committee based on their qualifications. Under the BOD are the subcommittees, chaired by and participated in by outside directors. Comprised exclu- sively of outside directors, both the Ethics Committee and the Audit Committee regularly meet to fulfill their  duties independent of the BOD. The Audit Committee may request reports on management activities from the directors and inspect financial  conditions and business practices when necessary. The Korean Commercial Law prescribes that outside di- rectors comprise two thirds of the Audit Committee. However, Hyundai Steels audit committee consists of all  outside members to ensure independence of the committee from the management board. Corporate  Governance  Hyundai Steel aims to become a company respected by its stakeholders where both in- ternal and external experts lead and monitor corporate management. Its efficient risk  management system helps and aids in the preemptive prevention of and response to  various risks. Hyundai Steel advocates fair competition in the market. By remaining vig- ilant to Its corporate social responsibilities, Hyundai Steel aims to set a good example  of transparent and ethical management practices.

In order for a company to grow sustainably for more than 100 years, it must not only be equipped with high  technological competitiveness but must also practice ethical management that is worthy of social respect. Un- der the belief that maintaining the confidence of all stakeholders as well as executives, employees and custom- ers through ethical management practices that adhere to fundamental principles is essential, Hyundai Steel  regularly holds ethical management training and campaigns. Moreover, having created a company manage- ment policy that focuses on the implementation of transparent and trustworthy management as its basis, the  company is set on a path towards sustainable growth. Upon declaring our adoption of ethical management  practices in 2002, we instituted both an Ethics Charter and a Code of Ethics and posted them on our company  website. Additionally, in order to increase the ethical awareness of our executives and employees and to estab- lish an ethical organizational culture, we have been engaging in a variety of activities including the publication  of our Business Ethics Guidebook. 2002 Declaration of the Adoption of Ethical Management Practices  2003 Announcement of Ethics Charter and Code of Ethics 2004 Implementation of Purchase Ethics Regulations  2008 Publication of Hyundai Steel Business Ethics Guidebook Ethics Charter Composition and functions of subcommittees  Audit Committee  (four outside directors) Ethics Committee  (five outside directors) Outside Director Candidate  Recommendation Committee  (two outside, one inside director) Auditing management activities and financial  conditions, evaluating the appropriateness of  changes made to major accounting principles,  appointing independent auditors, etc. 2011 activities A total of four meetings convened to report on  management performance and internal ac- counting control system Deliberate and resolve business ethics issues  to achieve ethical and transparent business  practices 2011 activities A total of five meetings convened to report on  the CSR activities and performance, and to ap- prove large-scale internal transactions Recommend the candidates for outside direc- tors Board of Directors Ethical  Management Chronological list of Business Ethics at Hyundai Steel  Ethics Charter  Training & Campaigns  In order to promote ethical management, Hyundai Steel hosts training sessions provided to both new em- ployees and members of related departments via on and offline media. This training cover subjects such as  Understanding Ethical Management and Fair Trade Law. In addition, we also hold mandatory training for  the employees of our partner companies that covers the prevention of bribery and corruption, the protection  of confidential material from competitors, fair trade practices, and ethics/human rights issues. Moreover,  Hyundai Steel publishes the column Lets Play Ethics (once per month, 12 times per year) in Hyundai Steel  news, which discusses issues related to ethical management and shares examples of ethical practices.  Efforts to Practice Ethical Management In April 2003, Hyundai Steel adopted the Fair Trade Self-Compliance Regulations as its bylaws, and as of  2010 has amended them three times. The objective of these Fair Trade Self-Compliance Regulations is to  determine the criteria for adherence to laws related to fair trade in order to facilitate the development of  Hyundai Steel into a company that simultaneously engages in trustworthy management practices while of- fering penalties and rewards based on our regulations. These penalties and rewards are meted out through  human resources management and include suspension and reductions in salary for violations, and bonuses  for strict compliance. Additionally, in September 2002, internal audit regulations were added to the corpo- rate bylaws to form a basis for the prevention of any illegal actions. Hyundai Steel  operates a Cyber Auditor  page on its website, through which any of our stakeholders, including company executives and employees,  customers, or partners, may report unethical behavior by executives or employees. Reporting may be done  through a variety of channels such as phone, internet, e-mail. An informants information is strictly protected  under several laws, including the Public Informant Protection Law., All matters that are reported via the Cyber  Auditor page are thoroughly investigated in accordance with internal regulations and protocol, and necessary  steps are taken in line with regulations and company bylaws that pertain to the incident reported.       2003 Enactment of the bylaws governing the  Compliance Program   Publication of examples of ethical  management in Hyundai Steel news  BOD Activities  In 2011, the board of directors held a total of eleven meetings, consisting of four regular and seven special  meetings, to discuss and approve matters such as the issuance of corporate bonds and new infrastructure in- vestment. The board also reviewed managements performance in terms of sustainability based on reports  on the current status of the internal accounting control and compliance program. The attendance rate of out- side directors at all meetings was 89%. Passing a resolution requires the presence of more than half of the  BOD members, with a majority of those present voting in favor. Any member of the BOD facing a conflict of in- terest on a particular issue is not allowed to cast a vote on the issue. While a cap on annual compensation for  the nine directors was set at KRW 10 billion, the total remuneration actually paid out to directors for fiscal  2011 stood at KRW 6.95 billion.   11 BOD meetings 4 regular and 7 ad hoc BOD meetings  were held in 2011  HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Strong Sustainability 030 031  Raw materials, production,  sales and procurement Business innovation team CFO, CEO, BOD To advocate for market integrity and fair competition, Hyundai Steel adopted the Compliance Program (CP) in  2002 and has made consistent efforts to incorporate the CP into our day-to-day business activities.  Efforts towards fair trade  Hyundai Steel gives regular trainings on the CP and fair trade act to its employees through either online cours- es or outsourced training, and special lectures by external fair trade experts. Cartoon manuals on fair trade  were also published and distributed to employees. Hyundai Steel checks and monitors fair trade practices throughout the sales, purchasing and other depart- ments vulnerable to unfair trading practices in order to prevent any violations of the Fair Trade Act. In 2011,  the Growth Potential (GP) Council was launched as a self-directed CP unit. In addition, the CP Day and online  CP tests help promote CP practices within the organization. In 2012, we are planning more activities to support CP, such as holding GP Council meetings and special lec- tures given by external experts, in an effort to raise our employees CP awareness. In addition, we are plan- ning to conduct monthly self-checks of fair trade practices at the team level with a focus on some of our major  departments. Additionally, we will distribute promotional items to encourage employees spontaneous com- pliance with fair trade.    Hyundai Steel established a risk management system in 2006. The system classifies our companywide work- ing process and applies different risk indicators to each sector in order to define and evaluate risk factors ap- propriately. The risk profiles are updated and managed on a regular basis by taking into consideration feed- back from each department and changing business environments. In addition, the working-level  departments regularly check and monitor for any risk factors, enabling instant response in the event of a risk. Preventing Risks Hyundai Steel operates its audit and inspection system for the purpose of preemptively detecting and remov- ing risk factors, as well as preventing the recurring of risks through enhanced post-control of instances in  which risks occur. By improving the both the procurement and examination systems, we have reinforced our  risk prevention control while also providing a self-reflection checklist to staff members who are exposed to  the risks of any conflict of interests by the nature of their duties.  In a bid to protect its tangible and intangible technological rights and intellectual properties, Hyundai Steel  goes through the ISO27001 review conducted by an external agency, BSI Korea, once every six months. Addi- tionally we have established a company-wide security check index for quarterly information security checks,  designed to encourage employees voluntary participation in the management of information security. We  also run various information security training sessions and campaigns to raise employees awareness of infor- mation security.   Financial Risks  At Hyundai Steel, we run sensitivity analysis to control for financial risks, such as risks associated with foreign  exchange or interest rates. Sensitivity analysis entails analyzing the potential risk scenarios in foreign-curren- cy transactions that arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The results are reported to the top  management. We manage potential interest rate risks by striking a balance between fixed rate loans and vari- able rate loans through interest rate swap agreements. We strategically avert risks on a regular basis by ad- justing the interest rates and risk profiles or altering the positions of accounts in the financial statements, and  by preventing changes to interest charges by adjusting different interest rates.

With a total investment of KRW 3.25 trillion,  the completion of this four million-ton blast furnace will result in a 12 million ton annual capacity at Dangjin  Works. Including the electric arc furnace, total annual production capacity of Hyundai Steel amounts to 24  million tons.  Hyundai Steel was able to commence the construction of the third blast furnace only four months after the  completion of its two first blast furnaces, as a result of gaining confidence in operating integrated steel mills  through the successful full-scale operation of the first two blast furnaces ahead of schedule.  Upon completion, the third blast furnace will achieve economy of scale, strengthening the companys cost  competitiveness and replacing steel imports worth USD12.0 billion per year. Moreover, the third blast fur- nace will further diversify our product portfolio in regards to both size and type of steels. Through the devel- opment of numerous new steel types through the use of the two blast furnaces, Hyundai Steel will continue  to expand the production of new highly profitable products such as automobile exterior steel sheets and  heavy plates for shipbuilding. Equipped with a comprehensive product portfolio that ranges from flat steels  to long steels, Hyundai Steel is emerging as a leading global steelmaker catering to the different needs of di- verse clients in the automobile, shipbuilding and construction businesses.  Resource circulation value chain Dangjin Steelworks has adopted cutting-edge environmental technologies and facilities, bringing major  changes to Hyundai Motor Groups value chain. With the full-scale operation of the blast furnaces at the inte- grated steel mills in Dangjin, Hyundai Motor Group has successfully completed the creation of a resource cir- culation value chain. Hyundai Steel has adopted innovative enclosed raw material process facilities, signifi- cantly reducing fugitive dusts and loss of raw materials and building its reputation as an eco-friendly steel  works. The hot-rolled plates produced from the blast furnaces are supplied to Hyundai Hysco, which process- es and supplies steel sheets for automobiles to the Groups car making subsidiaries, Hyundai Motor and Kia  Motor. The scrap cars are sent to the Automobile Recycling Center, where steel scraps are produced from the  scrap cars to feed the Hyundai Steels electric arc furnaces. As such, Hyundai Steel plays the critical role at the  center of the resource circulation value chain of Hyundai Motor Group. Dangjin  Works  Innovative ideas    drive corporate development.

Product Technology Automobile exterior panels  In 2010, Hyundai Steel developed various types of steel products for automobile exterior panels, contributing  to the creation of a lighter car. As a result, we have cemented our position as a steelmaker specializing in steel  plates for automobile. Earthquake-resistant steels  Hyundai Steel has been involved in R&D activities to create earthquake-resistant steels since as early as 2005,  when few recognized the need for such products. Hyundai Steel had the foresight to recognize the impor- tance of earthquake-resistant construction materials and thus devote its resources to designing seismic long  steels. The US has legislated regulations mandating seismic design for all construction. In Korea, new seismic  design standards have become mandatory by law for all new buildings with two stories or fewer in the wake  of the Japan Earthquake of 2011. In response to the regulatory changes, Hyundai Steel is developing earthquake-proof and fireproof products  and expanding the size of productsmaking them thicker, broader and larger and new production process- es for these new products to sharpen its technical advantage as an electric arc furnace operator.  Technological  Competitiveness  Technology is the core competency and ultimate goal of the drive for innovation at  Hyundai Steel. Hyundai Steel has completed the construction of an integrated R&D  Center that provides technical solutions to client companies issues through compre- hensive R&D efforts on application technologies, as well as process and product tech- nologies.

In a bid to hedge exchange risks arising from imported steel scrap, Hyundai Steel has secured domestic part- ners who produce quality steel scrap for its long-term supply line. This has led to enhanced domestic self-suf- ficiency and reduced mediator margins, thereby reinforcing our cost competitiveness. With iron ore and coal  being the main raw materials of blast furnace steelmaking, Hyundai Steel has secured stable, long-term sup- ply channels through several supply MOUs with global companies. In the future, Hyundai Steel will continue  to seek new supply lines in order to secure the reserves required for the stable operation of our integrated  steel mills.

HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Eco-Energetic 054 055   CO-EnERGETIC Hyundai Steel is consistently improving its environmental perfor- mance through our endeavors to qualify for the environmental man- agement system (ISO 14001) certification and energy management  system (ISO 50001) certification. We are also wielding our technologi- cal leadership towards mitigating climate change by adopting an GHG  & Energy Target Management system, building a greenhouse gas in- ventory and developing technologies that reduce greenhouse gas  emissions. Hyundai Steel is working to respond to climate change and reduce en- ergy consumption by utilizing environmental management and lever- aging our resource-circulation system. Specifically, Hyundai Steel plays  a key role in Hyundai Motor Groups ambitious eco-friendly resource  circulation value chain, by supplying the steel plates for automobiles,  which are then in turn reduced down to steel scrap at the end of their  life cycle and, finally, return to our steelworks to be remade into steel  products once again.  In 2011, we recycled 95% of the total 7,180,000 tons of byproducts  from our three steelworks. Byproducts-slag, sludge, dust, and waste  refractory-are another type of resource to Hyundai Steel. By retrieving  the digestive fluid from food treatment wastewater, we reuse it to re- place methanol in our steel processing under the memorandum of un- derstanding (MOU) with Dangjin City. In addition, we recycle steel slag  into construction aggregates, and have sponsored 40 partners adop- tion of carbon footprint management, which has resulted in a reduc- tion of their energy consumption by 8.2%.   2011 Hyundai  Steel Eco-Energetic Planning Technology Field management CEO Environment & Energy  Office of Technology  R&D Center Environmental Safety  Team at each steelworks Business Planning  Division *  Committed to a safe and environmental workplace, Hyundai Steel has a dedicated  Safety & Environment Division led by the vice president.

Hyundai Steels environmental management vision of becoming the worlds leading  eco-friendly steelworks attests to the companys commitment and dedication to en- vironmental protection. This vision, which is based our environmental management  system and resource circulation system, is instrumental in furthering our environmen- tal endeavors. These endeavors include environmental management, addressing cli- mate change and communicating with local communities. Launched in 2010, the  Greenhouse Gas Energy Taskforce Team (TFT) oversees the company-wide practices  of greenhouse and energy management.   The need for environmental management has increased in tandem with our sizeable expansion that followed  the completion of our integrated steel mill. Therefore, we have implemented a strict environmental manage- ment policy under the environmental management vision of being the worlds leading eco-friendly steel- works. With environmental management forming the basis of our business strategies, we created environmental  management and resource circulation systems, and we address the key tasks of working to mitigate climate  change and communicating with local communities. The environmental management organization serves as  the medium for company-wide communication on environmental management practices by sharing and fol- lowing environmental management performance, establishing the best practices, and keeping up with mar- ket and regulation trends.  With the new integrated steel mill running at full operation, Hyundai Steel has renewed its ISO 14001 environ- mental management certification for the new mill and three other steelwork plants with the Korea Standards  Association and the British Standards Institution. We became the first Korean steelmaker to obtain the ener- gy management system ISO 50001 certificates provided by the Korea Energy Management Corporation in  December 2011. In order to promote environmental management practices among our partners, we have  been encouraging them to adopt the carbon footprint management project, established in 2009, to help re- duce greenhouse gas emissions. We have also joined environmental civic groups as part of our proactive re- sponse to climate change.

They  work closely with each other to create environmental and energy policies, manage legal compliance issues,  production facilities and R&D for environmental and energy technologies.  Led by the CEO, the environmental officers hold quarterly meetings to discuss domestic and international  trends regarding environmental issues, develop environmental & energy management strategies, and to re- view the TFT performances of current policies.   Hyundai Steel has put into place a GHG inventory system in order to allow for the systematic management of  GHG emissions and energy use by source throughout its entire production process. Additionally, this invento- ry system helps to assure efficient response to the GHG & Energy target management system. The GHG inventory system controls GHG emissions from each production line, as well as source-specific ener- gy use, in compliance with the governments GHG & Energy Target Management System. This guideline re- quires matching the specifications set on GHG emissions and energy consumption, as well as calculating any  reduction potential.   Our environmental accounting consists of electricity bills, repair & maintenance expenses, labor expenses and other environ- mental facility operation costs, and R&D expenses for environmental impact surveys that are conducted with the goal of min- imizing our impact on the environment of local communities.  Environmental investment expenses consist of facility improvements to enhance dust collection efficiency, prevent fugitive  dusts, and improve wastewater treatment plants and the conditions of raw material yards.

Company-wide Greenhouse Gas (GHG) & Energy TFT  Hyundai Steel has been operating company-wide GHG & Energy TFT since 2010 with the advent of the GHG & energy  target management system and the emissions trading scheme (ETS). This strategy was created as an effective re- sponse to the heightening regulations on GHG emissions and energy consumption. The company-wide TFT sets the  companys position with regards to the governmental regulations covering GHG emissions and energy consumption,  prepares the specifications of GHG & energy consumption, builds strategy for negotiations on target management,  and develops reduction targets. 2011 Environmental Expenses  KRW  179.5 million 2009 2010 2011 2009 2010 2011 (KRW millions) +14.3% 179,493 153,741 56,851 50,299 23,708 20,082 Environmental Investment Expenses  (KRW millions) +52.8% Environmental Accounting HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Eco-Energetic 060 061  Our dedication to protecting the environment and conserving resources translates into action through our  endeavors to improve air quality, reuse water, and recycle wastewater along with steel production byprod- ucts. Hyundai Steel will continue to make strenuous efforts towards building a sustainable resource circula- tion society where the interests of the economy are compatible with the environment. Hyundai Steel monitors the emissions of exhaust gas from its operations using a tele-monitoring system  (TMS). Exhaust gas from the sinter plant is particularly difficult to treat. Minute dusts and dioxins in particu- late matters are collected using electric dust collectors or filters, and sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and diox- ins in gas are treated at a dual activated carbon absorption facility. Dual absorption is high-tech equipment  certified by a German authority. With the aid of this equipment, Hyundai Steel maintains its GHG emissions  far below the legal minimums. Eco-Energetic What are the major achievements of    Hyundai Steels  environmental management? Air  Quality Hyundai Steel works continually to apply advanced technologies, invest in facilities and  improve processes in order to achieve airtight control over various pollutants, such as  wastewater and GHG. The company also reuses and recycles byproducts, such as slag,  sludge and dust, thereby transforming waste into resources. In addition, the company  strives to protect biodiversity and the surrounding environment near its operations.   2009 2010 2011 2009 2010 2011 Air Pollutant Emissions   (kg/t-s)    2009 2010 2011 Dioxin Emissions Concentration   Chemical Substance Emissions   (ng-TEQ/m3)  (kg)  0.03 0.10 0.15 0.03 0.05 0.06 0.24 0.02 0.05 0.08 0.15 Incheon Pohang Dangjin electric arc Dangjin Sinter 28,255 22,545 7,880 0.07 0.25 0.34 0.05 0.28 0.38 0.04 0.06 0.06 Dust Sulfur oxides Nitrogen oxides HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Eco-Energetic 062 063  Example of  Environmental Management Water recycling at Incheon Works  86% Our planets surface water is limited, and the amount of usable water is shrinking. In an effort to prevent a  scenario of escalating water scarcity and water pollution, Hyundai Steel is carefully monitoring its water use  pattern. Water use  In 2011, Hyundai Steel used a total of 32,207,000 m3 of water. Of this, Dangjin Works used 74%, or 23,791,000  m3. Incheon Works fulfilled 86% of its total water demand by using recycled water from the Gajwa Sewage  Treatment Plant.  The ratio of total water use compared to crude steel production decreased from 1.98m3/t-s in 2010 to  1.89m3/t-s in 2011, despite the increase in the total water demand due to our blast furnace No. 2 entering into  full operation. This significant accomplishment can be attributed to our consistent wastewater use reduction  campaigns. In the future, Hyundai Steel will continue to manage water resources through the recycling of ef- fluents, reduction of water use, development of replacement water, and increasing the amount of water that  is reused. Water  Management  Wastewater Treatment &  Water Quality Management  Bio toxicity control Best practices within the private sector Hyundai Steel continues efforts to improve its wastewater treatment  plants and increase investment in new environmental facilities with  the goal of enhancing efficiency in wastewater treatment and remain- ing below the legal limits for waste water effluent discharge. By monitoring the toxicity of its wastewater, Hyundai Steel estab- lished its own internal guidelines on the handling of toxic substances  (applying stricter standards of TU1 than the legal limits of TU2, current  measurement stands at TU0). Based on these guidelines, we have in- vested in process innovation and facility improvement while prepar- ing an internal toxicity-monitoring plan. These efforts were widely  recognized when we were selected as the best of the private sector at  the Bio Toxicity Control contest by the Korea Environment Corporation. In order to maximize the reuse of sewage & wastewater, we prepress  all sewage and wastewater at the chemical reactors and bioreactors,  after which the water proceeds to advanced treatment facilities, such  as the activated carbon absorption facility. After the treatment re- moves any pollutants, the treated water is discharged into the deep  sea 300 meters offshore to prevent sea pollution. Collaboration between our company and local governments Food treatment wastewater recycling Currently, wastewater containing digestive fluid from treating food  wastes is discharged into the sea. However, starting in 2013, the Ma- rine Environment Management Act will prohibit the release of diges- tive fluid into seawater. Therefore, Hyundai Steel has developed tech- nology to replace methanol with digestive fluid as the agent providing  carbon to the microbes that eliminate organisms in wastewater. In 2011, Hyundai Steel signed an MOUN with Dangjin City regarding  supply-demand and technical support for recycling digestive fluids  from food treatment wastewater. This agreement is expected to save  Hyundai Steel KRW 600 million on the purchase of methanol and Dan- gjin City KRW 900 million annually on treating digestive fluid.  This agreement marks the first case where a private company provid- ed the solution to an environmental issue being faced by a local gov- ernment, and serves as an example of a local government-company  alliance contributing to the national low-carbon green growth initia- tive. Also currently under development is a technology that would re- duce food waste by generating methane gas from food wastes.

Hyundai Steel reused 94.5% of these byproducts in 2011, up from 92.1%  in 2010. We reuse and recycle byproducts from our steelworks and treat them as another resource, helping  address the social issue of resource conservation. Developing technology for recycling byproducts  Slag from the integrated steel mill is divided into blast furnace slag and converter slag. Blast furnace slag has  properties similar to those of natural aggregates, suggesting high utility. The entire volume of this slag is used  as raw materials in making cement and aggregates for civil engineering works and concrete.   By recycling the slag from the electric arc furnace and using it to pave roads, we have proven the excellent  properties and environmental safety of slag. Based on the know-how resulting from this project, Hyundai  Steel plans to develop and apply eco-friendly slag to various construction projects in collaboration with local  communities and governments, and to promote slags excellent performance as aggregates.    Dust & Sludge Recycling Technology  Dust and sludge generated from the integrated steel mill is highly recyclable due to its high level of useful con- tent. Hyundai Steel has installed recycling facilities, such as pellet & brick making facilities and mill scale treat- ment plants, and recycles the byproducts back into our production process. The byproducts with low recy- clability are also reused as eco-labeled bricks for landfilling or the interlocking of the public bodies of water.  We are also developing and inventing other uses for recycled byproducts, thus contributing to the circulation  of resources throughout society.

Every year 25,000 to 50,000 species disappear from  the planet. Protecting and preserving the ecosystem of our local communities is an important duty and responsibility that Hyundai  Steel must fulfill as a corporate citizen. Creating Ecological Parks  In 2008, Hyundai Steels Dangjin Works built an ecological park in  Songsan-myun on an area of land spanning 6,000m2, creating a forest,  ponds and streams. Created with an aim towards making a natural en- vironment where wildlife and nature can coexist, the ecological park  has grown into a well-managed ecosystem that protects the wild  growth of flora and fauna. In the forest within the park there are 4,500  living trees including privet, spiraea, and Japanese oak. The wildflow- er bed is planted with a variety of wild flowers such as plantain lily and  iris. There are also shrubs and bushes that provide fruit for birds. The two ponds, which provide a habitat for fish and amphibians, have  also been planted with a number of aquatic plants including fringed  water lily, water lily and yellow iris. Additionally, Hyundai Steel created  a valley above the pond as a habitat for fish and crawfish, and planted  reeds and common reeds around the area in order to secure a habitat  for green striped bitterlings, crucian carp, and morocco oxycephaluses. Hyundai Steel produces and processes steels under the natural provi- dence to protect and preserve a clean and sustainable environment.  Hyundai Steel is working to preserve the value of the environment so  that it can remain pure and unchanged into the future. Cleaning the underwater environment  Hyundai Steels Pohang Works scuba diving club and Meisters council  cleans Hyungsan River regularly. They dig up waste in the river such as  tires, nets, and fish traps, and they also clean the riverbanks. In addi- tion, the company participates in the One-Company One-River pro- tection campaign created by local communities, which gathers people  to clean the riverbanks and create flowerbeds along the riverside. 1,520 1,711 4,176 6,787 4,534 7,180 HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Eco-Energetic 066 067  Eco-Energetic What is Hyundai Steel   doing to address global warming  and climate change? Hyundai Steel continues to make a constant effort to deal with climate change through diverse GHG emission  reduction technologies and systems. The GHG & Energy TFT controls and supervises these activities, moni- tors the company-wide GHG emissions, and creates long-term plans for developing technologies to cut down  on GHG emissions. In addition, we actively participate in international programs focused on addressing cli- mate change and share technologies with global steelmakers. Organization Since 2010 Hyundai Steel has been operating a company-wide GHG & Energy TFT to efficiently address cli- mate change. In collaboration with the Energy Conservation TFTs from each plant, a team oversees energy  conservation activities on production processes. The GHG & Energy TFT implements the GHG & Energy Target Management System, responds to GHG regula- tions and policies, and promotes an energy management system. Supported by the planning, production and  technology sectors of the company, the team sets the companys public position on related issues. GHG Emissions  Hyundai Steel runs a bipropellant system of steelmaking incorporating its electric arc furnace and the blast  furnaces at the integrated steel mill, which has been in operation since 2010. Powered by electricity, the elec- tric arc furnace uses steel scraps as raw materials for steelmaking, while the blast furnace that is fueled by  hard coals and byproduct gases from production process makes steel from iron ores and soft coals. Conse- quently, the emissions from the two processes have very different properties. The total volume of GHG emissions from the premises of Hyundai Steel stood at 14,590,000 CO2Tons in 2011,  up from the previous year due to the addition of the second blast furnace. Hyundai Steel consistently improves the energy efficiency of its operation and facilities in order to reduce the  intensity of any emissions.    Climate  Change  The steel industry is by definition energy-intensive. Therefore, steelmakers are re- quired to pay more attention to energy conservation and GHG emission reduction ac- tivities than other industries. Hyundai Steel established a company-wide GHG & ener- gy TFT in order to set the companys public position on GHG emissions and energy  consumption, and to provide an efficient response to any related issues. In addition,  the company actively participates in various activities to mitigate climate change in- cluding joining national projects and improving its internal systems, while simultane- ously developing related technologies in collaboration with related associations and  partners.   2010 Company-wide GHG & Energy TFT  GHG Emissions   (1,000 tons)   Indirect emissions  Direct emissions  1,351 6,308 10,630 2,869 3,827 4,342 4,220 10,135 14,972 2009 2010 2011 HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Eco-Energetic 068 069  Internal system  Hyundai Steel makes forceful efforts to diminish GHG emissions and energy consumption under the control  of the company-wide GHG & Energy TFT, which collaborates with the Energy Conservation TFTs from each  plant to achieve energy reduction throughout our steelworks. At the same time, the company has completed the GHG inventory system for the implementation of the GHG  & Energy Target Management System, specifying the reduction potential for each production process in line  with the company-wide reduction targets.  We have developed a long-term roadmap for curtailing our GHG emissions and energy consumption based  on our analysis of the goals to lower GHG emissions and reduction potential at each plant. Energy Use Target Management Pilot Project  Beginning in 2009, Hyundai Steels Incheon Works set and implemented targets for reducing energy use un- der the Energy Use Target Management Pilot Project by the Ministry of Knowledge Economy (MOKE) and Ko- rea Energy Management Corporation (KEMCO). Led by its Energy Conservation TFT, Incheon Works has been  improving its processes, replacing outworn facilities, and increasing its overall operational efficiency. We  keenly anticipate that this will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions from our Incheon Works surpass- ing the business as usual (BAU) estimate. The reduction record will be subject to document verification and  due diligence by an independent assurance agency before being submitted for the governments approval.  When all due courses are complete, a company-wide implementation of the GHG & Energy Target Manage- ment System will be applied. Energy Management System Certification  In a bid to improve its corporate image as part of an industry that is energy-intensive by nature, Hyundai Steel  participated in the Energy Management Pilot Project by KEMCO and adopted advanced energy management  protocols. The Incheon Works has completed an internal system for energy management policy building  along with organizational and work process management under the international standards on energy man- agement systems (ISO 50001). In December 2011, Incheon Works became the first Korean steelmaker to win  the energy management system certification. We plan to implement this energy management system on a  company-wide scale to create an integrated, company-wide energy management system by the end of 2012.  Improving energy efficiency With our blast furnaces running at full operation, fuel and electricity expenses are surging. Consequently, it  has become imperative for the company to enhance our energy efficiency and save on these expenses. In or- der to deal with this issue, Hyundai Steel commissioned an energy audit group of internal and external ex- perts to discover potential sources of energy conservation within its entire range of processes. While some of  the findings are currently being tested for feasibility, others were instantly applied to the work processes and  have already contributed to enhancing energy efficiency. Most notably, an inverter circuit was installed to  run rotators in accordance with the optimal combustion control of thermal plants, cooling water control and  required operation loads. We have constructed an energy laboratory to test the feasibility of new energy con- servation systems before applying them to the process. We believe this will be instrumental in our R&D ef- forts and experimental testing to find practical ways of reducing our energy use.

(TOE) HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Eco-Energetic 070 071  Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) Technology  The steelmaking industry is often cited as the major culprit of the greenhouse effect because of its high emis- sion intensity of CO2. Therefore, it is imperative for the industry to develop new technologies to meet the gov- ernment-driven GHG reduction targets and international carbon regulations.  In response to this, Hyundai Steel is actively involved in R&D efforts to meet the national reduction target (re- ducing 30% of BAU by 2020) while simultaneously continuing efforts to reduce GHG emissions.  In particular, we are focusing on developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which involves  capturing and recycling CO2 from flue gas. In the future, we will continue to develop and commercialize com- petitive technologies in order to mitigate global warming. Byproduct gas mixed combustion technology  Fuel for the integrated steel mill consists of byproduct gas from the steelmaking process and purchased LNG.  Byproduct gases are collected from the blast furnaces (BFG), coke ovens (COG) and Linz-Donawitz converters  (LDG) for use in the blast furnace, air heating furnace, cokes ovens, steelmaking and continuous casting heat- ers, rolling heaters, boilers and power plants.  We aim to maximize the use of byproduct gases in order to minimize the purchase of fuel gas, which will save  on fuel expenses while also minimizing our environmental impact.  At the moment, the steelmaking process depends more on the coke oven gases due to their high heat value.  In the long run, however, we aim to increase the use of low heat-valued byproduct gasses, such as BFG and  LDG, at our steelworks. In addition to conventional combustion technology, we will develop new technology  by integrating oxygen and flameless combustion, which will in turn further enhance the use of low-heat by- product gases. To that effect, we are working to define the optimal balance of mixing byproduct gasses, which  will result in the minimization of our fuel expenses.   Technology  Development International  Cooperation Hyundai Steel is an active member of the World Steel Association (WSA) and involved participant in its envi- ronment & energy-related committee activities. Our Environment & Energy Management Team and the Envi- ronmental & Energy office of Technology R&D Center actively participate in the activities of WSAs Environ- mental Policy Committee and the Technology & Environment Committee, fostering exchange with global  steelmakers. Industry Climate Change Response Task Force  Hyundai Steel is also an active member of the Industry Climate Change Response Task Force, which was insti- tuted by the Business Institute for Sustainable Development. The TF collects opinions throughout the indus- try on the GHG Energy Target Management System and Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and also communi- cates with the government regarding these matters.  Carbon Footprint Management System on our Supply Chain  Being a recyclable resource, steel is the key factor to successfully realizing a resource circulation business  structure. Hyundai Steel participated in the Large Corp-SME Carbon Partnership project by the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy to establish a carbon footprint on its steelmaking supply chain. Under this partnership, large corporations collaborate with their SME partners to calculate the carbon emis- sions on the entire production process and to subsequently reduce GHG emissions through technical R&D,  process innovation and facility investments. Through the project, Hyundai Steel has supported 40 partners— raw material suppliers, scrap suppliers, and car component makers—in reducing and controlling their GHG  emissions for a total of two years between June 2009 and May 2011. Specifically, we supported their activities of establishing carbon footprints on their production processes and  creating a GHG inventory and energy management system. Additionally, our internal experts were dis- patched to help them conduct due diligence and set goals for reduction. As a result, the total energy con- sumption of the 40 partners declined by 8.2% and GHG emissions decreased by 3.8% over the past two years. Verified Carbon Standard  In collaboration with Korea Midland Power (KOMIPO), Hyundai created the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)  on the byproduct gas power plant of Hyundai Green Power within its Dangjin Steelworks. The program uses  the byproduct gas from the blast furnaces to fuel power generation in replacement of fossil fuels, contribut- ing to the reduction of fossil fuel use and its resultant GHG emissions. Hyundai Steel successfully completed  due process on the verification and certification of the VCS in May 2012, winning international authorization  of its reduction of 1.98 million tons of annual GHG emissions—the largest reduction of GHG emissions in the  given period among Korean companies. This achievement is fraught with significance as it marks Koreas first  company to complete the entire process of VCS. Hyundai Steel was also the second in the world to complete  the procedure among the 800 VCS projects worldwide. The 1.98 million tons of GHG emissions accounts for  13.6% of Hyundai Steels annual GHG emissions, equivalent to planting 660 million Korean nut pine saplings  on a 605km3-size land. One ton of GHG emission reduction amounts to the planting of 323 saplings. In the fu- ture, we will promote the recycling of waste energy sources to reduce social GHG emissions, while consistent- ly discovering new methods of reduction both inside and outside the company.   VCS project on the byproduct-fueled  power plant   8.2 % Carbon footprint project Energy consumption  *  VCS is the worlds most popular  certification of carbon emission  reduction. It is a voluntary GHG  reduction project endorsed by  the World Economic Forum  (WEF), International Emissions  Trading Association (IETA) and  the Climate Group.

Special Lectures  In an effort to inspire our employees to positively and cre- atively embrace change, we regularly provide special lec- tures featuring prominent experts in the field of humani- ties every year.  Cultural Exchange  Hyundai Steel runs a cultural exchange program to culti- vate a global mindset and enhance a broader perspective  among our employees. A given number of employees se- lected through an annual recommendation process orga- nize teams and plan their own trips. They use mission  books related to their destinations to map out their itiner- aries, a process which assures they will enjoy a more  meaningful and direct cultural experience. Communication Dedicated to building an energetic and happy workplace, Hyundai Steel promotes company-wide communi- cation by building job-oriented and emotional solidarity among employees and departments. It does this  through GWP programs and the Communication & Cooperation Seminars, Smart Board and Labor-Manage- ment Council.  GWP (Great Workplace) Hyundai Steel has been operating the Great Workplace (GWP) campaign since 2007 to foster an energetic  and positive corporate culture. In 2011, the three GWP missions included finding the value of ones work,  communicating openly, and working creatively. In 2012, we plan to focus on enhancing employee engage- ment and promoting a communicative culture with an emphasis on promoting the GWP, enhancing employee  engagement, and reinforcing trust-based relationships. Communication & Cooperation Seminar  Every year, Hyundai Steel holds 2-day communication &  cooperation seminar for managers and sophomore assis- tant managers from different departments within the  company. The seminars provide a venue for discussion  and open exchange amongst employees. In an effort to in- crease solidarity, not only business-related but also per- sonal exchanges between employees are encouraged.  Smart Board  Hyundai Steels Smart Board stands for Self-determining,  Motivated, Active, Revolutionary and Together. It is a ju- nior board consisting of 32 staff members (ranging from  general staff to managers) from four different local opera- tions-Incheon, Pohang, Dangjin and Seoul offices.  Labor-Management Council  At each works of Hyundai Steel is a labor-management  council consisting of 10 representatives each from labor  and management.

The Safety & Health Guidelines prescribe detailed procedures and proto- cols for ensuring safety and health at work for both Hyundai Steel employees and its partners employees.  Industrial Safety & Health Committee  Hyundai Steel operates an Industrial Safety & Health Committee at each of its steelworks. Consisting of 20  members total (10 from labor and 10 from management), the committees hold quarterly meetings to bench- mark the best possible practices for safety & health management and to monitor the status of hazardous sub- stance management. In addition, each steelworks holds monthly safety meetings to check safety controls  and constantly works to find better ways of safety control. All good ideas are fairly rewarded throughout this  process. Monthly Safety Meetings  Each steelworks holds monthly meetings to check safety issues and track improvements that need to be  made at each particular worksite. Each plant also sets accident-free target periods and rewards departments  according to their accomplishments. In addition, Hyundai Steel holds council meetings with its partners to en- sure collaboration on safety control at each worksite by raising safety awareness among employees and the  employees of our partner companies. Safety Rallies and Related Safety Campaigns Hyundai Steel holds regular meetings at each steel plant to share safety information, experiences and ideas to  prevent accidents. The meetings are conducted in such a way that good ideas that are put forth during these  meetings are actually applied to real operations. Safety rallies and various other safety campaigns remind  employees of the safety mind-set that they need to put in place every day before they start work.  Safety Training Center In addition to its safety training programs, Hyundai Steel has safety training centers at its Incheon, Pohang  and Dangjin Works in order to more effectively educate employees on safety issues. Equipped with diverse  safety devices and accident simulation programs, these centers are accessible to both our employees and  outside visitors and provide effective, hands-on education programs.  Health Management Hyundai Steel is committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all of its employees. Each plant has  an infirmary and a fitness room to promote a healthy lifestyle for our employees. In addition, the company  subsidizes various health expenses as well as provides regular health check-ups and medical subsidies.   Safety &  Health  Fire Drills  "Stable operations begin with safe worksites" The Forged Steel-making Department of Incheon Works (ca- pacity of 50 tons) was established in August 2008, when the Forged  Steel Mill resumed operation. Led by the departments general man- ager  Jae-hun Park, the 98 team members sweated to produce a half- finished steel product Ingot. Dedicated to higher quality and produc- tivity, they always pay extra attention to safety at work due to the  belief that stable operations begin with safe worksites.  In particular, they have developed their own Safety Rainbow  campaign to raise safety awareness among their colleagues under the  motto of A safety campaign easy for everyone and A joyful safety  campaign. The Department manufactures Ingots (half-finished steel  material that is cast into shapes suitable for further processing, such  as rolling or forging). Ingots are used as the components of ships and  wind/nuclear power plant facilities. They are enormous in size and  weight, with one unit weighing 180 tons. Therefore, a slightest mis- take can lead to a huge setback in the product quality. It is no wonder  the manufacturers of these essential products are so focused on  maintaining a safe workplace.  Since June 2010, the Department has customized the Incheon  Works Safety Rainbow campaign to its own needs. The Safety Rain- bow campaign is a weekly safety campaign, consisting of 7 slogans,  each of which starts with the first letter of the seven colors of the rain- bow in Korean.  The Forged Steel-making Department of Incheon  Works has made it a rule to examine the seven prescribed items on  the list daily—check roll call, neat maintenance, preemptive risk con- trol, wire rope condition, gas check, handrails/hooks, and safety  gears. Forming a two-man group, they wear different rainbow work  belts every day to take turns patrolling the plant and keeping safety  records. In addition to these onsite checks, the Department has creat- ed its own safety manuals while the other departments have not yet.  In June 2009, the Department held a photo exhibition under  the theme of Safety saves lives. The Department is committed to  maintaining the safest and healthiest workplace possible for its em- ployees, and strives to meet the highest standards in a society that  emphasizes safety awareness. Safety at Work Example of  HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Listening to the World 084 085  Listening to the World What does mutual growth     mean to Hyundai Steel? Hyundai Steel shares its profits with all stakeholder groups including business partners, customers, and inves- tors, and endeavors towards advancing the steel industry and creating a new growth engine which will stimu- late the overall development of the steel industry. Enhancing the competitiveness of our partners At Hyundai Steel, we pursue mutual growth through trust-based partnerships with our partners. We believe  the key to building trust in partnerships with our partners lies in technological support. Therefore, we have  initiated various technology transfer programs and developed diverse channels for active communication.  We also provide financial aid for various projects and investments. Mutual Growth Support Scheme  Hyundai Steel believes that Large Corp-SME win-win partnerships are the foundations of the competitiveness  of the national economy. Therefore, in 2010 we expanded the Win-Win Cooperation Organization into a Win- Win Cooperation Committee, which consists of sale, purchase and production executives, in order to rein- force our company-wide win-win partnership. In 2011, the Win-Win Cooperation Committee renamed itself  the Mutual Prosperity Committee, broadening the scope of its influence beyond simple mutual growth to- wards a more future-oriented relationship. Under this committee are several groups working for the actual  implementation of initiatives. Hyundai Steel runs mutual growth programs in financial aid, technical partner- ships, education and training. On March 29, 2011, Hyundai Motor Group held a ceremony where it signed mutual growth agreements with  1,585 partners. Having been augmented from the previous win-win partnership agreement, the new agree- ment stipulates; the three guidelines of subcontracting will be reinforced and applied further to assure fair  trade, financial aid will be provided for the continual growth of business, and various types of programs for  mutual growth such as business support will be enacted. To provide technical support to our partners, the  Group sends researchers to each business, runs an academy for quality control, and expands the scope of  joint purchasing of raw materials. Hyundai Steel also contributed KRW 22.8 billion for its partners facility in- vestment and Mutual Growth Fund. It improved its bill settlement conditions in favor of its partners by creat- ing a cash paying system and shortening the payment period. The number of partners that signed the agree- ment has increased from 70 in 2011 to 87 in 2012. The support program has also been diversified.

Our steel scrap supply partners were provided  with KRW 16.5 billion in interest-free loans as an investment in a storage yard facility. We also provided KRW  6.3 billion in guarantee fees to distributors, who are some of our most important customers. In 2012, we are  planning to increase the amount of financial aid to KRW 38.6 billion. Hyundai Steel provides bridge loans to its financially distressed SME partners, allowing them to get loans of  up to 80% of the contract amount when they sign contracts to supply Hyundai Steel. The loan program offers  loans at a 2.4% lower interest rate than ordinary credit loans to SME companies with credit ratings of BB+. In  2011, KRW 5.0 billion was extended in new loans. Furthermore, Hyundai Steel financed the Mutual Growth Fund with KRW 8.0 billion to support its financially  distressed partners who find it difficult to get loans in excess of their existing credit line. This money provided  support by supplying Hyundai Steels partners with more working capital and cash to cover R&D expenses.  When a business partner makes a request, Hyundai Steel writes a recommendation letter to Hyundai Com- mercial, which then evaluates the credit ratings of the applicant and extends loans to the partner with 1.5% of  the given interest rates supported by Hyundai Steel.  In 2012, our contribution to the fund was expanded to  KRW 10.0 billion at an interest rate of 2.54% on new loans. In the run-up before national holidays, Hyundai  Steel settles payments to its partners earlier than usual. We also contributed KRW 600 million to the con- struction of the Global Support Center under the Korea Federation of Small and Medium Businesses. Long-Term Plan  Hyundai Steel has instituted and implements long-term plans for mutual growth with its partners. Originally  developed in 2006, the mutual growth plans were upgraded in 2011 to provide the foundation for further co- operative partnerships between Hyundai Steel and its partners. Hyundai Steel plans to expand its partner  support program in the future, and aims to become a leader in Korea in mutual growth practices.

Now, we have im- proved our payment terms and pay all subcontracting bills in cash. We previously paid our steel scrap suppli- ers four times a month, but now we pay them eight times a month. We also shortened the bill payment term  of steel scrap from 85 days to 60 days in 2011, and then shortened it again to 55 days as of January 2012. Technical partnerships  The technological competitiveness of our partners plays a key role in our competitiveness. Therefore, we pro- vide our partners with technical support and training. For instance, the Eco-Friendly Steel Slag Production  Process R&D was a joint R&D project with our partners. It is part of a green process that reduces the produc- tion of steel slag from the steel-making process and increases the recovery rate of valuable metals to realize  the creation of an eco-friendly steelmaking business. A wide heavy plate work roll is required to manufacture a wide heavy plate of more than 5 meters in width.  However, its development and production technology is so complex that only six companies around the  world can manufacture it successfully. Korean heavy plate makers were previously importing the work rolls,  as there was no domestic work roll manufacturing facility. The Korean steelmakers rolling capacity signifi- cantly increased from 54 million tons in 2009 to 75 million tons in 2012. Consequently, the domestic demand  for cast steel work rolls for rolling mills is expected to grow by 16% from 29,000 tons to 34,200 tons. Here, we  seized upon an opportunity and began R&D efforts to localize wide-size heavy work roll technology in collab- oration with SME, academic researchers, and industrial peers.  Education & Training  In a bid to build relationships with our partners and communicate with them regarding mutual growth, Hyun- dai Steel holds regular seminars inviting our business partners to send representatives. We also reward the  best performers in order to promote mutual growth. In 2011, we rewarded 27 of our partners with a total of  KRW 480 million. At the same time, we collaborate with our partners to maintain accident-free worksites as part of our safety  management. As a result, Hyundai Steel and 16 of our partners received the KOSHA 18001 certification from  the Korea Occupational Safety & Health Agency (KOSHA) on August 4, 2011.

There- fore, Hyundai Steel puts customer value at the top of its business activity priority list. Our customer-oriented  management system facilitates customer-oriented and highly focused marketing. Through these efforts, we  are able to enhance the quality of our products to meet the potential needs of our customers. To that effect, we created our 2012 management policies and core values with a focus on Customer Value  Creation and Customer First Management. We aim to cultivate a customer-oriented corporate culture and  build long-term, trust-based relationships with our customers. Meetings with the global buyers  Hyundai Steel has been hosting meetings with global buyers every year since 2006 in order to maintain and  solidify its business partnerships with global clients. Attended by 70 CEOs from 15 countries in Asia, the Amer- icas and Africa, the meetings provide a venue for exchange and cooperation among global business partners.  Hyundai Steel presented its vision of using the synergy achieved through the creation of its new blast furnaces  and electric arc furnace, along with 50 years of technology, as the basis for continually providing its customers  with top quality products. We also expressed heartfelt appreciation for their unwavering support and collab- orative role in our remarkable accomplishments despite the unfavorable market conditions, and encouraged  a sustainable cooperative partnership for mutual growth.   Customer-oriented organization  Hyundai Steel actively forayed into new markets by integrating its technology sales organization, developing  customized steel products and enhancing the overall quality of its products. We reorganized our technology  sales network, allowing our customers to tap directly into our advanced product technologies. While aug- menting technology marketing by end-user industry, we employed different technology marketing strategies  tailored to the needs of our customers.  Through these activities, we anticipate the creation of customer ser- vice that can best serve the diverse needs of our customers while constantly adapting in step with a drastical- ly changing world. In addition, we incorporated a quality monitoring process into our aftermarket service to  deal more effectively with customer complaints about product quality. Quality control is a type of service  performed before a product hits the market, as we preemptively identify potential customer complaints and  address them promptly. This new quality monitoring process is the result of our extensive benchmarking of  the global steelmakers sales network and a reflection of our customers voices. Customer satisfaction survey  Hyundai Steel conducts an annual customer satisfaction survey (CSS) to enhance its customer satisfaction.  Starting in 2011, we changed the CSS administration department to the Business Planning Team in an effort to  enhance the reliability of the survey. The customer satisfaction survey consists of 70 questions in 11 different  categories covering topics such as price, product, technology, quality and service claim handling. This survey  provides us with opportunity for in-depth one-on-one interviews with client companies to hear any feedback  or requests about products and services throughout the entire process, from sourcing and ordering to use. In  2011, we earned a rating of 68.2 points from 235 respondents. Based on these findings, we have developed  plans for improvement in the areas of price and quality, which in our study proved to be the decisive factors in  customers purchasing decisions.  In an effort to cultivate a customer-oriented mindset within our sales force, we provide special training cours- es conducted by external experts on customer service. In addition, we offer technology presentations and  product technology application seminars to strengthen our partnerships with our customers and to provide  them with customized services.     Customer-oriented steel product development Hyundai Steels integrated R&D Center develops customized steel products that best serve our customers  needs. We have paid particular attention to expanding the R&D facility investments to build up our early ven- dor involvement (EVI) capabilities for car making client companies, allowing them to make their voices heard  at the initial stage of product development so that we in turn can provide highly customized products.  Furthermore, Hyundai Steel strategically focuses on making 28 steel products, such as the TMCP for offshore  plant engineering and large vessels and anticorrosive steel products for oil drilling. Equipped with a compre- hensive system that allows for the manufacture of a variety of steel products, we are able to efficiently fulfill  the diverse demands of our client companies in the industries of construction, shipbuilding and plant engi- neering. In the future, we will also work to discover new uses for existing steel products so that we can contin- ue providing our customers with competitive products.   HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Listening to the World 092 093  Hyundai Steel contributes to the creation of a better society through its various community engagement pro- grams that focus on community programs, employees volunteer works, environmental protection and HRD.  Our employees volunteerism and our commitment to local communities help make us a sustainable corpo- rate citizen that is respected by our stakeholders.  Because local communities provide the premises for our operations, they are extremely important stake- holders in our business. As such, we regard cooperation and communication with them to be of the utmost  importance. Our most notable community programs are House Remodeling for Hope, Green Guardians and  Happy Yes.   House Remodeling for Hope   Houses are more than just residences to us. Each building contains the ordinary objects that make up a home-  chairs, tables, walls- and serve as the background for happy family memories. Capturing the notion that the  house is a home for our hopes, we launched the House Remodeling for Hope project in 2009. Now a number  of our employees, Happy Yes volunteer corps and local volunteer corps are chipping in their resources and ef- forts to the cause. Through these efforts a lasting camaraderie has been formed among members of the com- pany, the local community and the younger generation. Sponsored by a matching grant program, the House Remodeling for Hope project had renovated 120 houses  total by 2010. In 2011, we expanded the project to include a Housing Efficiency project, working to reduce the  CO2 emissions by improving residential conditions. As it requires a lot of labor and resources to repair houses,  the projects not only improve the quality of living for people in low-income brackets but also create jobs for  them, all the while reducing CO2 emissions. As the saying goes, killing three birds with one stone. The project, which is planned to span ten years and operate through 2020, also promotes the energy rights of  people in low-income brackets. In 2011, the reduced amount of CO2 emissions per house repaired added up  to 1.11 tons—a savings equivalent to planting 190,000 Korean pine trees. To Hyundai Steel, the project goes beyond repairing houses. We send energy coordinators once a month to  the beneficiaries of our work to help them develop efficient energy use habits. Coordinators measure the  standby power and provide energy-saving supplies, contributing to a reduction in electricity bills of KRW  12,000 per house. The Steering Committee, consisting of seven experts from welfare, environment and con- struction, administers and supervises the House Remodeling for Hope-Energy Efficiency project, finding new  and various ways for houses to become more energy efficient.

The program includes nature outings, camps and quiz contests for elementary students in Incheon, Po- hang and Dangjin, to encourage them to conserve energy and practice eco-friendly habits in their daily lives. In 2011, Hyundai Steel and Seoul National University of Education offered a Green Guardians program on the  subject of Climate Change and Global Warming for 1,000 students from 23 elementary schools.  Happy Yes  In 2009, Hyundai Steel launched an annual volunteer corps program consisting of 100 university students  called Happy Yes. The name Happy Yes means Volunteer activities make me happy. I always say yes to any  requests. In 2011, the third generation of Happy Yes participated in the House Remodeling for Hope and  Summer Blue Santa event, and helped the disabled climb up the mountain during the Jiri Mountaineering  event.    Employee volunteerism  Hyundai Steel has systemized the voluntary activities of its employees. Office workers are obliged to volun- teer for 8 hours every quarter, while the company-wide 12 volunteer corps, consisting of technicians and  their spouses, participate in regular volunteer activities. The company also provides annual education to vol- unteer corps leaders to ensure that their activities are serving local needs. Blood drive  We have held an annual blood drive in March of every year since 2004 in order to address the social issue of  blood shortages. The number of participants has grown year by year and reached 736 employees in 2011. We also hold a variety of events to promote blood donation within the local community. In 2008, we provided  KRW 10,000 per blood donor to help child patients with leukemia. Afterwards, many of our employees volun- tarily donated their blood. Matching Grant campaign  To promote volunteerism among its workforce, the company launched a matching grant campaign in 2008. In  2011, 1,000 employees became new members of the campaign. The company matches employee contribu- tions by contributing an equivalent amount of each donation to the fund. One employee can open up to 10 ac- counts worth KRW 2,000, with a ceiling of KRW 20,000. The fund is spent on the House Remodeling for Hope- Energy Efficiency project.

I am writing this letter to express my deepest gratitude to Hyundai Steel and Happy  Yes volunteers for their kind care and help that they provided for our residents. This event inspired us with a  dream—a dream of climbing a mountain. It was a great challenge for our  disabled residents. Looking down at the magnificent sunrise at the top of  Chotdaebong of Jiri Mountain, our residents were inspired with courage,  confidence, hope and the energy to move forward.   85,039 99,496 100,008 33 35 39 HYUNDAI STEEL Sustainability Report 2012 Listening to the World 096 097  As a long-term companion to local communities, Hyundai Steel offers diverse support for welfare, culture &  art, the environment and education. Gifts for Festive days  In the run up to the two major festive days, New Years Day and Korean Thanksgiving, Hyundai Steel delivers  gifts to local low-income families. Our employees visit 3,000 houses to deliver our gifts every year.  Revitalizing Traditional Markets   Since 2008, we have been conducting several campaigns to promote  traditional markets, such as signing reg- ular food supply agreements and encouraging our employees to shop for groceries at traditional markets. In  2010, we signed an agreement with Dangjin City and local market authorities in an effort to revitalize tradi- tional markets. Under this agreement, we urge our employees to shop for groceries at traditional markets at  least once a month and on national holidays, so that we can contribute to the development of local markets.  In 2011, we purchased an Onnuri Gift coupon worth KRW 130 million and purchased supplies at local markets  in Incheon, Pohang and Dangjin to donate to local charities. In addition, many of our employees participate in  a Traditional Market Day campaign twice a year, which encourages shopping at nearby traditional markets. One Team-One Village Sisterhood  Hyundai Steel entered into sister city relationships with nine villages in the vicinity of Dangjin Works in 2005.  Organizing nine teams of our employees, the sister teams work as farmhands, clean up the environment of  their sister villages, provide medical services, throw birthday parties for the elderly and supply oil fuels to lo- cal community centers for elderly. Disaster Relief  Hyundai Steel actively becomes involved in disaster relief campaigns to help those damaged by floods and  earthquakes. In the summer of 2011, 100 of our employees went to assist in the relief of flooded areas by  cleaning up the surrounding area for a week, helping the victims of landslides, collapses and flooded houses.  In addition, the company donated KRW 250 million to disaster relief efforts throughout the year. Community  Engagement  Protecting  the  Environment No Disposable Cups at Work  Hyundai Steel declared a policy of No Disposable Cups at Work to curtail its greenhouse gas emissions. All  employees are encouraged to use personal mugs and remove disposable cups from the office. This small  change can contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions and the subsequent mitigation of climate change.  The money saved by not purchasing disposable cups is donated to environmental civic groups to fund the  Global Eco Leader program for elementary and middle school students. Flea markets for charity  Hyundai Steel holds flea markets at its Incheon Works and Pohang Works in collaboration with the local gov- ernments. At these flea markets, employees sell things that they do not use anymore so that they can be recy- cled back within the community. The proceeds from the sales are then donated to charity causes, and the par- ticipants are able to learn the importance of the environment through the process of reuse. In the future, we  plan to hold flea markets at least twice a year.   Cleaning up river, mountain, and oceanside environments Smile Microcredit Bank  Hyundai Steel agreed to contribute KRW 2 billion annually for ten years starting in 2009, to help people in low- income brackets and the financially distressed get back on their feet.

After signing an agreement with the Graduate  School of Sungkonghoe University Institute for Social Welfare in 2007, we provide domestic and overseas  training opportunities to those aspiring to become social welfare experts working at social enterprise  schools, social enterprise festivals or those who plan on establishing social enterprises. For the past five years  till 2011, 267 beneficiaries have completed the training programs.  Junior Engineering Academy  Hyundai Steel runs a Junior Engineering Academy for elementary school students in Dangjin, inspiring them  through science and technology. Developed by the Korean National Academy of Engineering, the courses in- volve performing various scientific experiments, such as seeing how an airplane flies, building a sun chaser,  and making windup robots. In 2011, 85 of our employees volunteered to teach six classes at six elementary  schools in Dangjin.
