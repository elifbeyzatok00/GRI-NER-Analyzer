Consequently, it is the best option to fight climate change before the next-generation of alternative energy sources becomes widely available. Looking at the entire process, from the production to the transmission of natural gas, the production stage displays the highest GHG emissions, which can be technologically controllable. Most responsibly, KOGAS has engaged in a campaign to promote CNG-fueled buses in metropolitan areas. These CNG-fueled buses are dust-and SOx-free and emit negligible levels of NOx.  The Concept of Natural Gas  Natural gas is an ignitable hydrocarbon gas mixture divided into conventional and unconventional gas according to the existence of lower layers and its method of production.   Conventional Gas : is dissolved in crude oil or coexists with crude oil underground.  Unconventional Gas  : is a general term for gases included in geological strata where there are difficulties found in production.  Natural gas is divided into PNG (Pipeline Natural Gas) supplied through pipelines and LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) supplied as vaporized gas after maritime transport.  Eco-friendly Natural Gas  Although it is a fossil fuel, the structure of natural gas has a 1:4 carbon to hydrogen atom ratio, so it contains much more hydrogen per molecule than carbon, as opposed to other fossil fuels such as coal and oil. Therefore it emits less CO2 during combustion and since most impurities such as sulfur and nitrogen are eliminated during the liquefaction process, the process emits virtually none of the energy production pollutant by-products such as SOx, NOx, radioactive waste or ash, all of which require costly reprocessing. Coal has a 2:1 carbon to hydrogen atom ratio, the highest among fossil fuels, while petroleum has a 1:2 carbon to hydrogen atom ratio. 15 14 Natural Gas Industry Overview  KOGAS Corporate Overview Natural Gas Industry Overview  Natural Gas for a  Carbon-lean Green Society - Comparison between LNG and LPG LNG LPG Distinction Methane Propane Butane  Main components  0.66 1.5 2.0 Specific gravity  530 450 400 Ignition temperature -162 -42 -0.5 Liquefaction temperature  City gas and power generation  Home fuel and city gas Car fuel and industrial fuel  Use *LPG :Liquefied Petroleum Gas - GHG Emission Comparison Carbon Emission Factors (kg C/GJ) CO2 Emissions (based on 1 LNG) Distinction 15.30 1.00 LNG Gas Liquid Solid 18.90 1.24 Gasoline 19.60 1.28 Kerosene 20.20 1.32 Diesel 21.10 1.38 Heavy oil 26.80 1.75 Anthracite Coal 25.80 1.69 Thermal Coal 27.60 1.80 Lignite *Source :IPCC guidelines - Air Pollutant Emission Comparison Pollutant Energy Source 1 1 1 1 1 LNG 1.03 0.002 393.5 78.7 833.3 LPG 1.20 3,360 1,767.7 858.2 12,506 B-C oil 1.20 808.7 1,202.2 595.7 3,105.6 Diesel 1.17 19.2 2,011.5 178.3 3,284.1 Kerosene 1.60 3,233.6 3,888.9 1,348.6 3,597.9 Anthracite Coal 1.58 3,149.7 2,651.5 919.5 24,603.2 Soft Coal *Source :CO2 (IPCC), others (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) CO2 SO2 CO NOx Dust Flow Chart of LNG Industry Gas mining Gas field Elimination of impurities, liquefaction, storage & shipping Liquefaction base LNG carrier Maritime transport Stevedoring, storage, gasification & delivery Production base Pipe  network Power generation and city gas Consumer  Gas field Storage Storage [Production Facilities] [Supply Facilities] Shipping LNG carrier Stevedoring Elimination of impurities Gasification & Delivery Nationwide  Supply Pipelines  Power Generator House Heating Industrial Use  Cogeneration  City Gas Company Supply Management Office  Pipe transport, static pressure, measurement and blockage   2010 Sustainability Report The current state of the global natural gas market As for the current state of production and consumption of the global natural gas as of 2010, the market recorded 149.5 billion tons in proven reserves, 2.7 billion tons in annual production and 2.65 tons in annual consumption. As natural gas reserves are sufficient (60 years in reduction production ratio, 42 years in petroleum), and dependency on the Middle East is low, it has drawn attention as a promising energy source that can be substituted for petroleum, and accounts for 24.0% of the global primary energy resources (based on consumption). As for the current state of the global natural gas trade, about one fourth (675 million tons) of natural gas production (2.7 billion tons) was traded globally (2010). PNG accounted for about 70% (470 million tons) of international trade, and LNG accounted for about 30% (205 million tons) of international trade. Five Asian countries including Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China and India account for 62.7% of the global LNG imports.  Produced in gas form in the field, the prevailing form of trading is Pipe-Line Natural Gas (PNG) for convenience and economic reasons, especially over short distances. For distances longer than 4,000km and for economic reasons, inter-continental or trans-ocean transmission, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is the popular trading form. Furthermore, LNG trading continues to grow due to its flexible marketability. Although Korea imports only LNG to date for geographical reasons, it is positively reviewing the import of PNG from Russia and China in the future. Characteristics of the Global LNG Markets The natural gas business characteristically entails enormous investment and long waiting periods before the production of gas is realized. The trading of natural gas is, in general, conducted under strict conditions, such as take or pay, ship or pay terms, with prohibitions against reselling after designation of a destination. In terms of transactions, Korea and Japan, the two major LNG importers in Asia, couple their natural gas prices with crude oil prices, furthering rigidity, while North America mostly opts for an open free-market pricing policy. Nonetheless, the rising demands for more flexibility in the market will allow alternative transaction methods, such as spot markets and diverse pricing methods. The Korea Natural Gas Business System KOGAS is the major importer of natural gas for the domestic natural gas industry and directly supplies Koreas large-scale consumers-22 power stations from 14 power generation companies and 31 out of the total 32 city gas companies across the nation. These retail city gas companies then distribute the gas to the end users. Ownership Structure Unchanged from 2009, 61.1% of KOGAS shares are held by public entities such as the Korean government, local authorities and the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO), with issned shares of KRW 386.4 billion. Board of Directors KOGAS has conducted various activities to check and supervise management so that governmental policies can be implemented to improve the corporate governance of public corporations based on BOD operational objectives that can respond to the rapidly changing management environment.  The company established a board of directors composed of a total of 13 directors including 6 permanent directors and 7 non-permanent directors. In addition to a Chair in accordance with the Act on Operation of Public Institutions and articles of incorporation, KOGAS operates a BOD centering on non-permanent directors by applying procedural independence when selecting the members of the BOD. In addition, the company operates three subcommittees including an Audit Committee and discloses the BOD activities in time. KOGAS has enhanced prior deliberation capability by introducing a subcommittee and council while continuously providing an opportunity for the BOD to reflect employee opinions when making decisions. It is also focused on deliberating on sustainable management issues through planning and strategic subcommittees. KOGAS aims to realize BOD-centered management models through enhanced BOD roles and improve management achievements based on the expertise on the part of non-permanent directors.  Subcommittees Activities Under the improved operational scheme, the KOGAS BOD adopted a business suggestion & feedback system. During subcommittee and preliminary council meetings, a total of 30 suggestions were made on cost-savings and overseas expansion. The subcommittee held 17 meetings, significantly increasing the opportunities for directors to make their voices heard in major decisions regarding management activities. In addition, a phased program aimed to further understanding has been operated to enhance competence of non- permanent directors, and an opportunity for non-permanent directors to participate in field management has been expanded through BODs meetings held in the field and through facilitated support for overseas projects. 17 16 Natural Gas Industry OverviewCoporate Governance KOGAS Corporate Overview Characteristics of Natural Gas Trading Corporate Governance - BOD Decision-making Process - LNG Market vs. Petroleum Market - Natural Gas Business Flow Chart - Ownership Structure - BOD Operational Scheme Ministry of Knowledge Econom Approval of wholesale  prices Administrative  guidelines & supervision KOGAS Large-scale Consumers Mayor/Governor Approval of retail prices Administrative guidelines &  supervision City Gas Companies End Users Policy cooperation Gas supply Retail Gas supply Retail Gas supply Power generation, tank Lorries LNG Market Supplier Development/ Production Costs Transaction Form Minority (oligopoly) High-expenses (US$ 7~8 billion) Dependent on long- term contracts of  20~25 years - Make-to-orde Majority (perfect  competitive market) Low-cost (approximately  US$ 1 billion) Short-term kind-based  transactions - Order-to-make Board of Directors Management Committee (All standing directors) Audit Committee (2 non- standing and 1 standing) Planning & Strategy Committee (2 non-standing and 1 standing) Overseas Project Committee (3 non-standing and 2 standing) Chair: elected  non-standing  director Chair: CEO General ShareholdersMeeting Participants Meeting Term Agenda Distinction Pertinent director 3 wks. prior to BOD meeting Major issues Proposal All standing directors Every Thursday Major issues  (BOD agenda) Management Committee All directors Every third  Friday BOD agenda Preliminary Council (subcommittees) All directors Fourth BOD agenda BOD All directors Following BOD meeting BOD agenda Result Report Composition of BOD and minutes can be confirmed on the KOGAS homepage As a public corporation, KOGAS has established a rational and transparent decision-making system in a bid to contribute to the nations energy security and globalization.

Candidates undergo deliberation by the related committee before being elected at the general shareholdersmeeting. On the passing of a resolution, the KOGAS CEO is designated by the Korean President, while non-standing directors are designated by the Minister of Strategy & Finance. Standing directors are designated by the KOGAS CEO after they are recommended by the Executive Recommendation Committee and approved at the general shareholdersmeeting. Remuneration of executive members includes basic salary, incentives and retirement allowances. The annual basic salary is determined by non-standing directors within the limits approved at the general shareholdersmeeting. Incentives paid to the CEO and other directors vary: the CEO is paid in accordance with the ratio decided by the Governmental Performance Evaluation Committee; standing directors, according to their performance based management contracts; and standing auditors according to the limit and ratio set by the government. For objective evaluation, KOGAS runs separate evaluations on the performance of the BOD and individual directors every December and uses the findings to improve its efficiency. All directors were evaluated through the use of 4 general items and 29 detailed items in 2010. The results of the evaluations on the BOD and directors were improved from the year before on the back of systematic and efficient operation of the BOD, and job training and meetings were enhanced to minimize the period of adjustment on the part of new directors. KOGAS was the first market-oriented public corporation to adopt an audit committee. Designated by a resolution at a general shareholdersmeeting, the three members include two non-standing directors and one of them is an accounting and/or financial expert. The committee audits accounting practices, requests reporting on business activities, surveys the performance and financial status of the company and implements special assignments commissioned by the BOD. Furthermore, the audit scheme shifted from traditional post de facto auditing to preemptive monitoring and a policy-oriented auditing scheme through system and process improvement, for the realization of management efficiency and cost-saving.  The Management Committee, comprised of the CEO, the standing auditor, and all vice presidents and directors in each division, holds regular meetings every Thursday. Chaired by the CEO, the committee resolves on a submitted agenda management issues through the consensus of the majority. Any member with interests in the submitted agenda or a standing auditor who proposed an audit opinion waives their voting rights on that agenda. 19 18 Coporate Governance KOGAS Corporate Overview - Increased Contribution by Non-standing Directors to the BOD - Selected as a corporate governance improvement company based on the establishment of the BOD-centered management system No. of Agenda Resolved by BOD  No. of Agenda Resolved by subcommittees No. of Suggestions on the Management  Participation Rate 82 15 16 97% Distinction 2008 87 45 26 97% 2009 76 50 30 98% 2010 5 cases (11%) growth 4 cases (15%) growth Relatively good performance Remarks - 2010 Results Roles and Responsibilities of the BOD BOD Structure BOD Operation Activities of Subcommittees Average 4.58 4.35 4.58 4.52 4.51 Items 2009 4.69 4.63 4.74 4.58 4.67 2010 Participation in Fulfilling of Fiduciary Duties Contributing to the Enhancement of Corporate Value Fulfilling Due Diligence as an Ethical Supervisor Average 4.54 4.29 4.97 4.60 Items 2009 4.65 4.33 4.93 4.64 2010 BOD Evaluation Individual Director Evaluation Evaluator Corporate Governance Service Evaluatee 645 listed companies  Winners 19 listed companies (within top 3%)  *KOGAS and KEPCO were the only public corporations included.

The driving goal of the company is also embodied in its mission, Better Energy, Better World, which sets the direction for its vision and strategies.  As a public corporation in charge of the nations energy welfare, KOGAS strives to serve the nation through a spirit of continuous innovative change and challenge, while at the same time fulfilling its corporate social responsibilities. Based on a systematic analysis of corporate social responsibilities and business activities, we have devised a sustainable management strategy scheme. The harmony of the triple bottom-line constitutes the core of the scheme. To that effect, the Management Strategy Team integrates and realigns the respective strategies of the environmental, ethical, social contribution and safety management teams with the corporate business strategies. Strategy-building practices are periodically reviewed and determined by the Management Committee which is the companys top decision-making body. 21 20 Sustainability Strategy Scheme Sustainability Management Sustainability Management Sustainability Strategy Scheme Sustainability Management Strategy & Business Strategy - Sustainability Management Roadmap Reinforcing the Binding Force of Strategies as an Autonomy Management Agency Ensuring Energy Source Leadership ProactiveOil &GasField DevelopmentProjects SecuringNon- conventionalEnergy Sources FosteringGreen EnergyProjects ExpandingSupply Infrastructur AugmentingMidand Down-stream Businesses ReinforcingtheEnergy Marketing SecuringGlobal Talent DevelopingCore Technologies Reinforcing Financial Soundness IncorporatingCore Values Establishing Customer-oriented ManagementPractices Performance-based Operation Vision 2017 Strategic Agenda Sustainability Management  Strategic Agenda Expanding Business Networks Enhancing Global Competencies Upgrading Management System Upstream Assets Self-sufficiency Rate Alternative Business Demand-side Management Renewable Energy Good Governance Transparency Risk Management Ethical Behavior Environmental Management Environmental Performances Carbon Risk Management E&P, JV EHS HR and Compensation OHS & Safety Stakeholder Engagement Corporate Philanthropy Strategic CSM Systematic CSM Environmen tal Superiority Social Leverage Strategic CSM Top- Management Commitment CSM Competence Communication & Network Upstream Assets Self- sufficiency Rate Alternative Business  Demand-Side Management Renewable Energy Systematic CSM Sustainability Excellence : DJSI Level Good Governance Transparency Risk Management Ethical Behavior Environmental Superiority Environmental Management Environmental  Performance Addressing climate  change E&P, JV EHS Social Leverage HR and Compensation OHS & Safety Stakeholder Engagement Supply Chain Management Corporate Philanthropy Global KOGAS - with People, with the Planet KOGAS secures safe and reliable energy with the utmost care for the natural environment, taking all necessary steps to minimize the impact on the global climate. We take pride in what we do, and respect and embrace all our stakeholders, the people we work for- our customers, communities, authorities and society, wherever we work.  Vision Statement Global KOGAS -with People, with the Planet KOGAS has realigned its strategic scheme with the business environment and internal competencies based on its review of the vision and strategy performances in 2010. In the process, we incorporated our sustainability management strategy and roadmap into each strategic agenda, creating a platform for implementing sustainability management. In coping with various business environmental factors, such as the rising issue of human rights in overseas resource development projects, we came up with a customer-oriented management policy, while also promoting the integrated practices of sustainability management and socially responsible management. Furthermore, we set our target at enlisting in the DJSI indexes and devised a sustainability roadmap based on the 2009 experience of being enlisted on the DJSI Korea Index, the DJSI Asia /Pacific by 2012 and ultimately the DJSI World. In addition, various preparation tasks aimed to use ISO26000 confirmed at the end of 2010 as a new key issue of sustainable management were included as a part of strategic agenda. This has led KOGAS to brace itself for proactively responding to external environmental changes.  KOGAS was designated as an autonomy management public company by the government in 2009. An autonomy management company is endowed with autonomous management rights, allowing merit-oriented accountable management under reduced government control regarding management activities. In particular, KOGAS has expanded the autonomy of its organizational and personnel operations within the 2% limit of its regular workforce, enabling flexible personnel recruitment for overseas projects. Without any influence on corporate governance, the partial autonomy in the operation of the workforce contributed to management efficiency. KOGAS is working to return the fruits of this to the people.  2010 Sustainability Report KOGAS has made efforts to introduce the core issues by main sector and include them in this report. Based on the experience and information acquired in the process of issuing previous reports, this report aims to influence the sustainability of the economy, society, environment and business and to selectively provide information in which stakeholders have interests, present external sustainable management trends, internal sustainable management competence, diagnosis on the present conditions and results of various surveys for stakeholders.    The following key issues have been defined in consideration of our survey on stakeholders; the urgency of the sustainable management of KOGAS, future success factors and based on risk assessment supported by future projections and possible effects, and these have been reflected in the report with care and detail.  As of 2010, KOGAS was exposed to the domestic media 143 times.  95% were positive articles. Economic articles accounted for the highest portion, and this appears due to the fact that KOGAS suffered managerial difficulties caused by the company unable to collect on an outstanding debt that was owed. Others include energy security in relation to resources development, social contribution activities and support for low income classes, which is connected to the social responsibility of a public corporation. Some of the articles also deal with an interest in environmental issues including technological development aimed to address climate change. Until now, KOGAS has been rarely exposed to the overseas media, so this exposure has not been analyzed. However, information will be collected and analyzed every year from now on so that KOGAS can determine issues of interest by stakeholders with regard to sustainable management. As KOGAS was enlisted on DJSI Korea for its second consecutive year in 2010, it has been able to acquire a basis for implementation of sustainable management at the DJSI level. Through this, KOGAS has been able to more objectively confirm the level of sustainable management conducted by the company. Closely reviewing the feedback from the DJSI, the company reflected these results in its 2010 sustainability management initiatives and continues to improve its sustainability management practices to attain and exceed global standards. 23 22 Materiality Test & Key Issues Sustainability Management Materiality Test & Key Issues Media Analysis Materiality Test Process & Results DJSI Korea Enlisting Media analysis CSR trends analysis Review on other corporate  CSR reports External institutional evaluation  Reference to guidelines of  international CSR-related  institutions (GRI, Global  Compact and etc.)  Analysis on previous reports and  verification results  Diagnosis on the level of CSR and  designation of strategic directions   Collection of opinions from related departments   Review on the strategic direction  of business Consultations among  hands-on staff by sector  Determination of key issues  to be reported and the main           contents  Verification by specialists and  the issuance of a report Analysis on feedback to previous  reports     Stakeholder survey  Collection of opinions from  stakeholders by sector  Collection of NGO opinions  External environment analysis KOGAS Stakeholder analysis Issue confirmation Internal environment analysis Stakeholder Energy security (Supply  stability of natural gas) Safety accidents prevention  activities  The current state of the  implementation of overseas  projects  Sustainable management,  vision and strategic direction Transparency of corporate  governance Economic sector Supply stability of natural gas Expansion of storage facilities  The current state of  implementation of overseas  projects including E&P etc.  R&D (E&P technology, new  energy sector and  safety/environment  technology development) Distribution of economic  achievements  Social sector Ethical management  (corruption prevention) Stable personnel operation  Enhancement of member  competence  Healthy industrial relations Social contribution activities Activities to support SMEs  Environment/safety sector Overview on the EHS  management system  The current state of  environment management policy  Efforts to reduce  environmental contamination  Improvement of the safety  management system  Efforts to manage fields,  products and healthcare  Enhancement of urgent  response capability  Efforts to address climate  change Economic 43% Social 16% Resource Development 26% General 11% Environmental  4% - Rate of media exposure in 2010 (%) Energy Security Sustainability Management Strategies  Overseas Projects  Social Contribution Activities (Onnuri sharing management) Addressing Climate Change Environmental Protection 36 ~ 39 20 ~ 21 40 ~ 45 83 ~ 89 58 ~ 61 54 ~ 57 Key Issues  Page Contents Korea is the worlds 10th largest energy consumer, and imports 97% of energy sources from other countries. KOGAS is making every effort to acquire resources by continuously pushing for overseas projects and participating in oil field development in Iraq in addition to providing a stable supply of natural gas.   In 2009, KOGAS enhanced its executive power in connection with its company-wide strategies, and it particularly furthered assignments addressing climate change by acquiring economic resources and environmental green growth strategies.  The company is pushing various overseas projects by proactively participating in overseas resources developments with regard to the entire value chain of the gas industry linking exploration, development, production, transport, and the supply and sale of oil and gas resources.  The company is sparing no effort to promote a sharing culture for a warm-hearted and fair society by spending more time with the local community. In addition we are endeavoring to achieve mutual growth based on expanded energy welfare for the underprivileged and fair and transparent business practices with regard to relationships with all of our partners including SMBs.  In connection with the low carbon green growth strategy of the government, KOGAS has established and implemented a low carbon green growth strategy to lay the foundations for mid-to-long-term efforts to address climate change.  KOGAS pushes for an environmental friendliness level superior to other energy companies and has rarely had any incidents of environmental contamination. However, the company recognizes the importance of environmental protection as a natural gas supplier and endeavors to preserve the environment in areas such as water and soil quality while conducting diversified campaigns to raise public awareness about environmental protection.    2010 Sustainability Report Survey Summary KOGAS conducted a phone-based survey on 100 internal and 200 external stakeholders so as to define their interest in KOGASsustainability management activities. The 200 external stakeholders were randomly selected from customers, shareholders & investors, business partners, local communities & NGOs, governmental bodies and authorities groups. Based on the results, we have compiled our 2010 sustainability report and our 2011 sustainability management initiatives. Material issues for sustainable development The KOGAS survey on material sustainability issues found that stakeholders are highly interested in resource development, energy supply and safety issues. In particular, their concerns for eco-friendliness rose significantly on the previous year, highlighting their expectations regarding green growth initiatives related to addressing climate change. Although advances into the overseas expansion have been somewhat reduced, many still have a high interest in it. Major Issues of Interest to Each Stakeholder Group As a result of the survey on material issues related to sustainable management centering on interest by stakeholder, customers and employees turned out to show relatively higher interest than the average whereas shareholders & investors, governmental bodies and authorities exhibited a relatively lower interest. Customers usually expressed high interest in material issues including environmentally friendly policy and safety accidents, and all stakeholders displayed a high interest in such issues as resource development and energy supply.  Assessment of the Response to Major Issues As a result of the survey on the level of response by material issues for the purpose of the sustainable development of KOGAS, such items as contribution to economic development, environmental protection and international cooperation were somewhat improved, but such items as the establishment of a vision , strategy, energy security and social achievements declined. The fluctuations were from the previous year, but the absolute scores turned out to be relatively high.   Assessment on the Importance of Core Values  For the purpose of KOGAS sustainable development, stakeholders cited transparency and co-prosperity as the most important values. Transparency turned out to be the most important value of sustainable development for KOGAS, and its importance grew by 3.4% from 2010. Confidence and Co-prosperity were also cited as important values by stakeholders.  Stakeholders Response to Material Issues As a result of the survey, such issues as energy supply and resources development which received high marks in interest by material issues suggested by stakeholders were intensively reported in the economic area, and transparency and co-prosperity that earned high marks in the importance of core values were intensively reported in ethical management, social achievements, safety accidents and environmental achievements.  As KOGAS is a wholesale supplier of natural gas, primary customers are confined to city gas companies or developers. However, the company recognizes its basic responsibility for serving the public, the fundamental customers of natural gas, and makes efforts to realize more transparent and proactive communications by defining all members of society as stakeholders who are interested in or influenced by the operation of KOGAS.     In particular, KOGAS has no overseas premises under its direct control; the company encourages responsible management practices regarding socio-environmental issues at locations where it holds stakes. Therefore, it shares its principles and guidelines on socio-environmental issues via Web pages and related reports with all of its partners. In the future, the scope of stakeholders will be expanded for more active stakeholder engagement. 25 24 Materiality Test & Key Issues Communication with Stakeholders Sustainability Management Stakeholder Survey Communication with Stakeholders - Material issues for sustainable development - Assessment on the Importance of Core Values  Overseas Expansion 4.20 4.43 4.33 International Gas 4.164.29 4.24 Resource Development 4.244.58 4.46 Safety Issues 4.274.48 4.45 Energy Supply 4.224.49 4.48 HumanResources Management 3.59 3.85 3.74 Two-way communications 3.90 4.04 4.03 Environme ntalPolicy 3.954.24 4.33 Transparency 34.3 29.3 32.7 Co-prosperity 17.3 16.0 16.3 Cooperation 4.9 5.3 5.7 Responsibility 10.113.3 9.7 Confidence 15.7 15.3 15.3 Service 9.5 3.7 2.7 Change 8.2 8.3 11.3 Challenge 8.7 6.3 2009 2010 2011 Internal Stakeholders Business Expansion, Wages, Job Security, Health & Safety, Welfare & Benefits, Competency-building, Union Relations Presentation by Executive Management, Presentations on Major Business Developments (via -intranet), Labor-Management Council, Ombudsman (HRM, etc.) Shareholders/Investors Stock prices, Investment security, Growth potential, Financial soundness, Dividends, Corporate governance IR activities, Electronic disclosures (Alio, KRX & FSS), News Letter, Internal Magazine, Disclosure on the Web Direct Customers (city Gas companies, power plants, etc.) Supply Stability, Facility Soundness, Price, Business Expansion, Transparency, Customer support Conferences with Customers, Customer Satisfaction Survey, Biz Portal, Joint Workshop, Charge Scheme Explanation Session, Technological Information Exchange The Nation Gas Price, Stable Supply, Thermal Value (quality), Safety & Environmental Management, Social Contribution, Transparency (ethical management), Energy Welfare Charge Scheme Explanation Session, VOC(web-based), KOGAS News Letter, Disclosure on the Web, Campaigns and Social Contribution Activities, Appeal for Information Disclosure Governments/Authorities Green Growth (addressing climate change), Securing Energy Sources, Corporate Governance, Business Expansion, Supply Stability, Restructuring Appeal for Information Disclosure, Report on Management Activities, Parliamentary Inspection of the Administration & Audit by the Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea, Joint Workshop Local Communities, NGOs Social Contribution, Safety & Environmental Management, Human Rights Management, Addressing Climate Change, Sustainability Management, Ethical Management, ISO26000 IR Sessions (including on-site observation), Campaigns and Social Contribution Activities, Conferences,KOGAS Newsletter in Korean, Internal Magazine, Ddisclosure on the Web  Business Partners (suppliers) Business Expansion, SME Support, Financial Soundness Joint Workshops, IR Sessions, Management Disclosure, Contract Satisfaction Survey, Talkfest Global Stakeholders  Environmental & Human Rights Policy, ISO26000 English Newsletter, Sustainability Report 2009 2010 2011 - Assessment of Responses to Major Issues Overseas Expansion  International Gas Resource Develop ment Safety Issues Energy Supply Human Resources Management Environmental Policy Employees Customers Shareholders /Investors Suppliers Local communities/NGOs Governments/Authorities Overall Two- way commun ications  2010 Sustainability Report The practice of ethical management at KOGAS is based on transparent and sound management principles. As a public corporation supplying safe and convenient natural gas, KOGAS applies a high standard of ethics. Not only does it abide by national regulations and normal social and ethical values, it also works hard to establish global- standard ethical management practices in all its systems and mechanisms. Thanks to these efforts, no cases of corruption were detected in 2010, but the companys score in the government ratings on the integrity of public organizations was 9.14 (out of 10), down 0.1 from the previous year.  KOGASethical management system segments the ethics codes to ensure that all its employees understand and comply. This, in turn, constitutes the basic platform for anti-corruption, and ultimately facilitates the company in fulfilling its social responsibilities to the nation. As for the companys four major initiatives, the key performance indicators (KPI) were set and kept in check, with feedback regarding ethical management performances on a regular basis generated.  Ethical Management Organization KOGASethical management organization not only establishes and promotes ethics regulations and systems but also articulates the roles and responsibilities of each segment, ensuring a bottom-up practice of ethical management. Top managements strong commitment can easily propel the spread of ethical practices across-the-board to reach the contact point with customers. The strong commitment of KOGAS executives towards ethical management is embedded in the ethics regulations and bylaws, including the ethics codes, and conveyed to all employees.

In 2010, the company generated and conducted a unique KOGAS ethics training program in consideration of the results of the external transparency evaluations and governmental management evaluations of the past.   In addition, KOGAS held a co-prosperous ethics camp along with customers in an effort to lay the foundation for coexistence and ethical management practice. The camp aimed to express KOGASdetermination to conduct ethical management, realize continuous practice, share a sense of ethics, narrow gaps through cases of ethical dilemma, promote mutual understanding based on a strong will to achieve co-prosperity and create ethics guidelines for the purpose of reconciling ideas and overcoming difficulties.   Main contents of ethical standards by job function  Practice Committee The Practice Committee takes the lead in collaborating with district divisions (on-sites), the ethical practices of clients, partners and communities, PR, training and social contributions and ensuring that everyone is on the same page. Facilitation of communication with partners for the purpose of co-prosperous management KOGAS is endeavoring to establish a transparent corporate culture by holding breakfast meetings for the CEOs of constructors, forming a task force team for subcontractors and pushing for a resolution on mutual growth with large, medium and small constructors. In addition, the company is focused on facilitating communications with its partners and pursuing to implement construction and to conduct seamless co-prosperous management based on mutual trust.  Ethical Management Monitoring System In the monitoring of ethical management practices, KOGAS conducts quarterly reviews and evaluations on the performances and activities of ethical management. The results are used to identify issues and develop solutions. In this way, this constant flow of feedback provides opportunities for continuous study and improvement. Internal Evaluation of KOGAS Ethical Level  The test by an external agency constitutes the core element of the monitoring system, and can be classified into internal and external (customer) monitoring. Since the declaration of the companys commitment to ethical management in 2004, the ethical mindset and practices of KOGAS employees have gradually improved. In 2010, the company scored 8.35 points on a scale of 10 in its internal evaluation of ethical levels by 1,004 respondents; strong evidence of a gradual improvement in the companys ethical level. 29 28 Ethical Management Sustainability Management Ethical Management Monitoring As it became necessary to introduce a pledge of ethics with regard to  main job functions for the purpose of improved ethical practice in the  field, a code of ethics for sales people was established.

In order to address the issues raised from the results of the 2009 assessment, the company expanded its ethics camp, which has traditionally concentrated on the contract, construction and marketing areas, to include facility repair & maintenance areas. As a result, KOGAS earned 9.24 points in the organization integrity assessment by the Anti-corruption & Civil Rights Commission (ACRC) in 2010, ranking 6 th among a total of 21 public organizations.  Internal Anti-corruption Activities  The rate of e-Bid increased to 94.5% in 2010 from 93% in 2009 in an effort to enhance contract transparency, and an integrity contract was conducted based on the KOGAS construction integrity manual to eliminate corruption factors in advance. In addition, the Standard for Transparency Contracts with Foreign Invested Suppliers was established to prohibit the receipt of money, valuables and gifts from foreign companies and domestic agents related to contracts. The standards clearly define the rights and obligations of foreign companies and domestic agents so that corruption factors do not occur. Promotion and training were enhanced based on an internal report system for the purpose of preventing ethics accidents, and a convenient access to the Report Center on the Internet was offered. In addition, anonymous reports were facilitated, and an external independent report center was additionally installed to thoroughly protect reporters based on the enhanced operation of the Irregularities Report Center.  Ethical Management Performances More than just simple window-dressing, ethical management is establishing itself as a type of management system with accurate measurements and improvement mechanisms for employees. In 2008, KOGAS pushed the envelope past the typical difficulties of measuring ethical management performances by adopting key performance indicators (KPI), a first in the industry. However, the six categories introduced fell short of effectively quantifying these performances. In addressing this issue, which was raised by an external consulting agency, the company revised the six indicators and added four new indicators, such as the investment information provision rate in 2009. The following 9 indicators were designated in 2010 to enhance the effectiveness in the measurement of performances. In the future, KOGAS will continue to develop more indicators for a more objective assessment of its ethical practices so as to establish a reliable evaluation system. It will also continue to serve company initiatives of earning customer trust and achieving sustainable growth befitting its position as a leading global company.

So KOGAS conducts effective implementation strategies stage by stage and by mid-to-long-term strategic assignments.  Risk Management System - Risk management plotting board. KOGAS risk management consists of regular risk management activities aimed to discern, assess, prevent and counter risks in advance and crisis response activities aimed to respond to and aid recovery in times of crisis as well as to conduct post-management when risks escalate into crises.  KOGAS expanded its existing crisis management guidelines into crisis management regulations in order to conduct integrated management on enterprise-wide risks (Aug. 2010). In addition, operational risks including value chain risks and financial risks were classified into 16 types so as to improve management strategies based on a practical response manual for each type of crisis.

In 2010, crises occurred in problematic supply and demand in the winter, failure in collective bargaining, changes in exchange rates, regulations on gas rates such disasters as typhoon, cyber terrorist acts and compensation-linked conflicts, but the ripple effects were minimized through the use of a practical manual for crises response EHSQ System, financial risk management system and disaster management system.  In particular, it conducted VaR value simulation, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis in order to manage main financial crises related to exchange rates, interest and liquidity, and if the pre-designated limit is exceeded, it was reported to the Financial Risk Management Committee before responses were made in accordance with regulations on financial risk management in the manual. 2010 Sustainability Report KOGAS generated 71 risk pools by identifying typical risks throughout the entire management system through workshops for working-level employees (September 2010). KOGAS is continuously conducting identification and assessment activities with regard to main risks by generating 124 risk pools that prevent KPI from being attained and by conducting evaluations on importance and appropriateness.  In particular, it has come up with various risk management measures including acceptance (hedge), avoidance and relaxation of risks with regard to Akkas Project in which KOGAS participates as the first operator in an effort to respond to expanded overseas E&P projects.  33 32 Risk Management Sustainability Management Category  Main Risk  Management Measures Country Risk Operational Risk Financial Risk Security War, civil war etc. Insufficient technology & experience Occurrence of default including financial crises  Increase in exchange risks and investment costs Personal safety of dispatched staff members  Joint response along with participating IOC (Eni, Gazprom and Shell etc.) Cash flow management through Economic Evalnation based on reflection of risks Employment of experts through subsidiaries  Establishment of a service contract with PMC (Project Management Company) Payment guarantee along with KSURE Establishment of a guarantee credit line with Korea EXIM (about $ 1 billion) Raising Funds in foreign market for overseas investment projects Prioritized review on finance in the local market  Selection of Security Provider & safety support for dispatched staff members Minimization of staff members dispatched to the field and transfer of subcontract contracts Risk Management Activities  Crisis Management Activities  Supply and demand 2008(7cases) 2009(9cases) 2010(14cases) 1 1 1 Labor and manage- ment 2 1 1 Finance 3 1 Strategy 1 Regula- tions 1 1 Disaster  4 3 IT 2 4 Gas accidents 2 Conflict 1 Category  A method of measurement Requirements for issuance Exchange rate risks Interest risks  Liquidity risks VaR value simulation through the use of a crystal ball Enhancement of financial risk management/ Continuous monitoring Scenario analysis based on such variables as oil prices and exchange rates/ Sensitivity analysis Caution Watch Warning Seriou- sness Changes in treasury bonds interest for 3 years Changes in average exchange rates Changes in limits of measured VaR values Measures .

For purposes of effective response, all crises handled by KOGAS are immediately reported to the Safety Division Head, crisis management executives (CRO & Chief Risk Officer) and the CEO through the use of extensive reporting systems such as the executive support information system, and the Crisis Management Committee led by the CEO, the Emergency HQ supervised by the Vice President, and a crisis management executive and Field Control Team are formed in accordance with the seriousness of the crisis situation.  KOGAS is operating the following respective crisis management systems: a financial risk management system, an e-Audit system, a disaster management system, an environment & healthcare safety quality (EHSQ) system and a crisis management bulletin within the ERP system for risk management and plans to establish an enterprise-wide crisis management system by integrating the above in 2011.  - Number of warning issuances against a crisis Crisis Management  Regulations Practice Manual   for Crisis Response Action Manual for Field Response Enterprise-wide  HQ  Offices Management Strategy Team  Dedicated Department  Related Teams (safety/management) Organ- ization Docu- ment Management  Area Supervising Departments  Management Organization Main contents Crisis management organization, document Types of crises, reporting system Crisis Management Committee  Definition of crisis, standard for warning issuances Crisis response activities by type Four areas (Management/   Disaster /PR/Conflict) Response & Countermeasure HQ/Situation  Room HQ-linked crisis management activities Independent activities by office  8 regional HQs, 4 bases  Control Division System Financial Risk Management System Environment & Healthcare Safety Quality  (EHSQ) System  Crisis Management Bulletin  E-Audit System Disaster Management System - Establishment of an enterprise-wide crisis management system   35 34 Disclosure Management Approach Economic Performance The financial crisis 2008 pushed up oil prices to an unprecedented level and caused alarm in Korea, a country heavily dependent on imported energy sources.  Dedicated to the stable supply of energy sources, KOGAS has therefore strived to diversify its LNG import routes, while aggressively pursuing a number of overseas E&P projects. In addition, the company is expanding its service areas to cover not-yet-in service areas for the popularization of natural gas nationwide. Furthermore, KOGAS is steadily promoting the development of green energy as a future energy source. In 2010, KOGAS achieved significant results in overseas resources development by overcoming the economic recession in 2009 and participating in gas sales and the Akkas Gas Field as an operator. The company started supplying gas to Youngweol, Hoengseong and Geumsan and revived fuel cost pass-through system in September 2010. It collected about 500 billion won of outstanding amounts by resuming fuel cost pass-through system (base material costs) and increased assets by 1.4 trillion won through expanded investments in resources development on the back of gas supply projects in not-yet-in service areas including Gangweon and the Akkas Gas Field while expanding debts and capital by 1.2 trillion won and 0.2 trillion won, respectively.    It recorded 831.5 billion won in operating profit up 37.5 billion won from the previous year, but it posted 206.2 billion won in net profit during the term including foreign exchange-related profits, down 31.8 billion won.  KOGAS recorded 359% in the ratio of debts, down 14%P from a year ago, in the wake of increases in the rate of investment, and it posted 3.89% in the rate of return of equity capital, down 0.72%P, due to reductions in net profit during this term.

The company is making every effort not only to push for an expanded basis for stable supply of natural gas but also to pursue a green energy development project.   Total Reserves and Resources in 2010 3,900million tons 20093,700million tons 20082,347million tons  Natural Gas Demand  Forecasts 37 36 Stable Supply of Natural Gas Characteristics of Domestic Natural Gas Consumption Korea has four distinctive seasons. Due to these seasonal characteristics, domestic demand for natural gas is concentrated on heating during the winter time, and leads to a pattern of high-demand-in-winter-and-low- demand-in-summer. On the other hand, natural gas producing countries make efforts to equalize production befitting facility limitations for the purpose of maximizing production efficiency. Due to conflicts of interest between producing countries and consuming countries, an imbalance between demand and supply exists in the natural gas market. In an effort to resolve the structural difficulties in the market, KOGAS has continuously acquired storage facilities to adjust an imbalance between supply and demand. In particular, it makes purchases for storage in summer when prices are lower in the spot market for the purpose of economic efficiency. It aims to stably supply energy at lower prices. The company is also focused on demand forecasts, improved accuracy of prediction and establishment of an appropriate stockpile management model.  Enhancing Accuracy in Demand Forecasts Efforts to realize the stable supply and demand of the natural gas stem from accurate demand forecasts. KOGAS is forecasting demands in the long term, short term and in the winter time and pursues to establish a short-and- long-term import contract through this. In order to improve the accuracy of demand forecasts, the company has cooperated with the Econometrics Research Center of Sungkyunkwan University to continuously improve and complement a demand forecast model for natural gas while nurturing experts in demand forecasts.  Diversifying LNG supply lines  KOGAS imports LNG mostly from South East Asia including Indonesia and Malaysia. However, as the development of the natural gas is reduced in the region, the company has recently increased the quantity of import from the Middle East centering on Qatar. It is also concentrated on improving the stability of supply of LNG through diversification of channels of LNG sources. In particular, the company is relieving geographical and political risks caused by regional concentration through the acquisition of LNG from new channels in Australia and Russia.

The pervading resource nationalism around the world is giving rise to the need for energy security. Therefore, just diversifying LNG supply lines is not enough to ensure the stable supply of natural gas. KOGAS has proactively pursued the upstream business of natural gas, and is thus securing sources of energy. In addition, the company is strenuously strengthening its storage capacity and expanding pipelines in not-yet-in service areas in a bid to strengthen the supply infrastructure. As of 2010, natural gas accounts for 16.0% of primary energy consumption and 27.0% of power generation and is cited as one of the most important national energy resources along with petroleum, coal and nuclear energy. In the wake of the economic recession in 2009, the consumption of inexpensive fuels including coal was increased reducing the importance of natural gas to some extent, but it became more important on the back of the economic recovery in 2010.     As seen in 75.9% recorded in the rate of distribution of city gas for homes, natural gas fully plays its part as a civic fuel, and as the company supplies the city gas to areas alienated from the existing supply of city gas, it contributes to stabilizing the life of the underprivileged in regions and realizing energy equity. On the back of these efforts, demand for the city gas is expected to experience a continuous increase although the rate of increase is on the decrease after the completion of pipelines nationwide. However, demand in the power generation sector is expected to be reduced after 2015 due to long-term expansion of new and renewable energies and nuclear energy.  Natural gas sales maintained an annual growth rate of 13.7% on average from 1987 to 2009. However, this growth is forecasted to slow to an annual growth of 0.1% between 2011 and 2020. Demand will be gradually increased until 2015, but the rate of growth is expected to be at a standstill due to increased demand for new and renewable energies and nuclear energy on a long-term basis. Accordingly, KOGAS is endeavoring to expand a basis for overseas projects for the purpose of creating new growth engines.

The company is expanding a demand management- type meter rate in order to realize stable supply and demand as well as reasonable demand while enhancing capacity to manage supply and demand through the use of overseas storage tanks.   KOGAS established a long-term contract (20~25 years) to annually introduce 238.3 to 200.8 billion tons of LNG until 2024, and it also made a mid-term 10 year contract to introduce 2.06 million tons of LNG. As of 2011, the mid-to- long-term contract responsible for introduction of 25.89 million tons of LNG accounts for 76% of 34.04 million tons, the demand forecasts for 2011. Main contract partners number ten, and they include South East Asia, the Middle East and Oceania.  Expanding LNG Storage Capacity  At the end of 2009, the rate of LNG storage of KOGAS was only 10%. This is very low even compared to Japan (16~18%) that was one of the major LNG importing countries. KOGAS has filled the shortage in low storage capacity by conducting spots and swaps. However, it plans to increase the rate of storage to 21% by 2024 taking fundamental measures to achieve stable supply and demand in the future. The company will reduce gas import costs by decreasing high priced spot purchases in the winter time through expanded storage facilities while acquiring a reliable mid-to-long-term supply.  In addition, the company is pushing for construction of a 4th LNG terminal (Samcheok) in addition to 3 LNG terminals in Incheon, Pyeongtaek and Tongyoung. It is also reviewing a new method of storage facility construction based on underground bedrock storage technology aimed to turn East Sea gas fields into storage facilities. Laying Pipelines in Not-Yet-In Service Areas  KOGAS is continuously supplying natural gas to areas that have been alienated from the existing benefits of natural gas so that the entire public can use clean fuels. Through this, KOGAS contributes to resolving energy discrimination facing some areas and expanding energy options. The company plans to additionally lay about 858km supply pipeline by 2016 in addition to existing supply pipeline network (2853km) while expanding supply areas to 212 from the existing 158 cities and counties. If the project is completed, 54 small-and-medium cities nationwide will be able to additionally choose natural gas.  Supply and Demand Management in 2010 After reduction in demand in the wake of global financial crises in 2008 and 2009, the economy recovered to increase demand in 2010, and changes in demand were as much as 26.6% from the previous year, and this resulted in difficulties in supply and demand management. However, as a result of continuous efforts made to reduce the margin of errors in demand forecasts, KOGAS was able to decrease the margin of errors by 0.7% in 2010 when it was 3.0% while laying the foundation for a stable supply and demand. Through this, the company was able to establish a short-term-supply-and-demand plan in 2010 to calculate sufficient quantity while pursuing to acquire an anticipatory quantity. In order to acquire needed quantities, the company formed a purchase portfolio to secure 18 cargo units in the winter months based on a new-short-term contract and re-established a supply and demand plan for the winter at the end of September after the spot purchase of 6 cargo units in the summer when prices are relatively lower in a permitted range of storage tank capacity before additional purchase of 31 cargo units. If the 22 cargo units of purchase quantity from January to March, 2010, the previous winter period, are added, the company has acquired a total of 77 cargo units to achieve a stable supply and demand based on economics and a stable adjustment of supply.

Concerns factors in the demand aspects are classified into demand for city gas and power generation. In the meantime, demand for city gas changes or occurs according to business fluctuations and temperature change.  As natural gas used in generating power is used as base material for electricity production, its demand changes according to increased demand for electricity, mechanical problems in power generation facilities, preventive maintenance and the relative prices of heavy oil competing with LNG in addition to changes in weather or economic conditions. Concerns factors in supply aspects include mechanical troubles in production facilities, problems in LNG transport ships and political factors in producing countries. In addition, problematic storage and supply facilities may cause concerns about supply and demand. In this regard, KOGAS is making diverse efforts to stabilize the supply and demand of LNG. First of all, the company thoroughly puts short and long term demand and the winter time into perspective to calculate the seasonally needed quantity while purchasing additional quantity or treating surplus quantity by using the LNG spot market during times of excess or deficient demand. The company has also set up branch offices in South East Asia and the Middle East where most LNG is concentrated to monitor the state of operation of facilities in producing countries and political and economic conditions of each and every country. In addition, it is expanding the channels of introduction into Russia and Australia in order to overcome regional concentration of the introduction channels and minimize geographical and political risks.  In order to counter possible difficulties in managing supply and demand through adjustment of supply, the company established a quantity contract with city gas providers and power generators and took measures to manage supply and demand during emergencies by dealing with demand for LNG used in generating power through increase in the quantity of power generation in heavy oil power generators and coal power generators while conducting operations based on systemization of regulations on natural gas supply and demand Efforts to stabilize  supply and demand  2010 Sustainability Report - The current state of KOGAS mid-to-long-term LNG import contracts  Long-term contract Mid-term contract Existing contracts New long-term contracts Category Indonesia Malaysia Qatar Oman Yemen Russia Brunei Korea Australia Egypt and others Australia Indonesia Producing countries KOREA BADAK MLNG MLNG RasGas RasGas OLNG YLNG Sakhalin BLNG East Sea Gas NWS BG GLNG DSLNG Project 200 100 200 200 492 210 406 200 150 70 40 2,268 50 156 406 300+Option 50 70 Quantity (10,000 tons/Year) 1994~2014 1998~2017 1995~2015 2008~2028 1999~2024 2007~2026 2000~2024 2008~2028 2008~2028 1997~2013 2004~2018 2003~2016 2008~2016 2015~2035 2015~2028 Contract period FOB FOB FOB Ex-Ship FOB Ex-Ship FOB FOB FOB Ex-Ship PNG Ex-Ship Ex-Ship FOB FOB Delivery terms Subtotal Subtotal 14 contracts (9 countries) 26.74 million tons of annually  KOGAS is expanding business areas into different regions like North America, Oceania, Africa, South East Asia, Middle East, CIS, and the pan-pacific and polar region. The company has established a portfolio strategy with regard to regional business characteristics for a stable supply of natural gas to the domestic market in an effort to emerge as a global energy provider. 41 40 Overseas Project Performance Economic Performance In addition, the company established a contract with an outsourcer to conduct elasticity wave exploration in Uzunkui, Uzbekistan, and is currently working to acquire two-dimensional elasticity wave data. These upstream exploration projects will secure a long-term stable platform of natural gas, while also diversifying the revenue structure of KOGAS. Acquisition of Akkas/Mansuriyah gas field development rights in Iraq Iraq ranks 4th in petroleum reserves and 12th in natural gas reserves. It is also a strategic point of resources development where global companies including oil majors and public corporations are engaged in fierce competition. KOGAS has participated in the region as an Akkas gas field operator and acquired development rights by defeating various competitors. In addition, the company formed a consortium along with TPAO and the Kuwait Energy Company in Mansuriyah Gas Field to acquire gas field development rights.  Oil Field Development & Production Business in Iraq Zubair  Located 20km southwest of Basra, Iraq, the Zubair oil & gas field spans 900km2; equivalent to 1.5 times the size of Seoul. KOGAS is the only Korean company participating in the project, the largest ever developed by a Korean company. The project includes the restoration and upgrading of the worn-out production field (blocks) and increasing production with the aim of generating approximately 6.4 billion barrels of oil over the next 20 years. KOGAS formed a consortium with ENI and Occidental, who have years of E&P business experience. The consortium will render the company with technological development in the area of resource development, while also securing new sources of revenue and serving as a foothold for becoming an independent business in the future. As KOGAS has advanced into the oil trading sector for the first time, it is expected to make a great contribution to creating profits. *Consortium Composition :KOGAS(18.75%), ENI(32.81%), Occidental(23.44%), Missan Oil Company (25%) - A map of the Area 4 in Mozambique - A map of the Gas Field in Indonesia Development Business - A map of four mines in Iraq  KOGAS is involved in overseas projects so as to secure the stable, long-term supply of energy sources and expand its business portfolio.

Beyond our primary mission of ensuring a stable supply of natural gas, we also endeavor to maximize values for our stakeholders, our shareholders, investors, customers, employees, government, community and partners, by creating new value and returning profits to society.  53 52 Disclosure Management Approach Environmental Performances KOGAS business has characteristically low environmental impact factors due to the clean and environmentally friendly features of natural gas. Despite this, the company is well aware of its social responsibility to climate change as an energy enterprise. Its approach to environmental protection starts from responding to the global concern over the greenhouse effect, and also includes low carbon green growth initiatives for new growth engines and minimizing environmental impact from its construction and operation of natural gas facilities. In order to control these various efforts within a single system, the company operates the EHSQ management system and applies a total quality management (TQM) process to continuously improve the companys effectiveness and soundness. In terms of energy efficiency, the sale of natural gas drastically increased by 27% on the previous year, but sales were somewhat reduced by 6.5% in terms of basic units. Considering that the basic unit increases up to 250% in the winter time in the natural gas industry, it shows improved energy efficiency on the back of optimized facility operation and improved TDR (Turn Down Ratio) in both winter and the summer.  This is the result of the implementation of low cost green management on the back of integrated management on green house gas emissions and improved energy efficiency in accordance with the KOGAS green management strategy established based on the governmental low carbon green growth strategy. Although construction waste products have increased in the wake of the construction of the Samcheok Base and in the expansion of supply networks for not-yet-in service areas, the company makes efforts to treat its wastes in an appropriate manner.

Disclosure Management Approach Environmental  Performances Regarding its environmental policy, KOGAS recognizes its role and responsibility for climate change as a seller of fossil fuels while pushing for the reduction in green house gas emissions on a preferential basis. The company endeavors to research in advance the environmental effects of facility operation on surrounding areas to minimize leakage and emission, and efforts are being made to minimize effects on the quality of air and water and the local community. In the meantime, the company is putting emphasis on raising the awareness of employees and the local community through ongoing campaign activities.  2010 Costs of environmental activities in 2010 33,345 KRW  million 200934,694KRW million 200821,984KRW million  55 54 Environmental Policies Environmental Performances KOGAS runs an integrated EHSQ Management System for the comprehensive control of its environmental, health, safety & quality management activities. The key functions of the EHSQMS include the periodic measuring and monitoring of corporate activities in order to identify any improvement opportunities and make any necessary corrections. KOGAS establishes an Environmental Performance Evaluation (EPE) System to conduct environmental activities and to objectively and quantitatively assess activities and performances according to the environmental index.  In particular, the company regularly revises the Environmental Contamination (Maritime) Practice Manual to effectively and efficiently respond to environmental emergencies including leakage of Bunker-C used in LNG transport carriers while enhancing crisis response competence through regular training conducted in our 3 LNG Bases.  2010 Environmental Expenses  KOGAS has developed its own standards for environmental cost calculation in four categories pollution prevention, pollutant treatment, stakeholder activities and legal compliances. The lions share of the companys environmental budgets is spent on preventing pollution, followed by the treatment of pollutants. As waste treatment costs related to construction that was calculated as contamination treatment costs in 2009 were excluded from the costs of environmental activities in 2010, contamination treatment costs were drastically reduced last year to the level of previous years. In the meantime, legal costs were increased in the wake of general consultation costs in the process of negotiations to compensate nearby fishermen with regard to changes in ocean temperature in Tongyoung Terminal.

The company endeavors to research environmental effects of facility operation on surrounding areas in advance to minimize leakage and emissions. Also efforts are being made to minimize the effects on the quality of air and water and the local community. In the meantime, the company is putting emphasis on raising the awareness of employees and the local community through ongoing campaign activities. The company is pursuing to satisfy the legal requirements for the environment in various overseas resources development projects executed for the purpose of national energy security while conducting environmental management activities at a level required in domestic business activities.  Essence of KOGAS Environmental Management Regarding KOGAS business activities in 2010, the KOGAS core process that affects the environment is the operation of the LNG Base and supply network aimed to provide natural gas through a grid of nationwide pipelines after gasification of LNG.  However, this vaporization does not involve any chemical change in property, causing only negligible environmental impact. Located on the coast, LNG terminals inevitably bring about change in the neighboring environment, as does the construction and operation of the pipelines nationwide. Therefore, it is imperative for KOGAS to minimize any impact on the environment. In addition, the company established a Green Growth Teamin order to proactively respond to climate change, the latest global concern, and braces itself to comprehensively manage responses to climate change and turn green growth into a new business model in accordance with the governmental low carbon green growth policy.  While controlling its emissions of soil, water and air pollutants, the company added water usage to its company- wide monitoring list in 2009. The company employs the EHSQ Management System as an integrated environmental management system, which collects and maintains the environmental database on the KOSMOS System (KOGASintegrated information management system). To date, none of KOGASbusiness sites have influenced any protected areas such as the Ramsar Wetlands. In response to rising public concern over biodiversity, the company will discreetly approach the issue in all its environmental impact assessments in the future.  As part of these efforts, the company has excluded the local wetlands and lagoon from its Samcheok LNG Terminal construction site as well as relocated the sea grabbles to neighboring beaches.

As the use of NaOH aimed to adjust pH within an SMV water tank is increased, general use rose to the level indicated in 2008, but favorable results have been generated in terms of basic units compared to 2008.   Wastes  Most of KOGAS waste originates from construction sites. In particular, as the construction of the 4th LNG Base in Samcheok kicked into high gear in 2010, construction wastes were increased in the wake of ongoing installation and expansion of other bases, enlargement of supply network in not-yet-in service areas and increased construction. Other general wastes increased by a small margin compared to 2009, and designated wastes were reduced. KOGAS applies higher standards than the legal requirements to all its waste management. We farm out the treatment of waste to external expert agencies, which are selected after careful verification, on their actual treatment capacity and methods. We also conduct regular audits on their legal compliances.

The main source of water use is the water service, but some of our valve stations operating in remote areas use underground water. As the water usage increase factor is insignificant due to rising sales in consideration of the operational characteristics of the facilities, water usage was similar to the previous year.  Sewage Discharge  Of KOGASthree LNG receiving terminals, the Pyeongtaek and Incheon Terminals treat sewage water on-site before discharging it into the sea. The sewage water from the Tongyeong Terminal and valve stations of the Trunk Line Operation Department are sent to city wastewater treatment facilities. We control the pollutant concentration of all our effluents within the legal requirement of 20 ppm.  Industrial Water Discharge  The Incheon Terminal operates its own oil mixed water and general water treatment facilities in order to treat the wastewater from its cogeneration facilities and laboratories. Other business premises recycle most of their used water on-site after eliminating water pollutants. Seawater used in the LNG vaporizer is discharged without any harmful effects. In 2010, the level of BOD, COD and SS waste water emitted from Pyeongtaek and Incheon Terminal was significantly lower than the previous year.

During all procedures connected with controlling and treating pollutants, KOGAS fully abides by governing laws and regulations.  59 58 Strategic Green Growth Environmental Performances In addition, the company conducted a project to explore a green growth business model with the aim to achieve low carbon green growth. KOGAS defined 3 strategic directions including green gas, clean fossil fuel and new and renewable energy efficiency based on natural gas, a popular fuel emitting the smallest amount of green house gases. This was done while conducting analysis on 15 business candidates to explore five business areas for strategic appropriateness and strong market appeal. The company concentrated on analyzing five business areas such as production and sale of biogas, overseas gas sales, sale of car fuel gas (NGV), efficient gas field process management and investment in new and renewable energies to push for overseas gas sales and biogas business on the preferential basis. This growth industry is expected to contribute to reducing green house gases and improving the rate of energy independence. Through this, the company will establish the KOGAS Green Growth Master Plan in 2011 to systematically push for green growth policy from a strategic viewpoint.  Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)  KOGAS participates in a carbon disclosure project (CDP) involving about 3,000 global companies, including 534 leading global financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, AIG including the companies on the FT500 Index after 2008. The company worked hard to provide more accurate and credible climate change information, which was then utilized to evaluate investment risks and opportunities by numerous global financing and investment organizations. Carbon Point Program for Individual Workers   Reducing GHG emissions begins with changes in individual habits. Providing its employees with opportunities to better understand the companys GHG reduction efforts, KOGAS is dedicated to establishing a habit of reducing GHG emissions in the day-to-day lives of its workforce both at work and in society. Encouraged by the successful results of the pilot program, KOGAS expanded the program to a company-wide level, providing its employees with opportunities to contribute to a carbon-lean society.  At the same time, a dedicated web-based program for carbon mileage points was constructed on the corporate Web site, where employees can keep records of their energy consumption patterns. In 2009, the participants numbered 776, but the number drastically increased to 1,767 in 2010 to facilitate these activities.

Through the implementation of these green management strategies, KOGAS has proactively engaged in GHG reduction initiatives and established itself as a sustainable green energy enterprise by securing green growth engines. KOGAS has made continuous efforts to respond to climate change and installed a Green Growth Team in the Management Strategy Department in order to proactively push for green growth. The existing Climate Change & Environment Team that focused on responding to climate change was reorganized into the Green Growth Team now concentrated on environmentally friendly growth, and the company is doing its utmost to acquire new growth engines through green growth on the back of low carbon management and green house gas reductions.  Under the vision of becoming a sustainable green energy enterprise KOGAS is pushing forward green management mid-term strategies (2010~2014), including seven missions and 52 action plans in three categories: addressing climate change, energy conservation and securing green growth engines. From the comprehensive information management system controlling GHG emissions to renewable energy technology R&D and commercialization, these 52 action plans will utilize the PDCA process to implement a five-year plan. Performances will be closely monitored at the Green Growth Commission meeting held biannually. At the same time, an annual review of plans will keep us updated on policies and strategies regarding the rapidly changing business environment. Compliance  with  Regulations  Cost  Reduction Creating Opportunities  61 60 GHG & Energy Management Environmental Performances KOGAS also introduced the Energy Management System (EnMS) to its Incheon Base on a trial basis for the first time in the domestic gas industry and plans to expand it enterprise-wise based on ISO 50001.  The company will establish an IT system for integrated green house gas and energy management in order to achieve energy savings and reduce green house gases in a more organized and systemizedway.  KOGAS is making efforts to establish a system to respond to the national green house gas and energy targets management conducted by the government since 2011 and plans to set reasonable green house gas and energy targets in consultation with the government so that policy can be fully implemented.  Green Work Place KOGAS has introduced new and renewable energy to its business places in an effort to achieve green working conditions, starting with the introduction of photovoltaic power generators and a solar heat-based hot water system in the Cheonan and Gunsan Management Offices in 2009. The company has also installed and operated photovoltaic power generation facilities and a solar heat-based hot water system in the regional head offices in Chungcheong, Honam and Gyeongnam in 2010. In addition, the company selected the Cheongju Management Office as a trial operation management office for the purpose of producing electricity by using waste pressure of gas. As for the new HQ building into which the company plans transfer in 2014, KOGAS will introduce photovoltaic and geothermal heat-based power generation comprising 10% of its energy use.  Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Recovering Vent Gas KOGAS has adapted recompression equipment since 2003 in order to recycle vent gas produced by repairing and/or relocating pipelines. In 2010, KOGAS recycled a total of 837 tons of natural gas, in turn reducing the equivalent of 17,577 tCO2 in GHG emissions. The company will purchase one more unit of recompression equipment in 2011 for more effective use in the field.   Reduction of GHG through Efficient Facilities in the Field  Proactive efforts have been made to reduce GHG with efficient facilities in the field of production and supply. The Incheon Production Terminal replaced existing water-pipe boilers with high-efficiency steam boilers, and the Banghwa and Gimhae Management Offices have installed and operated a gas heater waste heat recovery system. The company also replaced all of its incandescent lamps numbering 2323 and will change 30% of its enterprise- wide light fixtures into LED by 2012.   Voluntary GHG Reduction  - Photovoltaic power generation facility  - Recompression facility - LED Lamp 2010 Sustainability Report GHG & Energy Management Calculation and verification of GHG emissions  In order to effectively reduce green house gases, it is necessary to determine the current state of green house gas emissions according to objective and accurate standards above all else. KOGAS has established an enterprise- wide green house gas inventory from 2007 to 2010 based on the KOGAS Inventory Guidelines that fully comply with international standards. Furthermore, the company once again calculated green house gas emissions in accordance with the Guidelines for GHG & Energy Management as the government notified laws on the target management system with regard to GHG and energy. In order to improve the efficiency of GHG inventory management and the level of credibility of calculations of GHG emissions, the company has designated and operated one or more Green Manager in 14 business sites nationwide. As a result, it was able to calculate GHG emissions for the four years from 2007 to 2010 and enhanced its credibility by completing third party verification through the use of a specialized institution designated by the Ministry of Environment. The company plans to set and achieve reasonable GHG and energy reduction targets based on these calculated emissions in consultation with the government before making every effort to attain the goals.  Improvement of energy efficiency  KOGAS continuously endeavors to save energy in order to proactively respond to changing management environments including the governmental low carbon green growth policy and the global response to climate change. As the quantity of energy input into production is directly related to green house gas emissions, the company is proactively pursuing to conduct energy saving activities to efficiently use energy.  The Enterprise-Wide Energy Saving Committee consisting of executives sets enterprise-wide energy saving targets at the beginning of the year with goals for each of the 14 business sites. Then, the Green Growth Team dedicated to managing energy regularly analyzes and assesses energy use before reporting on it. The company conducts assessment on enterprise-wide achievement of energy saving targets and efforts to save energy and rewards excellent business sites to further encourage further energy savings.  In terms of energy efficiency, the sales of natural gas rose 27% from the previous year, but the basic unit experienced a minor decrease of 6.5% from last year. Considering the industrial characteristics of natural gas where the basic unit soars up to 250% in the winter time, energy efficiency has been improved on the back of optimized facility operation and an enhanced TDR (Turn Down Ratio) during both summer and winter.

As unfavorable or favorable evaluations might occur in accordance with business characteristics, changes were made to organizational scale and personnel composition in bureaus, departments and business places when promoting grade-2-and-3 employees in 2010.This was done to exclude lower score earners (lower than 50% in evaluation) instead of applying a fixed rate promotion system in order to improve fairness. When promoting grade-3 employees (deputy mangers) who are considered core personnel of KOGAS, the company pays attention to encouraging employees by preventing promoted personnel from being concentrated at HQ or certain business places through the designation of a minimum rate of promotion by HQ and business place while improving organization competitiveness and productivity.  Career development for employees and facilitation of in-house contests KOGAS operates its own career development system to provide career development support to employees according to corporate and personal career development systems while placing personnel with the right talent in the right position. In addition, the company selects personnel to fulfill important obligations through in-house contests in an effort to create a healthy competitive environment within the organization and improve fairness and transparency in the selection process. In particular, the company has introduced in-house contests among Team Leaders or higher with the aim to reform personnel management while enhancing job satisfaction and responsibility by granting appropriate positions to the right people.  The increasing number of overseas projects has also given rise to more opportunities for work abroad. The company publicly recruits candidates for overseas dispatches, recruiting talented workers and assigning employees to their dream positions, which, in turn, improves rationality and transparency in our human resources management practices. Job Satisfaction Survey  KOGAS conducts surveys of its employee satisfaction levels as part of its human resources management practices. For objectiveness and transparency in its procedures and results, the company outsources the survey to an external agency. Based on the objective diagnosis of its human resources management system and operation, the company prepares improvements and future directions. In addition, the company conducts follow-up surveys on employee satisfaction in regards to recruitment, evaluation, rewards, dispatches and promotion for a more effective and specific analysis of its system. In 2010, employee HRM satisfaction improved by 4.5% on the previous year, a clear indication of improved rationality and employee satisfaction. Improvement and operation of personnel management system through communication  HRM employees run tour sessions of all our business premises in order to explain current HRM policies and issues and listen to employeessuggestions, thus enhancing the employees acceptance of the HRM systems and its rationality. In case of a revision to the system, the company holds workshops to reflect employeesopinions. It also operates diversified channels for its employees to voice their grievances and complaints, such as e- mail, telephone, visits and an intranet system. Those voices are incorporated in the assigning process.

It is effectively realized through the use of a career development program (CDP) operated by KOGAS. The career development program (CDP) aims to systematically manage a series of processes of designing and implementing a competence development plan by designating career targets and paths and diagnosing present competence and needed competence. The CDP progress is monitored at each step and feedback provided to employees in order to strengthen their competencies and increase job fulfillment. Through the objective review of their achievements, the company then positions qualified employees in the most suitable areas. Self-directed Life Learning  Through a multi-dimensional analysis of individual and organizational demands, KOGAS is able to create optimal conditions for self-directed learning, setting the stage for co-prosperous growth. Individuals establish a career development plan targeting desired performances in the future, and the company suggests the level of required competence by individual through a corporate stratum and performance analysis while providing optimized and customized education that systematically offers procedures and methods so that the needed education and self- initiated learning can be implemented.   Knowledge Management KOGASknowledge management consists of action learning where learning, sharing and improvement are pursued at the same time. To this end, a CoP (Community of Practice) system, an autonomous learning organization, has been facilitated, and knowledge owned by individuals is registered with KOSMOS, an enterprise- wide managerial management system, so that experts by area can share the knowledge when conducting evaluation and management.  Since 2009, the company has conducted integrated management of CoP where subdivision was executed into knowledge, suggestions and performances in an effort to encourage smooth operation of the CoP, and as of 2010, 367 CoP were registered, and activities conducted, and this is up 23% from the previous year. As for the current state of registration of knowledge, a total of 3,124 cases have been registered and shared, which is up 16% from a year ago.

KOGAS complies with the ILO Convention 87 Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention, the ILO Convention 98 Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention and the ILO Convention 182 Worst Form of Child Labor to respect employees rights. Founded in November 1985, the KOGAS labor union was incorporated as a branch of the Korean Public Services Union in November 2006 under the reorganization of labor union associations. The union operates under the union shop system, in which all employees under grade 3 are automatically entitled to membership. As of the end of 2010, 2,525 people, or 88.2% of the companys regular staff, were members of the union. The Labor and Management Council consists of not more than 10 members, and the same number of members, respectively, from the labor and the management participate in the council where a meeting is held quarterly to prevent conflicts and disputes in advance and create a cooperative environment for labor and management.

Following consultancy with an expert agency, the company designed its own retirement pension program customized to its needs. Before finalizing the program, the company conducted surveys, seminars and workshops to ensure that employees, the direct beneficiaries of the program, and the labor union were on the same page. Aiming to implement the program in 2011, the company is planning to give a presentation with the labor union and gain consent from its employees before finalizing the system. KOGAS adopted an optional welfare program in 1998 that caters to the individual needs of employees, and thereby enhancing their satisfaction and productivity. The welfare card, introduced in 2007, further enhanced efficiency and transparency of the welfare programs. As of 2011, new KOGAS employees minimum wage (1,572,700 won) is 174% of the national monthly minimum wage (902,880 won). Amid difficult economic conditions, the government has recently decided to control excessive spending on labor costs and employee benefits in an effort to share hardships in the public sector while improving the welfare benefits system to counter an aging society, reflect various employee demands and increase satisfaction based on a more efficient non-monetary welfare benefits system that can better respond to the managerial environment and governmental policy.   - KOGAS Welfare Program Health check-up Health & medical EAP Cultural life Retro planning Leisure life Residential stability Scholarship fund Maternity program Life welfare Daycare center Family-friendly Self-development Department support Club subsidies Medical supplies Athletic events BCP  Designing Work and Life for a Healthy Future Individual Family Organization Efforts to enhance  employee welfare  - Enhancement of employee satisfaction through   expanded non-monetary welfare benefits - 2010 welfare benefits satisfaction survey Additional implementation  of EAP  Period: June 2010 ~December 2010 (6 months) Participants: Employee satisfaction 2010 81.0% 2009 73.7% Improvement of disaster insurance Implementation period: 70 million won 100  million won at a time of death Installation of outpatient-based  medicine (300,000 won) 2010 82.3% 2009 77.1% Expansion of additional services for welfare cards Expanded contents: Increase in the amounts of  gas discounts  Additional discounts given on  theater tickets  Employee satisfaction 2010 2009 78.5% Expansion of a childcare center for employees Opening of a nursery in Tongyoung Terminal  Division (September.9) Employee satisfaction 2010 2009 76.0% Medical Disaster Health Card Companyhousing Childcare Resortfacilities Scholarshipfund Club EAP Loanstocollege students 2009 2010 71.2% of satisfaction on average Improvement of welfare  benefits in response to  an aging society Retirement Pension Program  Welfare program principles (continuity, efficiency, effectiveness) Jop/Personal Life Topics S t S t e s e s s s s t e s e s t s t d Employees Addressing work and life issues enhanced employee engagement Improved mental health (happiness)  of employees Psychological stability Motivation  Enhanced organizational satisfaction Company  Efficient and specialized management  Compliance with regulations on  occupational safety and obligations  within business places  Decreased absence and accident ratio  due to stress Improved corporate image  retaining core talent Corporate development through  improved productivity  - Effects of provision of EAP services Employees - Company Win-Win - Effects of import of EAP services 83.3% 76.6%  75 74 Customer Satisfaction Management KOGAS energy starts with customers.

It has also installed a satellite base through the use of a tank lorry in not-yet-in-service areas through pipeline in an effort to realize supply at an earlier possible date while laying the basis for improved public welfare in energy-poor areas and paving the way for an advanced regional economy.  The company has also provided customer-oriented marketing services by expanding the gas-fueled air- conditioning support system and fixed quantity system for collective energy operators while relieving the burden on gas fees by changing the fee systems for semi-residence facilities. These measures are creating factors leading to reduced natural gas fees based on a decreased financial burden on our customers through requests for developmental natural gas fees, improved procedures, delivery of city gas to the military, and enhanced refund procedures for individual consumption taxes and a shortened period of warranty insurance for direct tank lorry- supplied industries. KOGAS has expanded the safety diagnosis service in the field of customer facilities based on systematized safety system and provided such free safety check services on customer facilities as special inspections in preparations for the spring thaw and in the winter time.

As for SME products and SME technological development, purchase targets and purchase expansion plans have been established for the purpose of enabling more SMEs to have more opportunities to deliver products, and efforts have been made to provide SMEs more chances to win project orders based on monthly check on implementation performance.   In encouragement of SMEs technological development, KOGAS promotes new product development projects with purchase guarantees and localization of core components. These programs provide stable supply lines and encourage SMEs to push forward with technological R&D activities. New Product Development Projects with Purchase Guarantees  Entering into an agreement with the Small and Medium Business Administration (SMEA) in 2003, KOGAS selects items every year in order to fund SME development activities, making preferred purchases of these items for two years. Through this program, KOGAS has purchased four items in deals worth KRW 780 million from 2005 to 2010.  *SMEAs selection of and support for developers as to development assignments include new products for which the government, public institutions and large companies have applied (75% of project costs, up to 500 million won). Also we seek the acquisition of sale routes through purchase for a certain period of time (2 years or longer) on the part of technology consumers if SMEs succeed in developing and commercializing the technology Localization of Terminal Equipments  In a bid to stabilize its facility operations, KOGAS supports its SME partners technology development and the localization of spare component supplies of foreign made LNG Terminal facilities. In 2010, KOGAS completed commercialization of 12 items and established a mid-term plan to localize parts so that 82 items can be additionally localized by 2015.

After measures to achieve mutual growth in the private sector were reported to the President last September, countermeasures to be pursued in the public sector were reported in December to emphasize proactive roles to attain mutual growth. KOGAS will endeavor to respond to governmental policy and fulfill its social responsibility as a public corporation.  KOGAS will review diversified action plans to expand the purchase of SME goods and conduct co-prosperity management along with SMEs for the purpose of achieving mutual growth and systematically pushing it forward. To this end, the company formed the SME Support Team, an organization dedicated to leading support for SMEs last December and established the Co-prosperity Management Council, a permanent consultative body, in 2011 to conduct restructuring for the purpose of supporting the SMEs.  KOGAS is making efforts to settle a transparent and fair contract culture for small, medium and large constructors in the construction sector. Last October, the company formed a Special Subcontractor Improvement Team to conduct research on the actual conditions in the field for 2 months with regard to main pipe construction to supply natural gas (17 construction areas).   The company requested autonomous corrections with regard to violations detected in an inspection, and if this is not implemented, the company will report the problems to the related institutions. In addition, KOGAS established the Subcontractor Management Instructions to systematically correct problems detected in research on the actual conditions. In order to eliminate unfair subcontract practices, KOGAS signed the Fair Contract Culture Agreement among the National Assembly, KOGAS and constructors, afterwhich held a rally to encourage mutual growth for small, medium and large constructors. The company will enhance checks on the state of implementation in the future and continuously and systematically conduct operation for mutual growth for small, medium and large constructors based on subcontracts and cross-confirmation on payment.  2010 Sustainability Report KOGAS depends on SMEs for 90% of its materials and procurement of LNG terminal construction or natural gas pipelines. Therefore, competent SMEs contribute to KOGAScompetitiveness. The stable construction and operation of cryogenic high pressure gas facilities heavily depends on these SMEs technologies. Therefore, KOGAS supports its SME partners so as to improve the quality of its gas facilities and stabilize management. Supporting SMEs - The CEOs determination to attain mutual growth  KOGAS will take the initiative in sharing-oriented management for the purpose of mutual  growth based on fair and transparent transaction practices and cooperation in its  relationships with partners including SMEs.

In addition, the company has established a road map on mid-to-long-term EHSQ education and training in order to develop sectoral experts by applying a differentiated education system by job, stage and obligation while introducing a safety-oriented corporate culture by developing safety regulations befitting KOGAS through the use of case studies on excellent safety management companies.

The system makes it possible to conduct integrated and effective management of safety, health, environment and quality issues while minimizing risks and improving productivity in the field. In addition, KOGAS EHSQMS acquired and maintained ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001; all highly recognized at home and abroad.  ISRS-based evaluation and proliferation of the safety culture  In 2010, KOGAS while receiving Level 7; conducted evaluations through use of the ISRS (International Safety Rating System) developed and operated by DNV for the purpose of a more objective evaluation on EHSQMS.  Although the result was rather disappointing in consideration of the time-honored experiences and expectations on  EHSQMS, the company is bracing itself for another leap forward a new development. The company continues to conduct evaluations not only on the ISRS-based system but also on the safety culture. As the safety culture has failed to meet expectations in the wake of the latest business diversification and internal competence dispersion for the establishment of infrastructure, the company is considering taking proactive measures to promote the safety culture centering on the CEO. In particular, the company helps safety take root in daily life by inducing employees to raise their awareness about risk factors in the field and to introduce proper safety behavior.   KOGAS safety management is conducted in a way that risk factors in the field are defined and eliminated in advance or that measures are taken to minimize contacts with workers in the field. This leads to a safe work place based on fundamental safety management, and an emergency response plan is made to minimize damage caused by accidents. Continuous and repetitive training is conducted along with governmental institutions and nearby businesses. Thanks to these efforts, KOGAS achieved its zero-disaster goal in 12 business places in 2010.  The current state of occurrence of industrial disasters by year  In 2010, no industrial disasters occurred in KOGAS in accordance with laws and regulations related to its employees. However, various construction projects to establish infrastructure nationwide including the expansion of supply network in not-yet-in-service areas and the Samcheok Base have resulted in increased risks on the part of our partners. As three people lost their lives, the company came up with various measures to enhance safety management for their partners, and these have been implemented since 2011.  Establishment of an evaluation system befitting global standards EHSQMS has turned out to be the best choice for KOGAS when managing risks in the field and supplying natural gas in a safe and stable way. The fundamental purpose of KOGAS EHSQMS is to continuously improve activities and generate the best performances. To this end, KOGAS operates an annual evaluation system and assesses the level of operation of EHSQMS in the entire business to reflect the result in the internal performance evaluation. In 2010, KOGAS developed an objective global evaluation system to acquire the capability of conducting internal audits on employees while raising EHSQMS to the global level and guaranteeing consistent and objective evaluation.   The evaluation system named MASTER (Management & Assessment Tool for Efficient Rating) helps objectively and quantitatively conduct evaluations on the level of safety, health, environment and quality management activities by KOGAS, and the company is making efforts to improve EHSQMS to meet global standards and  secure global competitiveness by making the most of Improvement Opportunities through evaluation.

The company established a video  conference  network connecting the HQ and 12 sites and a disaster situation room for immediately reporting disasters and rapidly proliferating situations during large-scale disasters by linking the earthquake detection system to the national safety management system. In addition, the company maintains disaster response capability by conducting various practical training sessions including virtual accident training, random training and reporting system inspection drills. KOGAS established and implemented safety management measures to successfully support the G20 Summit in Seoul and respond to crises related to provocations by the North Korean Military on Yeonpyeong Island while contributing to fulfilling its social responsibility by proliferating the advanced KOGAS disaster management system to other institutions (KOGAS honorly made presontations on its excellent disaster response to the Ministry of Public Administration and Safety and the Ministry of Knowledge Economy). As a result, the company was highly recognized for its excellent disaster management system and received the Presidential Award and Minister Awards (the Ministry of Knowledge Economy and the Ministry of Public Administration and Safety)    81 80 Safe work places & healthy employees  The current state of response to earthquakes and tidal waves KOGAS production and supply facilities reflect earthquake-proof design in order to continue to supply gas even if earthquakes occur. As an example we have the Samcheok Terminal under construction on the eastern coast of Korea. The company immediately determines the current state of earthquake action through the use of an internal earthquake detection system (5 production Terminals & 101 supply management offices) while preventing gas leaks caused by an earthquake by rapidly blocking sections in affected areas.

The company established a five-year-plan to conduct risk evaluation on facilities and conducts activities to define gas facility-related crises that might be caused by climate change. (earthquakes, tidal waves, damage from storm and flood, wild fires, landslides etc.).   KOGAS established a database on risk factors related to 6,000 works through the use of job safety analysis data that has been accumulated for the past 10 years in an effort to define risks that field workers might face in the field in advance and effectively share countermeasures before allowing them to be shared by employees and linked with the work permission system. The company shares information with workers through the use of the Tool Box Meeting (TBM) in an effort to prevent these accidents before they occur. This system has led to enterprise-wide shared risk factors and improved safety based on essential safety management items designated through the generation of risk factors that had been overlooked during individual job safety analysis (JSA) and offers suggestion concerning the degree of danger.  Prevention of actual accidents through the facilitation of the Near Miss KOGAS is making efforts to explore and share Near Misses experienced by employees in the field. Near Misses occurring in the field might result in large-scale accidents causing a great deal of damage, and it manifests risk factors, so it provides a very important opportunity with regard to safety management in the field. In 2010, the company discovered a total of 401 cases, up 90% (190 cases) from a year ago and rectified potential dangerous situations. The company also rewarded excellent cases and provided education on pertinent Near Misses to allemployees.  Unification of an enterprise-wide crisis management system  KOGAS has established an enterprise-wide crisis management system to conduct unified management of various managerial crises as well as emergencies in the field. It has also come up with regulations, procedures and an action manual by level. Through this, the company subdivided responses according to situational characteristics and minimized possible confusion by unifying the enterprise-wide response process.

Based on its business sites located in 13 cities and towns nationwide, KOGAS is conducting social contribution activities for the local community especially helping the underprivileged take part in a healthy society on the back of understanding and cooperation of social workers and local governments. The company is doing its best to enhance the rights of future generations through environmental protection, cultural enrichment, and scholarship projects so that it can warm-heartedly assist the general public.  KOGAS is sharing a happy world not only by providing clean and convenient natural gas to the public but also by sharing energy in a reliable manner. The company designated expansion of its beautiful sharing culture as a core strategy inside and outside the company in an effort to nurture representative social contribution projects in consideration of the characteristics of business, and to increase social contribution activities to satisfy the need of local community and raise employees awareness on social contribution.  The company is pursuing its great vision of a global KOGAS based on the Onnuri Project aimed to support energy, medicine and scholarships for the underprivileged and the KOGAS Hope Project that enhances the rights of future generations through preserved cultural assets and improved air conditions. Furthermore, the company has concentrated on unifying the local community by the Eoullim project and has designed Volunteer 5up project to raise employees awareness and participation. KOGAS social contribution activities are systematically conducted through record management system and social contribution project review committees. Operation of the Occupational Safety & Health Committee KOGAS is doing its utmost to help its employees lead a safe and healthy life at work. The company held 48 Occupational Safety & Health Committee Meetings in 2010 in an effort to smoothly narrow the gaps between labor and management while generating reasonable solutions, and no industrial accident has thus occurred. KOGAS is endeavoring to secure a safe work place and a guarantee of employee health.  Non-smoking KOGAS work places KOGAS has continuously pushed for an enterprise-wide non-smoking campaign since 2009. The company conducted an anti-smoking campaign in the HQ and 12 work places while holding a non-smoking clinic in connection with local health centers. In addition, it motivated employees to voluntarily participate in the campaign by rewarding excellent performers and providing individual incentives. A total of 254 employees took part in an anti- smoking clinic in 2010, and 71 employees succeeded in quitting smoking (28%). The rate of smoking in KOGAS that was 38.9% was reduced to 35.8%. The company has plans to proliferate the anti-smoking culture in 2011. 2010 Sustainability Report Healthcare activities to maintain healthy work places  - Anti-smoking clinic Establishment of a health management system KOGAS defines health-related risk factors in the field to create a pleasant working environment and establish a health management system that can prevent industrial disaster and occupational diseases by improving the health of all employees. This system, expected to be completed in 2011, will contribute to creating a pleasant and healthy office culture by systematically managing personal safety and health based on health management, GHS MSDS, health exposure evaluations and PPE.

Applying the lowest industrial gas rate, the company reduced the gas bills of 15,284 charities (facilities for handicapped, children and the aged), saving them KRW 4.1 billion in 2010. Reduced city gas fees applied to the underprivileged  In an effort to help the financially-distressed, such as welfare beneficiaries, the physically challenged and person of merit and nationally meritorious persons, KOGAS has been providing discounts on gas bills since January 2009. In 2010, the program provided KRW 22.5 billion in discounts to 556 thousand households. To ensure a warm winter for welfare security recipients and those in low-income brackets, the company introduced a suspended service system for the winter to households in arrears from 2005.  Creation of social jobs for the underprivileged - the Onnuri Project (Energy welfare support for the underprivileged) In consideration of the characteristics of an energy provider, KOGAS initiated the Onnuri Project to help improve heating efficiency in social welfare facilities mostly used by people in the low-income bracket, the handicapped, and the aged and this is based on flooring construction, wall insulation and replacement of windows and doors. The project also supports 3-month-long heating fees to low income households using kerosene, LPG and briquettes.  *The Onnuri Project : As a KOGASs representative social contribution project, it aimed to help people lead warm-hearted lives.     The project aims to replace outdated boilers, windows and doors used in 850 houses of welfare security recipients and those in low income brackets and in 71 facilities for the aged in 13 cities and towns while supporting them in the purchase of kerosene, briquettes and LPG prior to the onset of winter. The project resolved heating problems in the short-term by supporting heating costs for those in low income brackets while increasing asset values and saving energy in the mid-to-long-term through insulation construction and improved heat efficiency. It also created 389 social jobs through house repair and creating a self- supported community. As a result of a SROI (Social Return on Investment) analysis based on global standard reporting standards, it turned out to lead to high ROI. KOGAS will continue to take the initiative in creating social jobs for the underprivileged and supporting energy welfare.   A health protector for the underprivileged - the KOGAS Health & Sharing Project  Since 2008, KOGAS started supporting charges for cataract operations for the underprivileged in cooperation with Community chest of Korea in an effort to help out the poor alienated with medical benefits. Despite the advent of an aging society and an era of public health insurance, the company has given new hope and dreams to 61 youths and children by pushing for a project to support handicapped children and youths in cooperation with Bundang Seoul National University Hospital.

Awareness of social contribution activities by KOGAS   Of all the social contribution activities pursued by KOGAS, primary and direct activities such as support for social welfare facilities (33%), reduction in city gas fees (25%) and scholarships for youths (13%) are well known. The recognition of the Blue Sky Project to protect the rights of the environment for future generations and the Onnuri Project initiated as a representative social contribution of the company are continuously growing. Requests with regard to the city gas business Regarding the natural gas business, reduction in fees for the underprivileged and social welfare facilities accounted for the highest portion (53%). In addition, support for not-yet-in-service areas for natural gas (20%) and free inspections on gas facilities (19%) turned out to be highly requested. Of these, reduced fees for the underprivileged including basic livelihood security recipients started in 2009.

Accordingly, if additional verification procedures follow, the results may differ.   Limitations The verification does not include credibility of data in the report in accordance with the verification standards above. In addition, field verification has been conducted on the HQ in Seoul on a limited basis, and work places and research centers have not been included. Accordingly, if additional verification procedures follow, the results may differ.  Methods of verification  The report has been verified by applying the following methods. 1. The appropriateness of selection of main issues and technologies dealt with in the report through media research and benchmarking analyses has been examined.  2. Satisfaction with requirements for GRI application level A has been confirmed through examination on the rate of reporting on each indicator of GRI G3 Guidelines and technical methods.  3. Compliance with principles of reported contents and quality has been confirmed based on GRI G3 Guidelines.  4. The appropriateness of descriptions within the report and expressive errors has been compared with other sources based on the analysis.  5. A basis for main data and information has been checked through field verification on the HQ in Seoul, and internal processes and systems have been examined.  Result of verification The verifier has confirmed that the report has sincerely and fairly reflected KOGAS sustainable management activities and performances. The verifier has also confirmed that the verification has satisfied requirements for GRI application level A as announced by KOGAS.  1. Inclusivity : Stakeholders participation  Through the verification, it has been confirmed that KOGAS has divided stakeholders into internal members, shareholders, investors, customers and local communities and that it has determined stakeholdersinterest through the use of various means of communications. In order to collect opinions from stakeholders, diversified activities to share information by stakeholder have been conducted through various channels including partnersmeetings, IR activities for shareholders and investors and the labor management council. In particular, the scope of customers has been expanded to include final consumers and communications with customers and have been expertly enhanced through the use of various online and offline communication channels including a customer support system and VOC channels. The company is advised to establish more systematic stakeholder-participating channels to continuously manage and report stakeholdersparticipatory process and performances in the future. 2. Materiality : Selection of and report on main issues  In an effort to select information that affects corporate sustainability and in which stakeholders have interest, KOGAS has proactively reflected core issues generated based on information and experiences accumulated in the course of publishing previous reports in the report. In the process, it has been confirmed that sustainability issues have been selected through research including media analysis, sustainable management in the industry and global sustainability standards. The same questionnaire survey on stakeholders as last year is judged to be excellent as it has consecutively compared the importance of core issues selected by KOGAS from the past. However, the selected issues are confined to energy security, vision for sustainable management, strategy, environmental performances and contributions to economic development, and they are considered to have limitations in determining the diversified issues related to KOGAS sustainability. It is advised that to manage stakeholders there should be more systematic and continuous examination of important issues and performances so that these more detailed and diversified issues can be generated and fully reflected in the report.  3. Responsiveness : Organizational responses to issues  In 2010, KOGAS reconfirmed its vision for sustainable management, strategies and performances and analyzed the internal and external environment to adjust the strategic system while re-examining internal objectives and performances 2010 Sustainability Report Natural gas piping diagram Seoul district division Gyeongin district division Chungcheong district division Honam district division Gyeongbuk district division Gyeongnam district division Gangwon district division Seohae district division Under construction : G/S               : V/S               : B/V Explanatory notes  95 94 Assurance StatementGRI G3.0 Index Appendix GRI G3.0 Index 1.1 CEOs statement on sustainability management  CEOs Message & Sustainability Management Strategies  4,20 1.2 Key Impacts, Risks and Opportunities Materiality Test, Stakeholder Analysis and Addressing Climate Change 22,25,58 2.1 Name of organization Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) 8 2.2 Priority brands, products and/or services Import & supply of natural gas  8 2.3 Organizational structure of KOGAS  Organization chart & workforce (number of employees) 8 2.4 Location of organizations headquarters  Locations of the main office and district division  8~10 2.5 Countries in which the organizations operations are located  Headquarters and overseas operations 9 2.6 Nature of ownership;
