This years report also covers  our achievements realized within the framework of our  environmental, social and economic performance and  our sustainability vision.  Based upon our principle of ethical and reliable  banking, our sustainability vision is to be a bank  with strong financial foundations having respect for  the environment, keeping community investment at  high levels and attaching importance to stakeholder  relations and transparency. This vision guides our  Bank in our sustainability strategies and practices. We believe that environmental and social sustainability  is as important as profitability in our operations.  Thus, since 2007 we have been reemphasizing our  commitment to the United Nations Global Compact  (UNGC). During the reporting period, in other words  throughout 2010, we continued to support four areas  of UNGC (labour, human rights, environment, and anti- corruption) as well as the related ten principles with  our various policies and practices within the framework  of our operations. during 2010, which has been a year of  recovery due to efforts to overcome the  global economic crisis, environmental  issues have again been one of the  most important items in the global  agenda. 2010 has been a year in which  environmental awareness increased  throughout the world and necessity to  take actions against climate change  was felt more deeply. Occupying an important part in the agendas of numerous  private sector companies, financial institutions,  governments, and non-governmental organizations, the  increase in greenhouse gas emissions is also among  the priorities of us in Akbank. Especially since 2005, we  have been implementing various activities and practices  on this end. Among these are activities and practices  to support increasing environmental awareness in our  country, to reduce environmental effects resulting from  our operations, and to minimize effects caused by climate  change. In addition, since requirements regarding this  issue also bring economic benefits alongside, we offer  loan opportunities for energy efficiency and renewable  energy financing to our customers. We closely follow all international developments that  contribute to solutions regarding climate change and  5  MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN we take active part in solution processes. In line with  this approach, we took pioneering steps both locally and  internationally in 2010. Carbon Disclosure Project, which  is considered to be among the most globally recognized  and prestigious projects today, has been one of the most  concrete and awareness-raising initiatives in 2010 both  in terms of its influence area and results. This project  is also one of the most important indicators of Akbanks  declaration of and commitment to its responsibilities in  sustainable environment. Cancun Communiqu, drafted prior to the United  Nations Climate Change Summit held towards the end  of 2010 in Cancun, Mexico and also signed by Akbank,  makes a call for cooperation of governments against  climate change. As a pioneer of the struggle against  climate change in the Turkish finance industry, our  Bank has been one of the 384 companies and the only  bank in Turkey to sign the Cancun Communiqu. By  signing the Communiqu presented to government  representatives, Akbank made a call to governments  to achieve global consensus on measures to be taken  against climate change and to bring the low-carbon  economy to life at local, national and regional levels. Another effort that we believe will make significant  contribution to the socioeconomic development of  Turkey is our services provided to support SMEs that  are vital to the economy. SMEs -accounting for over  99 percent of all enterprises in our country- represent  a strategic potential in terms of sustainable growth.  Similarly, entrepreneurship and youth are the other  elements of power that has not been revealed yet.  Believing that these three elements must be supported  through various tools, we have developed a variety of  products, projects, information and communication  channels, and campaigns. Two examples of such  successful projects are Special Loans for Endeavor  Entrepreneurs initiated by Akbank and the Endeavor  Foundation and the Ideas Paving the Way to Business  program implemented in cooperation with the Sabanc  University. On the other hand, in order to benefit from the  innovative and creative potential in our country, Akbank  offers some suitable platforms to the youth. Thinking  Club activities initiated with such an approach at  various universities grow with the participation of new  students and projects every year. We, as Akbank, also aim to contribute to processes of  policy-making that will accelerate the development  of Turkey. stanbul meeting of the Royal Institute  of International Affairs (Chatham House) in 2010,  High-Impact Entrepreneurship support organization  Endeavors meetings, Opportunities in Exports  Seminars of the Foreign Economic Relations Board  (DEK), stanbul Trade and Export Finance Conference,  Euromoney Turkey Conference are only some of the  events we supported in 2010. Numerous art events that our Bank has been  supporting for a long time via Akbank Art Center play  an important role in enriching the arts and culture in  our country and create social values. While carrying out operations that have its signature  under positive developments in environmental, social  and economic sustainability, Akbank will certainly  continue to pioneer changes in the industry and in  our country and to build cooperation with the aim of  creating common benefits. Suzan Sabanc Diner Chairman, Board of Directors 6  MESSAGE FROM THE CEO AKBANK SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2010  dear Stakeholders, In 2010, we left behind a period of time in which the  traces of the recent economic turmoil were cleared and  main focus stood on growth strategies. In this difficult  period, we, as Akbank, maintained the same momentum  for creating lasting values for all of our stakeholders.  We are proud to share our second Sustainability Report,  which is one of the most important indicators of our  long-term perspective and commitment. Akbank steers its operations not only towards its  corporate targets, but also with a direction of growth  that meets expectations of its significant stakeholders  including Shareholders, Employees, Customers,  Investors, International Financial Institutions,  Society, Legislators, Business Partners, Suppliers,  Youth, Media, and Non-Governmental Organizations.  Dialogues on important and material issues with  our stakeholders via various platforms contribute to  improving our business processes and performance.  Corporate governance, transparency and loyalty to  ethical values have always been a priority of Akbank.  We are aware of the fact that a transparent and sincere  communication is what brings value to Akbank from  the perspective of existing stakeholders and potential  investors. Akbank management team meticulously  implements the principle of sharing financial results  of its operations with all related parties in a complete,  fair, accurate, timely and understandable manner  within the framework of generally accepted accounting  principles and legislation provisions. In terms of  informing the public, our practices are based upon the  regulations of the Capital Markets Board of Turkey and  the stanbul Stock Exchange Market.  Global and local operations that we perform for the  sake of sustainable environment accelerated in 2010.  7 Since 2009, we have been communicating  our practices and performance related  to our environmental, social and  governance responsibilities to our  stakeholders with our Sustainability  Report. our 2010 Sustainability Report  covers six main subject areas; namely,  our Approach to Sustainability, Corporate  governance and Risk Management, value  Added to Customers, our employees,   our operations and the environment,  and our Community investment. We  believe our Report documents our  ever-increasing commitment and  performance in the area.  MESSAGE FROM THE CEO Akbank continued its sponsorship to the Carbon  Disclosure Project (CDP) in 2010 and therefore  contributed considerably to the implementation of  this project in Turkey. CDP is a voluntary initiative  carried out in approximately 60 countries worldwide,  with the aim of measuring environmental footprints of  companies and ensuring that they implement carbon  management and assess the issue strategically.  As one of the pioneers in making an internationally  standard greenhouse gas reporting commitment in  Turkey, we, as Akbank, also received scores that carry  us to the world leaders category in our sector with our  CDP 2010 Global 500 reporting. Furthermore, we have  been the first and only Turkish institution to take place  in the global report. In addition to these, our bank  also presents as a signatory member in the report,  together with the worlds most prestigious institutions.  As one of the largest companies in Turkey, we  are aware that we need to assess and audit our  environmental impacts. Our Head Office building and  20 Regional Management buildings, 912 branches,  over 15,300 employees mean not only a huge physical  asset, but also a huge power that believes in change.  The dimensions of our responsibility become evident  when more than 500 suppliers and elements within our  delivery network that offers countrywide services are  also included. In full awareness of this responsibility,  we continue to develop various environmental  projects and programs. We accelerate our efforts to  create programs that raise employee awareness in  areas such as energy conservation, reducing carbon  emissions, and paper conservation.  As we have been doing since the day our Bank was  established, we continue to contribute to social  developments via projects we implement and support  in various areas, including culture and arts, education,  youth, entrepreneurship, and environment. We collected all of our efforts to create customer  and employee satisfaction so far under a For You  philosophy in 2010. With this For You philosophy that  bears signatures of all Akbank employees, we improve  our customer and stakeholder satisfaction-based  banking approach even further. Going beyond being  simply the bank of our customers and stakeholders,  we are their power supplies and supporters. Building  closer relations with our customers and stakeholders,  we closely monitor their needs, expectations, and  questions. With accordingly-devised innovative  products and services, practices and projects, we offer  solutions that improve their quality of life and that  create sustainable values. Having completed 2010 in line with its targets,  our Bank will continue to operate with a customer  satisfaction-based approach, to support the national  economy and the real sector, to create everlasting  values together with all our stakeholders, and to carry  out national and international efforts for a sustainable  environment. I would like to take the opportunity  to extend my gratitude to all our stakeholders who  encourage us to perform better with their feedbacks,  opinions, and support while we are continuing to invest  in the future of our country and the world.

Following our first report which  we prepared absolutely voluntarily in accordance  with the Sustainability Reporting Principles of the  Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and in line with  our stakeholders expectations regarding our  social, environmental, and widespread economic  responsibilities, we have completed our second  sustainability report covering the year 2010.  Our Banks vision, belief, and efforts regarding  sustainability are some of the most concrete  examples of our notion of transparent banking. We  believe that this informative material contributes  to the development of sustainability and corporate  responsibility management initiatives of the private  sector in our country.  This second sustainability report that we prepared  using this approach contains the active role we play in  the economic growth of our country, the value we add  to our customers with our products and services, the  benefits we provide for our employees, our cooperation  with stakeholders to improve social welfare, and our  activities to protect the natural environment. We are  committed to continuously improving our performance  and reporting processes in these areas. We would like to take the opportunity to summarize  the basic steps we took in our second report with  the aim of improving the quality and contents of our  Sustainability Report. We made some significant  changes in the structure, content and design of our  report. In order to improve the quality and readability  of our report, we performed some improvements in the  light of guidelines and principles of GRI, concerning  contents and quality of report. Throughout the report  we paid attention to bringing related themes and  elements together under the same title so that readers  may easily find what they are looking for. In addition,  we showed ultimate care in explaining the information  and data collected on the basis of GRI Indicators in  a comprehensive way that meets our stakeholders  expectations. Although the main sections of this years report are  the same as our first report, subtitles and therefore  issues handled under each section have partly  changed. In Our Approach to Sustainability section  we provided more details on the sustainability  management in our Bank and we also spared a  special part for our Climate Change strategy due to  the materiality of the issue to our Bank. We enhanced  the contents of Corporate Governance and Risk  Management section in a way that covers corporate  profile indicators more comprehensively in line with  GRI's expectations. Most of the information under  the Our Product Responsibility section of the last  years report is now placed under the title Value  Added to Customers. This section was redeveloped  and restructured with a focus on sustainability,  instead of using last years texts containing practices  of our Banks Business Units. In the section about  Our Employees, related issues were gathered under  the same subtitles; information and data in line  with the GRI Indicators were presented in a more  comprehensive way. In Our Operations and the  Environment section, we focused on environmental  impacts of our Banks own activities and operations.  Last but not least, we reorganized Our Community  Investment section in accordance with our  fundamental policy of community investment. The Scope and Framework of the Report Covering our social, environmental and economic  performance and practices between January 1st,  2010 and December 31st, 2010, this report has been  written with the aim of informing our stakeholders  and is based upon GRI G3 Guidelines for Sustainability  Reporting, which is a globally recognized international  reporting standard. The content of the report has been  developed in a way that meets the requirements of GRI  Application Level C and a GRI Index has been placed at  the end of the report in order to ensure easy access to  the information declared accordingly. The statement  from GRI about Akbanks fulfillment of the requirement  of Application Level C is presented at the page 104 of  this report. GRI Guidelines not only allow comparing our  sustainability performance to that of local and  international peers but also create a reference guide for  our stakeholders and guide continuous development of  22  02 ABOUT THE REPORT Akbanks sustainability initiatives. Turkish translation of  GRI Guidelines for Sustainability Reporting can be found  at http://www.globalreporting.org  While determining the scope of our report, in addition  to the GRI Guidelines, requirements of the United  Nations Global Compact (UNGC) of which we are a  signatory have also been taken into consideration.  Our Bank continued to support this global voluntary  corporate initiative in the reporting period of 2010. Four  areas of UNGC (labor, human rights, environment, and  anti-corruption) and the related ten principles have  been implemented with various policies within the  framework of our operations. Our sustainability report  is a Global Compact Communication on Progress  report that also includes the activities and practices  we performed within the scope of our commitment to  UNGC. Boundary of the Report Unless mentioned otherwise, all data and information  in our report covers the banking activities and  operation areas of Akbank T.A.. in Turkey. Impacts  of our activities, our joint ventures or our suppliers in  other countries are not within the scope of this report.  In the Our Employees part of our report, employees  of Malta branch are also included in the total number  of employees. Financial statements and distributed  economic value tables reflect consolidated figures.  Data in Our Operations and The Environment section  cover activities of Akbank T.A.. in Turkey.  In this report, the words Akbank T.A.., our Bank,  the Bank, We/Us all mean Akbank T.A.. unless  mentioned otherwise.  Setting out the Content of the Report Sustainability Reporting Process The content of this report has been created based  upon the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement  Standard devised by AccountAbility which is a UK- based independent institution globally recognized in  developing, managing and implementing stakeholder  engagement strategies. During the preparation  process, in order to identify significant and material  issues for our major stakeholders and corporate  strategies, a number of expectations and needs of  stakeholders were collected via various channels and  our Sustainability Task Force and expert consultants  evaluated these expectations and needs.  For the data in 2010, data and information collection  methods used during the development of 2009 report  were employed. Methods different from those used in  2009 are explained in related sections of the report.  Prepared with contribution from almost all units of our  Bank, this Report was published after being approved  by the Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility  Committee and Board of Directors. 23  02 ABOUT THE REPORT financial  performance Corporate  governance - Risk  Management value Added to  Customers  our employees our Community  investment our operations  and the  environment Sustainable  profitability and  growth Productive  business  processes Customer  satisfaction Environment- focused product  and services financial  literacy Access to  financial  services Secure banking Innovativeness,  new product  development Employee  satisfaction Career  development and training Equal career  opportunities  Carbon  emissions Technologic  wastes  Culture and arts Youth Education Entrepreneurship Transparent  corporate  governance Ethical  banking Efficient risk  management and  internal control Legal  compliance Climate change 24 Our Material Issues   In accordance with the AA1000 standard and GRI G3 Guidelines, this report includes our significant and material  issues in sustainability.

Taking the principle of  equality into consideration, we answer all questions that are not related  to commercial secrets and we ensure that the management and  shareholders are in continuous communication. Our dialogues with this  group of stakeholders are based upon transparency, accountability, and  regular briefings. Through the Corporate Social Responsibility Sub- group within the Investor Relations department, we inform investors on  sustainability issues of environmental, social and economic dimensions.  we are aware that high motivation and satisfaction levels among our  employees are determinant in ensuring long-standing business per- formance in the long-term. we support that our employees proceed  towards the same goals by adopting our common strategies rather  than adapting to a centralized management and by using effective  communication tools. we regularly collect our employees opinions  and expectations via various platforms and we try to bring those  to life. In addition, we organize trainings and briefings to increase  awareness of our employees on various sustainability issues. for  instance, e-training for our Ethical Principles has been offered to use  by all employees with the aim of ensuring that our employees inter- nalize and adopt Akbank Ethical Principles which are updated with  social and environmental factors. Our Stakeholders and Stakeholder Engagement All institutions and corporations that are affected by our Banks activities or that directly or indirectly affect our Banks  performance are our key stakeholders. In full awareness of the fact that stakeholder engagement is the basic  principle in corporate responsibility, we consider expectations and opinions of our key stakeholders while developing and  implementing our sustainability policy and we pay ultimate attention to creating a regular, continuous, and trust-based  communication with them. One of the main reasons for us in developing and publishing this Sustainability Report is to  create a dialogue platform to share our practices that are in line with our stakeholders expectations and opinions.  Our key stakeholders and examples of our dialogue and cooperation with them are presented below.  25  Stakeholder group-based        engagement and dialogue platforms general practices and examples Customers 02 ABOUT THE REPORT international financial institutions legislators and Regulatory Bodies Customer Satisfaction Surveys Akbank Branches Akbank Call Center Akbank website Business development Meetings for      Customers E-mail Briefings Media Activities we Organize and Participate  Local Projects Akbank Art Center Activities  Advertising and Promotion Campaigns 1-to-1 Meetings joint Meetings Teleconferences  Reports Negotiations  Meetings forums and Conferences  Various Task forces Oral and written Notifications declarations  Press News Akbank website Reports Customer satisfaction is the most material issue to us. Opinions and  expectations of our customers inspire us in developing products  and services. In order to ensure and retain customer satisfaction,  we implement numerous practices, from information security to  responsible marketing communication, innovative and environment- friendly products, and supporting customers in business development.  for instance, at the end of trainings given to SME customers to help  them with business development, we hold surveys to learn about our  customers degree of satisfaction and to get their opinion on other  issues they request or need to be handled in future events. Advantageous loans that we obtain from international financial  institutions such as IfC, EBRd, and EIB are mostly climate-friendly  loans that support development. with the aim of building management  systems to monitor environmental and social performances of our  customers in accordance with the loans obtained, we establish  dialogues with these institutions on various platforms.  we thoroughly comply with all related laws and regulations to  ensure the safety of our customers investments. with the aim of  closely following the agenda, identifying trends, timely developing  and adapting our products and services in line with expectations of  customers and legislators, we follow forums, conferences, task forces,  and press news carefully and we organize meetings. we present our  opinions on legislation amendments influencing the banking sector to  related authorities. for instance, we work in intense communication  with the financial Crimes Investigation Board (MASAk) which operates  to prevent laundering proceeds of crime and financing of terrorism  with the aim of ensuring compliance with legal liabilities as well as  with other public institutions.  26  02 ABOUT THE REPORT Stakeholder group-based        engagement and dialogue platforms general practices and examples Business partners  Suppliers university Students local Community Activities we Organize and Participate  Our Arts and Culture Activities Sponsorships Our widespread Branch, ATM and     POS Network Akbank website Press News  Akbank Call Center Local Meetings Meetings Akbank Ethical Principles Press News Akbank website Akbank Ethical Principles Akbank website Meetings Youth Banking Brochures and Promotion Campaigns   Briefings Akbank website Campus Branches Cultural Activities we Organize and     Support (jazz at Campus, Short film     festival) we operate in full awareness of the importance of the finance sector  in sustainable development and we contribute to the development of  local economy with our widespread branch, ATM and POS network  throughout Turkey.

We aim to establish  dialogues with a greater number of stakeholders  by enhancing the influence area of our social  responsibility performance. With our reports, we  intend to communicate the results of this dialogue to  our stakeholders. Through the dialogues established  with stakeholders via various platforms, we receive  feedback on issues that are important to them and  continuously improve our business processes and  performance accordingly.  We implement our Banks sustainability policies  and processes both in our operations and customer  relations, while monitoring our own performance.  With our Sustainability Report published every year,  we communicate our practices and performance  regarding our social, environmental and widespread  economic responsibilities in parallel with the  expectations of our stakeholders from Akbank. Our Sustainability Vision, Strategy, Policy and  Commitments  our Sustainability vision Our sustainability vision below guides Akbank in all  sustainability strategies.   Strong financial performance: A strong long-term  financial performance that creates benefits for all our  stakeholders and lays the foundations of sustainability  is our indispensable target. dialogue with Stakeholders: Our stakeholders  priorities are our priorities. This perspective is the  foundation of Akbanks success and a constant  principle of our sustainability vision.

Corporate sustainability means  a continuous development process to Akbank.  This process covers our entire social and physical  environment. Our targets, as Akbank, have been  set in order to achieve a better understanding  and management of our influence areas form the  foundations of our sustainability strategy. Working to improve environmental, social and  economic welfare of not only todays people, but also of  future generations, Akbank also has corporate values  and a vision that supports its sustainability strategy. Our strategies regarding Climate Change, which we  see as a material issue in sustainability, are mentioned  in a separate section below.  29 our Sustainability policy  Akbank supports Sustainable development by;  Pioneering environmental awareness and  accountability,  Supporting policies based upon dialogue with  stakeholders and transparency,  Meeting competitive expectations with  advanced technology products and services,  following international customer safety  standards and performing better than  expectations,  Encouraging educational, artistic, and  cultural initiatives aimed at social welfare and  development,  Based upon sound financial grounds in terms  of sustainable banking, continuously improving  the target of being a pioneer and a role model  in Turkey.  03 OUR APPROACH TO  SUSTAINABILITY  To continue to put satisfaction-enhancing practices  into effect by regularly measuring customer  satisfaction level via questionnaires  To increase energy conservation and renewable  energy loans offered to customers in the short and  medium-term   To apply Akbanks Environmental and Social Policies  on project financing loans with sums exceeding USd  50 million and those with terms of over five years   To continue to support internationally prestigious  environmental initiatives such as the Carbon  disclosure Project (CdP)   To put the sustainability criteria included in our  purchasing processes into effect, starting with  prominent suppliers in the short term   To continue to closely follow innovations and  developments in information security and to make  the maximum endeavor to take necessary measures  To measure employee satisfaction via annual  questionnaires with the aim of improving our  institution continuously and to set targets that  at least maintain previous years satisfaction  measurement results  To focus on training and development programs that  support employee satisfaction  To continue to sponsor events that reinforce cultural  and artistic insights of our society.  our Sustainability Commitments one indicator of the importance we, as Akbank, attach to sustainability is our short-, medium- and long-term  commitments. These include: Sustainability Management at Akbank BOARD OF DIRECTORS INTERNATIONAL  ADVISORY BOARD  OUR STAKEHOLDERS NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS INITIATIVES MEMBERSHIPS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND  SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY INVESTOR RELATIONS  CORPORATE SOCIAL  RESPONSIBILITY SUB-GROUP CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TEAM OTHER RELATED UNITS OF OUR BANK 30  03 OUR APPROACH TO  SUSTAINABILITY In order to handle sustainability issues in a holistic  manner at the senior management level, a Corporate  Governance and Social Responsibility Committee  (CGSRC) that directly reports to the Board of Directors  was established at Akbank in 2009. Three members of  the eight-member Committee are also members of the  Board. CGSRC meets at least twice a year; however, if  needed, meetings may be held more frequently. In addition to the CGSR Committee, Akbank  International Advisory Board also adds value to  our Banks sustainability vision. Mr. Kemal Dervi,  former Vice President of the World Bank (1996-2001)  and President of the United Nations Development  Programme (UNDP) in 2005-2009, is the Chairman  of the Advisory Board. Among the Advisory Board  members is Lord Nicholas Stern, acknowledged for his  global climate change report entitled Stern Review on  the Economics of Climate Change. Since April 2008  Lord Stern is also the President of Grantham Research  Institute that does researches on climate change  and the environment. Members of the International  Advisory Board are listed in part 4 of this report.  In our Bank, Investor Relations Department (IRD)  is in charge of managing sustainability issues in  coordination with internal and external stakeholders.  In line with this purpose, a Corporate Social  Responsibility Sub-group was established within the  Department in 2010 and a manager was assigned. In  addition, a Sustainability Task Force of all business  units contributing to sustainability reporting operates  under the leadership of the Corporate Social  Responsibility (CSR) Manager.  Sustainability is handled both in a holistic and an  issue-based (theme, subject) manner at our Bank.  Holistic management is implemented by IRD and  supervised by CGSRC. The holistic management covers  issues such as integrating environmental, social  and ethical sustainability issues into our products  and services with a strategic view and developing  sustainability policies. An example is that our banking  and purchasing units internalize sustainability by  integrating environmental and social elements that  are defined as material issues by the Bank into their  own processes and products. Environmental loans for  corporate and SME customers and environmental and  social criteria applied to our suppliers are the results  of our policies within this category.  In addition, there are various social elements handled  by related units within the scope of our general  business management. These cover issues such  as employee performance management, employee  satisfaction, customer satisfaction, and information  security. Although these elements are managed on  the basis of related units, they are included in the  sustainability report due to their influence on our  sustainability performance. By including environmental and social factors into its  Occupational and Ethical Principles, Akbank ensured  that sustainability management becomes a procedure.  Thus, all of our employees are expected to comply with  and adopt the mentioned principles.  Our Bank continues its communication and operations  with external stakeholders at various levels via the  management organs mentioned above. Within the  scope of this approach, our Bank plays an active role in  numerous national and international associations and  initiatives. Akbank Corporate governance and Social  Responsibility Committee Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility  Committee (CGSRC) that reports to the Akbank  Board of Directors was established in 2009 to improve  our corporate performance in corporate social  responsibility and sustainability, to integrate our areas  of responsibility into our decision-making mechanisms,  to increase awareness of sustainability issues among  our employees, and to be able to implement reporting  that is identical to our transparency principle and  in line with the international standards. CGSRC is  responsible for compliance with Akbanks corporate  management principles as well as for monitoring  and managing operations, risks and opportunities  related to our social, environmental and economic  responsibilities.  Among the items in 2010 agenda were assessment of  steps on sustainability to be taken by our Bank in the  future, climate change strategies and action plan, and  social responsibility projects that contribute to the  society. Organization and members of the Committee are  stated below.  31  03 OUR APPROACH TO  SUSTAINABILITY Members of the Corporate governance and Social  Responsibility Committee as of december 31st, 2010   hayri ulhac  Chairman (Vice Chairman and Executive Board  Member) Suzan Sabanc Diner  Member (Chairman and Executive Board Member) Ziya Akkurt  Member (Board Member and CEO) Hakan Binbagil Member (Deputy CEO â€“ Private Banking) Atl zus  Member (Executive Vice President â€“ Financial  Coordination) Bade Sipahiolu Ik  Member (Executive Vice President â€“ Human  Resources) Cenk gksan Member (Department Head â€“ Investor Relations  Department) derya Bigal Member (Director - Akbank Art Center) CGSRC has guided us in implementing and auditing  our sustainability perspective throughout the Bank.  It has ensured that our Ethical and Occupational  Principles which aim to regulate attitudes of all  Bank employees at every level and their relations  with individuals and institutions either inside or  outside the Bank are updated with environmental and  social elements and are applied within the Bank. In  addition, Ethics Line to be used if any violation of these  principles is observed is among procedures to support  sustainability management within the Bank.  Akbank and united nations global Compact The biggest evidence of Akbanks commitment to  universal principles regarding human rights, working  conditions, environment, and a cleaner society is its  signature under the United Nations Global Compact  â€“ one of the important worldwide corporate social  responsibility initiatives. With this signature, we, as  Akbank take responsibilities such as respect for human  rights, providing a safe and healthy work environment,  protecting the nature, offering sustainable values and  benefits to employees and the society by means of  policies and practices that cover transparent corporate  management. We pledge to fulfill our duties in creating  a more humanistic globalization. internal Communication and Awareness  A CSR portal was opened in our intranet system  with the purpose of increasing awareness and  information on sustainability among Akbank  employees; presentations containing related supporting  publications, various information and sample studies  started to be published on this portal at the end of 2009.

Especially since 2009, our Bank has been putting  various activities and practices into effect.  Among the first important initiatives are our sponsorship  for application of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in  Turkey and the steps our Bank took within the framework  of CDP. As a pioneering private sector corporation that  is committed to reporting greenhouse gas emissions  in accordance with the international standards, Akbank  aims to ensure that awareness of other institutions and  corporations in our country on climate change increases  and positive changes are made to reduce emissions while  public awareness is improved.  Climate Change Management  Climate Change issue is handled in the Bank  within the scope of sustainability. Therefore, our  sustainability management approach described above  is implemented in the same direction while also  developing climate change strategies, policies and  actions.    Risk and opportunity Management Human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and risks  caused by Climate Change (which is the result of  such emissions) are discussed at various platforms.  Our Bank is taking all necessary actions to manage  these risks that it foresaw on time in the best way  and to transform them from threats to opportunities.  We are doing the necessary groundwork in order to  follow recently updated legal regulations on energy  efficiency and renewable energy and to comply with  these regulations. In addition, we have started to offer  products and services on relatively favourable terms in  order to encourage our corporate customers to benefit  from opportunities in energy efficiency and renewable  energy. On the other hand, certain measures have  started to be taken within the Bank to measure and  reduce carbon emissions resulting from our operations  and business travels. Carbon Management in our operations  Following our Banks participation in Carbon  Disclosure Project in 2009, the importance of  measuring greenhouse gas emissions of our  operations and mitigation activities has increased.  With the aim of measuring, calculating, reducing, and  monitoring greenhouse gas emissions resulting from  electricity and fuel use in our buildings and from fuels  used in our employees business and training travels,  our Bank has initiated certain internal practices. Data  of greenhouse gas emissions measured and calculated  accordingly are given in detail in Our Operations and  the Environment section of this Report.  our Carbon-focused products and Services In addition to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions resulting from our Banks operations, we  offer various products and services with the aim of  encouraging the customers that we provide loans  to make energy savings and thus to reduce their  greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the fact that such  products and services of our Bank are given in detail  in section Value We Add to Our Customers of this  Report, we can also give as examples here the Akbank  Energy-Friendly Loans and the Carbon Footprint  Project that was put into effect in early 2011 to raise  awareness of our customers.  In 2010, we, as Akbank, put Akbank Energy-Friendly  Loans in order to provide financing for construction  efforts of our customers to save energy. Companies  may use this loan for renewal of their heating,  cooling, electric engines, and lighting systems of  commercial real estates such as their workplaces and  factories; for exterior insulation; and for transition  to environment-friendly energy resources, all with  the aim of increasing energy efficiency and reducing  energy costs. 33  Our 2010 Initiatives  our 2010 Carbon disclosure project (Cdp) Report    Akbanks first CDP report presented to the CDP Global  Secretariat in the United Kingdom in 2010 received a  score of 81 in the 2010 Global 500 report that assesses  reports of 500 companies worldwide. In the Global  Leaders of the Finance Sector Index by CDP that  considers companies with more than 80 points as  leading institutions in carbon disclosure rating, the  highest scores in the finance sector varied between 86  and 93. Signatory to Cancun Communiqu The Cancun Communiqu, drawn prior to the United  Nations Climate Change Summit held towards the end  of 2010 in Cancun, Mexico makes a call to governments  for global cooperation and urgent actions against  Climate Change. While a total of 384 companies  from 35 countries and different industries signed  the Communiqu that was presented to government  representatives in Cancun, Akbank has been the only  Turkish bank to sign the Cancun Communiqu.   Sustainability in the Supply Chain In order to ensure that suppliers of the products and  services we purchase take various environmental and  social standards into consideration, we, as Akbank,  started to work on revising our Supplier Management  policies in 2010. In the light of works done within this  scope, the following elements have been added to our  Ethical Principles and Purchasing Regulations. Akbank;   Pays necessary attention to ensuring that its  suppliers implement all aspects of the United  Nations Global Compact principles that the Bank  has internalized and that it creates required internal  systems to achieve this goal.  Considers the supplier processes that monitor their  social and environmental risks.  Provides opportunities to suppliers that operate  using systems which are more sensitive to the  society and the environment during procurement of  services and products.  With the aim of putting these into effect, we shall  inform our entire supplier portfolio â€“starting with  the largest ones- on Akbanks Ethical Principles and  Corporate Social Responsibility Policies. We plan to  obtain declarations of commitment from suppliers,  stating that they shall comply with Akbanks principles  and policies. In our current Purchasing Regulations there are  criteria for issues including corporate organizational  structures of suppliers, their fulfillment of public  liabilities such as taxes and social payments. In  addition, companies are asked to confirm that they do  not employ child labor and perform such practices. 03 OUR APPROACH TO  SUSTAINABILITY 34 Carbon disclosure project (Cdp)  Carbon Disclosure Project is a global initiative  that was started in the year 2000 with the  purpose of gathering and sharing information to  allow companies, investors, and governments  to take measures against the threat of climate  change. Within the scope of CDP, which aims  to create transparency in greenhouse gas  emissions and to increase public awareness  and consciousness, every year institutions and  corporations report the strategies and policies  they applied in their struggle against climate  change, amount of greenhouse gases they  emitted, their targets to reduce these emissions  to the public and investors. These data and  information are shared with a large audience,  including corporate investors, companies,  public policy leaders, public institutions,  and academicians. As the only independent  international institution to globally report the  way climate change-induced risks are managed  by companies, CDP operates on behalf of 534  corporate investors that manage global assets of  USD 64 trillion.

In this sense,  the Board of Directors is primarily responsible for  the establishment and operation of an efficient risk  management system throughout Akbank. The Board  performs necessary actions to ensure that the Banks  basic approach to risks, risk policies, risk-taking levels  are decided and updated, as well as to make sure that  risk measurement, monitoring and reporting systems  are created. Audit Committee and Executive Risk Committee  established within the Board of Directors assist in  fulfilling and monitoring responsibilities.  Risk Management, Internal Control and Internal Audit  units that report directly to the Board are responsible  for coordination and assessment in achieving the  expected efficiency.  Besides, all units of the Bank are responsible for  compliance with policies and strategies drawn by the  Board, identification of risks related to their own areas  of operation, management of such risks, and taking  necessary actions to keep the risks at the minimum level.  Basic Approach Foreseeing risks and managing them with a  professional proficiency have been one of the most  prominent superiorities in Akbanks corporate culture  since the establishment of the bank. This prudent and  visionary approach towards risk-taking also complies  with our long-term banking strategies. The Banks overall risk strategy is to efficiently manage  all risks within the banks risk profile by prioritizing  them from the viewpoint of materiality. Risk is one  of the material issues to be considered in decisions  regarding capital allocation, portfolio/investment  preferences, positioning, performance rating, and new  product and activity decisions. Risk policies and practices The Banks risk policies are identified in relation to  our long-term strategies and targets as well as to  the quality and volume of activities. Risk policies aim  to analyze and monitor the risk within appropriate  limits and thus include efforts to identify, measure,  consolidate, and manage the risk. Risk Categories Major risk categories that Akbank might be exposed to  while performing its activities and definitions of these  39 non-discrimination: We refrain from prejudices  against customers, suppliers, employees, and  shareholders based on gender, behavior, opinion  or ethnic origin and we do not discriminate against  anyone under any condition or circumstance. Compliance: We abide by all laws, regulations  and standards. Confidentiality: We do not share any information  or details of transactions concerning  shareholders, employees, suppliers and  business partners, and above all personal  information regarding customers with any person  or institution, except with those authorities  with which the sharing of such information is  permitted by law. Transparency: Except for information that is  deemed a commercial secret and not yet disclosed  to the public, we disclose financial and non- financial information on our Bank to the public  in a timely, accurate, complete, comprehensible,  interpretable, and accessible manner. Sustainability: Our Bank aims to contribute to the  economic, social, and environmental development  of the society. In all efforts, practices and  investments of Akbank, we consider not only  our Banks image, benefits, and profitability,  but also social benefits, development of the  banking sector, and continuance of the trust in  the sector; we abide by regulations related to the  environment, consumer and public health.  04 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND  RISK MANAGEMENT AT AKBANK categories are prepared under the coordination of the  Risk Management unit and approved by the Board of  Directors. Risk categories and definitions are regularly  evaluated in terms of competence and updated if  deemed necessary.  Based upon these major risk categories, all Bank  employees also evaluate the risks they may be exposed  to during their own activities and take all required  actions or ensure that such actions are taken based  upon the results of these evaluations. Risk Measurement and Reporting Executive Risk Committee identifies models to be  used in measuring risks that can be expressed in  figures (e.g. loans, interests, market, and liquidity) and  methods to be employed in evaluating risks that cannot  be expressed in this way (e.g. reputation and strategy  risks). In particular, Expected loss, Unexpected  loss and Expected loss under stress data related to  risks that can be expressed in figures are calculated by  the Risk Management department. These activities continued in 2010 and current  practices were improved by monitoring financial and  economic developments in world markets as well as  developments in Basel III principles, other international  regulations in the field of risk management. In  addition, analyses, simulations, scenarios, stress tests,  and other activities play a role in strategic decisions  of the Board of Directors and senior management and  support the decision-making mechanism.  With its qualified and well-equipped staff, the Risk  Management department follows internationally  accepted practices, regulations, and changes in  models to contribute to developing the system. Risk limitations and Management In order for risks to be managed efficiently, limitation  is used as a risk and control tool. Risk limitations are  identified depending on the type and scope of risks and  based upon employee, unit, bank or group and they are  approved by the Board of Directors. Actuality of risk  limitations are examined in line with scenario analyses,  stress tests, and evaluations of related units; updates  are performed when deemed necessary. Limitation method is used especially in the  management of market, interest rate, and liquidity  risks; on condition that the risk limitations approved  by the Board are abided, risks are taken under control  by the Executive Risk, Asset and Liability committees;  and banks positions are determined accordingly.  In addition, hedging strategies are devised against  negative changes.  in credit risks, such risks related to the Banks  products â€“from placements and commitments to  customers to letters of credit- are managed with  assistance from cautious loan policies and procedures  at Akbank. In all transactions, loan quality  (credit  worthiness) of the other party is assessed via an  internal rating system; sector, customer, loan type,  provider segment-based limits are identified; and  compliance with these limits are monitored.  In the management of operational risks, methods  such as control mechanisms, emergency planning, and  insurance are employed in addition to the limitation  mechanism. Risk Management department, Head  of Internal Control, and Board of Internal Auditors  cooperate for risk management. Reputation risk is handled as a significant risk in  terms of sustainability and all Bank employees,  notably the Board of Directors are held responsible  for the management of this risk. Within the scope of  the management of this risk, policies and practices  to be applied throughout the Bank were identified  (including areas such as full compliance with legal  regulations, establishing and exercising a relationship  of confidence with stakeholders, efficient and fast  solutions to customer complaints) and these have  been put down in writing. Our Banks Ethical and  Professional Principles is used as a reference.  Strategy and business risks are managed by the Board  and Asset-Liability Committee. In addition to risks identified for existing products and  activities, risks that may arise from development of  new products and services and that may affect the  Banks overall processes are also evaluated. Probable  risks of newly-developed products or services (loans,  operational, legal, reputation, etc.), methods to be  used in measuring and managing these risks, control  mechanisms to be established are determined with  40  04 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND  RISK MANAGEMENT AT AKBANK contribution from related departments and these  evaluations are documented. After new developments  are submitted together with a comprehensive risk  assessment and approved by the Board of Directors,  necessary actions are taken for risk management. Monitoring and Reporting Risks Reporting is made to the Board of Directors and  Committees within the framework of methods  identified by the Risk Management department and  other related units on the basis of risk category.  Internal Control System Main objective of Akbanks internal control system is  to ensure that the Banks assets are protected, the  Banks operations are performed effectively and in  compliance with legal regulations, and a reliable and  integrated accounting and financial reporting system is  established.  All Bank employees, notably the Board of Directors are  held responsible for the establishment and execution  of an efficient internal control system in the Bank. The  Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in such  activities.  Control environment within the Bank, which is one of  the most important components of an efficient internal  control system is maintained by well-disciplined,  positive and supportive manners. To achieve this goal,  arrangements on major elements such as organization  chart, Ethical Principles, distribution of authority  and responsibility are also performed. All employees  are encouraged to identify and evaluate risks that  may prevent the Bank from possible risks and the  importance of control activities in managing such risks  are continuously emphasized. To achieve this goal,  efficiency of the internal control system is continuously  improved via following some mechanisms, including  Identification of functional differences, separation of  the functions of marketing and operations  Documentation of job definitions and specific  responsibilities in the control system of each  employee of every level  Documentation of all workflows and checkpoints  throughout the Bank  Establishing information systems that are in  compliance with the volume and quality of the Banks  activities  Establishing efficient and comprehensive  communication channels, hearing suggestions  of employees on process and activity issues, and  implementing such suggestions  Opening an Ethics Line for notification of suspicious  transactions. In addition, the Head of Internal Control that reports  directly to the Board of Directors cooperates with  units in performing the required renewals and  revisions in control systems and designing new  control mechanisms; the Head also coordinates and  performs such efforts. The Head of Internal Control  plays an active role especially in redesigning business  processes and identifying checkpoints to be added to  the processes. By means of controls it performs, it also  evaluates efficient performance of checkpoints within  the processes and closely monitors actions taken  regarding findings of controls.  The Head of Internal Control operates together with  competent employees that have their own expertise  in related areas and experience in banking; it also  provides trainings to support professional and personal  development of its employees.  Internal Audit System The Board of Internal Auditors performs audits and  evaluations in order to ensure that the Banks activities  are in accordance with legal regulations and strategies  and policies identified by the Board of Directors;  productivity is improved; service quality is enhanced;  efficiency and competency of the Banks internal  control and risk management systems as well as  corporate governance processes are retained. The Board of Internal Auditors plans and conducts its  operations with a risk-oriented point of view. Thus, it  evaluates possible risks in the branches, affiliates,  subsidiaries, Head Office units and all bank processes.  It also reviews mechanisms and risk systems designed  to manage such risks.  In addition, it investigates  the reliability and integrity of the Banks information  systems and checks whether information is accessed  on time; it performs information security audits based  upon international standards. 41  04 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND  RISK MANAGEMENT AT AKBANK There are also efforts to identify errors and  irregularities within the Bank and to mitigate existing  or probable risks. Both outcomes of special software  used by the Board of Internal Auditors to identify the  irregularities and notifications by legal authorities,  other units of the Bank and customers are examined in  detail and solutions are sought. As a result of audits, not only findings are identified,  but also suggestions to develop the processes,  increase efficiency and strengthen internal systems  are made. Furthermore, actions taken accordingly are  actively monitored.

With this purpose in mind, in 2010 we  initiated the For You campaign which expresses all of  our customer-oriented activities. First and foremost,  For You means listening to our customers and  comprehending their needs and expectations correctly.  The For You campaign is considered as a critical step  in the process of improving communication channels  to understand our customers better and creating a new  product development system. In an era where banking  has become a service to improve users life qualities,  we are aware that we should not only understand our  customers correctly, but also offer a variety of products  and services to meet their diversified expectations. This approach covers not only banking products that  contribute to individuals lives but also large-scale  activities that invest in the future - from culture and  arts activities which contribute to social development  (such as jazz, theater, modern arts, etc.) to projects  that aim to reduce the impact on the environment  (such as the Carbon Disclosure Project). From the smallest branch to the Head Office,  Akbank shall continue to consider the lifestyles of its  customers and the future of the country and to employ  its know-how for the aim of supporting a better life  quality.  While developing and offering services that add value to  our customers in every segment, we, as Akbank, also  take sustainability issues into consideration. Among  current examples of such services and approaches are  environment-focused project finance and loans offered  to our customers; advantageous SME loans provided  to facilitate access to financial services; Freedom  Banking services that we offer via our widespread  network of branches and ATMs; business development  meetings for SMEs; consumer banking practices to  improve financial literacy; and Akbank Environmental  and Social Policies applied to project finance loans.

With the aim of offering more efficient services to  micro-scale companies that form an important part  of the SMEs in Turkey, micro-customers started to  receive customized services at Akbank Consumer  Banking Business Unit in 2010. Our Banks service  model was changed to offer faster and better services  to our micro-customers and a more comprehensive  model was designed. Corporate Banking Akbank Corporate Banking Department serves our  corporate customers, the number of which exceeds  2,600 as of year-end 2010.

As of year-end 2010, number of our SME  customers is approximately 134 thousand.  Akbank undertook a restructuring initiative at the  beginning of 2010 and consolidated the Commercial  Banking and Small Business Banking Departments  under a single roof, entitled the SME Banking. Under  the new organization, Akbank continues to serve via  22 Commercial Branches while commercial banking  services were expanded countrywide by appointing  Commercial Customer Relationship Managers (CRM)  to 143 Retail Branches by the end of 2010.

Customers can also execute their Istanbul  Stock Exchange and TURKDEX transactions through  resident dealers in the branches. 47  05 VALUE ADDED TO  CUSTOMERS Responsible Practices in Corporate and       SME Loans Loans that we, as Akbank, provide are allocated for  the financing of projects by our corporate or SME  (commercial or small business) customers. Since  2010, Akbank Environmental and Social Policies are  implemented for project finance loans exceeding USD  50 million and with a term of over five years. In addition  to these Policies, compliance with a variety of social  and environmental performance criteria are sought  for finance obtained from international financial  institutions, depending on the source of the loan. Akbank's Environmental and Social Policies,  Processes and Risk Management Applied to Loans Akbanks environmental and Social policies  For managing probable environmental and social risks  and opportunities that can be experienced in projects  of our customers which exceed USD 50 million and  with a term of over five years, Akbank Environmental  and Social Policies were developed and put into effect  in 2010. Despite the fact that project finance loans  are provided for financing projects of customers in  the corporate and SME segment in principle, most  loans are provided for customers in the corporate  and commercial segments since these projects are  generally large-scale and have a long term. The mentioned policies and practices can be  summarized as below.  Pursuant to Akbanks Environmental and Social  Policies, we pay due attention that all elements stated  in the United Nations Global Compact are implemented  by the customers that we grant loans. For instance,  businesses that are proved to employ child labor are  not granted any loans. In accordance with our Policies,  considering that a project may cause severe and  important impacts on the environment, we request  submission of Environmental Impact Assessment  (EIA) reports or proof of exemption from EIA in  financing projects in sectors within the scope of the  Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations.  Pursuant to our policies, loans are not granted for  projects that are proven to have severe and negative  impacts. For instance, EIA approval certificate is  a prerequisite for granting loans for long-term  infrastructure projects that have a high level of impact  on the environment, such as hydroelectric power  plants (HEPPs).  If EIA reports and approval mechanisms are  implemented on all HEPP projects by the state,  independent of the projects capacity or installed  capacity, our Bank can use this report as a prerequisite  for loans. During project examinations performed by  the engineers team of our Loans Business Unit, HEPP  projects that are exempt from EIA pursuant to the  former regulations, but are strongly opposed by local  communities due to probable threat to the nature are  evaluated taking these factors into account and finance  requests of some projects are rejected. On the other hand, if any risks become clear in projects  where negative environmental impacts cannot be  foreseen, our Bank can provide support for our loan  customer in making improvements.  Also in some project finance loans, in-situ checks are  conducted in the construction phase and compliance  with occupational health and safety standards are  monitored via accident and death statistics. In addition,  Construction All Risks Insurance is requested as a  prerequisite for loans in all HEPP projects and it is  mandatory that accident and death compensations are  paid with this insurance.  Our policies have been developed in a manner that not  only prevents social and environmental risks, but also  covers environmental opportunities. Our Bank gives  priority to providing loans for projects that improve  environmental conditions, such as renewable energy  investments, waste recycling investments or those which  reduce carbon emissions or improve energy efficiency. Environmental and Social Risk Management of Loans Our Banks Environmental and Social Policies applied  to project finance loans are adopted by all employees  of the department who play a role in loan decisions.  Our Branches and Pre-Credit Committee of the  General Directorate are responsible for evaluating  compliance with the policies and developing required  action plans. When our Branches make offerings for projects  exceeding USD 50 million and with a term of over five  48  05 VALUE ADDED TO  CUSTOMERS years, we define environmental and social risks of the  project -if any- and confirm compliance of the project  to our policies. While evaluating the loan offer and  the project, the Pre-Credit Committee of the General  Directorate examines the issues stated in the offer. If  actions to prevent the defined risks are not to be taken  by the customer, the Committee rejects the loan offer.  If a current loan in our portfolio is against our Policies,  Pre-Credit Committee informs the Credits Committee,  which is the supreme committee, and necessary  evaluations are made.   Environmental and Social Risk Management  Processes  The company applying to our branch for project  finance loan is requested to submit an EIA approval  or exemption certificate.   If EIA documents are not submitted to our branch  during application, submittal of the related  documents are included in the loan contract as a  prerequisite for providing loans.   After the loan application file is approved by the  branch and related Business Unit, the EIA report  is examined in detail by the Technical Team of the  Loans Business Unit.   While visiting the field, the Loans Business Unit team  also inspects issues related to the EIA report and  unless there are discrepancies, the loan is approved  on condition that other aspects are also suitable for  loans.  Projects that are exempt from EIA are also examined  by the engineers team of the Loans Business Unit.  Before approval of such projects, location of the  project, the projects impact on local communities,  and opinions of not only the central administration,  but also local administration and courts of law are  inspected.  Criteria Applied to loans pursuant to  international financial institutions Depending on the source of the loan, our customers  are expected to abide by various social and  environmental performance criteria for financing  provided by international financial institutions. For  instance, our customers that we provide loans via  International Finance Corporation (IFC) should  comply with Akbank Social & Environmental  Management System (SEMS). This System is  developed for identifying, evaluating, and managing  social and environmental risks of transactions in SME  and corporate segments and is based upon IFCs  internationally recognized performance standards. Within the framework of such operations, there are  plans to assign a coordinator and a committee to  manage the SEMS in our Bank. The SEMS coordinator  and committee members will be selected among  representatives of various business units (loans,  marketing and sales management, international  banking, corporate social responsibility business  unit). As job definitions of committee members and  the SEMS process vary depending on the funding  International Financial Institution, criteria will be  defined and implemented according to the related  institution. In addition to IFC, for loans that we obtain from  European Investment Bank (EIB) and European  Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),  compliance with a variety of social and environmental  factors are expected from both our Bank and our  customers using the loans. Our customers undertake  to perform and manage projects financed via EIB  in accordance with the Turkish Environmental  Regulations. In case the Turkish Environmental  Regulations do not meet the EU Law thoroughly or the  Court of Justice of the European Communities reaches  such a resolution, our customer undertakes to comply  with the EU Environmental Law that covers measures  to be taken for protection of the vegetation, air, soil  structure, soil, water, cultural heritage, and physical  environment. Similarly, in projects that we finance via  loans from EBRD, compliance with criteria brought  together under 10 main titles including Environmental  and Social Evaluation and Management, Labor Force   and Working Conditions, Prevention and Mitigation  of Pollution, Public Health, Safety and Security is  sought. While fulfilling these criteria, methods such  as field visits, communication with local communities  regarding projects, examining the EIA report are  employed.  Environment-Focused Project Finance Loans In terms of environment-focused project financing,  our Bank attaches priority to providing loans for  49  05 VALUE ADDED TO  CUSTOMERS projects that improve environmental conditions, such  as renewable energy investments, waste recycling  investments or those which reduce carbon emissions  or improve efficiency.  energy-friendly loans Developing financial products and services that  support initiatives to reduce the pressure of production  and consumption on the natural environment is an  issue that our Bank attaches importance to. Akbank  obtains loans from both its own resources and  international financial institutions for the financing of  energy efficiency and renewable energy and offers a  variety of loan opportunities for its customers. Akbank Energy-Friendly Loan is used generally as  an investment and operation capital loan for the  financing of heating, cooling, renewal of lighting  systems, insulation of facades and conversion to  environment-friendly energy sources of commercial  real estates such as factories. Available especially  for shopping malls, hospitals, hotels, cold storage  houses, laundries, restaurants, and bakeries, this type  of loan is a significant support in ensuring businesses  to achieve progress in protecting and recovering the  environment, using non-fossil renewable energy  sources, and improving energy efficiency.  As Akbank, we continued to contribute to the  development of the energy sector in Turkey; to  encourage businesses to consider environmental  protection during activities; and to finance especially  renewable energy generation projects in 2010. In  this context, Wind Energy Power Plant (WEPP) and  Hydroelectric Power Plant (HEPP) projects constitute  an important part of our loan portfolio. In 2010, USD 2.3  billion financing was provided for such projects of our  customers. Within the framework of the same goals, our Bank  obtained loans amounting to USD 135 million from  IFC and EBRD in 2010. Loans obtained from IFC are  planned to be employed in supporting energy efficiency  and renewable energy financing for SMEs.  Sustainable Energy Finance Loan (Sustainable Energy  Financing Facility -TurSEFF- Program) obtained  from EBRD aims to support businesses in reducing  energy costs, use of fossil fuels, and greenhouse  gas emissions. Within the scope of the TurSEFF  Program, loans with a maximum term of seven years  are provided for the financing of industrial energy  efficiency, thermal rehabilitation of buildings, and  renewable energy investments, including geothermal,  solar, biomass, and biogas. As a requirement of this  program, companies that would like to invest in energy  efficiency or renewable energy projects are expected  to meet certain performance criteria such as over 20%  energy savings in projects regarding energy efficiency  in industrial and commercial operations or over 30%  savings in projects regarding energy efficiency in the  construction sector.  Our Products and Services to Support SMEs Importance of SMEs is evident in the economic  indicators of Turkey. Currently, over 99% of businesses  are SMEs. A significant portion of total employment  and exports is created by SMEs. Therefore, we consider  SMEs to be vital for the economy and act accordingly.  As Akbank, our aim is to create value for our SMEs  by developing innovative products and services,  holding briefings, and establishing cooperation. With  all relevant activities that we perform, we make a  call to SMEs: All SMEs That Seek Growth! Akbanks  Expertise Is There For You...  Special Funds for SMEs  With the aim of meeting financing needs of SMEs,  cooperation was made with a variety of institutions  and funds were obtained from low-cost sources; thus,  new, affordable and long-term funds were developed.  Examples of such funds (KOSGEB, Undersecretariat of  Treasury, European Investment Bank) provided in 2010  are given below.  50 An example of energy-friendly loans Investment of  ah Wind Energy Power Plant by  Aaolu Energy Group was financed within the scope  of our Energy-Friendly Loans. Financed with a loan  amounting to EUR 62.7 million and having a total term  of 8 years, this project will contribute approximately  10% to the nationwide installed wind energy power of  around 1,000 MW at 33 existing projects.   05 VALUE ADDED TO  CUSTOMERS Cooperation with koSgeB  In an effort to support the investments of SMEs,  increase their exports and help them grow, Scale  Indexed Growth Support Credit Program and Export  Support Credit Program were provided for SMEs.  Scale Indexed Growth Support Credit Program  prepared as a six-month non-refundable commercial  loan with the remnant to be paid in equal installments  or as a periodic payment with a 18-month term and the  Export Support Credit Program prepared as a six- month-term spot exports loan provided a significant  interest advantage for SMEs. In these loan programs  75% of the interest sum is paid by KOSGEB (Small and  Medium Industry Development Organization) and the  remaining 25% is paid by the companies. Cooperation with the Turkish prime Ministry  undersecretariat of Treasury for provinces with  priority in development Akbank offers Loans with Interest Support from the  Treasury to SMEs for their investments within the  priority development in provinces III and IV and also  for their R&D and environmental investments.

Secure Banking  Security in banking products and services means  confidentiality and safety of customer information and  forwarding problems experienced with regard to the  use of the products to the concerned departments in  the most sound, most risk-free and quickest manner  possible, and solving them. Akbanks responsibility  in this regard begins as soon as the product is sold  and continues for the entire life cycle of the product  or service. Any trouble experienced in any phase could  result in customer loss and affect the reputation of  our Bank adversely. Therefore, it is our duty to ensure  customer satisfaction on secure use at all phases. Information Security  The principle of secure banking is a cornerstone  especially in our credit card services as well as  internet and telephone banking. To ensure maximum  monetary security of our customers, these systems  are protected with high-level security measures.  Regarding actions to be taken by our customers with  the purpose of providing the required level of security,  we strive to increase awareness of our customers and  announce things to consider on our website.  http://www.akbank.com/guvenlik-uyarilari-2392.aspx  (This website is available only in Turkish.) In addition to these measures, our Bank established  security committees in order to develop suggestions  and to make strategic decisions to the end of  continuously monitoring technology-based threats in  services offered to our customers through branches  and alternative delivery channels and to prevent,  minimize and stop internal and external technology- based threats targeting our Bank. The Security Committee offers various solutions to  foresee potential fraud threats and to remove current  risks. Meeting at least once a month with a certain  agenda and chaired by the Executive Vice President  â€“ Information Technologies, this Committee offers  solutions and draws informative or approval reports  for the supreme Committee when necessary. Supreme  Committee of Security monthly monitors suggestions  of the Security Committee to prevent potential fraud  and if necessary, meets to discuss and resolve the  issues on the agenda. Supreme Committee of Security  directly reports to the CEO. Committee members are  Executive Vice Presidents. Security Measures for Alternative delivery  Channels All Alternative Delivery Channels of Akbank are  systemically protected with high-level security  measures to provide maximum financial security for  customers. In order to ensure that these security  measures are taken at the required level, information  to be paid attention to by our customers is published  on the internet and a careful read is recommended. Mobile password: A number of transactions including  money transfers such as bank transfers and EFTs,  Credit Card Transactions and Donations performed  via Consumer and Corporate Internet Branches and  Consumer Telephone Branch is carried out via a  Mobile Password sent to the customers mobile phone  through a Mobile Short Message.  Mobile Signature: Many transactions such as Money  Transfers, Credit Card Transactions and Donations  carried out through the Akbank Consumer Internet  Branch and MobileBranch can be conducted through a  Mobile Signature.  ip / iSp Restriction: Access to our Internet Branch can  be limited to IP addresses specified by our customer  or via certain Internet Service Providers (ISPs) by using  the ISP restriction function. date / Time Restriction: Our customers can limit their  log-on to the Internet Branch only to dates and times  specified by them.  MobileBranch Security Measures: Our customers  can log on to the MobileBranch only via mobile phones  registered with our Bank and with a mobile signature,  wap otp/sms link. The last date on which the customer  logged-on to the MobileBranch is shown on the main  page. smsBranch Security Measures: In order to be  able to transfer money over the 4425 smsWallet  application, which is a part of the 4425 smsBranch  service, customers should have identified their secure  telephones. Security practices in the Call Center: At Akbank Call  Center, in order to ensure the security of our Bank  and of our customers, there are various authorization  levels and security measures in all applications in  which the customer is contacted. All calls to our  Customer Representatives are recorded and when the  call is terminated, customer information becomes only  partially visible in order to avoid any transactions beyond  the demand of the customer. Parameters used in  identity confirmation vary depending on the risk level of  transactions. Confidential information such as password  etc. used in identity confirmation is never received  orally by the customer representative and customers  are transferred to the Voice Response System to  enter their passwords. In addition, with the purpose  of minimizing risks in monetary transactions, extra  measures such as transaction-based limits to sums or  maximum number of transactions are applied. Measures are implemented against fraud; such attempts  are shared with the security units and all issues are  monitored through call listening and evaluation methods.  While all transactions are recorded and reported,  duplicating any information belonging to the customer  is controlled and third parties are not provided with any  information in any way. Security Measures for Credit Cards   Our Bank employs a variety of control and security  applications aimed at well-informed use of credit  cards. These are summarized below.  Sector-based expenditure in Business Cards:  Business cards can be closed to expenditures in  certain sectors by the user business. encrypted Shopping (Chip&pin): Through Chip&PIN,  we, as Akbank encourage our customers to use  PINs while shopping and especially emphasize this  in our communication channels. 92% of our credit  card transactions are carried out with PINs and  our customers are sent a warning SMS after each  transaction carried out without the use of a PIN.  Through these measures, a significant decrease was  achieved in credit card fraud rates. Shopping with virtualCard: In order to ensure that  online shopping is more secure, we offer our customers  the opportunity to have a credit card with zero (0) limit.  Thanks to this practice, our customers can create a  limit in accordance with the expenditure just before  the transaction is made. Thus, card limit will again be  zero after the shopping. In addition, since the card is not  physically issued and car information is different from that  of physical credit card, shopping becomes more secure. informing cardholders of suspicious transactions: Our  cardholders transactions are tracked on-line through  special software and in cases considered suspicious,  our customers are called and informed and, if  necessary, their credit cards are blocked. Confidentiality of Customer Information Pursuant to our Ethical Principles, customer information  that we have due to our position is strictly not used for  other purposes. In line with our responsibility in ensuring  the confidentiality of customer information, we keep  such information secure and share it only with legal  authorities. If any employee resigns from the Bank for  any reason, he/she cannot take personal and financial  information out of the Bank.

Customer Satisfaction In all of our services and in each moment of contact with  our customers, we aim to provide a maximum level of  customer satisfaction. Our intense efforts to achieve this  important goal can be summarized as follows:    Training and awareness of employees,   Monitoring service quality levels offered by our  branches and other delivery channels,   Ensuring satisfaction after customers contact with  our Bank and use of reporting systems,   Taking actions to improve and develop areas that are  suitable.

Business process Management  In order to achieve efficiency in delivery channels that  are in contact with our customers and to increase  productivity in related operational processes, these   05 VALUE ADDED TO  CUSTOMERS 67 processes should be examined in detail. With this  purpose, Akbank adopted the Business Process  Management (BPM) approach as a business process  management methodology. With this approach,  thanks to all elements evaluated in a holistic manner  (especially information technologies, data, organization  and product), customers needs are met more  efficiently and fast. On the other hand, with the Process  Restructuring Project implemented as an extension  to this approach, required system development and  infrastructure improvement works are performed. Customer Satisfaction Survey Our customers can inform us on their expectations  from our services by calling Akbank Call Center or via  email or fax. In addition to these, our regular customer  satisfaction surveys also form an efficient customer  feedback platform. Monthly and annual customer  satisfaction surveys are performed both to measure  the expectations of customers of various segments and  to identify our strengths and areas to be improved. Results of the Customer Satisfaction Survey In 2010, we held our Customer Satisfaction Surveys with  the participation of approximately 6,000 people selected  in accordance with our active customer distribution in a  variety of cities and regions in Turkey.

In addition to having fast-operating and easy-to-use  programs employed in delivery channels that our  Customers make direct transactions, aspects including  the comprehensible nature of forms and reports have  significant influence on customer satisfaction. In  order to provide ease of use during development of  the mentioned services, needs of our customers and  employees are identified via surveys.

Performance Management System (PMS) Akbank uses a transparent and flexible performance  system that keeps fair evaluation factors in the  foreground, responding to changing needs and  remaining receptive to developments. Adopting a performance-based management  approach, Akbank shapes its organizational  development accordingly. For the sake of continuation  of our success and development, all our employees go  through  performance evaluation once a year.  As a result of this performance evaluation, areas of  development are identified for our employees and  various trainings are organized in these areas to  support their career development. These evaluations  and trainings allow us to determine employees  competence in a variety of roles and responsibilities.  Our employees can also be recruited in business units  other than their current functions in order to create  business diversity.  71 Employee turnover rates depending on the age group are given in the table below.

The criteria of the Akbank Performance Management  System are goals and competences. The types of  goals and competences in the performance forms,  their weights and numbers are determined through  projects conducted jointly by Akbank Business Units  and Human Resources Business Unit. The performance  period covers a term of one year. The Operations and  Digital Scorecard measurements as part of PMS are  conducted twice a year at 6 month intervals. Performance ratings of our Banks Senior  Management is made by considering both our Banks  year-end performance and success criteria that  support long-term sustainable performance. With this  purpose, Balanced Scorecard is used in our Bank.  Performance of Senior Management is measured with  Financial, Customer, Internal Processes, and Human  Resources perspectives. Therefore, in the goals and  success indicators of our Senior Management, social  performance criteria such as customer satisfaction,  employee satisfaction rates, employee turnover rates  are also used in addition to the financial criteria. Benefits to Employees Akbank Staff Retirement Fund Trust All of our working and retired personnel and their  dependents are registered at the Akbank Staff  Retirement Fund Trust, independent of Turkeys Social  Security Agency. Their pension funds are paid by this  Fund and health needs of both our working and retired  personnel and their dependents are met in better  conditions than those offered by the Social Security  Agency.   Retirement The Trust is a social security institution as a legal  person that provides social insurance support to  members using the insurance premiums collected  from employees and employer, with the provided  rights not being inferior to those provided by the Social  Security Agency. Conditions for earning the right to benefit from  insurance support are in parallel with legal  regulations; however, with additional rights inherent in  the Trusts status, this support is improved.  Premium revenues of the Trust are 33.5% of the  employee salary, on condition that it is within the  maximum monthly revenue identified by the law  annually for insurance premiums (TL 4,943.40 for the  second half of 2010). 14% of this is deducted from the  employees salary and 19.5% is the contribution of  employer. In addition, premiums amounting to 2% of  total revenues of employees in a year are deposited by  the employer to the Trusts account, again on condition  that these are within the stated limits. The right to benefit from retirement is earned by  employees, depending on a certain period of insurance,  number of days that premium is paid, and the age  of the employee - all initiating on the first day of  employment. Employees who fulfill these three  conditions are provided with pension by the Trust upon  their demand.  In calculating the pension, basic parameters are the  working period of the employee, revenues within  this period and age, as well as consumer price index  change rates and development rates in our country.  72  06 OUR  EMPLOYEES Due to such variable parameters, monthly pensions  may differ for each employee. health Care Services  Since the day of establishment, our Bank offers its  employees a safe working environment and a variety of  opportunities to meet health care needs.  Members of Retirement Fund Trust who reside in cities  where we have health centers can apply to the physicians  in these centers to be treated. Members in other cities  can get services from the physicians we employ; if  specialized treatment or operation is needed, they can  receive these services at the public or private health  institutions that have an agreement with our Trust.    Akbank Private Pension System with  Corporate Contribution Akbank employees are also offered Private Pension  System (PPS) Services with some corporate  contribution. Senior and mid-level managers and  auditors are also included in this PPS plan with  corporate contribution. Our Bank contributes to  savings of employees by making additional payments to  the PPS contracts of the above-mentioned employees  in a certain ratio of their monthly gross salary. It  is assumed that this contribution helps to improve  motivation and loyalty of our employees. Participation in the plan is voluntary. The aim of the  plan is to ensure that employees continue with the  same life quality as today when they are retired.  Employee loyalty and motivation is very important to  Akbank. Therefore, we attach a special importance to  the PPS with corporate contribution. PPS programs  are carefully monitored by our Human Resources  Business Unit and there are efforts to increase the  number of employees participating in this plan.    Collective Bargaining Agreement In our Bank, all employees can become members of  BANKSS (Union of Bank and Insurance Employees)  on their own preferences and exercise their rights of  collective bargaining agreement.  54% of our employees (8,209 people) are within the  scope of collective bargaining agreement. The collective  bargaining agreement covers some rights such as  death benefits, natural disaster benefits, disability  compensation, death and injury compensation, and  emigration compensation for personnel moving to  another city. In addition, employees expecting babies  are allowed sixteen weeks of paid leave â€“ eight weeks  before and eight weeks after the delivery. Fathers are  also given three-day paid leave. Akbank Pension Fund  Trust meets child delivery costs of employees and  provides a variety of support.   Employee Health and Safety With regards to our area of operations, occupational  diseases or workplace accidents are not experienced  in our Bank. Yet, the total absenteeism (lost days)  of 4,855 employees who got sick leaves with official  health reports in 2010 amount to 40,092 days (calendar  day). Average sick leave per person, calculated by  finding the ratio of this figure to average number of  employees, is 2.61. In 2009, this ratio was recorded as  2.72 days.  Information on epidemics or other important diseases  is regularly given at the Health Column published  on the Akbank Staff Pension Fund Trust (AKSandk)  webpage. In cases of emergency, information is spread  via e-mail. (www.akteksan.net) First aid training is  given for the health and safety of Akbank employees.  In-class training on this subject is given to the number  of employees stipulated by law, and other employees  are trained through e-learning. The ventilation systems in our branches are installed  to provide 100% fresh air and heat recovery. With  these systems that undergo regular maintenance, our  employees are protected against diseases arising from  allergic reactions. In this way  not only our offices  air quality meets the stipulated values of respective  standards  but also energy is saved by preventing  uncontrolled air flow. The Bank of Learners and Teachers: Career  Development and Trainings at Akbank Supporting the development of Akbank employees and  creating motivation and job satisfaction are two of the  main goals of our Bank. Through its well-developed  human resources applications, Akbank creates an  environment in which employees can develop in  73  06 OUR  EMPLOYEES line with their potentials and preferences; the Bank  also plans different duties and responsibilities that  employees may undertake within the organization.  In Akbank, where career paths are clearly defined,  employees are offered flexible and diversified  opportunities. Supporting the development of all employees and  increasing motivation and work satisfaction is targeted  through the training system, which has a strategic  importance in the Akbank Human Resources policy. Akbanks Training System With full awareness of the fact that knowledge is  an important asset for our employees and well- equipped human resource is a strong competitive  advantage, Akbank performs trainings that contribute  to employees personal and professional development.  Trainings vary every year depending on Akbanks  strategies, sector needs, and development areas of  employees. The training requirements of Akbank Branch and Head  Office employees are determined in conformity with  the related Business Units. During these consultations,  not only overall goals and strategies of our Bank,  but also goals and strategies of Business Units are  discussed and budgets are made. The annual training  plan and budget are forwarded to the Akbank executive  management for opinion and approval; the plan and  budget can be updated within the year, in accordance  with emerging needs. The training requests brought directly by Akbank  employees and executives before our Training  Department in connection with their fields of  development are also examined and answered. The goal of the Akbank training system is to  enable Akbank employees to perform their current  jobs successfully and to prepare them for the  responsibilities required by more senior positions  before they get there. Employees participate in career  and certification trainings for their current duties, and  are admitted to the specially designed Candidate Pool  for the duties for which they are candidate for.  Additionally, Management Trainees, branch and Head  Office employees at the assistant status who have just  started work and will be having their first experience in  the banking sector attend the Management Trainee  and Basic Banking programs. The aim of these  applied and practice-oriented trainings is to build  corporate culture and loyalty among our employees  from the first day. At the Management Trainee  program that lasts six months, in-class trainings  are supported by e-learning and the program is also  supported with branch and Head Office internships.  In addition, Management Trainees follow a 1-year  mentorship program and both mentors and mentees  are trained so as to get ready for this process. Akbank employees may transmit their opinions, ideas  and suggestions concerning the training they have  received, primarily through the online questionnaires  filled in at the end of the training. Our employees, who  can also send their questions, requests, suggestions  and opinions with regard to all trainings through  the e-mail address egitim@akbank.com, can share  their thoughts on e-learning programs using the  send message function on the training portal. All  questionnaire results are carefully evaluated by the  Training Department and necessary actions are taken. Our Training Programs  Akbanks training programs include starting work,  candidate pool, career, certificate programs,  restructuring trainings, project-based trainings  and management skills development trainings. The  competence levels of employees are developed  through remote learning (e-learning and video  conferencing) that supports personal and professional  development and on-the-job training methods as well  as in-class lectures.  A total training of 993,004 hours was completed as  of December 31st, 2010 and average training per  employee was 9.46  work days. Total training time  increased 7% compared to 2009.   74  06 OUR  EMPLOYEES Anti-Corruption Trainings The banking sector is among the largest with its  number of employees, customer potential, and  business volume. The scale of the sector and intensity  of monetary transactions causes a number of risks.  Corruption is the most important of these risks.

Corporate portal    A Corporate Portal was established in order to  facilitate access to information and increase internal  communication for all employees, including over  900 branch employees all around Turkey. With this  portal, all announcements and information were  brought from printed media to the intranet system.  Our employees have access to the information they  seek, from different locations, immediately and  with the use of keywords. Thus, not only employee  satisfaction increases, but also time and labor losses  are prevented.

Being a part of the Akbank family   The Being a Part of the Akbank Family  communication platform on our corporate portal is  one of the most important tools we use to reinforce  communication with our employees.  This platform  was launched in April 2009 in order to offer employees  exclusivities of being part of the Akbank family. Being  79  06 OUR  EMPLOYEES a part of the Akbank family is something that brings  the pleasure of achieving goals together, the positive  reflection of having fun, and the joy of being together  to the quality of our work. Under titles such as special  company campaigns for Akbank members and  privileges, campaigns specially designed for Akbank  employees are announced and the privilege of being a  part of Akbank is emphasized. Some titles from Being Part of the Akbank Family:  Awards received by our Bank: Important awards are  shared with our employees on the page Being a Part  of the Akbank Family.  Feedback from Customers: Positive feedback on our  employees is shared under this title.  Social Activities: Activities that Akbank employees  participate can be followed on this page.  Board of Pride and Joy: Successful employees are  introduced under this title.  Special for the Akbank Family: Special advantages  for Akbank members are shared with our employees  under this title.  Akbank in the Press: Press news about our Bank is  shared with employees.   Mechanisms for employee opinions and  Suggestions Feedback from employees to senior management  is encouraged via meetings and several internal  communication channels. For instance, employee  suggestions collected through the Suggestion  System on the Corporate Portal are meticulously  evaluated and concluded. In addition, an Ethics  Line has been established to enable employees to  express issues they believe they cannot solve within  their departments or they somehow refrain from  sharing with their colleagues and managers in the  department; to support employees in such cases; and  to provide consultancy when necessary. Our Employee  Satisfaction Survey is another active feedback  mechanism. With this survey, our employees enjoy the  opportunity to share their expectations, opinions and  suggestions with the Banks management. Internal Activities    Activities and sports events are organized to bring  employees together out of the office with the aim of  reinforcing team spirit. By ensuring participation of  our employees to activities that our Bank sponsors,  we hope to serve the sense of loyalty. Our objective in  such activities is to establish efficient and productive  relations among our employees. Some of the internal activities we held in 2010 are  listed below.  January 2010: At the 1. Akbank Children Festival,  employees came together with their families.   March 2010: Akbank members received Basic Art  Training in Photography.  April 2010: Akbank sailing team was established to  teach sailing to employees form various departments  and then to support participation in races.   May-June 2010: A Streetball Tournament was  organized for Akbank employees.   June 2010: With a draw, 25 fortunate Akbank  employees won the opportunity to see the Sonisphere  Festival that we sponsored.   July 2010: Akbank employees donated blood within  the scope of the Red Crescents Blood Donation  campaign.  Summer of 2010: TEAMNETA sailing team which  was first established in 2007 within the Information  Technologies Business Unit today attends races with  its nine permanent and four substitute members.  Sponsored by Akbank in its first years, TEAMNETA  sail team won three trophies in 2010.  September 2010: With a draw, 15 fortunate Akbank  employees won the opportunity to go to the U2  concert.  December 2010: With a draw, 10 fortunate Akbank  employees won invitations to the Cirque du Soleil  show.  December 2010: 40 Akbank employees won the right  to attend Akbank Arts Modern Dance Workshop.  December 2010: LSEV (Foundation for Children with  Leukemia) and UNICEF opened a stand at Akbank.  Our employees supported these institutions by  purchasing their products. 80  06 OUR  EMPLOYEES Employee Satisfaction Our employees happiness, their loyalty to our Bank,  and maintaining a strong team spirit are important  factors supporting us in achieving goals and  maintaining permanent success. Our human resources  policy based upon equal career opportunities, our fair  and performance-based salary policy, our training  system that attaches importance to employees career  development and training, and our practices focused  on an active internal communication and activities are  all aimed to improve employee satisfaction. Measuring,  monitoring, and improving the level of employee  satisfaction are also material issues for Akbank.  With this in mind, Akbank used to conduct Employee  Satisfaction Survey for all employees once every two  years, and as of 2010, this survey is held annually. In 2010, using the analyses made on the results of the  Employee Satisfaction Survey which was performed by  a completely independent company on a confidentiality  basis and applied via a certain infrastructure, each  Business Unit received the required feedback. Based  upon the analyses of these feedbacks, action plans  were made to retain successful elements and improve  those that need to be developed. For instance, feedbacks regarding reinforcement of  internal communication and increasing the number  of social activities were received; Being a Part of the  Akbank Family concept was created based upon such  feedbacks. A number of social activities are performed  within this concept and announced to employees via  the Being a Part of the Akbank Family sub-portal on  the Corporate Portal. In addition to Akbank Employee Satisfaction Survey,  regular regional visits are conducted and our  communication channels are kept open through  collective and one-to-one interviews between Business  Units, management teams and human resources  specialists and employees. 81  OUR OPERATIONS AND  THE ENVIRONMENT AKBANK SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2010  07 Our Operations and the Environment As a company operating in the service sector, Akbanks  impact on the environment is significantly limited  compared to that of the production sector. Yet there  are certain environmental impacts resulting from  activities of Akbanks employees, the Banks branches  and operations. Among the environmental elements  that Akbank pays attention to are energy consumption  and the related greenhouse gas emissions. Paper  use and technological wastes are also important  issues for our Bank and therefore they are monitored  among environmental indicators. Each environmental  aspect is monitored by using appropriate quantitative  indicators and a variety of practices are performed  within the Bank to reduce these negative impacts.    Our Environmental Policy Akbank is pioneering the Turkish banking sector  by making a commitment to carry out projects to  minimize the negative impact that its activities have on  the physical environment. Our bank has adopted the  following methods as its environmental principles in  carrying out this policy:   Working to achieve efficient use of natural resources  and to minimize waste caused by our processes  Establishing international cooperation to support  transparency policies that will reduce the emission of  greenhouse gases  Supporting recycling and reuse activities for our  employees and all of our key stakeholders and  making efforts to increase awareness on this subject  Initiating awareness activities in order to reduce the  environmental impacts of our activities  Ensuring full compliance with environmental  laws and regulations; encouraging awareness on  this subject among our stakeholders by following  developments in this field closely. Energy Consumption and Saving     The Carbon Disclosure Project, conducted by the  Sabanc University Corporate Management Forum with  support from Akbank, is an indicator of the importance  Akbank attaches to greenhouse gas emissions and so  to the Climate Change issue. Within the scope of this  project, Akbank became one of the first companies  in Turkey committed to reporting greenhouse gas  emissions in line with international standards.  Energy Consumption direct and indirect energy Consumption A wide-scope study was conducted in 2010 with  the aim of calculating the amount of electricity and  natural gas consumed for heating purposes and of  establishing an energy management system. Within  the scope of this study, consumption data from all  buildings, including branches, were gathered to create  a basis. Consumption data in this years report are  based upon these data and were calculated using  heating, electricity, and water costs. In 2010, Akbank  Banking Center (ABC) in Gebze was put into effect and  thus, some of the buildings in stanbul were moved  to Gebze. This moving period lasted for a certain time  within the year and consumption data of both ABC  and the buildings that moved to ABC were counted in  calculations and therefore some consumption figures  seem to have increased.  The Natural Gas Consumption table, including our  direct energy consumption data and the Electricity  Consumption table, including our indirect energy  consumption data are presented below. Natural gas is  used for heating purposes in our buildings. 82 natural gas Consumption (gigajoule/year) 2008 2009 2010 Akbank Sabanc Center ABC and Other Centers* Branches ToTAl * Other Centers: Maslak Operations Center and Zincirlikuyu, Gmsuyu, mraniye, and Silivri Service Buildings.

Note: data control processes were continuing during the reporting.  45,493  - - 45,493 47,214 47,236 221,156 315,606 49,327 75,855 224,362 349,544 A total of 4% increase is observed in the natural  gas consumption of our Bank. It is believed that the  increase in the number of branches have a role in this  increase. In addition, during the moving process from  some buildings to the ABC, which started to operate  this year, services were provided concurrently, leading  to an increase in consumption. For heating purposes, fuels other than natural gas,  such as diesel fuel, butane (LPG), coking coal, and  fuel oil were also used in branches nationwide. It is  calculated that 32.926 GJ energy was consumed using  these fuels in 2010.  electricity Consumption Electricity consumption resulting from services offered  to customers are presented below. Total electricity consumption throughout our Bank  shows an increase compared to 2009. One of the  major reasons of this increase is moving to the Akbank  Banking Center in 2010 that has a capacity of 5,000  people. During the preparation of ABC for operations,  electricity was consumed in both the existing buildings  and in the ABC and electricity was also used in  efforts to complete preparations for the operation of  the Center. Throughout this large-scale operation,  consumption of natural resources such as natural gas  and water as well as electricity, increased due to the  process of moving.  On the other hand, with the aim of maintaining and  improving the services offered to customers at our  Head Office in the Sabanc Center, new servers were  added to the existing main servers. Both these servers  and the cooling systems for healthy operations of  servers increase electricity consumption. Measures  taken to reduce electricity consumption are explained  in the next part, under the title Energy Savings at the  Data Center. Another issue is that the number of branches  increased as a result of the growth experienced  in our Bank. Despite this fact, increase in branch- originating electricity consumption is considerably  lower compared to the increase in the number of our  branches. In addition, 2010 electricity consumption  values include ATM/BTM consumptions and the  number of our Banks ATM/BTMs increased 24% this  year. Therefore, this growth has triggered the need for  electric power. Energy Saving Practices energy Savings in Buildings Mechanical automation of the Heating, Ventilating and  Air Conditioning (HVAC) system in all branches was  revised in a way to operate based on internal air quality  and this system was installed in 26 new branches  opened in the last quarter of 2010. With this system,  approximately 30% and 14% annual savings will be  achieved in electricity and natural gas respectively.  This new system will continue to be installed in new  branches in 2011. In addition, there are plans to revise  the systems in 400 branches.  Operating since May 2010, the ABC in Gebze,  construction of which started in April 2009 and  completed in April 2010, uses heat recovery drum to  collect the air within the building and transfer it to the   07 OUR OPERATIONS AND  THE ENVIRONMENT air conditioning system; thermal charge of this air is  used in maximum efficiency to reduce natural gas and  electric consumption. This also leads to a reduction in  carbon emissions.  Hood fumes in the cafeterias kitchen of Gebze ABC  have the quality of heat recovery. With these devices,  approximately 8,611 m3 of natural gas savings was  achieved in 2010. This figure is calculated based upon  the technical productivity value of the device. energy Savings at the data Center  Number of servers used in Akbanks Data Center  increases to meet the increasing demand. With the  aim of reducing energy consumption at the Data  Center, virtualization technology started to be used as  of early 2007. With a principle adopted in 2007, each  new server is created in the virtual environment if  there are no technical drawbacks. Today, the ratio of  virtual server use approached 60% at Akbank. Existing  physical machines continue to be transferred to virtual  environments with new investments. Number of servers at Akbank increased approximately  50% in 2010. In parallel with this increase, amount of  energy needed to operate these servers and to cool  the system rooms of these servers is expected to  increase by 50% in minimum; however, thanks to the  virtualization technology, energy need increased by 40%. Comparison of the energy consumption in virtual  environments and the expected consumption without  virtualization (physical machines) is demonstrated  in the table below. As can be seen in the figures,  transition to virtual environments had considerable  positive influence on Akbanks cooling and electricity  consumption. The table includes the GJ used by virtual  and physical servers in 2009 and 2010. energy-Saving devices  Our Bank employees have an intense use of computer  screens. In order to reduce the amount of electricity  consumed by this item, LCD screens are purchased  instead of CRT.  Carbon Emissions and Reductions     Carbon Emissions Akbank calculates its carbon footprint and takes  necessary actions to perform a carbon management  program. With this aim, our Bank continues to sponsor  the Carbon Disclosure Project in our country and  to continue its pioneering efforts. In 2010 Akbank  produced a report at the CDP Global 500 level and  received a score similar to those of world leaders of its  sector.  84 Total annual  electricity  consumption (gJ/year) virtual servers  used use of physical servers  corresponding to virtual  servers Amount  saved  december 2009 december 2009 december 2009 december 2010 december 2010 december 2010 ToTAl  (Cooling+electricity)   2,152      3,042    6,793   10,297    4,641    7,255  Carbon emissions generated by natural gas Consumption Natural gas, a primary energy source, is the basic fuel used for heating in our Bank and carbon emissions  generated by natural gas consumption are presented in the table below. Carbon emissions generated by use of other fuels such as diesel fuel, butane (LPG), coking coal, and fuel oil in 2010  are around 2,966 ton CO2-e. Therefore, the carbon emission resulting from our Banks fuel consumption for heating  purposes are approximately 7,693 ton CO2-e.  Carbon emissions generated by electricity Consumption Carbon emissions generated by electricity consumption at our Bank are presented in the table below. The 6% increase observed in the total carbon emissions of our Bank is mostly related to the increase in electricity  consumption resulting from moving to the ABC. However, despite the 4% increase in the number of branches and  24% increase in the number of ATM/BTMs, emissions generated by Branches and ATM/BTMs remained almost  stable. This is partly a result of the measures taken at our Bank as well as our decision to receive energy from a  private autoproductor that generate energy with lower emissions with the aim of reducing carbon footprint. 07 OUR OPERATIONS AND  THE ENVIRONMENT 85 Carbon emissions generated by  natural gas Consumption (tonCo2-e) 2008 2009 2010 Akbank Sabanc Center ABC and Other Centers* Branches ToTAl * Other Centers: Maslak Operations Center and Zincirlikuyu, Gmsuyu, mraniye, and Silivri Service Buildings.

Use of the mentioned vehicles  generated a carbon emission equivalent to 3,307,738  kgCO2. Number of employees using service buses is given  below. Hence, as these figures also include outsource  employees, number of people using service buses at  the ABC exceeds the actual number of our employees  at ABC. From Sabanc Center:   1,150 From ABC:    3,500 3,307,738 kg CO2-equivalent carbon emissions  resulting from commuting by around 4,650 employees  in our Bank would be much higher if service buses  were not used and employees used their own vehicles.  Therefore, with the service buses provided for our  employees, we believe that our Bank achieved a  significant saving in carbon emissions.    videoconferences With the introduction of standard and advanced  Videoconference devices to meeting rooms, business  travels between the Sabanc Center in Levent, stanbul  and the Akbank Banking Center in Gebze have been  limited. Thus, both greenhouse gas emissions and  loss of working hours due to commuting have been  reduced. There are plans to increase the number of  such devices in 2011. other Sources of greenhouse gas emissions Protection of IT System Rooms Against the risk of a fire in system rooms full of IT  hardware, these rooms are taken under protection.  The new system room established in 2010 is equipped  with the Novac1232 system instead of the one that  contains gases causing climate change. Use of Alternative delivery Channels (AdC)    Number of customers using our alternative channels  such as internet banking and mobile banking increases  regularly. This increase not only reduces the number  of customers directly visiting our branches for banking  transactions, but also contributes to our efforts to  reduce our carbon emissions.           Paper Use and Savings     paper use  Amount of paper used by Akbank was 1,320 tons in  2009 and this figure fell to 1,150 tons in 2010. Total  amount of paper includes the paper used in the Head  Office, Regional Directorates, and Akbank Banking  Center; A4 photocopy papers used in branches are not  included in this calculation. Materials purchased by  the Corporate Communications Department, such as  invitations, brochures, banners, flyers, envelopes, and  posters, are also excluded in the 2009 data. Reports  and other print materials printed by suppliers are not  included in this number either.  As one of the most widely used paper types, amount  of A4 photocopy papers consumed at Akbank fell 7%  in 2010 compared to the previous year. As a result of  a variety of savings practices in the Bank, amount of  paper consumed per person fell from 90 kg to 75 kg  in 2010, which indicates a major reduction. Increase  in the number of employees in 2010 may also have a  partial effect in this reduction.  Paper Savings  Branch Without paper  The Branch Without Paper project -started in 2008- is  a collection of practices that enables transfer of paper- 1,320,099  (0)* 1,320,099 1,143,647  6,479 1,150,126 paper use (kg) 2009 2010 Purchasing department Corporate  Communications  department ToTAl *It is not possible to get retrospective data for 2009.   07 OUR OPERATIONS AND  THE ENVIRONMENT based transactions to the electronic environment and  management of such electronic environment. The  aim of this project is to reduce the traffic of physical  documents, the use of photocopiers and fax machines  between Akbank Head Office and the branches.  Through this project, approximately 10% efficiency was  achieved in operational transactions. In 2010, within  the scope of Branch Without Paper project, 4,350,000  transactions were performed via confirmation/control  of documents stored in the electronic system, where  paper waste caused by copying documents was  avoided. end of day Reports without paper The first phase of the project to transfer end of day  reports, which had to be printed to perform end of  day transactions, to electronic media was realized in  October 2008 and the second phase was completed  in February 2009. This project has enabled to reduce  the number of paper consumed from 2 million sheets  monthly in 2008 to 980,000 sheets monthly in 2009.  This provided a saving of TL 310 thousand in 2009. In  2010, monthly average paper consumption was 515  thousand sheets, which means a saving of TL 400-420  thousand annually. Transition to e-extracts â€“ The give life to        Trees Campaign Since August 2008 extracts indicating credit card use  are produced in the electronic media, via e-mails or  SMSs. To encourage our customers to accept and use  this extract which we call e-extract, we have been  performing communication activities and guidance  with the motto Give Life to Trees since 2008. The  fact that our customers would contribute to paper  savings and thus to the protection of the environment  by abandoning printed extracts is emphasized in the  communication works.  Our campaign is occasionally  supported with chip-money rewards as an incentive.  Number of e-extract users among our customers  increased to 1,211,167 in 2010 from 254,704 in 2008  year-end. new Technologies   In 2010, our Private Banking Business Unit initiated iPad  use in customer visits and promotion activities. During  the visits to customers, all details can be seen on iPads  instead of printed promotion materials, printed extracts  and bank statements. This project achieved a significant  reduction in paper use.   Water Use and Savings                 Water Use Total water use at Akbank includes water used by the  employees and water used for cleaning purposes.  Compared to a production facility, Akbanks total  water withdrawal is limited and municipal water is  used. Therefore, Akbank's water use does not have  significant negative impact on a specific water source. With the effect of our ABC building, which was put into  use in 2010, and a wide scope moving operation from a  number of buildings to this Center, water consumption  has increased. It is believed that water consumption  increased during the operations to prepare ABC for  operations and concurrent services given both at ABC  and buildings to be moved out of.  87 Water Consumption (m3/year) 2008 2009 2010 Akbank Sabanc Center ABC and Other Centers* Branches ToTAl * Other Centers: Maslak Operations Center and Zincirlikuyu, Gmsuyu, mraniye, and Silivri Service Buildings.

In addition, photocell taps are used in  WCs where water is used in great amounts, in order to  achieve water savings. Wastewater Management  An oil retainer is placed between the wastewater line of  the kitchen in the Akbank Banking Center in Gebze and  the city sewer line. Thanks to this system, within 2010,  when the building started to be used, 1,250 kg of oil  was sent to recycling stations. As the oil was separated  for wastewater, it was easier for the treatment plant to  purify the wastewater.  Environment-Friendly Technologies environment-friendly Maintenance of      electronic devices Maintenance of some devices (POS devices, laptops,  computer screens, PCs, printers, scanners, etc.) is  conducted at the IT Hardware Department. The solder  used during maintenance works contain lead, which  may be harmful for the environment and human  health. Since 2008, the IT Hardware Department  purchases lead-free (PB free) solders. Electronic  components used in maintenance operations are  also chosen among the lead-free ones. In addition,  frontiering companies that produce these components  (Intel, Infineon, National Semiconductor, Maxim, etc.)  also avoid using lead in their products.  Waste Management Akbank uses a great number and variety of electric and  electronic devices due to its large scale and banking  operations. Therefore, our Bank performs activities to  ensure recovery of devices that have gone out of use  within the economy or to reduce probable negative  impacts on the environment.   Recycling of Toner Cartridges  Project preparations within the IT Business Unit to  recycle the toner cartridges of the Banks printers  were completed in August 2010. Since then, empty  cartridges in the Head Office buildings and branches  are sent to an electronic waste recovery institution for  recycling. The recovery company uses the recycled  cartridges as fuel for energy generation. Within the 5  months time between August and December 2010 a  total of 783 cartridges -490 from the Head Office and  293 from the Branches- were sent to the recovery  company. This project achieved its goal to establish  a continuous recovery system, therefore it will be  ongoing during 2011.  Recovery of Technological Wastes Of the electronic devices that are no longer appropriate  for use according to our Banks standards, some are  given out as scrap, while some are sold to Turkish  companies for second-hand use. Companies either  utilize these devices as scrap or repair the problematic  parts and sell as second-hand products. In addition,  some of general-purpose devices such as computers,  screens, laser printers are donated upon requests  made to the Bank. Schools account for the 90% of such  donations.  88 07 OUR OPERATIONS AND  THE ENVIRONMENT  89 07 OUR OPERATIONS AND  THE ENVIRONMENT 2007 2008 2009 2010 Sold as  Scrap  Type of  Technological  Wastes Sold as  Scrap  Sold as  Scrap  Sold as  Scrap  Sold as  Second- hand Sold as  Second- hand Sold as  Second- hand Sold as  Second- hand donation donation donation donation Computer Screen Passbook  Printer dot Matrix  Printer Laser Printer POS device ATM device 1,692 1,401 710 91 349 - 544 - - - - - 20,642 - 153 153 - - 3 - - 3,666 2,079 465 50 413 50,030 65 - - - - - 2.628 - 177 177 - - 7 - - 5,962 3,471 445 23 342 50,490 164 - 197 188 - 1 13 2 - 964 2,195 676 130 404 6,592 273 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 433 436 - -     24   - -  OUR COMMUNITY  INVESTMENT  AKBANK SUSTAINABILITY  REPORT 2010  08 Our Community Investment Pursuant to the understanding of sustainability embedded  in its genes, Akbank not only operates to improve the life  quality of individuals in the society it operates, but also  aims to create a better future for next generations.

In addition, our social awareness campaigns on  environmental issues and our donations â€“both by Akbank  and our customers- to a variety of foundations and  associations are stated in this section of the report as  indicators of our community investment.   Culture and Arts international stanbul film festival (permanent)  Since 2004, Akbank has been the major supporter of  the International stanbul Film Festival, which brings  the most exclusive and original films of the cinema  world to cinemagoers and contributes to the formation  of cinema culture through special activities held with  the participation of movie stars and master directors.  The festival attracts a wide audience of mostly young  people and opens up new horizons to viewers with  a variety of lives, different perspectives and its rich  content. Akbank aims to maintain its support to this  festival organized by KSV (Istanbul Foundation for  Culture and Arts) for many further years. Contemporary istanbul (permanent) Contemporary Istanbul, the modern and  contemporary art event with the widest scope  in Turkey, introduces the countrys cultural and  artistic life to the world. Akbank, as the sponsor of  Contemporary Istanbul since 2007, is recognized by  the international art community with its contribution to  one of the most important modern art events in Turkey.  Contemporary Istanbul presents many side events  and art projects throughout the year, from discussion  panels to exhibitions. Sonisphere festival  exi26, Akbanks banking segment that offers special  opportunities for young people aged 16-26, enabled  holding the Sonisphere Festival â€“performed in 11  countries- in the stanbul nn Stadium on 25-27  June 2010.
