This form  of responsibility was already taken on in 2003 with publication  of the LEONI Social Charter, continued in 2007 with the LEONI  Code of Ethics and taken further forward in 2011 by joining the  UN Global Compact. The obligation under the German Corporate Governance  Code, the LEONI Social Charter and the LEONI Code of Ethics  constitutes a solid basis for all of LEONIs activity and commit- ment to fulfil the ten principles of the UN Global Compact.   Sustainability has especially high priority for LEONI. It means  both a long-term business outlook and integration of ecological  and social aspects in our management systems. We regard this  as a contribution both to safeguarding our Companys future  and towards sustainable growth of business and society. That is  why we submitted the questionnaire on the Carbon Disclosure   Project for the years 2005 and 2006 for the first time in 2007;  why we have certified our principal production facilities in  accordance with the ISO 14001 environmental standard why we  launched our Green Technology Initiative in 2009, with which  we are advancing towards being the leading manufacturer of  cables for environmentally friendly technologies.  Corruption prevention is managed as a key compliance field in  our Compliance Management System.  LEONI thereby ensures  anti-corruption conduct in accordance with the principles of the  UN Global Compact.  This first LEONI Global Compact Communication on Progress  documents our key steps towards upholding the 10 principles  of the UN Global Compact through to signing it and details our  measures and results since joining in August 2011.  LEONI is committed to ongoing support of the ten principles  of the UN Global Compact and to continual improvement in  applying those principles.  Nuremberg, July 2012 LEONI AG The Management Board  Dr Klaus Probst  Dieter Bell  Uwe H.Lamann  5 |    UN Global Compact The LEONI Group The LEONI Group  LEONI operates worldwide, providing wires, optical fibers,  cables and cable systems as well as related services for the  automotive sector and other industries. The group of com- panies market-listed in the German MDAX index employs  more than 63,000 people in 31 countries and generated  consolidated sales of EUR 3.7 billion in 2011. Established 95 years ago, the Company now ranks among the  worlds largest and most successful cable manufacturers. In  addition to tailor-made cable solutions, the Group is increas- ingly offering its customers complete systems with perfectly  harmonised components â€“ from the cable itself through to the  required connectors and fixings. Ongoing growth of the Com- pany as a provider of development work and systems is a sig- nificant trend in this respect. Experience in and presence on the markets of the future LEONI focuses its business on the core markets of Automotive,  Industry & Healthcare, Communication & Infrastructure, Elec- trical Appliances as well as Conductors & Copper Solutions. Its  customers include well-known companies such as ABB, BMW,  Bosch, Continental, Deutsche Telekom, EADS, Ericsson, Fiat, GM,  IBM, Jaguar/Land Rover, Johnson Controls, MAN, Mercedes- Benz, Meyer Werft, Philips, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Renault/Nis- san, Shell, Siemens, Solarworld, Volvo and VW. The Company  already leads the world market as a supplier of single-core  automotive cables; in the wiring systems market it occupies  first place in Europe and is fourth worldwide. In addition, LEONI  is among the leading manufacturers across Europe in all of its  other business areas.  Leading cable systems manufacturer with a global footprint   More information     is to be found at www.leoni.com Geared to global trends The Company intends in the future to benefit more from  global trends. These present the Company with major chal- lenges because they frequently entail greater consumption of  resources and environmental harm. At the same time, how- ever, they provide major opportunities. LEONI is therefore, with  its products and services, preparing for the change involving  demography, ecology, mobility, globalisation, industrialisation  and urbanisation. Especially with respect to environmental pro- tection, LEONI aims to become the most innovative cable sup- plier for the green technology market.  Tradition and progress since the 16th century A small wire factory in the Franconia region of Bavaria laid the  foundation for todays global player LEONI back in 1569. At that  time, Frenchman Anthoni Fournier began with a handful of  staff in Nuremberg to produce finest gold and silver threads,  known as Lyonese wares, for precious woven products. His sons  opened further production facilities in the region. From these  beginnings, Leonische Werke Roth-Nrnberg AG emerged  in 1917. Then as now the ability to change as well as a keen  sense for trends in the market and for customer requirements  are among the key characteristics of the Company, which was  renamed LEONI AG in 1999. Long-standing values simultane- ously serve as a guide for acting in a predictable and responsi- ble manner.  6 Human rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect   the protection of international human   rights within their sphere of influence;   and  Principle 2: make sure they are not complicit   in human rights abuses. LEONI supports and respects the protection of inter- nationally recognised human rights within its sphere   of influence and ensures that it is not complicit in  human rights abuses.  7 |    UN Global Compact Human rights  The LEONI Social Charter     and the LEONI Code of Ethics     are published on www.leoni.com. LEONI Social Charter and LEONI Code of Ethics  LEONI was one of the first companies in the world to draft  a Social Charter in April 2003. It applies directly to all LEONI  Group companies worldwide. Ensuring employee and human  rights as well as assuming social responsibility have always  been integral elements of corporate policy. LEONIs European  Works Council and the International Metalworkers Federation  (IMF) are co-signatories to this Charter. In the LEONI Social Charter, the Group commits to respecting  internationally recognised human rights and to support their  observance. We also encourage our business partners to con- sider this declaration in their own business policy. We regard  this as a beneficial basis for reciprocal business relationships. In March 2007, LEONI also introduced its own Code of Ethics.  It is binding on all employees of the LEONI Group worldwide  and has been made accessible to every staff member.  The Code of Ethics describes in unequivocal terms the values  and the demands placed on the kind of personally responsible  and honest conduct that has always guided LEONI as a busi- ness enterprise. The crux of the Code of Ethics is that LEONI  employees act in accordance with the corporate rules and the  statutory regulations of the legal system that applies to them.  Every LEONI employee must, when newly recruited, have a cor- responding clause in their service contract by which he or she  undertakes to observe the LEONI Code of Ethics. Courses on LEONI Code of Ethics compliance  The mandatory training courses that we have been holding for  management worldwide for several years, and which currently  involve about 150 managers, were switched to the Compliance  Basics and LEONI Code of Ethics e-learning module starting in  2011. In 2012, these courses will be offered in further languages  in addition to German and English, and they will be extended  to more than 10,000 employees. This will involve all LEONI staff  with e-mail access. We will be using a training platform with  worldwide accessibility for this purpose. The courses make our  managers and staff more aware on the topic of human rights. Health, safety and environmental policy Acting sustainably safeguards our Companys future. Specific  principles for action are embedded in our health, safety and  environmental policy to ensure the health and safety of every- one who works for or with LEONI. These include avoiding injury  to or illness of our employees by preventive detection of risks  and effective averting of threat. Acting in a safety aware man- ner is part of every employees job. Adhering to all legal obliga- tions on safety at work and other requirements is the basis for  our activity and the applicable national standards are minimum  requirements in this respect. LEONI undertakes to observe all  pertinent laws and directives on safety at work as well as inter- nal rules of conduct.   8 Labour standards LEONI is committed with worldwide effect to providing  a working environment for its employees that is free  of discrimination in both employment and occupation,  and in which there is freedom of association. The right  to collective bargaining is effectively recognised.   LEONI strictly rejects child and all forms of forced  labour. These principles are embedded in LEONIs   Social Charter. Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom   of association and the effective recognition  of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and  compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour;   and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination   in respect of employment and occupation.  9 |    UN Global Compact Labour standards Measures Part of the annual Control Self-Assessment of managers per- taining to LEONIs Social Charter involves confirming at all of  the Groups 93 locations that all employees are of at least the  minimum age under local law and are at least 15 years old. This  ensures that child labour is never used at LEONI.  Furthermore, breaches of these principles require Human  Resource Reporting and can also be reported directly to our  Chief Compliance Officer via our internal compliance process.  In addition, the Internal Audit department checks this on a ran- dom basis as a separate control factor of our Internal Control  System (ICS). Supply chain management In order to apply the principles of the UN Global Compact in  everyday work, it is of great importance to LEONI that social  responsibility is also taken into account in the context of sup- ply relationships. This applies not only within LEONI, but also  to suppliers operations and for the Company in general. In the  selection of suppliers, we have in our Wiring Systems Division  therefore ever since 2006 checked candidates according to the  principles of the UN Global Compact using a supplier self-audit.  The supplier will receive approval to supply only if either the  Social Charter and the Code of Ethics or the principles of the UN  Global Compact are accepted.  In addition to our Social Charter, which suppliers already had  to accept in the past as part of our General Terms and Condi- tions, the principles of the UN Global Compact have also been  adopted in our T&Cs. Here we draw express attention to the fact  that, in the event of any serious or repeated breach of the prin- ciples as detailed in the T&Cs, LEONI is entitled to terminate the  supply relationship without notice.  Note item Social responsibility     in our T&Cs: http://www.leoni.com/AGB.179.0.html Diversity Due to our Groups operations in 31 countries, our workforce  includes people from many nations, cultures and ways of life.  With plants in Brazil, Egypt, India and South Korea, among other  places, virtually all of the worlds religions, including Christian- ity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism, are represented. To promote  acceptance of this diversity, training courses on the General  Equal Treatment Act are regularly held at LEONI. The Company joined the Diversity Charter in 2010. This is a  project to create a prejudice-free work environment initiated  by Minister of State Dr Maria Bhmer, the German federal gov- ernments officer for migration, refugees and integration. Com- mitment to the standards of the Diversity Charter establishes  an open-minded business culture based on inclusiveness and  mutual respect. Different talents in the workforce are to be rec- ognised and deployed in a targeted way. LEONI intends thereby  to contribute to establishing a climate of acceptance and  mutual trust in society and to raise appreciation of embraced  diversity. This diversity is also reflected in the international nature of  our management on the first four levels at LEONI, which com- prise 21 nationalities.  More than 40 percent of these positions  are thus held by non-Germans. Social commitment LEONI commits itself with donations for and sponsorship of  various social projects, where we give priority to sustainabi- lity and a regional approach. In 2011, for example, we suppor- ted the Healthy Food for School Children and City for Child- ren projects in Nuremberg. Overall, we promoted numerous  social projects and establishments in those countries where  we are represented with larger facilities. In 2011, we supported  childrens aid organisations, sports clubs, crches and orpha- nages, among other good causes, with a total of about EUR  275,000. The single biggest donation, of EUR 100,000, went to  SOS-Kinderdrfer (China and Serbia), an organisation for child- ren in need.  10 Environmental protection LEONI supports protection of the environment with   a precautionary approach and has several ongoing  initiatives to promote greater awareness of responsibi- lity for the environment. We therefore encourage the  development and diffusion of environmentally friendly  technologies. LEONI regards environmental protection as a primary  corporate objective. Our environmental management  is geared to keeping the impact of all our processes on  nature as minor as possible. The principles of our envi- ronmental policy also play a role in the selection of our  suppliers. Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary  approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater  environmental responsibility;   and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion   of environmentally friendly technologies.  11 |    UN Global Compact Environmental protection relative to sales.  In the future, too, LEONI shall use the projects  findings to further reduce its CO2 emissions. Saving resources LEONI endeavours everywhere to reduce energy consumption  and thereby CO2 emissions. Both divisions run environmental  management systems and multifaceted environmental protec- tion activities, which are adapted to the respective require- ments of their activities. In our Wire & Cable Solutions Divi- sion an energy manager has, since 2011, been ensuring more  energy-efficient processes and is planning the use of recupera- tive energy for our production. The Factory of the Future, a  production facility with energetically optimised production, is  being planned our Roth facility. In so doing, attention is being  paid to both more efficient processes and energetically sensible  methods like heat recovery. CO2-REDUCTION      Due to our work towards CO2 reduction,  LEONIs CO2 emissions have dropped by 14 % compared with  2010. This is reflected in the CO2 emissions relative to every mil- lion euros in sales. We have set ourselves the target of reducing  CO2 emissions by 3 % annually. Energy consumption There was a year-on-year reduction in energy consumed in  2011, yielding a saving of 14.75 %.  RECYCLING     The EU End-of-Life Vehicle Directive (Directive  2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on  end-of-life vehicles, dated 18 September 2000) defines the  objective, among others, of broadening the recycling and the  reusability of waste. LEONI has, above all due to the use of cop- per as a main element of its products, an ideal starting position  in this respect. Copper is a 100 % recyclable material.  Initiatives GREEN TECHNOLOGY      LEONI has made it its task to become  the most innovative supplier of cables for green applications.  Aggravating shortage of resources and mounting harm to the  environment make it necessary to develop processes, products  and applications that are sustainable, energy-saving and envi- ronmentally compatible. We encapsulate our endeavours to  improve both our value chain from an ecological aspect and,  in a targeted way, to supply products for use in proven envi- ronmental technologies in our green technology plan. This  encompasses all products, system solutions and services that  enable us to operate with more energy efficiency and to be  easier on resources, thereby reducing emissions and pollution  of the environment. In so doing, we rate our activities according  to the following three criteria of product, process and applica- tion:   Product:   Increasing the proportion of low-emission, environmentally  compatible raw materials in our cable products as well as rai- sing the ability to recycle the processed materials and compo- nents; one example being our halogen-free LEONI EcoSense  cable.   Process:   Optimising resource efficiency in our manufacturing proces- ses by deploying energy-efficient machinery. Certifying more  facilities in our global production network to the ISO 14001  environmental standard.    Application:   Expanding our range of products and solutions that are used  directly in green markets and technologies or serve as input  products or components for green applications, e.g. wires,  cables and conductors for the solar and wind power indust- ries. CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT    LEONI participated in the  Carbon Disclosure Project for the fourth time in 2011. On behalf  of institutional investors, the initiative surveys the worlds lar- gest, market-listed companies on the amount of their CO2 emis- sions, among other things. The trend in this respect shows that  LEONI is well on its way towards improving its CO2 readings.  In the ranking of comparable companies participating in the  Carbon Disclosure Project, LEONI was again at the top end rela- tive to the number of employees and advanced to the middle    2009  2010  2011 60 40 20 0     Direct CO2 emissions group-wide    [ tons per 1 mill.  in sales ]   2009  2010  2011 150 100 50 0     Energy consumption group-wide    [ MWh per 1 mill.  in sales ]  12 Anti-corruption LEONIs rules of conduct, which are laid down in the  LEONI Code of Ethics, clearly reflect the anti-corruption  mindset. There are clear rules concerning both the  giving and receiving of gifts as well as control systems  that proactively monitor observance of these rules.   Furthermore, we pursued all reported suspect cases  and did not find any breaches in the process. Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption  in all its forms, including extortion   and bribery.  13 |    UN Global Compact Anti-corruption LEONI Code of Ethics â€“ Prevention of corruption The LEONI Code of Ethics stipulates that no employee anywhere  in the world may offer or demand any benefit relating to prefer- ential treatment involving a business partner.  For the past several years there have been training courses  on this topic for all 150 managers on LEONIs first four manage- ment levels, which from 2011 were switched to the Anti-cor- ruption e-learning module. In 2013 this course will addition- ally be expanded to all pertinent staff worldwide and offered in  more languages. This will concern approximately 3,500 LEONI  employees. We will be using a training platform with worldwide  accessibility for this purpose. This course has further sharpened  our managers awareness concerning the prevention of corrup- tion. Automated compliance audits by means of Control Self- Assessments and a statement of undertaking to be submitted  by each manager on an annual basis provide the prevention of  corruption with a further safeguard. Compliance management system LEONI has developed its own compliance system that comprises  the key compliance fields. This also includes the compliance  field of anti-corruption, which is overseen by a compliance  field manager. The compliance programme breaks down by the  three processes of avoidance, detection and response. AVOIDANCE       The avoidance process is based on the risk  policy stipulated by the Management Board and the statement  of our Management Board on compliance with the following  key points:   Neither corruption nor breaches of competition law, export  control, the LEONI Social Charter or the LEONI Code of Ethics  are tolerated in the LEONI Group.   We use neither bribes nor cartel agreements to win a con- tract.   Every staff member and every manager is obliged to apply all  necessary measures within the Company to refrain from and  avoid infringements of the law.  Compliance within the risk management system at LEONI is  controlled and monitored at corporate level by the Corporate  Compliance Committee, which meets regularly with the partici- pation of Management Board members. The risk management  reporting system provides for reporting of the compliance risks  across all levels of the Company. The avoidance process com- prises various e-learning modules, among them the module  on the compliance field of prevention of corruption, various  explicit statements of undertaking and the Control Self-Assess- ment process of the respective managers, the integrated com- pliance status reporting as well as the internal whistleblower  system. Staff were informed worldwide in this regard that any  compliance breaches can and should be reported directly to the  Chief Compliance Officer. As a matter of principle, LEONI uses function separation to  rule out any accounting manipulation. A strict double verifica- tion principle provides corruption-relevant processes with addi- tional safeguard. DETECTION        The detection process comprises the areas of  internal audits by the Internal Audit department, compliance  field-related audits and clarification of deviations by the res- pective compliance field managers as well as external audits.  The Internal Audit department uses the Control Self-Assess- ments as a template for compliance and ICS audits.  External  audits comprise structured, regular spot checks, which are car- ried out either alone or in close collaboration with companies  specialising in compliance matters and internal control systems,  such as accounting and law firms that operate internationally. RESPONSE        In the event of a compliance breach, either the  Chief Compliance Officer or the responsible compliance field  manager will notify the Management Board. The Management  Board will decide on the suitable and appropriate measures  and designate the person responsible for their immediate  implementation. Responses can involve, for example, repeated  training courses, ad hoc audits by either internal or external  auditors and/or sanctions available under employment law for  the responsible staff members. Both the Management Board  and the Corporate Compliance Committee continuously review  the compliance system for possible ways of improving it. In  addition, the information and notices provided by staff and  operational managers also result in ongoing improvement of  the whole compliance programme.

The e-learning module on the LEONI Code of Ethics sub- ject area contributes to sharpening the awareness among  management and staff of human rights.    Embedded in the health, safety and environmental policy  are principles for action that ensure the health and safety of  everyone who works for or with LEONI.    Every LEONI employee is, upon being recruited, handed or  given access to the LEONI Code of Ethics.    2800 staff and managers worldwide have completed an  e-learning course on the topic of Compliance Basics and  LEONI Code of Ethics. By the end of 2012, a total of more  than 11,000 of our managers and staff are to have comple- ted this course. The course will be repeated annually.   Principles 3 â€“ 6:  Labour standards     Courses are held at LEONI on the General Equal Treatment  Act to ensure a working environment that is free of discri- mination.    The right of association as well as equal opportunity and  equal treatment are assured in LEONIs Social Charter.     Through this participation in the Diversity Charter LEONI  ensures diversity and mutual respect.     In the selection of suppliers, a Control Self-Assessment  ensures that suppliers accept the principles of the UN  Global Compact or alternatively the LEONI Social Charter  and the LEONI Code of Ethics.     Our principles on observing labour standards are also  embedded in our T&Cs.   The 2800 staff and managers who have so far comple- ted the Compliance Basics and LEONI Code of Ethics  e-learning module were hereby also taught the principles  of the LEONI Social Charter that concern labour standards.  This course is to be expanded to a total of 11,000 staff and  managers by the end of 2012 and will be repeated annually.    Furthermore, people on the first four management levels  will complete this course when they join the Company, also  outside the annual schedule.  15 |    UN Global Compact Results and key figures Principles 7 â€“ 9:  Environmental protection      LEONI condenses its efforts towards saving resources and  sustainability in the product, process and application areas  under the term green technology.   Our sales of products and solutions for green technology  grew by about 33 % in 2011, to  223.1 million.    Sales of products that are made in environmentally certi- fied facilities or using energy-efficient plant and machinery  increased by 38 % to  2,972.4 million.    In our Wire & Cable Solutions Division 43 % of the facili- ties are certified to the ISO 14001 environmental standard,  while the figure in the Wiring Systems Division is 36 %.    Through the progressing certification of our plants we gua- rantee that they adhere to the ISO 14001 environmental  standard.    Via renewed participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project  we both record CO2 emissions and gain knowledge on ways  to reduce them.   LEONI participates in the Our Cars http://www.unsere- autos.de/ initiative and thus in projects to recycle them,  such as the EU End-of-Life Vehicle Directive, for example.   Principle 10:  Anti-corruption      The LEONI Code of Ethics stipulates clear and binding rules  on combating corruption.    Through function separation LEONI ensures that situations  at risk of involving corruption are avoided.     Alongside other tools for controlling compliance, an e-lear- ning module on anti-corruption is incorporated in the  Compliance Management System.   People on the first four management levels, i.e. approx. 150  managers, have already completed the anti-corruption  e-learning module.    Our guide on prevention of corruption, the LEONI Code of  Ethics, has been made available to all managers and staff  worldwide and has also been translated into 19 languages.    In 2011, Deloitte & Touche audited LEONIs compliance  management system (CMS) according to the new IDW PS  980 Principles of proper auditing of compliance manage  ment systems auditing standard.
