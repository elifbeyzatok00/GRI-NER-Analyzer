PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  1  A MESSAGE FROM OUR CHAIRMAN This year Pacic Hydro is celebrating  20 years of clean energy.  The platform established by all the  hard work of the employees and  management of Pacic Hydro over  these 20 years has put the company  in a great position. A number of achievements for the  past year are highlighted in the report.  However, we also faced challenges  due to extended outages at our joint  venture assets in Chile, which have  impacted on the overall performance  of the group for almost the full nancial  year. During this time, I am pleased to  report that the Board and our owner,  Industry Funds Management (IFM),  remained fully committed to the long  term value of the business. Pacic Hydro is an important part of  the IFM Australian Infrastructure Fund,  which has delivered net returns of  12.13% per annum since its inception  (to 30 June 2012) to more than ve  million Australian members of industry  superannuation funds. Pacic Hydro continues to deliver  sustainable infrastructure investment  opportunities, enhancing energy  security and reducing carbon  emissions through its renewable  energy projects. The pursuit of these opportunities  will ensure a very bright future for  Pacic Hydro.  GARRY WEAVEN OUR LEADING VALUES LEADERSHIP  Having the courage to lead  and innovate.

VISION POWERING A CLEANER WORLD. 2  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  3 A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO WELCOME TO OUR FIRST COMBINED ANNUAL REVIEW AND  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT, AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS IMPROVING THE  COMMUNICATION OF OUR BUSINESS AND SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE  TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS. The 2011–12 Australian nancial  year saw us continuing to live our vision  – powering a cleaner world – through the  development, delivery and operation of  renewable energy projects. Our core strategy of investing in three  of the strongest combined renewable  energy markets and GDP growth countries  – Australia, Brazil and Chile – continues  to generate growth opportunities and  shareholder value. More than 1.8 million megawatt hours  (MWh) of clean, renewable energy were  generated by our assets, leading to the  abatement of over 1.2 million tonnes of  greenhouse gas emissions. Health and safety remained a priority  for us and we achieved two of our  three key performance indicators. Due  to the number of reportable incidents  that occurred during the year, we failed  to achieve our Total Recordable Injury  Frequency Rate target. Throughout the year, we continued to  work and support our host communities  globally through our community investment  funds and a range of community relations  activities.  We continued to support and promote  the ten principles of the United Nations  Global Compact throughout our business,  further aligning our operations and  strategies with these key areas. In late  2011, Pacic Hydro was recognised for its  corporate social responsibility efforts in  Chile, ranking tenth out of 40 companies  in the prestigious PROhumana Foundation  Corporate Social Responsibility ranking. Operationally, our assets in Australia  and Brazil performed well with high  levels of availability and efciency. One  of Pacic Hydros longest running assets,  the Ord hydro plant in Western Australia,  delivered its highest generation ever  and well-above-average wind resources  in the second half contributed to good  performance in Brazil. In Chile, our 111 megawatt (MW)  Chacayes run-of-river hydro plant was  completed on time and has delivered  excellent operational performance since  commencing commercial operations  despite continued dry hydrological  conditions. However, an extended outage  of our two hydro projects at our Tinguiririca  Energa joint venture, caused in part by the  collapse of a small section of the tunnel  at La Higuera, had a material impact on  Pacic Hydros overall group results.  Despite these challenges, the year ahead  is looking promising for Pacic Hydro as  we celebrate 20 years of clean energy. Our three core markets – Australia,  Brazil and Chile – are all resource-based  economies which are expected to continue  beneting from demand from China and  India for their mineral and energy products.  As these three economies grow, so too  will their demand for clean and secure  energy supplies. Pacic Hydro will play  a signicant role in meeting that demand  for new clean energy. In Australia, we are becoming a clean  energy retailer, offering solutions for  medium and large commercial and industrial  organisations looking for a reliable, exible,  and cost-effective service to meet their  electricity supply needs. A partnership recently formed with  Vale, the worlds second-largest mining  company, in Brazil , will see us jointly  build, own and operate two wind farms  in Brazils Northeast. In Chile, we will continue to work together  with SN Power, our joint venture partner,  to nalise the works in progress and to  resume operations at Tinguiririca Energa.  We are also focussed on developing our  rst wind farm in the north of the country  and continuing to develop our run-of-river  hydro project pipeline. I hope you enjoy reading about our  business and sustainability achievements  over the last nancial year and have the  opportunity to discover how we powered  a cleaner world over the last 20 years at  pacichydro.com.au/20years. ROB GRANT ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  3  4  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 ANNUAL REVIEW 4  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 The Pacic Hydro group achieved  many important milestones despite  signicant challenges faced during  the reporting year.  We made signicant  enhancements to our revenue  forecasting and risk framework  and saw the rollout of a new  SAP nance system in Australia.  However, the roll out to Chile and  Brazil has been delayed.  Market conditions for new  renewable energy projects in  Australia and Brazil continued to  be a challenge for our business.  In Chile, our focus was on the  completion of existing construction  projects. The ongoing nancial  support received from our owner,  IFM, clearly demonstrated their  commitment to Pacic Hydros  long term strategy. At the end of the nancial year, the  signing of a consortium agreement  with Vale to jointly build and  operate two wind farms in the  Northeast of Brazil was an crucial  strategic step for us as we  continue to grow our business in  South America. A diversity and inclusion strategy  was developed and implemented  across the business to further  strengthen our values. Voluntary  turnover reduced by 3% since the  previous year to 10.8%.  AUSTRALIA The move to become a clean energy  retailer in Australia was approved by  the Board in 2011. As a retailer, our solutions will help  medium and large organisations to  meet their sustainability and carbon  reduction objectives, building on our  track record of helping Australian  electricity retailers and large energy  consumers to meet their green  energy needs over the last 20 years.  With a focus on operational  excellence, we implemented a  new operations and maintenance  agreement for our Portland assets  and fully transitioned our Codrington  wind farm to in-house maintenance.  We also maintained our focus  on technology and geographic  diversication. The planning  application of our Keyneton wind  farm in South Australia was lodged  and we continue to work with  community members to address  concerns about the project. We also  further progressed plans to jointly  develop conventional geothermal  projects with exploration company  GreenRock Energy.  While the Moree Solar Farm  project was unsuccessful under  the Federal Governments Solar  Flagships Program, the New South  Wales project continues to be  developed with partner Fotowatio  Renewable Ventures.  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  5 PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  5 HYDRO      WIND         SOLAR      GEOTHERMAL BRAZIL With a population of 190 million  people and increasing electricity demand  created by a growing middle class, the  wind power led Brazilian renewable  energy market presents exciting growth  prospects for Pacic Hydro. Early in 2011, we made a strategic  decision to pursue opportunities in the  Brazilian unregulated clean energy  market to build on our wind farm project  development pipeline and supply  clean electricity to large industrial and  resources companies.  In June 2012, we signed a Consortium  Agreement with Vale, the worlds  second-largest mining company, to jointly  build, own and operate two wind farms in  Brazils Northeast. Under the partnership,  each company will have 50% ownership  of the wind farms and Vale will be the  sole off-taker for 20 years. Operationally, the business unit  achieved an availability of 97.5% for our  operating assets, despite the impact of  corrective maintenance on underground  cables at Vale dos Ventos, delivering  positive results. CHILE  The rst generation from our  111MW Chacayes run-of- river hydro plant in late 2011  was the most important  achievement for Pacic Hydro  in the reporting period. Already awarded  Environmental Initiative of  the Year for the sustainable  development measures put in  place in its early design stages,  Chacayes was chosen by  Chilean President Sebastin  Piera as the location to  announce Chiles National  Energy Policy in March 2012. Since commencing commercial  operations, Chacayes has  delivered excellent operational  performance despite continued  dry hydrological conditions that  have also impacted our other  assets in Chile. In June 2012, we  submitted the Declaration  of Environmental Impact of our  rst wind project in Chile, the  Punta Sierra wind farm, to the  Environmental Assessment  Service of the Coquimbo  Region, an important step  in Pacic Hydros technology  expansion strategy in the  country. CONTINUED PG.6  6  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 6  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 TINGUIRIRICA ENERGA While the Tinguiririca Energa Joint Venture in Chile is not  included in the scope of this report, its social, environmental  and economic performance has a material impact on our  business. A performance summary has been provided as  part our Annual Review. Tinguiririca Energa is co-owned (50%) by Pacic Hydro  and Norwegian company SN Power. The two run-of-river  plants, La Higuera and La Conuencia, are located in the  Tinguiririca Valley, in the sixth region. The stations add  more than 310MW to Chiles electricity generation capacity.  Tinguiririca Energas thermal back-up power station Colmito,  in the fth region of Chile, opened in 2008 and has an  installed capacity of 57MW. It was a difcult year for Tinguiririca Energa due to  an extended outage resulting from the collapse of a  20 metre section of the 17 kilometre tunnel at the 155MW  La Higuera project. While remedial works are progressing  well, the outage signicantly impacted nancial performance  for the reporting period. Tunnel remediation works are  continuing as planned and the plant will be operational  in 2013. BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND FINANCE La Higuera and La Conuencia generated over  190,000MWh of clean energy during the reporting  period, which abated over 117,000 tonnes of carbon  dioxide equivalent (C02-e). The two hydro plants are registered under the Kyoto  Protocols Clean Development Mechanism, a scheme  allowing projects which reduce emissions to earn certied  emission reduction credits, or CERs, which can then be  sold or traded with industrialised countries. La Higuera was  registered under CDM in 2006 and La Conuencia in 2011.  La Higuera and La Conuencia received capital funding  from both shareholders and were debt nanced by a  consortium of international banks. The consortium, led  by the International Finance Corporation, includes DNB,  Nordea, SEB and Santander. All the commercial banks  are signatories to the Equator Principles. The banks chose  to model the Equator Principles on the environmental  standards of the World Bank and the social policies of the  International Finance Corporation.  During the completion of La Higuera in October 2010,  a number of construction and mechanical failures occurred.  As a result of these delays, a signicant nancial cost was  incurred by Tinguiririca Energa relating to, amongst other  things, lost revenue, increased and unplanned costs and  additional repair costs. Since June 2011, an arbitration  process has been underway between La Higuera and  contractor Queiroz Galvo. ANNUAL REVIEW TINGUIRIRICA VALLEY, CHILE  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  7 WORKPLACE – HEALTH AND SAFETY Tinguiririca Energa achieved a TRIFR of 6.7 with no  fatalities occurring during the reporting period. A continued  focus remained on improving health and safety performance,  with a number of initiatives implemented to promote safe  behaviour. One such program was the fourth annual road  safety campaign to promote safe driving on the roads  that lead to the La Higuera and La Conuencia hydro  plants. Brochures and CDs were handed out and movie  screenings held for employees, locals and tourists to  support the message. WORKPLACE – HUMAN RESOURCES Overall, Tinguiririca Energa has 89 employees, 83 staff  and 6 managers. There are 13 female staff and 70 male  staff, while there is 1 female manager and 5 male managers.  In 2010, a scholarship program was developed to encourage  further professional development through vocational or  academic pathways. In 2012, 12% of the total workforce  participated in the program. Total staff turnover was 8.9%  for the reporting period. Employees of Tinguiririca Energa are entitled to participate  in the collective bargaining process and 42% of employees  are covered by collective bargaining agreements. COMMUNITY One of the major stakeholder groups is the local irrigators  who use the Tinguiririca River for irrigation and agriculture.  The Water Users Association have raised concerns regarding  the hydro operations upstream and Tinguiririca Energa are  working closely with them to achieve long term solutions  for optimal water management in the Tinguiririca Valley.  Tinguiririca Energa have also committed to supporting  improvements to the irrigation infrastructure in the Valley.  Some of the initiatives include an online monitoring system  for irrigator intakes, evaluating alternatives for improving  water efciency, cloud seeding to stimulate rain and  providing support to improve canal irrigator organisations  such as the Water Users Association. More broadly, community engagement creates value  for both Tinguiririca Energa and the community. Meetings  are held in different locations with community leaders,  neighbourhood councils and other organisations to share  information, maintain communication, strengthen trust  and identify opportunities. The open door policy in the  San Fernando ofce encourages visitors and addresses  concerns or queries from interested community members. Over $100,000 was invested in the local community  through the community investment program, Tinguiririca  Participa. As well as providing funding opportunities  for locals living in the Tinguiririca Valley, the program  works with community and grassroots leaders, proving  training and assisting with preparation of social and  community needs assessments.  ENVIRONMENT All three Tinguiririca Energa assets operate under an  Environmental Management System (EMS) based on the  ISO 14001 standard. Annual audits against the EMS occur  to demonstrate compliance against national legislation and  as a requirement of the lenders. Waste and emissions are  monitored at all three sites. During the reporting period,  La Conuencia emitted 7 tonnes of C02-e, La Higuera  emitted 110 tonnes of C02-e and Colmito emitted  699 tonnes of C02-e. Minimum ecological ows are required to preserve aquatic  life and river-bank dwelling species. Our water management  system includes monitoring to measure water quality and  ensure ecological ow requirements are met. Results are  reported to local environmental regulators periodically and  we received no nes for environmental incidents during the  reporting period. Monitoring programs exist for the most signicant wildlife  species native to the area, with results showing that no  species have suffered negative impacts as a result of our  presence in the region. Tinguiririca Energa provided funds for maintenance of a  major road, the I-45, to improve the infrastructure in the area.  The road was also watered daily to minimise dust pollution  and annoyance for locals. tinguiriricaenergia.cl PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  7  8  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 OUR SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY Our commitment to sustainability  supports our vision of powering a  cleaner world. It enables us to support  our neighbouring communities, enhance  our supply chain relationships and attract  and retain the best staff. It also allows us  to focus on long-term sustainable business  opportunities, manage risks, enhances  our corporate reputation and provides  a competitive advantage. To enhance the integration of  sustainability into our business practices,  our Sustainability Strategy has been  embedded within the corporate 2012–17  Business Plan. The Sustainability Strategy  outlines our sustainability objectives,  strategies and deliverables. It focuses  on setting consistent and cohesive  sustainability objectives to support the four  pillars of our Sustainability Framework (see  diagram below) across the Australia, Brazil,  Chile and Corporate business units.  Results from our materiality assessment  and internal consultation feed into the  development of sustainability objectives.

Each year, we conduct a materiality  assessment to determine the topics  of most interest, or materiality, to our  stakeholders. This exercise enables  us to determine key areas to be taken  into account during the business planning  process so that sustainability strategies  and deliverables can be set as well as  identifying topics to be included in annual  sustainability reports. METHODOLOGY We apply the Global Report Initiatives  denition of materiality as being topics  that reect the organisations signicant  economic, environmental and social  impacts, or that would substantively  inuence the assessments and decisions  of stakeholders.  This year, the external element of our  assessment comprised an anonymous  written survey with a total of 29 questions,  with a number of additional questions  asked of specic stakeholder groups.  Stakeholders were asked to list topics or  issues they thought were important for  Pacic Hydro to address. We received 53  responses and allocated topics an external  ranking based on the number of times the  topic was mentioned by stakeholders. Following this, an internal ranking of  topics was conducted, based upon an  assessment of company policies and  business strategies, risk framework and  registers, stakeholder feedback, peers and  business norms. The results of the internal and external  rankings are shown on the following page.  A line was drawn to highlight the topics  that received a high internal and external  ranking and could be considered priority  areas in the development of sustainability  strategies and the content of sustainability  reports. All key topics identied through  this process have been addressed in this  years report and are referenced below.

The increase  was driven primarily by the Chacayes hydro plant in Chile  commencing commercial operations in October 2011. In  Australia and Brazil, there was an increase in revenue following  improvements in generation volumes, which was partially offset  by lower spot energy prices in Australia.  The economic impacts exclude Pacic Hydros equity accounted  investments except where otherwise stated.  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES We sell a range of products associated with the generation  from our wind farm and hydro power assets. These products  include electricity, electricity derivative products and energy  related environmental products, such as European Union  Certied Emission Reduction credits (CERs), Large Generation  Certicates [formerly known as Renewable Energy Certicates]  and GreenPower. Our customers include energy retailers,  mining companies and large consumers such as businesses  and government.

LARGE GENERATION CERTIFICATES In Australia, all electricity retailers and some large electricity  consumers are required to purchase a minimum amount of  electricity from renewable sources under the Large-scale  Renewable Energy Target (LRET). These companies meet the  requirement by procuring Large Generation Certicates (LGCs) –  [formerly known as Renewable Energy Certicates, or RECs]. All  of Pacic Hydros Australian renewable energy projects  commissioned after January 1997 are qualied to produce LGCs. GREENPOWER Today more than 700,000 Australian households and  businesses support renewable energy by purchasing GreenPower  electricity products. This voluntary action adds to the demand  for renewable electricity created by the mandatory Australian  Renewable Energy Target and illustrates the widespread support  for increasing the level of renewable energy generation in  Australia. All of Pacic Hydros Australian renewable energy  projects commissioned after January 1997 qualify as GreenPower  generators.  RETAIL  During the reporting period, we moved towards becoming   a clean energy retailer in Australia. Since mid-2012, we have  offered solutions for medium and large organisations looking  for a reliable, exible, and cost-effective service to meet their  electricity supply needs. Over the last 20 years, we developed an impressive track  record in fostering positive, long-standing relationships with  our local communities – and thats how we will do business  with our retail customers. As a retailer, we remain dedicated  to our vision – powering a cleaner world – so well only sell  electricity to customers who are committed to buying a  minimum 10% GreenPower. PACIFIC HYDRO COMMITS TO SMALL  AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES Many of the suppliers engaged by Pacic Hydro  Chile are classied as small and medium sized  enterprises (SMEs). One of the greatest challenges  for SMEs is maintaining an adequate cash ow,  which provides the foundation for business  growth and development opportunities. Sello Pro  Pyme is an initiative of the Chilean Ministry of  Economy, designed to provide improved nancial  conditions for SMEs. Receiving the Sello Pro Pyme  certication, or stamp, demonstrates a commitment,  usually made by large organisations, to pay their  suppliers within a 30 day period. Pacic Hydro  was one of the rst companies to receive this  certication, just one of the many ways we support  the development of corporate social responsibility  throughout the Chilean economy. This certication ensures that we are doing  our share to support small and medium sized  entrepreneurs, said Noortje Magis, Chief Financial  Ofcer, Chile. These business partners provide  essential services to our value chain and this  is another avenue to express our companys  commitment to sustainability, and a new step  towards a model of business that considers the  sustainable development of all our stakeholders. Patricio Silva, a Pacic Hydro supplier and local  entrepreneur from Chacayes said: My familys  quality of life has improved signicantly. I started  with a very old truck called La Joyita and today  I have two vans and a truck for myself and my team.  I am very proud of what I have achieved and I am  very thankful for the initial support I received from  Pacic Hydro. Sello Pro Pyme certication recognises  Pacic Hydros long-standing approach towards  working with small businesses. We continue to  look for further opportunities to support and  strengthen relationships with our small, but vital,  business partners. ABOVE SELLO PRO PYME CEREMONY, HELD AT LA MONEDA PALACE IN SANTIAGO, CHILE  18  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 CELEBRATING THE OPENING OF CHACAYES INAUGURATION In October 2011, we celebrated the inauguration  of the 111MW Chacayes run-of-river hydro plant in  Chiles Alto Cachapoal Valley, approximately 120 km  south of Santiago, at a formal ceremony attended by  Chiles Minister for Energy. At an investment of over US$450 million, the  plant will contribute 111MW of installed capacity to  Chiles national grid, enough clean energy to supply  more than 300,000 local homes. Its operations  are estimated to abate over 340,000 tonnes of  CO2-e per year – the equivalent to taking more  than 130,000 vehicles off the road. CELEBRATING WITH OUR HOST COMMUNITIES Prior to the ofcial Chacayes inauguration, a  celebration was held with our host communities  and local staff. A family function was held at  the Chacayes camp with games, music and  entertainment. The guests had the opportunity to watch a play  about our environmental and sustainability values,  and a video that paid homage to the support of our  host communities and all the work that has been  done since the projects inception.  We are very pleased to celebrate this important  milestone with our host communities, said Pacic  Hydro Chile General Manager Jos Antonio Valds.  Without the support of these communities we  wouldnt have been able to celebrate the opening  of Chacayes today and this is a way to recognise  our joint work. ABOVE OFFICIALS AT THE OPENING OF THE CHACAYES HYDRO PLANT RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE Our commitment to powering a cleaner world reects our  dedication to addressing climate change. We endeavour  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while meeting growing  global energy needs. There are four key components to our  response to climate change: 1 Developing more new renewable energy projects   to help reduce the global reliance on fossil fuels; 2 Helping our customers address their climate change   mitigation obligations and reach their voluntary targets   by providing suitable products and services; 3 Advocating for government action to reduce carbon   emissions; and 4 Minimising our own carbon footprint. Our development pipeline of renewable energy projects,  including run-of-river hydro plants, wind farms, conventional  geothermal projects and a large-scale solar farm, will allow us  to improve our products and services to meet the current and  future needs of our customers.  We advocate policy and industry responses to climate change.  This occurs in a range of ways, from working with governments  to address regulatory market issues impacting renewable energy  generation, to lobbying for the transition to a low-carbon economy. This year our carbon footprint reduced by 6 per cent, primarily  due to the completion of our Chacayes hydro plant in Chile and  we have set a global reduction target for our own electricity  consumption over the next two years. Climate change presents signicant opportunities as well as  considerable risk to our business. Changes to long-term climatic  conditions such as the number of extreme weather events have  the potential to impact our revenue and operating costs. Climate  change risks are addressed through our Risk Management  Framework, knowledge gathering from weather forecasting  services and risk management practices. Regulatory changes  related to climate change in areas such as carbon, electricity  and governance, pose potential risks and opportunities. Our  business model will allow us to act on opportunities to expand  our geographic spread and diversify into other renewable  technologies. In addition, we are well placed to increase business  and community awareness of climate change through our  stakeholder relationships.

Perenia has developed a diverse  portfolio of Certied Emission Reductions (CERs) from projects  in both developing and industrialised countries, operating  throughout Australia and Asia.  pereniacarbon.com  20  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE Operational excellence is sought in the management of all our  operational assets and is governed by our Asset Management  Framework and management systems. The framework and  systems ensure the operational aspects are managed giving  greater certainty of operating costs, short and long-term  availability, reliability, and safety of our generation assets. They  are also considered during the development and delivery phase,  to ensure that the lifecycle costs are optimised.  Four asset management benchmarking exercises and  operations performance reviews were conducted during the  reporting period. These initiatives evaluate the effectiveness  of our systems and processes, asset performance and condition.  The outcomes of these studies form the basis of our strategic  decisions in relation to the use, maintenance and expectations  of the assets lifetime performance. Our Operations and Engineering Services teams work to identify  opportunities to improve asset performance and reliability. During  the year, our Operations team in Australia implemented systems  to signicantly reduce turbine stoppages and made improvements  to cleaning and maintenance activities. In Brazil, we implemented  a remote system to control and respond to electrical faults using  iPhones. While being relatively minor changes, the initiatives  increased productivity and availability and decreased manual  handling risks, environmental spill risks and man power required,  as well as improving response times. We endeavour to be ahead  of the curve in our systems and asset operations to allow us to  anticipate, adapt and respond to meet changing standards in  electrical systems and health and safety. We take on work experience students, nal year engineering  students and apprentices to support local employment, industry  growth and enable cross sharing of information and experiences  between the students and our employees. We also work to better understand climatic conditions. In the  planning stages of wind projects, our engineers collate long-term  data from meteorological sources with our internal readings to  estimate wind conditions in any given area. Our internal data  comes from meteorological masts, or met masts, which are  erected at one or more points within a proposed project. These  met masts measure wind speed, turbulence, direction, temperature  and pressure. For accurate correlation and analysis of our data  with Bureau of Meteorology data, the quality and reliability of our  internal measurement is critical. Met masts are designed, installed  and operated according to wind monitoring industrial standards.  Data from met masts is subject to quality control checks. Our longest serving met mast stands at Cape Sir William Grant,  our nal development project in Portland, Victoria. Standing at  over 50 metres in height, the met mast has taken accurate wind  readings for over ten years. We have begun to investigate new  technologies for measuring wind conditions that offer increased  safety measures, provide greater economies of scale and allow  us to investigate more potential sites. TRICAHUE PARROTS, CHILE GEARBOX CHANGEOUT AT CHALLICUM HILLS WIND FARM, AUSTRALIA  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  21 PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE OUR POSITION Carbon pricing  We support a price on carbon. Australias Carbon Price Legislative  Package is a long-term foundation policy to assist Australias  transition to a low carbon economy. Working alongside the carbon  price, the Renewable Energy Target will remain the key driver of  investment in clean energy to 2020 in Australia. During the year we  contributed to the debate on carbon pricing through discussions with  industry groups, authorities, politicians, communities and the media. Energy reform We advocate for reforms to transmission and interconnector  investment frameworks, transmission project funding reforms  and emissions standards for new generation plants. We seek  a complementary reform package in energy policy and regulation  in order to ensure the countrys long-term goals to transform  the stationary energy sector to clean, renewable energy can  be achieved. Wind farm planning regulations We support the development of community engagement guidelines  and toolkits for wind farms. During the year, we made a number of  submissions regarding changes to South Australian and Victorian  wind farm planning regulations. Renewables and retail energy prices Strong interest in electricity retail price rises has recently focussed  on the cost of renewables to retail customers, even though large  scale renewables are a very small component of retail bills. We   have emphasised that around 90% of retail energy bills are driven   by network costs, generation costs and retail margins. This position  is backed by recent Government reports such as the Australian  Energy Market Commissions report on future retail prices, which  predicts that the impact of large scale renewable energy on price  rises is small. PUBLIC POLICY ADVOCACY Our involvement in public policy development reects our view  that policies in renewable energy are both a major opportunity  for our business and one of the key risks that we face.  Key issues in which we play a policy advocacy role are  listed on the following pages.  AUSTRALIA During the year we played a key role in advocacy for the renewable  energy industry as an independent company and as a member of  a number of industry bodies. In all arenas we highlight the benets  of renewable energy and proactively sought opportunities to  provide informed advice to local, state and federal policy makers  and regulatory bodies. LANE CROCKETT, GENERAL MANAGER AUSTRALIA, ENGAGING WITH OUR HOST COMMUNITIES  22  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 CHILE We continued to contribute to the development of the renewable  energy industry, focusing on engagement with political authorities,  energy and industry associations, technical bodies and  environmentalists. BRAZIL We continued to advocate for improvements to the electricity  grid in the Northeast of Brazil through the joint commissioning   of a study with Vale and other engagement activities. PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE OUR POSITION Transmission limitations for wind power generation  We support the proposal of a prioritisation scheme for grid  reinforcement in Northeast Brazil. The proposal, supported by a  study undertaken by Pacic Hydro and Vale, will be presented to   the National Operator of the System (Operador Nacional do Sistema  Eltrico) and the National Planning Agency (Empresa de Pesquisa  Energtica). It addresses investor concerns relating to a systemic  crisis in the energy sector, where energy not transmitted is idle, thus  increasing energy costs and sector risk for investors. PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE OUR POSITION Non-Conventional Renewable Energy Law Currently, only hydro power plants with an installed capacity of   below 20MW are classied by law as Non-Conventional Renewable  Energy (NCRE) generators. As it stands, this law precludes larger  scale run-of-river hydro projects from beneting from Chiles  renewable energy law. We believe the limit should be removed for  run-of-river hydro power plants, to promote development of larger  renewable energy projects which are better placed to efciently  utilise Chiles abundant water resources and which will stimulate  further investment. We also support the removal of the words  Non-Conventional from the law to prevent confusion when  considering energy alternatives that have been previously dened   as non-conventional. Such amendments will allow our own Chilean  assets that trade and commercialise carbon credits in international  markets, to be classied as renewable generators domestically and  be eligible for the same benets as small hydros. Transmission system and connection The ongoing development of energy projects is a key factor   to addressing the energy security goals in Chile. Currently, the  construction and approval process for transmission lines is delaying  the incorporation of new energy projects to the transmission system.  We have continued to work with energy sector authorities and the  Generators Association to pursue solutions, as well as preparing   an ofcial position statement with regard to this issue.  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  23 SUPPLY CHAIN We recognise our impacts on people, the environment and the  economy are driven not only by our direct activities, but also by  activities in our supply chain. Our sustainable supplier survey and  evaluation tool identies key sustainability risks and opportunities  across areas such as governance, safety, labour standards, local  content and environmental management. This year 27 supplier  surveys were evaluated including, for the rst time, six survey  responses from suppliers in Latin America.

Our Health, Safety and  Sustainability (HSS) Policy outlines our commitments to ensuring  a healthy and safe environment for our employees. Each year,  corporate HSS objectives are set with the aim of decreasing injury  rates, improving management systems and increasing employee  engagement. Performance against these objectives is directly  linked to each employees performance appraisal and short-term  incentive payment.  2008–12 OVERALL TOTAL RECORDABLE INJURY FREQUENCY RATE  (TRIFR) 2008–12 TOTAL RECORDABLE INJURY FREQUENCY RATE (TRIFR)  BY BUSINESS UNIT * FROM 1 JULY 2011, THE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS UNIT INCLUDED CORPORATE HOURS AND INCIDENTS. 2008–12 TOTAL NUMBER OF INCIDENTS REPORTED DISASTER AND EMERGENCY PLANNING Coordinated emergency management plans, including  emergency evacuation programs, are in place at all operational  and development project sites. These systems are tested  annually via desktop reviews and mock exercises. A number of  community planning bodies are consulted during the development  and/or testing of our emergency plans to ensure appropriate  and adequate training is provided to all response personnel.  Mock exercises are attended by employees, contractors, local  emergency response services and other community members. We are in the process of building a heights training facility at  one of our regional ofces in Victoria to provide a controlled  environment in which to test and train employees in heights safety. All site-based leading hands receive re warden training.  All Melbourne staff were given the opportunity to complete  re extinguisher and hose reel training with the Melbourne  Metropolitan Fire Brigade.  Periodic re evacuation exercises are undertaken at each of our  ofces to ensure our employees are evacuated quickly and safely.  HEALTH AND SAFETY We follow ILO standards in each of our countries of  operations in classifying and responding to incidents.

We  have a broad range of strategies within our health and wellbeing  program, which are designed to prevent serious conditions and  illnesses in employees.  A formal Health and Wellbeing Policy is currently under  development and will be supported by a range of initiatives.  A number of core initiatives are already implemented globally,  such as the daily provision of fresh fruit, annual health checks,  u shots, audiometric testing and pre-placement health  screening for relevant staff, periodic ergonomic assessments  of work stations and language lessons (English classes in Chile  and Brazil, and Spanish classes in Australia). Health and safety  leadership training sessions were held in each business unit,  which all employees were encouraged to attend. Employee  Assistance Programs are available in Australia and Chile. Other  initiatives are country specic. For example, employees in Chile  can participate in company-sponsored sporting events, such as  long distance cycling, mountain climbing, fun runs and a womens  soccer tournament held between major energy companies in  Santiago. Brazilian employees have access to health insurance,  a dental plan and subsidised meal vouchers. The Australian  business unit received a $10,000 grant from the Victorian  Government to be used for health and wellbeing initiatives  to support existing programs. One of these was an initiative  that aims to prevent work-related psychological injuries and  occupational stress.  In Australia and Chile, we have also implemented health  and safety awards to recognise and reward employees for  outstanding behaviour or identifying improvement opportunities  to systems, processes or equipment to reduce risks relating  to health and safety. HEALTH AND SAFETY SYSTEMS Ensuring the health and safety of our employees,  contractors and other stakeholders will always  be our primary concern. One of the challenges  of having operations in three distinct geographic  regions is achieving consistency in our approach  to managing health and safety. While being  geographically diverse, our projects and assets in  Australia, Chile and Brazil can be similar in terms  of activities performed, and related risks. All three  business units operated under an effective group- wide Health, Safety and Sustainability Policy and  successful Health, Safety and Environmental  (HSE) procedures and processes in each country.  However, we identied an opportunity to develop  and implement a consistent, group-wide HSE  management system.  A set of Pacic Hydros Group Health and Safety  Standards were developed after an extensive  consultation process that included corporate and  business unit health and safety teams and a review  of industry best practices. The standards were  developed at a group level above the business  units and act as a framework to drive alignment  of the business unit management systems. They  are also fully integrated with our Enterprise Wide  Risk Management system to ensure that strategic  development, governance, compliance and risks  cover health and safety impacts. Looking forward, guidance documents will be  developed to identify minimum requirements and  to ensure consistency. An audit tool has also been  developed and will be implemented in a three year  staged approach. The tool will assist business  units to comply with the standards and promote  continual improvement.

We are proud  of our inclusive and diverse culture and have taken steps to  strengthen this through the launch of our comprehensive Inclusion  and Diversity Strategy. Equal employment opportunity and anti- discrimination are specically addressed in our Code of Conduct. Our workplace is family friendly and we encourage employees  to manage family commitments with work responsibilities through  a host of initiatives. Opportunities such as part-time employment,  job sharing, working from home and staggered start and nish  times are offered to employees, where appropriate, in an effort  to achieve work/life balance. Our Maternity and Paternity Leave  Policies were merged during the year into a Parental Leave Policy,  which goes beyond statutory requirements relating to parental  leave rights in each of our countries.

We provide a broad  spectrum of internal training courses that are offered to all ofce  and site-based employees. Employees are also given generous  funding support to attend external training or to pursue further  education opportunities. These training and development  programs equip our staff with the necessary knowledge, skills,  behaviours and commitment to drive business performance  and enable growth and success. Our training and development  spend for the reporting period was $642,000, which equates  to over $2,000 per employee. We continue to invest heavily in internal and external training  specic to health and safety matters. We have implemented a  variety of training courses, including hazard and risk identication,  incident investigation, monthly online training courses on a variety  of issues including manual handling and slips, trips and falls. All employees receive annual performance appraisals, in  which performance targets are set in line with our business plan.  Six-monthly reviews are held to assess performance against  targets before the annual performance appraisals. Professional  development opportunities are formally identied and discussed  during employee performance appraisals.  Our education sponsorship program was designed to help  employees develop their skills through part time, long-term  study and provide the opportunity to earn or improve a formal  qualication. Each business unit has a tailored program to meet  regional and staff requirements and have established their own  assessment criteria. Currently, there are eight employees in  Australia, ve in Brazil and 11 in Chile participating in the program.  We encourage movement between business units as a way  of developing employees, sharing skills and improving cultural  awareness between our countries of operation. Previously,  most transfers were Australians moving to Chile as the Chilean  business unit expanded rapidly. In the past year, however, a  number of Chileans were successfully seconded to Australia in  key roles. We will continue to look for opportunities to transfer  employees between business units.  Where required, restructuring processes are managed in  Australia through our Redundancy Policy. Statutory requirements  in Chile and Brazil include similar provisions for employees in  those regions. A Retirement Transition Policy is currently under  development and will be launched later this year. AUSTRALIA 9% BRAZIL 19% CHILE 11% FEMALE 0 4 8 12 16 MALE 4 7 2 3 12 2 NO.

It was an opportunity to share  what diversity means to Pacic Hydro and formally  announce our new Inclusion and Diversity Strategy  and Statement: Pacic Hydro is committed to promoting a  work environment where inclusion and diversity  are valued and where people in each of our  geographic business units are involved, supported,  respected and treated fairly. We believe that having people with diverse  capabilities, ways of thinking and experience  will benet our workplace and create a competitive  advantage. To achieve this we will develop a  culture that includes, attracts and retains a broad  range of personal backgrounds and attributes  in the company. The statement was developed using feedback  provided from internal employee workshops.  The strategy will initially focus on cultural diversity,  work/life exibility and gender diversity. Each ofce shared presentations to learn about  the cultures of Australia, Brazil and Chile. In Australia, the Melbourne ofce hosted a  lunch, with national dish contributions from  over 15 countries, while in our regional ofces  in Portland and Yambuk, staff got into the spirit  by enjoying some sweets from Chile and Brazil. In Brazil, the team used video conference to link  its two ofces (in Natal and So Paulo), enjoying  a morning tea and a variety of juices from different  regions in the country.  Staff in Chile shared dishes from around the world,  including England, Canada, Australia, Malaysia,  Holland, Venezuela, Panama, Nicaragua and Chile,  and many chose to dress up in their national dress.

In  response to feedback from employees about the length and  complexity of the survey, and to gain a deeper understanding of  employee engagement and alignment with our business strategies  and objectives, we changed to an Organisational Alignment and  Engagement Survey. While maintaining a few core questions, the  new survey uses different methodology and thus results cannot  accurately be compared to previous years.  The diagram to the right shows our alignment and engagement  results. The results indicate that our employees are passionate  and engaged, but we recognise areas for improvement to raise  our alignment score. Results are displayed as a percentage of  employees who scored statements as agree or strongly agree  on a seven-point rating scale. The colour-coding indicates how  our average raw score compares to other organisations in the  benchmark database (yellow is bottom decile, light yellow is  bottom quartile, light blue is second and third quartile, light green  is top quartile and dark green is top decile. The results indicate that our Overall Global Alignment score  was 51%, which sits in the second and third quartile when  compared to the benchmark database. Our Overall Global  Engagement score was 66%, also in the second and third quartile,  and only 5% below the top quartile. Although revealing areas for  improvement, the response rate of 84% demonstrates the value  that employees place on this exercise. Whilst the overall scores are made up of a number of indicators,  two strategic areas – senior leadership and overall alignment –  have been identied as areas for further attention. We have set a  Key Performance Indicator to increase scores in those areas to  move into the next quartile. Targeted initiatives and programs will  continue to be implemented to address issues raised during the  survey process.

In Australia, 5.6% of  employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  No direct employees in Chile are covered by collective bargaining  agreements and employees in Brazil are covered under relevant  legislation. We have not identied any risks at any of our  operations relating to the rights of employees to freedom of  association or collective bargaining. Employee grievances are covered by our Grievance Procedure,  Whistleblower Disclosure and Investigation Procedure, Equal  Opportunity Policy and Code of Conduct. These policies and  procedures encourage employees to seek and use appropriate  mechanisms to address any grievances. Any issue not adequately  addressed through these internal provisions can be taken to our  Employee Assistance Program or relevant external organisations. All employees in Australia and Chile complete annual training  in our Equal Opportunity (EO) Policy. Two complaints under the  EO Policy were made during the reporting period. Both incidents  were investigated under the EO Policy guidelines, appropriate  disciplinary action was taken, and both incidents are now resolved.  We are currently developing similar policies for our Brazil ofce. There were no reported incidents of discrimination during the  reporting period.  REMUNERATION AND BONUSES Our Remuneration Policy aims to attract, motivate, and retain  employees by aligning team and individual rewards with business  performance and ultimately value creation for shareholders. It  ensures employees are remunerated in a way that is both market  competitive and consistent with best practice. Global consistency  of our remuneration structure and rewarding both nancial and  non-nancial performance are key aspects of the policy.  We did not employ any entry-level employees during the reporting  period, but our minimum wage levels across all our regions meet  or exceed legal minimums. All benets provided to full-time employees are granted to all   part-time employees on a pro-rata basis. LOOKING AHEAD: STRATEGIES FOR 2012–17 2012–13 2013–17 HEALTH AND SAFETY Build and sustain a strong health and safety culture within  the company and have zero harm to employees and others To have zero harm to employees and others  EMPLOYEES Attract, recruit, develop and retain employees through the  Human Resources Framework to maximise performance Promote an inclusive culture that embraces diversity Continue to measure, maintain and improve employee  satisfaction and alignment  COMMUNITY OUR APPROACH As an employer, neighbour, customer and supplier, we  have a multi-faceted role in the local communities which  we operate in around the world. We aim to develop mutual trust and respect with our local  communities through honest and open communication. Our goal is to deliver community programs and initiatives  that provide clear benets and meaningful outcomes that  make a lasting difference to our host communities and that  are aligned ultimately with our own corporate objectives. We do this by:  communicating openly and constructively with our  local communities;  becoming involved in and supporting projects  and events near our project sites so we can better  understand and become part of our host communities;  and  leveraging off our areas of expertise to address  community needs. PROGRESS AGAINST GOALS FOR 2011–12 STRATEGIES PROGRESS ON DELIVERABLES COMMUNITY RELATIONS Engage openly with our local communities and maintain  our community relations programs  A wide range of activities were undertaken throughout the  year to enable us to better understand, support and enhance  our host communities. (p.33–37) COMMUNITY INVESTMENT Continue and enhance our community investment programs   (eg Sustainable Communities Fund in Australia and Creciendo  Juntos in Chile)  Our community investment programs continue, including  an external review which was undertaken to ensure that  they continue to provide maximum benet to our local  communities. (p.33) 32  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  33 COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND CONSULTATION Our approach to community consultation ensures stakeholders are  both well informed and have the opportunity to provide feedback  in the development of proposed projects. Consultation styles  are adapted to suit the needs of the local community and other  stakeholders. The methods of consultation and engagement  range from formal and informal community consultation sessions,  newsletters and surveys, to community investment activities and  dedicated community relations staff.  Our Community Charter aims to ensure our approach to  communities is consistent across the globe. Additionally, our  Community Affairs Policy in Brazil provides further guidance on  developing and sustaining relationships with local communities  in the region. DEVELOPING COMMUNITIES In Australia, we participated in the Future Leaders of Industry  program, providing opportunities for young people in rural areas  to gain hands-on experience in their chosen industry or career.  Students in the program are appointed a mentor, and spend a full  day in the workplace, learning about the industry, job roles and  potential educational pathways. Participants also work on personal  skills development, leadership skills, presentation development,  communication and goal setting.  Our wind farms in Brazil host regular education sessions with  high schools, technical institutes and universities through our  Open Doors program. Students from local primary and secondary  schools, indigenous schools and technical institutes, as well as  other visitors to the wind farms learn about energy generation,  particularly renewable energy, and its impact on the Brazilian  electrical system. Depending on their educational requirements,  they also learn about operations systems and processes, some  technical activities, our environmental obligations and activities,  as well as general concepts of sustainability. We continued our partnership with OTIC (Organismo Tcnico  Intermedio de Capacitacin OHiggins), an intermediate technical  training agency, and the Hope Corporation (Corporacin La  Esperanza) in Chile. This year the partnership provided training to  36 people from the local communities of Coya, Chacayes Termas  de Cauquenes, on leather craft, wood carving and catering. These  topics were decided through community consultation sessions  to determine areas of development interest within the local area.  Since 2007, over 380 local residents have received training  through this program.  IMPACTS COMMUNITY INVESTMENT PROGRAMS Our aim is to operate in a socially responsible way, maintaining  good relations and promoting social development and cohesion  in our host communities. Local community engagement, impact  assessments and development programs have been implemented  at all of our operations, except our Australian hydro plants.  Community investment funds have also been established at each  of our operations, except our Australian hydro plants, and are  tailored to the needs of each different community. Through each  fund, a portion of prots made by each project are invested back  into local communities through a number of grants in education,  health and safety, environment, sport, culture and the arts.  While the investment programs are tailored to each site to  best address the needs of each community, we have been  very successful in knowledge-sharing between business units  to improve how the programs operate. Through the funds, we  strategically promote innovative, creative solutions to local issues,  encouraging organisations to create partnerships delivering  community services. In this way, we hope to work towards  achieving positive, long term outcomes that have broader  community outcomes.  In Australia, the Challicum Hills Sustainable Communities Fund  provided $5,000 to implement a mentoring program for at risk  youth. This innovative program trains volunteers as mentors who  then spend regular time with children at risk of neglect or abuse.   The mentors offer a supportive, non-judgemental relationship to  the parent(s) and the child offering practical guidance and help  in accessing social and recreational activities. Our Brazilian business unit continues to develop their fund,  providing training and development to community leaders and  other key gures, including teachers and business owners, in  how to successfully develop funding applications.  One of the projects supported by Creciendo Juntos, our  community investment program in Chile, was to put a roof on  the Chacayes local gymnasium. Three different groups prepared  separate applications, all relating to the gym roof, all of which  were successful. Due to the support of Pacic Hydro, the  applicants were able to secure additional funding from other  sources, including the local government. Since completion, the  gym has become a hub for one of the communities of the Alto  Cachapoal Valley (Chacayes), hosting social gatherings and  town meetings as well as sporting activities.  34  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 COMMUNITY INVESTMENT FUND SPEND INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT Often our projects are located in rural areas with small populations  and low economic activity. In addition to our standard community  investment activities, a useful way for us to have a positive impact  is by assisting with the development of infrastructure or provision  of support in areas such as education. In Australia, our Community Relations team provide in-kind  support to many of our partner organisations. One of these  groups is the Portland Young Professionals Network, comprised  of around 70 residents aged from 20 to 35. The group is auspiced  by the Committee for Portland and aims to address some of the  challenges around attracting and retaining young professionals  in regional areas. It offers social, personal and professional  development opportunities for members as well as supporting  local events through volunteering. Pacic Hydro has supported  the group by providing staff with expertise in areas like social  media to share that knowledge with network members. Local staff  also provide some administrative and communications support  and event facilitation. Two unsealed roads connect residents of the small township of  Barra do Camaratuba with the larger municipality of Mataraca  City. During the wet season, road conditions deteriorate quickly,  preventing children from Barra do Camaratuba from attending  school and community members from accessing medical facilities  and other essential services. We engaged a local road works  company to grade and level the road, allowing the lives of these  community members to return to normal. We provided funding for a language teacher at a rural Chilean  school, giving local teachers and students the opportunity to  develop valuable foreign language skills. The Colegio San Lorenzo  (San Lorenzo Primary School), located in the Machal township,  near our Chacayes, Coya and Pangal hydro power plants, now  has an in-house English teacher who takes classes for both  students and teachers. We also provide support with maintenance  and watering of the roads around our host communities to avoid  real or potential impacts of trucks on local roads. We have also  assisted local community members in Chile to apply to a program  that promotes ecotourism within the Reserva Nacional Rio de los  Cipreses, located close to our hydro plants. The program is jointly  run by the Chilean environmental and tourism bodies, CONAF  and SERNATUR. Pacic Hydro helped community members to  identify and dene potential projects, and to develop and submit  applications for funding. Some of the projects we helped develop  are to provide healthy food items for visitors, develop an area at  the reserve entrance for souvenir trade, provide a service of local  guides for tours in the reserve and to develop a camping site. In all our countries of operation, we also provide training and other  assistance to individuals and community groups. Examples include  in health, safety, environmental matters, sustainability, marketing  and public relations, cultural and indigenous heritage, and other  sessions as required. Old electrical hardware, including printers,  computers and laptops are also donated to community groups  where possible. In isolation these may seem small initiatives, but collectively they  make a powerful impact, as each one results in positive outcomes  for our host communities. 0 50,000 100,000 150,000 200,000 250,000 $300,000 2008–09 2009–10 2010–11 2011–12 AUSTRALIA CHILE BRAZIL INVESTED IN COMMUNITIES MAKING IMPROVEMENTS TO LOCAL ROADS IN BRAZIL  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  35 JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND LOCAL SOURCING Although our policies and procedures do not specically  mandate using locally based contractors and suppliers, or  directly employing locally, we endeavour to support local  communities wherever possible. We dene local as the region  in which a project or asset is located. In Australia, we continue to actively seek and engage local  suppliers and contractors where they are competitive in price,  quality and service. In Ararat, Victoria, over $250,000 was spent  during the reporting period with local engineering companies  through the manufacturing of turbine parts. In Portland, Victoria,  over $600,000 was spent on maintenance activities performed  by local labour and maintenance contractors. Supporting local  workers and local industry provides benets, not only to our own  organisation, but to the sustainable development of the region. In the Northeast of Brazil, our two development projects, Paraiso  Azul and Paraiso Farol, are moving towards construction phase.  In preparation for this, we have partnered with a local technical  institute to provide skills training to local residents in a number of  areas. Participation in this program will not guarantee employment  once the projects reach construction, but provides them with  the skills required to apply for available positions, either with our  projects or for other organisations. It also provides an increase  of skilled workers in the region.  In Chile, our Chacayes hydro plant moved from construction  to operations phase, signicantly reducing the workforce  required. We have worked closely with employment groups  representing workers from the Chacayes area to ensure where  local workers have the necessary skills and qualications,  they be given opportunity to apply for and receive employment  at our asset. In each of our business units, we have employed apprentices  as part of our commitment to developing young workers in rural  and regional areas. For employees, apprenticeships recognise  existing skills, provide a combination of training and employment  and experience and lead to nationally recognised qualications.  They also offer local employment opportunities to assist with the  prevention of population decline in regional areas. CELEBRATING MATARACA CITIZENS DAY   IN BRAZIL Every Brazilian resident is required to possess  a birth certicate and personal identication card  as legal proof of their identity. However, not all  residents of Mataraca City and the surrounding  district (the community that hosts our Vale dos  Ventos and Millennium wind farms in Northeast  Brazil), are able to travel to a doctor to register  their children, or can afford the notary fees to  obtain personal identication cards. This means  these citizens are not legally recognised by the  Brazilian Government, are unable to gain legal  employment and cannot fully participate in and  contribute to community life.  For the second consecutive year, Pacic Hydro,  along with the Mataraca City Hall and a number  of other sponsors, organised the Mataraca  Citizenship Day. Around 1,500 residents from  the city and surrounding areas participated in the  free event, receiving legal documentation such as  birth certicates, personal identication cards and  electoral cards. Medical and oral health checks,  nutritional information sessions, including cooking  demonstrations and environmental education and  awareness training, were also provided. Programs  like the Mataraca City Citizenship Day allow us  to make a tangible difference to the lives of those  living near to our operations.  ABOVE LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS ATTENDING THE MATARACA CITIZENS DAY  36  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 VISUAL AMENITY We recognise that developing and operating a wind farm creates  changes to the visual landscape of an area. In Australia, as part of  our planning application process and environmental assessment,  independent landscape and visual impact assessments are  conducted. This includes production of a series of photomontages  depicting how the wind farm will look from a number of different  local viewpoints. These montages are made available during the  community consultation process and form part of the planning  application documentation.  At Keyneton Wind Farm in South Australia, we trialled a new  feedback methodology that included comments from community  members on their values and relationship with the landscape.  As part of our community engagement processes the landscape  architect undertook a cognitive mapping exercise where  participants were asked to analyse a series of qualitative values  relating to landscape surrounding the proposed wind farm, and  also complete a landscape survey. The outcomes of this exercise  were included within the landscape and visual impact assessment  included within the planning application.  The ndings from the landscape value assessment, along with  those from the cultural heritage assessment and environmental  and biodiversity considerations, were signicant enough for us to  revise the turbine layout. This includes the removal of 18 turbines  to minimise the impact on the community and the environment.  While there is opposition to this project within the Keyneton  community, we welcome communication and continue to engage  community members throughout the entire development process. Once projects reach operations, we work with impacted land  holders to minimise their visual impact through a series of  measures. Our visual screening program in Portland was  completed during the reporting period with all cooperating  landholders.  In Brazil, a questionnaire was developed for the Touros community  to assess attitudes towards the local lighthouse. The results will  assist us in understanding the value given to visual amenity in the  area, and how our proposed turbines might affect this. Further  assessment and discussion will be undertaken should ndings  indicate additional landscape characteristics were important to  the community. COMMUNITY ATTITUDES TO WIND FARMS  IN AUSTRALIA In November 2011, we commissioned an  independent research company, Qdos, to conduct  community polling on attitudes to wind farms and  renewable energy. The telephone survey interviewed one thousand  residents across Victoria, New South Wales and  South Australia, in areas where wind farms are  already in existence or under development. We  were especially interested to hear what local  communities living close to existing and proposed  wind farms had to say, said Lane Crockett,  General Manager, Pacic Hydro Australia. The key ndings included: – Community support for wind energy remains  strong, both nationally and in each state, with  83% nationally, 84% in Victoria, 90% in South  Australia and 77% in New South Wales.  – Support in Victoria for wind farms remains  almost unchanged with 2010 results at 83%  per cent and 2011 results at 84%.  – Nationally, over 7 in 10 people support wind  farms being built nearby and over 8 in 10 agree  that wind farms are an important part of our  clean energy future.  The results conrm that the majority of regional  Australians support wind generation and continue  to have positive attitudes towards wind farms in  their local communities. It also conrms that wind  energy is overwhelmingly more popular than non- renewable forms of energy. The results of the poll coincided with the release of  a report from the CSIRO on Exploring community  acceptance of rural wind farms in Australia and  conrm the headline nding that there is stronger  community support for the development of wind  farms than might otherwise be assumed from  media coverage.  www.pacichydro.com.au/les/2012/01/  2011-Community-Polling-Presentation- Results.pdf ABOVE LANDHOLDERS AT THE CODRINGTON WIND FARM, VICTORIA  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  37 HEALTH There has been signicant debate and media coverage on  the effects of wind farms on health, wildlife and amenity. In  relation to perceived health concerns we rely on the advice  from Governments and reputable health organisations. There are  now 17 international reviews on the risks of health impacts from  wind farms. The ndings are consistent in that there is no credible  evidence in the peer reviewed published scientic literature that  there are any direct adverse physiological health effects from  exposure to wind turbines.  To inform ourselves and the community, we commissioned an  independent acoustics consultancy, Sonus, to measure the levels  of infrasound near two of our wind farms, as infrasound is often  cited as the potential cause of ill-health. The measurements  indicate the levels of infrasound from the wind farms are below  human perception levels and are lower than those found at the  beach, in the city and near a gas red power station. However, poorly designed wind farms can cause annoyance to  some nearby neighbours if the audible noise levels are too high.  See p.42 for more information on wind farms and noise. Renewable power is safer, cleaner and healthier than fossil fuel  based generation. We have called for a review of the health  impact from all forms of power generation so that policy makers  and communities can make informed choices on the best  technologies for the future. We have also called for health impact  assessments to be included in the planning decisions for new  power generation plant. INFRASOUND Infrasound is a naturally occurring phenomenon which is  constantly present in the atmosphere and can be emitted naturally  in the human body, generated by natural sources such as waves  and waterfalls. It can also be emitted from man-made sources  such as vehicles, air-conditioning systems and wind farms. The Queensland Department of Environment and Resource  Management sets the common audibility threshold for infrasound  noise level at 85 dB(G). This threshold allows an acceptable level  of infrasound in the environment from a noise source to protect  against the potential onset of annoyance.  Independent studies show that infrasound generated by wind  turbines is well below such established thresholds of perception  and is similar to levels produced by other natural and man-made  sources.  www.pacichydro.com.au/les/2011/10/  Sonus-Report.pdf LOOKING AHEAD: STRATEGIES FOR 2012–17 2012–13 2013–17 COMMUNITY RELATIONS Develop, implement and manage programs that positively  engage local communities Further enhance community relations COMMUNITY INVESTMENT Promote and improve our community investment programs Further enhance community investment programs  ENVIRONMENT OUR APPROACH We aim to provide a net benet to our planet by producing  renewable energy with minimal impact on biodiversity,  natural resources and our climate. We do this by:  implementing environmental management systems and  continuously improving our environmental performance;   understanding that reducing the impacts of climate  change begins with our own activities and working  to reduce our own carbon footprint; and   regularly engaging policy makers, local communities  and the general public on renewable energy and  broader climate change issues and advocating  climate change policies in our areas of interest. PROGRESS AGAINST GOALS FOR 2011–12 STRATEGIES PROGRESS ON DELIVERABLES ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT Maintain environmental management systems  and meet compliance obligations  All operational sites operate under an Environmental  Management System (EMS) and we received no  environmental nes. (p.39) CARBON MANAGEMENT Develop a carbon strategy and value proposition   including corporate goals and targets  A carbon strategy and value proposition was developed   and endorsed by the General Management Committee. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE Incorporate sustainability metrics (eg International   Hydropower Association Sustainability Assessment   Protocol) into annual operations performance reviews  Sustainability metrics were incorporated into our Asset  Management Framework and Benchmarking Exercise. 38  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  39 ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND OUR  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM We aim to be an industry leader in environmental management,  continually striving to improve our environmental performance  and practices. We conduct our business in accordance with  the spirit and letter of all applicable environmental laws and  regulations. Our Health, Safety and Sustainability (HSS) Policy  includes our environmental aims and the manner in which we  seek to achieve those aims. It is applicable to all employees and  directors, as well as contractors and visitors to our sites or ofces. The HSS Policy is implemented in part through our  Environmental Management System (EMS). Every operational  site operates under an EMS, which is based upon or certied to  the international standard in environmental management systems,  ISO 14001. Regular internal and external audits occur to ensure  compliance against ISO 14001, the responsibility for which lies  with country-level environment managers and Health, Safety  and Environment teams.  During the reporting period we recorded one spill classied  as signicant under our EMS, which was a sulphur hexauoride  (SF6) gas leak of 0.740 grams. No nes were received during the reporting period relating  to non-compliance with any environmental laws or regulations.  We received two non-monetary sanctions in Chile. BIODIVERSITY Biodiversity is a major consideration during the early phases of  project development. We undertake extensive site assessments  and surveys of both ora and fauna, including species of concern  to stakeholders such as avifauna (birds and bats), terrestrial fauna,  ora and threatened species.  Assessments of species were recently carried out as part of the  environmental assessment at our proposed Keyneton Wind Farm  in Australia. Following these assessments, and in accordance  with the ecological consultants recommendations, a number of  modications to the proposed turbine layout were made. These  included removing or relocating turbines in order to avoid habitat  or respect buffer zones around ecologically sensitive areas. In Brazil, our First Steps biodiversity program, developed for our  Paraiso Azul and Paraiso Farol wind farms will help us to identify  site biodiversity, potential impacts of our activities and the most  appropriate ways to minimise and mitigate these impacts. The  First Steps program will ensure adequate controls are in place in  terms of required documentation, compliance with relevant legal  requirements and demonstrate our commitment to responsible,  sustainable development. In Chile, we continue to work on a cumulative impact assessment  to better understand social and environmental impacts occurring in  the Cachapoal Valley, where our Coya, Pangal and Chacayes hydro  plants are located. The information gathered includes data on  current use of and activities occurring in the Valley, and will allow  for more comprehensive planning and decision-making related  to current and future projects in the area. We also continued our  partnership with the Alto Cachapoal Scientic Fund to promote  research and knowledge related to the Cachapoal Basin.  NATIVE VEGETATION While we take a precautionary approach to all our development,  construction and operating activities, occasionally some tasks  require us to remove or otherwise interfere with native vegetation.  We abide by all local and national legislative requirements  concerning native vegetation and we minimise interference and  damage through systematic site surveys, careful environmental  planning and appropriate offsetting arrangements.  Over 60 hectares of land within the Upper Cachapoal Valley were  used during construction of Chacayes for tasks such as access,  working platforms and temporary sites ofces. To date, more  than 75% of the affected land has been restored with 14 species  native to the area, and the remaining land will be completed during  FY2012–13.  THREATENED SPECIES While our operations do not directly impact any conservation- signicant species, any such species or habitats that may  potentially be affected by our operations are identied during our  environmental assessments and appropriate mitigation measures  put in place within site Environmental Management Plans. These  include regular monitoring, timely restoration of disturbed areas  and establishing habitat diversity within reclaimed areas.  40  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ENERGY USE This year Pacic Hydros assets generated more than   1.8 million megawatt hours of clean, renewable energy, leading  to the abatement of more than 1.2 million tonnes of greenhouse  gas emissions. During the reporting period, 4,440 tonnes1 of greenhouse gas  emissions were generated through construction, operation and  ofce-based activities and 41,982 gigajoules of energy consumed. The construction of the Chacayes run-of-river hydro project  accounted for 52% of the companys total greenhouse  gas emissions and 67% of energy consumption during the  reporting period, mainly resulting from vehicle diesel consumption.  The project reached completion during the reporting period,  resulting in a 41% decrease in emissions from the project which  in turn reduced the companys total emissions by 6% from the  previous year. Emissions were 19% lower across our other assets and ofces  in Chile.  In Australia, greenhouse emissions increased from 117 tonnes  to 1,528 tonnes, although 1,332 tonnes of this increase was  due to changing the way we report emissions from purchased  electricity use. In previous years we reported zero emissions  because we use 100% GreenPower, sourced from our renewable  energy assets. This year, while we still use 100% GreenPower,  we have aligned our reporting methods with the Australia  NGERs legislation, which does not recognise the actual source,  but instead attributes a state based emissions factor to all  electricity consumption. In Brazil, emissions were 1% lower than the previous year.  The majority of emissions were generated from electricity  consumption and transport vehicles. Scope 3 emissions reduction initiatives implemented during  the year included reducing air travel, increasing length of trips  and promoting the use of video conferencing. Data collection is  improving and we anticipate that we will be able to include ight  emissions data in next years report. The emissions intensity of our operations is signicantly lower  than conventional electricity generators, because our power  stations utilise zero-emission sources of fuel such as wind and  water rather than higher emission sources such as coal and gas. 1 Includes scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions of assets and ofces  over which Pacic Hydro has operational control, regardless of who owns  the assets. 2009–12 TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (SCOPE 1 AND 2)   BY COUNTRY 2009–12 TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (SCOPE 1 AND 2)   BY SOURCE  EMISSIONS INTENSITY OF OPERATIONS (TONNES C02-E/MWH) COUNTRY EMISSIONS INTENSITY  Australia  0.00102 Brazil 0.00081 Chile 0.00082 (*NOTE: THIS CALCULATION CONSIDERS OPERATIONS EMISSIONS OF ASSETS ONLY, NOT CORPORATE OFFICES) 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 2011–12 2010–11 2009–10 tCO2-e 1,527 116 144 146 2,767 TOTAL 4,440 TOTAL 4,743 TOTAL 7,586 4,480 340 76 7,169 AUSTRALIA BRAZIL CHILE 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 tCO2-e STATIONARY ENERGY (DIESEL, LPG, PETROL) – SCOPE 1 PURCHASED ELECTRICITY – SCOPE 2 TRANSPORT ENERGY (DIESEL, E-25, PETROL) – SCOPE 1 153 2,154 2,050 TOTAL 4,357 1,285 127 3,292 TOTAL 4,704 1,380 481 5,693 TOTAL 7,554 2011–12 2010–11 2009–10  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  41 ANDEAN CONDOR CONSERVATION PROGRAM The Andean Condor is a Chilean national symbol,  currently listed as near threatened on the  International Union for the Conservation of Nature  (IUCN) Red List.  While our projects do not have an impact on  Andean Condors or their habitat, we recognise the  signicance of this iconic species to Chilean  people and our local communities. This has  inspired us to work together with the Chilean  Ornithological Association to support the  rehabilitation of injured condors. The Andean Condor conservation program  rehabilitates injured condors and takes condors  born in captivity through a complex process of  medical recovery, socialisation and muscle  development. Injured condors that have previously  lived in the wild usually require minimal assistance.  However, birds born in captivity require a long,  complex and costly rehabilitation. In March 2012, we achieved a special milestone,  releasing ve condors back into the wild in the Alto  Cachapoal Valley, close to our Chacayes run of  river hydro plant. Prior to release, condors are tted with microchips,  wing bands and radio or satellite transmitters to  allow comprehensive and ongoing monitoring of  the birds reintegration back into the environment.  The conservation program also provides  educational materials and activities to promote the  work being undertaken.

In Australia, we communicate with landholders, neighbours and  communities about wind farm noise emissions generated by our  wind farms from the design stage through to planning application,  construction and operation. We commission independent acoustic  consultants to provide noise impact assessments, including  background noise monitoring, to demonstrate compliance with  the government regulations and planning conditions.  After commissioning, testing of noise levels occurs to  demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements. Wind farm  noise may be audible at times depending on house location and  factors such as the number of turbines operating, wind speed and  wind direction and other atmospheric conditions like temperature  or humidity. We continue to work with individual community  members to address their concerns. We have a formal complaints procedure which can be used  by members of the community if they have concerns relating  to Pacic Hydro, including issues relating to noise.  RECYCLED ART AT BARRA DO CAMARATUBA  PRIMARY SCHOOL IN BRAZIL Over the last few years, we have partnered with the  Barra do Camaratuba Primary School to work on  projects to benet the school. This year, grade ve  students suggested an environmental initiative that  not only would benet the environment, but would  leave a lasting reminder of their time at the school.  Their idea was to upgrade the schools facade as  the name of the school had become faded and dull  over time. Engaging students from other year levels  at the school, as well as the rest of the Barra do  Camaratuba community – around 900 residents –  the children collected thousands of polyethylene  terephthalate (PET) plastic bottle caps. The caps  were then stuck onto the wall, repainting the school  name in a bright and colourful design. PET bottle  caps cannot be recycled at many sorting  and recycling facilities and often end up in landll,  so collecting and using the caps for something  useful addresses an environmental issue in a very  creative way. Not only did the project give the school facade a  facelift, it provided the students and residents of  the community an opportunity to think about waste  creation, innovative ideas about recycling  opportunities and about the concept of  sustainability in a broader context. Pacic Hydro  is proud to participate in projects that engage local  youth, promote environmental sustainability and  add value and bring together local communities  in this way. ABOVE IMPROVING THE BARRA DO CAMARATUBA SCHOOL WALL  PACIFIC HYDRO ANNUAL REVIEW & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2012  43 WATER We rely on water to power our hydro plants in Australia and Chile.  In all cases, water is diverted from a river or pre-existing storage  source, through our power stations and then returned to the  adjacent river system. This method ensures minimal ooding, has  low environmental impact and requires only non-consumptive  water rights.  Our operational wind farms consume only minimal volumes of  water sourced from on-site rain water tanks. In Brazil, we measure  our water use. However, in Australia, we do not have systems in  place to measure water use at many sites as we have chosen to  focus on other aspects of resource use, namely paper use, energy  consumption and waste generation. In Chile, we monitor water levels to ensure water ow is adequate  to preserve aquatic life and river-bank dwelling species. Water  quality is also monitored at Chacayes Liquid Industrial Waste  Treatment plant to minimise the risk of contaminated water  affecting the environment or communities.  The Cachapoal River, the source for our Chacayes hydro plant,  is used by a number of other stakeholders in the Cachapoal Valley  including mining organisations, other hydro plants, irrigators and  water sanitisers. The Irrigators Association of the Cachapoal Valley  has implemented a collaboration and participation model to ensure  that all major players are represented and their interests heard.  The design and implementation of the model was led by Pacic  Hydro and our Resources Manager, Patricio Correa, has been  appointed as Director of the Association. The Chilean Government  has observed the success of this model and has implemented  similar models in other catchment basins. WASTE In Australia, we measured performance against three initiatives  identied as areas of importance and achieved mixed results: 1 Improving lighting: The initiative was postponed and will occur  during the 2012–13 nancial year. 2 Reducing bottle waste: We were not able to see a reduction  in waste produced by plastic bottles due to potential manual  handling risks identied in purchasing larger bottles. 3 Reducing paper consumption: A joint initiative between  the Health and Safety and Information Technology teams  signicantly reduced the amount of printing and waste paper  collected by implementing a swipe system requiring employees  to use their building pass to trigger printing. We continue to monitor and improve our waste management  processes and have set targets around operational activities,  including improving waste management in the Melbourne ofce  and developing cultural heritage registers for some sites. Progress  against these targets will be reported next year.  In Brazil, our commitment to waste management has assisted  local small business. For example, we were able to support a  resident of the Barra do Camaratuba community, Luis Amaral da  Silvaas small recycling business. Our Natal ofce and Vale dos  Ventos and Millennium wind farms provided almost 14 kilograms  of unavoidable paper, cardboard and aluminium waste products  to his business during the reporting period. The completion of construction at our Chacayes hydro plant in  Chile and the associated decommissioning and demolition of  temporary works, generated 1,051,496 kilograms of domestic,  industrial and hazardous waste. Waste management, sorting,  transport and disposal processes are implemented at each site,  including the Santiago ofce.
