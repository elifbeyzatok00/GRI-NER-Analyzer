CHAIRMANS LETTER    In 2010 we again met all our targets despite operating  in an extremely difficult and complex environment.  Indra fulfilled these objectives in the face of  increasingly difficult market conditions which required  the adoption of decisive measures to maintain the  company's high levels of efficiency in the medium  term.    International markets were the key driver of our  growth in 2010, with outstanding successes achieved  in securing an increasingly global presence that  mitigated the impact of the deterioration of the  domestic market. Despite its current difficulties, Spain  remains a key market for Indra. We are convinced that  Spain will offer further opportunities for growth and  development, not just because we have prestigious  domestic customers with a strong international  projection but also because this crisis will yield new  segments of innovative demand and suitable  environments for a supremely innovative company  with a high-intensity technological offering like Indra.      Indra has always been a business project underpinned  by a long-term vision and a conviction that by  nurturing our profile as an innovation-focused  company with a strong technological base, offering  leading-edge solutions to blue-chip customers, we can  generate high levels of growth and profitability and  attract the very best talent. It is this approach that has  enabled us not only to meet our targets in a year as  challenging as 2010 but also to have done so while  continuing to generate employment, including in the  Spanish market, and maintaining competitive  compensation for our professionals and attractive  remuneration for our shareholders.      We follow an open innovation model, which seeks to  take advantage of both our internal talent (our  professional team) and the external expertise  accessible via our relationships with discerning  customers, with partners that are leaders in their  respective fields, with suppliers, with universities and  knowledge institutions and with society in general.  To  manage these relationships, Indra has a Corporate  Social Responsibility Master Plan, the objective of  which is to improve the company's sustainability and  growth by constantly improving its relationships with  its various stakeholders. Each year we launch new  policies and initiatives aimed at improving the  integration of various stakeholders into Indra's  decision-making, and at establishing robust and  enduring relationships based on transparency and  mutual benefit, as set forth in detail in the chapter  titled "Our stakeholders" in this Annual Report. In  recognition of these management practices, Indra was  once again rated leader in its subsector (computer  services and internet) in 2010 by the Dow Jones  Sustainability Indexes.     But our commitment to sustainability extends well  beyond improving internal management and we firmly  believe that our technologies can make a key  contribution to achieving a more sustainable society.  Many of our solutions and services are focused on  areas of major economic, social and environmental  significance. In fact, we believe that technology must  play a critical role in the economic recovery, and that it  should be a cornerstone of a more sustainable growth  model based on increased productivity. Innovation and  technology are key factors in ensuring sustainable  economic growth and are also essential tools for  enhancing life quality in a number of fields: more  efficient transport, renewable energy, integration of  the socially excluded..     We are convinced that this open relationship with our  stakeholders (shareholders, employees, customers,  suppliers and partners, knowledge institutions and  society) enables us to better identify the challenges  and opportunities we face, to increase our capacity for  innovation, and, in short, to make more sustainable our  progress towards the strategic objectives we have set  for the coming years: to become a more global player  while safeguarding our reputation as an innovative  company with a strong technological focus, thereby  helping to consolidate the future production model in  all the countries in which we are present.      We remain supremely confident in our potential and in  our ability to satisfy the expectations of all our  stakeholders. We continue to look to the future with  the same ambition as on day one, and to strive to  generate hope and value for all our stakeholders on  solid and sustainable foundations.      ANNUAL REPORT 2010   4  The following report has been prepared in accordance  with the Global Reporting Initiatives G3.1 Guidelines,  to application level A+, and in accordance with the  provisions of the AA1000 Accountability standard,  including our conduct in respect of the principles of the  Global Compact, to which we are wholeheartedly  committed. The result is a balanced and fair  presentation of our economic, environmental and social  performance, which has been externally verified.  ANNUAL REPORT 2010   5  03. MANAGING DIRECTORS  LETTER    Dear shareholder,    In 2010, we once again met all of our announced  objectives at the beginning of the year.     Revenue rose 2% to 2.56bn, within the target range  announced at the beginning of the year. Order intake  climbed to 2.88bn, posting year-on-year growth of  7% and surpassing the initial guidance of 5% growth.  The backlog increased 12% to 2.90bn, guaranteeing  the sustained growth of the company.     EBIT was 285mn, in line with the 2009 figure, while  ordinary EBIT margin was 11.2%, only 0.2 percentage  points less than in 2009, despite the difficult market  conditions that put pressure on prices and decreased  investment levels. Attributable profit fell 4%, to  189mn, due to the companys rollout of a series of  initiatives aimed at safeguarding for the future our  high efficiency levels.    Operating cash flow totalled 308mn, less than the  previous year due to the aforementioned extraordinary  costs incurred during 2010.     As regards Indras financial position, at 2010 year-end,  net debt stood at 275mn (0.8 times EBITDA), after an  ordinary dividend payout totalling 107mn, higher  than the 99mn paid in 2009.    Year-end net working capital was equivalent to 93  days revenues which, although higher than last year,  was under our projections.    Operations outside Spain continued to be the main  growth driver, registering a 10% increase in revenues  for full-year 2010 and already representing 39% of  total revenue. Furthermore, order intake in these  markets made a strong showing, with growth of 23%,  and bringing their share of the company's total order  intake to 44%. Latin America registered growth of  41%, a performance which reflects Indra's advances  with large customers in the region, both corporate and  government, and gives the company an excellent  growth outlook going forward. In the Asia Pacific  region, one of the company's strategic focuses, we  registered notable growth, and expect to continue  growing at a healthy rate in this area in 2011.    The trend towards increased outsourcing of application  management and other services throughout most of  Indras target sectors was reflected by the 6%  growth  in revenues in the Services segment, with especially  significant increases in Telecommunications & Media  and Financial Services. Furthermore, greater supplier  concentration is allowing Indra to increase its market  share in Spain, while the company won significant  contracts for providing services in Latin America and  Asia.     Solutions registered flat growth, although the  company carried out a number of important projects  that were significant due to their financial aspects or  strategic value.     By vertical market, it is worth highlighting the strong  growth in Telecommunications & Media (+19%),  Transport & Traffic (+11%) and Financial Services  (+10%), as well as the good performance in Public  Administrations & Healthcare (+3%). The markets most  affected by the current environment were Energy &  Industry (-5%) and Security & Defence (-13%).    In 2010, Indra carried out a series of measures that will  allow us to maintain our profitability going forward. It  carried out cost reduction measures in all areas of the  company and transformed Indra's structures and  processes with the aim of adapting its business to the  current market conditions, both on the geographical  and corporate level. The efforts of this year will allow  us to continue generating value and profitability at  high levels of efficiency, as we have done since our  company's founding.    We are constantly developing innovative new solutions  and services to help our customers meet the  challenges that they face in increasingly competitive  markets, and in pursuit of two main goals: to create  intelligent infrastructure and enhance efficiency.    In 2011, we expect a difficult and complex  environment, similar to what was seen the previous  year. We expect the company to continue posting  positive results thanks to the different actions it has  carried out in recent years to strengthen its global   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   6  presence of its offering. Furthermore, these actions  deal with new geographic markets, global customers,  and in high-potential markets with strong demand for  our services. As a result, Indra will maintain its profile  as a growth company with high profitability and an  attractive medium term outlook.     The company is fully confident that it will meet the  targets it has established for 2011. We expect an  increase in revenues of over 2%, driven by operations  outside Spain, and a total order intake that is  somewhat higher than last year, and much stronger  than revenue growth, further bolstering the order  backlog. In addition, we expect an ordinary EBIT margin  of at least 10.5%, and do not anticipate any actions  entailing additional extraordinary costs.     Once again, the company's globalisation process will be  a key factor in our future growth. To this end, we have  reinforced our commercial areas, improved our  execution and delivery capacity for projects in more  demanding environments and more important and  complex regions, and assembled an excellent team of  professionals to achieve these goals. As a result, Indra  is one of the most prestigious and recognised  companies in the sector.    The increasing competition facing our customers spurs  us to constantly innovate and create solutions to help  them meet their main challenges, which we would  divide into two major categories: creating intelligent  infrastructure and achieving greater efficiency. In  2010, this meant developing business lines in areas  with high growth potential, such as transport  management, health services "2.0", security, Cloud  Computing and technology-based BPO solutions.    But the challenges of our customers are also our own  challenges. Our primary goal is to continue improving  how we do things, working in a more intelligent and  efficient manner.     In addition, we cannot overemphasise the importance  of hiring, retaining and managing our talent, bearing in  mind the diversity of our employees, in order to ensure  that our team remains motivated so that the company  can move in unison in the same direction and share the  same goal: to create value.     A differentiated offering that meets the needs of our  customers, combined with investment in innovation  and talent management, financial soundness, and a  growing global footprint are the critical factors that  allow us to take advantage of opportunities presented  by the market and to continue on our vector of  sustainable growth.     In closing, I would like to thank our professionals for  their dedication and effort over the course of 2010.  ANNUAL REPORT 2010   7  04. GOVERNING BODIES                                  ANNUAL REPORT 2010   8  05. MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND  TRENDS    An asymmetric economic crisis     Global economic performance is currently lopsided. In  other words, each country and region has a distinct  pattern of recovery, leaving global economic growth  concentrated primarily in emerging economies in the  Asia Pacific region, Latin America and the Middle East.      Meanwhile, recovery from the crisis is proceeding  slowly and haltingly in more advanced economies,  trailing even the forecasts issued in early 2010.     Consequently, this asymmetric recovery is generating  "pockets of opportunity," not only in geographic terms,  but also  within industries and businesses. For  example, while the IT services industry is still plagued  by a scarcity of funding, with companies continuing to  seek greater cost efficiencies, a few niches of  opportunity have appeared which offer enormous  growth potential. These niches, which may be of  considerable size, are largely associated with two  fields, as anticipated in our 2009 Annual Report:  equipping infrastructure and systems with intelligence  ("intelligence") and making the provision of  technological services more efficient  (efficiency).Technology highlights in these areas  include Business Intelligence, Smart Grids,  Virtualisation and Cloud Computing, among others.      Technology as a vector for sustainable growth    Recovery from the economic crisis leaves us with a  challenge: to ensure that our future growth trend is  more sustainable. It seems clear that we must accept  that the current economic growth model, based on  overexploiting resources -- that is, on increasing  productivity by using the cheapest resources and  capitalising on economies of scale--, has been  exhausted. We live in a world in which resources (of all  kinds) are limited, and we are becoming increasingly  aware of this. We cannot aspire to continue to grow by  exerting ever-increasing pressure on resources,  especially if we bear in mind the rising living standards  and consumption patterns guaranteed to filter through  to Latin America and Asia in coming years.      Therefore, we must learn to manage our resources in a  more rational manner and lay the groundwork for a  more sustainable growth model. History has taught us  that economic progress is always tied to technological  development and to how technology is applied to  energy, transport and telecommunications.      As indicated earlier, we have an opportunity to tap into  the potential offered by information and  communication technologies (ICTs) to radically enhance  infrastructures usefulness by rendering it intelligent.  This means that by deploying sensors, communications  and distributed data processing capacity, we can help  our customers to achieve real-time monitoring and  automatic reconfiguration of their systems, enabling  them to safely and efficiently adapt to changes in the  environment.     Some of the major changes technology is likely to spur  are already on the horizon: clean energy based on  renewable sources; more efficient transport systems  that shorten distances and lessen environmental  impacts; safer cities; at-home healthcare; new ways of  interacting with government agencies, etc.     ANNUAL REPORT 2010   9  06. OUR STRATEGY      The lopsided economic recovery and the advent of  "pockets of opportunity," in which growth in demand  for IT services is concentrated, are forcing companies  to become more selective in their strategy, in order to  identify and secure our presence in said pockets of  opportunity.      A strong and growing foothold in high-growth  markets across the globe    Indra does business in the worlds most promising  markets for growth in demand for IT services: Latin  America and the Asia Pacific region.        Latin America now accounts for 15% of Indras  revenues and 23% of its workforce, while in 2010 our  business in the region increased by more than 30%. In  sum, the region is one of our leading geographic  markets and one of the major cornerstones of our  growth. Our goal is to significantly boost our local  presence, which, combined with our excellent range of  products and services, should enable us to maintain  very substantial rates of growth in the region.     Meanwhile, we have been present in the Asia Pacific  region for more than 12 years, enjoying a successful  track record with important accounts in state-of-the- art tech sectors such as air traffic management and  simulation. We intend to continue bolstering our  capabilities in the region in coming years, laying the  groundwork to guarantee that we can deliver rapid and  sustained growth.     Developing a range of products and services to  meet the challenges ahead    Separately, Indra is very well placed in markets for  what we have termed "intelligence and efficiency,"  with outstanding solutions and services such as  Cibersecurity, Education, Intelligent Cities and Cloud  Computing, which are destined to become the drivers  of growth in demand for IT services.       This market positioning is complemented by Indra's  ongoing commitment to innovation, which translates  into the development of capabilities in fields as diverse  and technologically advanced as domotics (home  automation), 3D projection, augmented reality, remote  energy management, etc.         ANNUAL REPORT 2010   10  07. NETWORKS OF EXCELLENCE:  THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR  MANUFACTURING AND  INNOVATION    Indra consolidates and concentrates its operations at  different workplaces, each of which becomes  specialised in a particular technology or area of know- how, enabling them to capitalise on potential  economies of scale and enhance production efficiency.     It doesnt stop there. As each workplace specialises in  a particular aspect of manufacturing, employees  develop a wide-ranging understanding of technology  and our customers. Our employees become genuine  tech gurus, and each workplace features innovation  units which are highly focused on developing a range  of products and services aimed at addressing our  customers' real, concrete needs. In sum, these  workplaces operate as advanced laboratories, using  the latest technological breakthroughs to develop  bespoke solutions for our customers.        These hubs are known as centres of excellence.    Our Centres of Excellence do not work in isolation.   Centres of Excellence function like neural connections,  linking areas of specialisation and know-how and  creating Networks of Excellence which generate  substantial synergies in production efficiency and  knowledge generation.       In 2010 Indra continued to expand its Networks of  Excellence through the creation of new workplaces in ,  such as a centre in Toledo (Spain), specialising in  medical imaging; the Bembibre site in Len (Spain),  specialising in e-learning, the Gijn site (Spain),  specialising in air traffic management systems, and the  Seville site, specialising in digital health systems.    Our Centres of Excellence have a permanent  commitment to constantly improve software  development processes, aimed at reducing production  and delivery times, lowering costs and increasing  quality.  This strategy involves a range of initiatives for  industrialising manufacturing, re-using code, automatic  code generation, the use of offshore resources, etc.     ANNUAL REPORT 2010   11  SOFTWARE LABS: AT THE CUTTING-EDGE OF  MANUFACTURING    At the heart of our Networks of Excellence is our  subsidiary, Indra Software Labs, which specialises in  software manufacturing and runs 20 labs across the  network.  Indra Software Labs facilities use the most  advanced manufacturing models on the market and are  a key driver of R&D activity. The following examples  illustrate its success in certification terms:     11 ISO 9001-certified centres    11 CMMi L3-accredited facilities    1 CMMi L4-accredited product (IGEA)    UNE 166002 certification for innovation  management    As of late 2010, the IGEA product successfully passed  the CMMi level 5 formal maturity appraisal, and  therefore is expected to receive official accreditation  in 2011.This indicates that IGEA 100-percent meets all  practices stipulated by the CMMi Model for maturity  levels 2, 3, 4 and 5, a milestone achieved by only 172  companies worldwide by the end of 2010 and by only  one company in Spain.      Moreover, we expect five new centres to be awarded a  CMMi 3 rating in 2011.   Indra Software Labs helps to develop models for  distributed software development and future  productivity    In 2009 and 2010 Indra Software Labs worked with  the  and the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied  Information Technology (FIT) to conduct research into  global delivery models.  University of Kaiserslautern    The purpose of this research is to identify issues  influencing overhead costs for distributed projects, in  order to develop a Effort and Risk Estimation Model for  Global Software Development, and to outline best  practices, mechanisms for decision-making,  comprehensive project management, real-world  experiences, etc.      Along the same lines, Indra Software Labs leads an  R&D project known as ORIGIN -- Intelligent Globally  InNovative Organisations, which is geared towards  optimising software development at global companies  by enabling companies software factories across the  world to operate as a single virtual facility, from both a  development and corporate culture standpoint.  The  project, conducted within the framework of the  Spanish Industrial Technological Development Centres  (CDTI) tech resources, is slated to last three years.       R&D&I MANAGEMENT: OPEN TO KNOWLEDGE    The most innovative companies are built by  capitalising on all available talent, both within and  outside of the corporation, which requires creating a  multidisciplinary, global cooperation network.  Indra  works with companies, universities and research  centres worldwide and has R&D tools which, along  with the offering-generating mechanism provided by  our Networks of Excellence, enable us to remain highly  attuned to our customers real current needs. At the  same time, they allow us to anticipate customers  future needs and ensure that our technology is always  cutting edge.     Consequently, Indra diverges from traditional  innovation management models by using an open  innovation model in which cooperation on knowledge  generation is not limited to the company's borders, but  instead welcomes feedback from customers, tech  allies, universities, research centres and even society  at large, with the following defining characteristics:     Decentralised, in which all individuals within the  company participate.     Open and online.     Aligned with business strategy.     The following are essential elements of this model:    Search for funding and generation of outside  interests.     Fluid communication that facilitates institutional  relationships of project teams.    ANNUAL REPORT 2010   12    Permanent observatory to channel information  from the surrounding environment as an "early  warning" of opportunities arising in new  technologies and adjacent markets.     Constant improvement in the methods used to  manage innovation projects.    Indra in the leading technological platforms     Technological Platforms are scientific-technological  cooperation networks comprising a diverse array of  organisations, primarily companies (from corporations  to small businesses) and research bodies (tech centres,  universities, government research entities), focused on  a specific industry. They are industry led and have  three main goals:    Draw up a Strategic Research Agenda     Mobilise the required critical mass to tackle  projects    Raise awareness of the platform's purpose    Indra participates in a number of Spanish and European  platforms, in which it has a decision-making role and  interacts with the array of players involved in RDI  programmes.

As part of the SGIDi, the company has undertaken  activities in technological surveillance,  technological chats, creativity, and has launched  an ideas contest, known as +IDEAS.  +IDEAS  objective is to encourage the generation of  innovative ideas at Indra Software Labs and to  engage all personnel in the corporations R&D  activities.  During the first edition of this  competition, 42 ideas were submitted from a  number of software labs.      ANNUAL REPORT 2010   15  LEADERS IN INNOVATION    The aforementioned projects enabled us to continue to  boost R&D investment, with said spending accounting  for 7.2% of revenues in 2010 (vs. 7.0% in 2009).       It may be more helpful to compare R&D investment  (184M) with the companys net attributable profit  (189M), which illustrates that Indras investment in  R&D nearly matches its net profit.

Economic sustainability  CloudMU: Creation of an expandable cloud for  companies    Cloud computing is one of the main IT strategies with  the greatest potential for businesses.  The company is  at the cutting edge of these services thanks to its  constant research into product alternatives. In this line  of strategy CloudMu has been born, whose goal is to  create an expandable cloud that can be used by  businesses, that is compatible with existing clouds and  that meets the needs of partners regarding the  generation of sector-wide products:     As regards infrastructure, the cloud will combine  both virtualization and grid computing, including  the concept of abstraction, in an Infrastructure as a  Service (IaaS) layer.    It will support application development platforms,  facilitating at the same time the migration of  existing applications.     It will provide service quality warranties that  guarantee the fulfilment of the Service Level  Agreements (SLAs), fault tolerance and security  mechanisms that meet business standards, at all  service levels.     It will follow an energy efficiency programme  (green computing) with the use, as far as possible,  of materials that minimize environmental impact  and favour the sustainability of the environment.    CloudMu offers some significant competitive  advantages compared to existing clouds: the  immediate provision of virtual environments to  develop business applications; the possibility of using  virtualization and grid computing in combination to  execute intensive computation processes or  algorithms; the combination of private and public  clouds; the development of specific Application  Programming Interfaces (APIs) according to business  sector, instead of general APIs; and the  implementation of security and service quality levels  according to business requirements.    99 136 152 175 184 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010  ANNUAL REPORT 2010   16  Social sustainability  TradionP: Expert personalised cancer diagnosis  and treatment system    Indra leads a consortium whose aim is to develop an  expert system that – using IT, artificial intelligence  techniques and computational biology – can facilitate  the modelling of oncology-related illnesses and the  selection of specific therapies for each patient. Its main  contribution will be its ability to aggregate different  types of information about individual patients and  recognize common patterns to offer a precise and  efficient prediction about the response and  development of the tumour. In this manner, the expert  system will also provide information about the  biological characteristics of aggressiveness and  possible resistance to certain medication and  therapies. This will improve the quality of life of  patients by avoiding the use of aggressive treatments  that will not be effective for a certain patient and  choosing the most suitable treatment.  The final goal being pursued is to create a new  standard for the overall management of cancer  patients to guide multimodal therapy (surgery,  radiotherapy and chemotherapy) in a personalized and  efficient manner.  The projects intention is to improve  through the use of new technologies the development  of new, more precise, objective, predictive diagnostic  methods that are aimed at determining which  therapies are the most effective for each patient and,  consequently, also the development of new modes of  treatment.    Once the TradionP prototype has been finalised at the  facilities of Indras Centre of Excellence in Advanced  Digital Health in Seville, Indra will study the possibility  of integrating healthcare applications and artificial  intelligence through a private Cloud Computing  platform for the healthcare sector. In addition, it will  analyze the exportation of the system from Andalusia  to other autonomous communities and countries as  well as its application to other disorders.    Environmental sustainability  Internet Of Energy for Electric Mobility (IoE):  Infrastructure for the full support of electric  vehicles    The aim of Internet of Energy (IoE) is to develop  technology that allows secure connectivity and  interoperability through the connection of Internet to  energy networks, giving rise to an infrastructure that  allows mobility to be applied on electricity networks.   IoE will implement the interface in real time between  what is known as Smart Energy Grids and Internet. This  will allow nodes of a distributed electricity network to  be defined that are easy to manage and integrate with  other networks that, together with generators and  storage systems based on plug-and-play principles, will  provide greater versatility and control over the  architecture of electricity networks. This will achieve  more efficient management and integration of the  network with electrical vehicles, buildings, and  electrical and household appliances, that can be  charged by or connected to any source of energy  (including sources of renewable energy).   The project allows value added services to be created  using devices that can be connected by cables or  wireless connections and allowing access to Internet,  which will offer key management services: response to  demand.  ANNUAL REPORT 2010   17  08. OUR APPROACH TO  SUSTAINABILITY:  SUSTAINABILITY COMBINED  WITH THE CAPACITY TO  INNOVATE    Indras innovation capacity is the cornerstone of our  corporate responsibility and our sustainability. Our  approach to sustainability is based on the companys  Corporate Responsibility vision, which after a process  of consultation and participation of the companys  professionals was defined in 2004 as follows:     To be an innovative, knowledge-based company in all  relations with our internal and external stakeholders  (shareholders, employees, customers, etc.) and with  the institutions that cultivate and develop those  values, and the communities where we operate.    INTEGRATED AND DECENTRALISED MANAGEMENT    For us, corporate responsibility, as a means to  guarantee our sustainability, must be integrated  throughout the entire organisation and in line with our  activity and objectives. Consequently, at Indra we have  established a decentralised and integrated corporate  responsibility management system in the various  management areas for the entire organisation.     Isabel Aguilera is the Director of the Board of Directors  to whom the companys CR management is reported  and who, in turn, reports to the Board in this  connection. The Corporate Responsibility function is  headed by Emma Fernndez, Innovation, Talent and  Strategy General Director.    Based on the Global Reporting Initiatives  Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (version G3), at  Indra we explicitly state our management approach in  terms of our financial results, environmental policies,  labour practices and decent work, human rights and  impact on communities and on society as a whole.

For more information: http://www.indracompany.com/en/sostenibilidad-e-innovacion/responsability-integrated-in-our-strategy       Since 2007, we periodically redefine these areas  following a process of consultation and participation  with all in-house staff responsible for relations with  each stakeholder group. This process prompted us to  update our Corporate Responsibility Master Plan.   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   19  SUSTAINABLE COMPANY AWARD    Indra was honoured in the Management for  Sustainable Development category at the European  Business Awards for the Environment.  These prizes,  which are awarded every two years by the Spanish  affiliate, the Fundacin Entorno-BCSD Espaa, with the  support of the Environment and Rural and Marine  Affairs Ministry and the Fundacin Biodiversidad,  acknowledge companies that have a strong  commitment to sustainable development.     Indras focus on sustainability, its approach to  corporate responsibility as a means of ensuring said  sustainability and the development of technological  solutions and services that help to enhance corporate  environmental management and improve society, were  among the attributes cited by the panel awarding this  honour to Indra.      Moreover, organisers noted that the company has an  up-to-date Code of Ethics, an Equality Plan, a Diversity  Policy, work-life balance measures, a Career  Management System and is certified as a Family- Responsible Company.     In terms of social programmes, Indra made significant  efforts to minimize the digital divide in society.         IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW CODE OF ETHICS AND  PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT    Indra in 2010 implemented a new Code of Ethics and  Professional Conduct , approved at the end of 2009 by  the companies making up Indra.      By the end of the year, the Code had been enacted at  companies representing more than 70% of Indra in  terms of employees. Indra plans to continue making  progress in this area by extending the Code to other  subsidiary companies over the course of 2011.     In parallel with the introduction of this Code, the  company undertook several training initiatives,  including a module on the Code of Ethics and  Professional Conduct provided as part of a welcome  orientation for new staff. It is also set to launch an  online training module in 2011, titled, "Indra. Who we  are, values, brand and workplace culture," which  includes a chapter devoted to the Code.  Furthermore,  we plan to design and introduce new, complementary  training activities in 2011 to ensure that all of our  employees are familiar with and apply the Code of  Ethics and Professional Conduct while doing their jobs.     In terms of the Codes progress during the first year of   implementation, it is worth noting that the company  received 17 questions/incident reports via the Direct  Channel, the majority of which were questions about  how the Code works, requests for additional  information or comments and suggestions for the  Code.  Only five of these messages required a solution:     Three incidents involving the principle of respect:  these were delivered to HR for definitive  resolution.        One incident report alleging corruption and  bribery: following an investigation by the  company, no evidence was found to confirm the  allegations.      One incident involving a conflict of interest: by  the end of 2010, the company had nearly  completed its investigation, which was awaiting a  decision by the Committee.       The Direct Channel was established alongside the Code  of Ethics and Professional Conduct for the purpose of  complementing the companys pre-existing  communication channels for sending incident reports,  which include reporting to the employees supervisor  and the use of a range of channels for communicating  with HR.    Additionally, Indra carried out an exhaustive analysis of  the company's risks and monitoring needs, which led  the Audit and Compliance Committee to create a new  legal compliance unit in 2011.  This unit is led by a  Chief Compliance Officer who will report periodically to  the Committee itself, and whose mission will be to   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   20  establish a set of measures and procedures to prevent,  monitor and detect criminal conduct and other legal  risks within all the enterprises of the company.    AMONG THE MOST ETHICAL COMPANIES IN THE  WORLD    In March 2011, Indra was selected by the Ethisphere  Institute to be part of the fifth edition of its ranking of  the World's Most Ethical Companies. The list is made up  of just 110 companies and Indra is the only Spanish  company among them.     The methodology of the ranking consists of studying  companies codes of ethics and their legal and  regulatory track record, their investment in innovation  and sustainable business practices, company initiatives  to improve business ethics, the study of top  management appointments, and their relations with  other companies in the sector, suppliers and  customers. The list of companies is published in  Ethisphere Magazines Q1 edition.       The Ethisphere Institute is an organisation that acts as  a think tank focusing on the creation, promotion and  implementation of the best practices in business  ethics, corporate social responsibility, anticorruption  and sustainability.     In addition, Indra was ranked 27th out of the 1,000  most sustainable companies in the world according to  the Global 1000 Sustainable Performance Leader  compiled annually by the US firm CRD Analytics. The  ranking is calculated after analysing over 5,000  publicly traded companies with a minimum market cap  of $1bn that issue social responsibility and  sustainability reports. To produce the ranking, CRD  Analytics used their own methodology, which uses 200  individual performance metrics composed of traditional  financial data and environmental and social data, as  well as the methodology of the Global Reporting  Initiative, the leading standard for compiling CR  reports.    OUR EFFORTS TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS    In late 2010, we finalised the design and development  of new surveys on the perception of Indra and its  sustainability efforts. This information was geared  towards stakeholders with whom the company had not  yet established structured channels for dialogue.  These new stakeholder groups include the media,  investment analysts, market analysts, bloggers and the  online audience, non-profit organisations, local  communities and university teaching staff.      These new surveys are intended to complement the  company's pre-existing questionnaires for customers,  suppliers, tech partners and knowledge institutions.     The survey, conducted in January and March of 2011,  gave the company an overall valuation of 6.7 points  out of 10.     For the next survey, Indra intends both to widen the  sample of stakeholders consulted and to include new  groups, such as non-profit entities or members of  relevant associations and foundations from  communities where we have significant operations.    IMPROVED RESPONSIVENESS TO STAKEHOLDERS     Indra in 2010 conducted a review of its financial, social  and environmental performance for the purpose of  achieving better responsiveness (in accordance with  AA1000 standards) to its stakeholders' concerns. To  this end, it carried out an analysis of indicators  generated by a range of sustainability gauges and  assessments to which the company submits itself for  examination (Merco, Aspi-Vigeo, OEKOM, SAM-Dow  Jones Sustainability Indexes, Eiris-Ftse4Good, Carbon  Disclosure Project, etc.), and selected the indicators  which it views as the most relevant to the companys  management.      These indicators were added to the sustainability  scorecard developed by the company in 2009 and  published on the current Annual Reports website as an  exercise in informational transparency for  stakeholders.      While the sustainability scorecard has been published,  it has not been completed, as development is ongoing  and we plan to add tools to allow automatic data  capture and continuous improvement in the reporting  system.    ANNUAL REPORT 2010   21  IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY  REPORTING    When the company emailed its 2009 Annual Report to  its main stakeholder contacts, it included a brief  questionnaire meant to assess user perceptions of the  quality of the report.  Readers assigned an overall  score of 4.4 points out of 5, giving a particularly high  score to the report's clarity (4.6 points).    Chart: results of opinion survey of Indra's 2009 Annual Report. 0-5  scale.    The 2010 Annual Report includes several improved  features designed to improve the element which  scored the lowest in the questionnaire: transparency  (4.2 points). These additions include the  aforementioned sustainability scorecard and overview  tables meant to make the reports information more  accessible.     The 2010 Annual Reports home page includes a direct  link to the perception questionnaire, enabling all  readers to offer their opinions of the quality of the  report. The questionnaire's findings will be periodically  updated on the 2010 Report's website, with definitive  data to be published in the Indra 2011 Annual Report.     RECOGNITION FOR OUR ANNUAL REPORT    Indras 2009 Annual Report was chosen in 2011 as one  of five annual report finalists for the Globe Award in  the sustainability report category,. These prizes are  awarded by a prestigious jury of experts in reporting,  sustainability and management from all over the world,  who assess criteria such as content materiality and  relevance, descriptions of sustainability's effects on  the business, descriptions of financial and non- financial performance information, target setting, data  on value chain impacts, how well the report fits with  the company's main annual report, risk and opportunity  management to integrate social and environmental  issues into the business, third-party verification of the  report, and the existence of comparable information.  Globe Award, a non-profit organisation, is a Globe  Forum initiative aimed at encouraging sustainable  development throughout society.       Separately, the Corporate Register Reporting Awards  2011ranked Indras 2009 Annual Report ninth in the  world in the Best Corporate Social Responsibility  Integrated Report category.  CorporateRegister  specialises in collating and publishing CR reports and  resources online. The reports and resources are  available to over 31,000 registered stakeholders which  include CSR experts and consultants, professionals,  students, academics, investors, analysts, journalists,  NGOs and public administrations.     In Spain, the Corporate Social Responsibility  Observatory, an association made up of organisations  representing civil society, including NGOs, trade unions  and consumer groups, ranked Indras 2009 CSR report  ninth among IBEX-35 companies. Indras report  received a score of 1.66 points out of 4, vs. the 1.61  points it received in the Observatorys previous report.  The Observatory praised Indras efforts in 2008 to  integrate its financial, social and environmental  performance in a single report. Among its criticisms,  the group noted that the 2009 CSR Report relegated  some information to the website. Furthermore, the  Observatory noted that the CSR Report placed a  positive emphasis on impacts while leaving out  important aspects of the companys performance on  financial, social and human rights issues. The current  2010 Annual Report includes content intended to  address some of these concerns, such as an overview  of management approaches or a description of Indras  presence in tax havens, amongst others.     Meanwhile, the Corporate Social Responsibility  Observatory , a unit of the Trade Union Secretariat of  the Confederative Executive Committee of the General  Union of Workers (UGT), ranked Indra's 2009 Annual  Report third among IBEX-35 company reports, with a  score of 61 out of 100.  4,6 4,4 4,2 4,4 4,4 Clarity Importance Transparency Amount of information General valuation  ANNUAL REPORT 2010   22  Indra obtained the highest score out of all the  companies included in the analysis of the indicators of  "overall investment effort in R&D and the promotion of  the sustainable use of natural resources, labour  conditions; balance between personal life and  professional demands; health and safety at work and  job security and products and services that address  social needs and efforts for change that favour  responsible production and consumption. However,  Indra received its worst scores for the indicators equal  opportunities and elimination of any form of  discrimination, "contribution of the company to job  creation and quality efforts" and "salaries and benefits,  economic participation and equality". With the  objective of improving in these aspects, in this Annual  Report, Indra has reinforced its commitment to  transparency in these areas and has included  quantitative indicators such as the percentage of  people with disabilities in the workforce, the  percentage of permanent contracts or breakdowns of  the information about the proportion of men and  women by labour category (up until now, the report  had only given the total figure for the whole of the  company).

Differentiation of the solutions,  delivery model and even the business model are  fundamental to ensuring continuous competitive  advantage. At the same time, reduction in costs,  focus on the truly differentiating tasks and the  consequent improvement in the use of available  resources are the most relevant elements in this  transformation of processes.    INTELLIGENCE - SOLUTIONS  OUR FOCUS    In the medium term, although it can already be  noticed in 2011, we believe that the potential of   ICTs to endow infrastructures with intelligence and  bring about radical changes in the movement of  people and goods (including water, energy or  information) and to reduce transaction costs, will  provide significant opportunities involving  sensorisation of infrastructures, the roll-out of  communications and distributed data processing  capacity, as well as information and intelligence  systems which enable control in real time of  infrastructures and the automatic reconfiguration  of networks safely and efficiently to respond to  variations in the environment.     More and more, businesses realise that investment  in technology and innovation is necessary for the  continuity of the business, in that it leads to  improved productivity and greater differentiation.     Diversifying geographical markets in order to  minimise risks and take advantage of new  opportunities    The world's economic situation is asymmetrical. The  economy is growing at a faster rate than in  previous years, but growth is concentrated in the  emerging countries of Latin America and Asia- Pacific.     Therefore it is fundamentally important to possess  a geographical market structure which is  sufficiently diverse to take advantage of the  opportunities arising from heavy investment in  development and modernisation of infrastructure in  the countries with greatest growth.     Indra employs a mixed globalisation strategy, which  combines establishing a local presence with an  export model. In the first case, during 2010, we  have continued to grow our presence in Latin  America, which has resulted in the award of  significant contracts, such as the implementation of  SAP GRC for Telefnica in the whole of Latin  America, the extension of the corporate model  based on SAP for the Gas Natural Group for the new  companies in Colombia, or the implementation of  the corporate model based on SAP for Grupo  Santillana in its subsidiaries in Argentina and Chile.     As part of our export model, we believe it is key to  establish solid technological alliances with top-level  technological suppliers, which enables us to   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   27  strengthen the marketing strategy. It is this which  has led, during 2010, to our being recognised by  SAP as second biggest technological partner thanks  to, amongst other things, the joint development of  major projects during the last few years in Algeria,  Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Zambia and other  countries which, in short, offer great opportunities  for IT projects on a grand scale.     To carry out these major projects under an export  model requires a very high level of excellence in  their delivery, and this is what Indra has been able  to demonstrate in recent years, and what has made  us a reliable supplier of technology for projects  undertaken by the principal international finance  institutions such as the World Bank or the  International Development Bank.    This strategic alliance has also led to us acquiring  an educational project for the Autonomous  Community of Madrid which is considered to be the  most important project in the world to be  implemented on SAP technology. The project  covers 3,300 centres and two million users. The  scale of this project, in terms of the number of  centres and learners, makes it a model of best  practice for replication in any other country.     Entry into the small to mid-size business  segment thanks to Cloud Computing    Cloud Computing is becoming one of the most  important IT delivery models for the future, thanks  to the significant advantages it offers in terms of  access on demand and in semi-real time to  resources which can be shared, scaled, delocalised  and assembled virtually, under a flexible price  model (pay per use).    Indra now has a significant portfolio of solutions  offered in Cloud Computing mode in sectors such as  transport, public administration or financial  services.    Our Cloud Computing strategy for solutions has two  objectives:     To offer proprietary solutions, as far as is  practical, in a Cloud Computing model to offer  our customers the most effective delivery  models. Indra now possesses technological  solutions which are offered under Cloud  Computing models, such as ARACS, AGREGA,  EDITRAN, or iOne; as well as solutions adapted  to this model in all the markets in which we  operate.     To develop solutions which use all the  potential offered to us by Cloud Computing. In  this respect, technological solutions for small  to mid-size businesses are especially relevant  because, as they are offered under a Cloud  Computing model, there is a benefit from  economies of scale which was not present  with traditional delivery models. To this end  we are exploring agreements for marketing  models with technological partners, in the  cloud utilities sphere, which will enable us to  define and incorporate solutions specifically  for small to mid-size businesses.    We are committed to the convergence of  technology and BPO    From the solutions viewpoint, we interpret the  outsourcing of business processes as the complete  automation of a stage in the customer's operating  process, which translates into a set of solutions  which includes, for example, systems for  digitalisation, intelligent capture of information,  intelligent document routing, or intelligent  management of processes. This range of solutions  complements what we offer from the BPO area of  services, and is intended to improve efficiency in  the supply of these services by the incorporation of  technology into the processes, instead of using  cheaper resources.    A key contract we were awarded in 2010 in Banco  Santander involves the implementation of a pilot  digitalisation project incorporating an improved  data capture and recognition system to handle all  source information in processes such as opening a  current account.  This enables the whole process to  be completed automatically with practically no  human intervention and, accordingly, creates a   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   28  saving in time which can be reinvested in more  strategic activities such as business generation and  improved responsiveness to the customer.    Development of social networking solutions    2010 is being defined as the year of the  emergence of Social Networks and especially, the  application of the 2.0 phenomenon in the context  of institutions. Major customers such as BBVA or  Red Elctrica de Espaa (REE) have set up social  networking pilot schemes with Indra, inside their  own organisations, in order to foster collaboration  and the sharing of knowledge.  The GENERA  project, which consists of a real pilot to set up a  social network in BBVA's management team on a  global scale, is a prime example.  This network will  become a flexible tool for communication and  sharing of initiatives and concerns within a large,  dynamic organisation.       SOLUTIONS FOR  SUSTAINABILITY    Indra has a range of technology-based solutions  aimed at improving the sustainability of  organisations in terms of efficiency and adherence  to regulations.    In 2010, this portfolio of solutions was enhanced  by: the development of an integrated package for  smart buildings; the development of technological  solutions related to the utilisation of information  generated in the drawing up of sustainability plans  and reports; and the preliminary development  phase of a tool for the management of relations  with stakeholders, relating to compliance with the  AA1000 standard.    Furthermore significant contracts have been won  with top-level customers which prove the quality of  our offering.  So, for example, we have continued to  provide LEED consultancy services to BBVA and the  final evaluation phase has been reached for the  USGBC in its headquarters in Paraguay and Madrid- La Moraleja; we began to implement and audit  systems for quality control, the environment and  workplace health and safety, and to roll out the  EFQM excellence model in companies in the  Fundosa Group (ONCE); and a global system called  PRM (Professional Relationship Management) has  been designed and will be piloted in our own  company.     For the future, we predict enormous growth  potential in sustainable growth models, for two  main reasons:  the increasingly widespread  conviction that responsible management of  businesses produces tangible benefits; and  widespread compliance, both in the public sector  and in other international institutions with certain  standards such as diversity, energy-saving,  measuring the carbon footprint, corporate social  responsibility, stakeholder satisfaction, etc.    Oracle's SOA challenge award     Oracle Ibrica has awarded Indra a prize in the SOA  Challenge 2010, in Edition IV of Awards to the  Community of Partners called "T y Oracle" [You  and Oracle].     THE FUTURE    The development and modernisation of  infrastructure in emerging countries continues to  be our main opportunity for growth, particularly in  Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region.    Our predictions for 2011 for our range of solutions  include important opportunities in payment portals  and bridges offered under Cloud Computing models,  especially in the context of small to mid-size  businesses, local corporations and trade  associations.      ANNUAL REPORT 2010   29  The application of technology to BPO processes,  especially in the financial services, public  administration and health sectors, should also offer  important opportunities in the coming years.          Efficiency - Services  OUR FOCUS    In the current climate of reduced economic growth  and low consumption in practically every sector,  businesses are looking to the outsourcing of  services as a means of reducing costs. Faced with  this situation, our focus in Indra is not only on  reducing our customers' costs, but also giving  greater added value to our services, through new  models for the supply of services (Cloud  Computing), the industry specialization of our  range of solutions (using our in-depth knowledge of  sectors), improvement in our delivery models,  offering complementary services and enhancing our  range with social and environmental values.    Innovation in our range of services    During 2010, Indra's position as a leading provider  of services in the Cloud Computing model has  become particularly evident. Indra now has more  than 6 years of experience as a provider of services  with "virtual" delivery models, such as SaaS, and  with flexible pricing models. This, together with our  expertise in the field of security (including ISO  27001 certification) and better practices in terms  of methodologies and certifications (ISO 20001,  ITIL,  CMMi-4 applications management),  demonstrate proven experience in our Cloud  Computing range, plus a high level of maturity and  great added value.    It is predicted that the Cloud Computing market will  undergo significant growth in the next few years  until it becomes the predominant form of  technological delivery due, above all, to the fact  that it can satisfy, in a joined-up manner, our  customers' requirements for optimisation of costs  and flexibility. In fact the distinguishing element is  that the provision of infrastructures is aligned with  the real demand for business processes, and  significant savings on costs can be made thanks to  an income collection method called "pay-per-use".    During 2010, Indra has developed its own service  delivery methodology, which we are calling Data  Center Flexible, and which offers a different  approach to Cloud Computing models for the supply  of outsourcing services. Data Center Flexible  derives from the premise that management of IT  cannot depend upon a service model based solely  and exclusively on a public "cloud", but requires a  combination of models based on the traditional  dedicated approach, a private cloud and a public  cloud, depending upon how critical the services are,  the need for control or personalisation, legal  requirements or the possibility of standardisation,  amongst other aspects.     Our Cloud Computing is based on expertise in  virtualisation of workstations (VDI) and  infrastructure management as a service (IMaaS)  and software as a service (SaaS) models. We are  also forming strategic alliances with the main  manufacturers in the sector such as BMC or Cisco,   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   30  which can strengthen our offering based on  proprietary solutions.        Industry specialization of the offering    Back office processes are the most strategic and  those on which companies place most importance.  However, the supply of services for outsourcing  these processes requires a high degree of  knowledge of the sector and an understanding of  the specific problem areas in the business.     At Indra we are fully committed to the industry  specialization of our back office BPO, especially in  the financial services, telecommunications and  utilities sectors, in order to be capable of  responding to our customers' needs. These sectors  are the biggest in volume of sales, and also those  which are growing the most.    Indra already has significant contracts in these  markets (La Caixa, Bankinter, CAN, ONO, Orange,  Euskaltel, Gas Natural) and a varied offering in the  processes of greatest value (supply and technical  support for telecommunications companies;  customer service, invoicing and supply in utilities).      Of particular note is the contract awarded by Caja  Navarra, in Spain, for the outsourcing of its back- office processes and more significantly, the  management of its telephone banking, since this  was a new service of Indra.     Development of expertise of global delivery of  service provision     Indra has acquired the Peruvian company COM S.A.,  an IT company heavily specialised in IT outsourcing  services and, above all, BPO. This acquisition is  important, not only because it enables Indra to  increase its presence in the Peruvian market by  operating in a new field with an enormous potential  for growth (outsourcing and BPO), but also because  it is of great value in terms of developing our  capacities for delivery on a global scale, since Indra  will export its BPO services from Peru to the rest of  the world.      Additionally, Indra has signed a contract with Banco  Sabadell for the outsourcing of its back office  processes which has led to the creation of the joint  enterprise IFOS, which will be responsible for  supplying services from  Argentina and will  subsequently supply other customers.     This development of capacity for delivery on a  global scale is a key factor in the outsourcing and  BPO markets since our customers are embarking on  the globalisation of service provision models as a  means of increasing efficiency.  Consequently,  customers are increasingly seeking suppliers of  technology which are able to offer global  management of outsourcing services. The capacity  for global delivery has become a prerequisite for  competitors in our sector.      ANNUAL REPORT 2010   31  Our capacity for global delivery has enabled us,  during 2010, to accompany our Spanish customers  on the road to globalisation of the management of  services. Customers supported include Grupo Prisa  in Spain, Portugal and Latin America, BBVA in Spain,  Colombia and Mexico; Mapfre in Spain, Colombia,  Brazil and the U.S.A.; Telefnica in Europe and Latin  America ; or Gas Natural-Fenosa.     Furthermore, the capacity for global delivery  provides us with a greater capacity to deal with  competition in the market and be more efficient in  our production model.     Efficient efficiency: how we improve efficiency  in the supply of services    Within our model for the supply of outsourcing  services we have continued working on an ongoing  improvement to our efficiency. We strive for  maximum efficiency in terms of cost and quality in  order to continue being highly competitive in the  market.    In this context, one of our main approaches has  been to concentrate production capacity by the  creation of reference centres. For example, we  have concentrated our capacity in ERP (SAP) at our  centre in Argentina; our capacity in open  technologies (J2EE and .Net) at our centre in  Colombia; and our capacity for user support at our  centre in Lrida, Spain. These production centres  are specialised and support the company's  operations throughout the world. This policy is  enabling us to create synergies, economies of scale  and, in short, to be more efficient and improve our  quality yet more, if possible.     The concentration of production capacity is part of  Indra's strategy for development of its global  delivery network, consisting of more than 75  centres of excellence, 7 data centres and 3 user  support centres.  A project which clearly  demonstrates our capacity for global delivery  involves our customer Enel in Italy, which has been  supplied with services from our production centres  in Slovakia and Moldavia.    Furthermore we are enhancing this process with  the implementation of tools for the improvement of  the production model.  For example, we have  designed and implemented a suite of applications  for service measurement, and to increase the  capacity for the automation of the production  processes.    Reducing the impact of our documentation  services     In 2010 Indra was awarded FSC Chain of Custody  accreditation at three of its centres. This  certification covers paper management and  assesses the forestry supply chain, starting with  the trees and finishing with the end product,  through all stages of processing, transformation,  manufacturing and distribution, to verify that the  wood comes from well-managed sources.    THE FUTURE     We predict major opportunities for growth in the  main markets in which we have presence.     In Spain, for example, the trend towards reduced  costs and improved efficiency, as well as the  reduced number of suppliers (especially in the  telecommunications and financial services sectors),  continues to offer opportunities for growth for  those companies who, with their added-value  service offering, possess increasingly advanced and  efficient production and delivery centres which  enable them to cope with the already strong  pressure on prices.    In this context, Indra intends to continue the trend  towards verticalisation of its BPO offering through  the creation of multiclient shared service centres  specialising in banking, telecommunications and  energy, on technological platforms with a high  potential for growth which can be used on an  international scale.    At the same time we intend to strengthen our  Cloud Computing capacity, and our priority in this  area is to develop an appropriate strategy of  technological alliances and base the service supply  model on an offering of differentiated proprietary  solutions with high added-value.    ANNUAL REPORT 2010   32    On the other hand the IT market in Latin America is  less mature compared to Europe or U.S.A. and the  extent of penetration in outsourcing and BPO  services is still relatively low. This means that this  market is due to experience a very high level of  growth in the coming years, and Indra aims to gain  leverage from its strong presence in the region and  its varied offering of services to exploit this  growth. Furthermore this region is a focal point for  our global delivery strategy, since it allows us to  provide more effective support to customers  throughout the world.  ANNUAL REPORT 2010   33  10.

TRANSPORT & TRAFFIC    Solutions and services    Air Traffic Management (ATM)    Communication, navigation and surveillance  (CNS)    Airports    Rail traffic management    Road and maritime traffic    Ticketing and tolls    Market trends    Intelligent infrastructure based on digital  solutions: logistics, transport, traffic...    Intensive urban planning process worldwide  and increase in number of megacities.    Major need for transport infrastructure  development in emerging countries.    Increasing importance of security and  sustainable mobility.    Sustained increase in demand for transport.     Growing user interest in transport information  (GPS navigation, traffic and weather  conditions, parking/petrol station locations).    Generation of public-private partnership  models.    Indra and customers real expectations    The company has introduced an end-to-end  solution for transport and rail traffic management, a  new suite encompassing everything from real-time  control systems – for buses, trams, underground  systems or railways – to automatic payment  methods, operator management, control and  operational systems and rollout of communication  networks for transport infrastructure.     Meanwhile, the company has created an end-to-end  large-scale construction project management  system to serve companies contracted to widen the  Panama Canal.  This system, Indra's debut in a new  business line, consists of developing an information  system to enable the winning venture, comprising  four corporations, to jointly manage the project  from groundbreaking to maintenance.     In the air traffic market, the company has created a  subsidiary, Tower Air Traffic Services, to provide  airport air traffic services and alert, advisory and  flight information services. Indras foray into this  new area of business reflects the Public Works  Ministrys revised regulatory regime, which allows a  range of suppliers to provide air navigation  services, an activity previously conducted  exclusively by the government-owned Airports and  Air Navigation authority, or AENA.   Bolstering confidence among our large  customers    In 2010 Indra assisted ADIF (Spain's Administrator  of Railway Infrastructures) in managing railway  control centres and corporate IT applications  (inventory management, telephone instructions and  the Spatial Data Infrastructure project).  In  addition, ADIF has hired Indra to develop the  technology required to create an Information and  Communications Technology Laboratory for high- speed rail, which will be a platform for all of the  railway operators R&D information systems.     Thanks to its relationships with customers such as  ADIF, Indra now does business worldwide:  implementing the Da Vinci system in the UK,  Morocco, Colombia and, more recently, Lithuania,  and submitting bids at several international tenders  in countries such as China and Saudi Arabia, to  name only a few. Specifically, the Lithuanian project  calls for the modernisation of all rail traffic  management and control systems across the  countrys 1,700-kilometre rail network.    Meanwhile, Metro Saint Louis (US) hired Indra again,  this time to install a contactless smartcard ticketing  system for its light rail and bus networks in  Missouri and Illinois. New features include a back- office system and state-of-the-art pricing solution  known as the Account Based System, which   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   37  automatically determines the best available fare to  charge for each passengers journey.     Cutting-edge technology for traffic  management and control, tunnel control and  toll systems.     In 2010 the company installed high-tech systems  which notably improved traffic circulation  efficiency, thereby reducing management costs.     Indra achieved one of its business objectives,  boosting its presence in emerging markets, by  signing a contract to introduce its access control  and ticketing technology on two rail lines in Kuala  Lumpur (Malaysia). It also won its first road traffic  deal in Morocco, where it will develop a  management and control system for the first tunnel  on the country's major road network.      In Latin America, Indra introduced one of the  regions most high-tech free-flow electronic toll  systems, installing intelligent traffic control  systems on Mexico's Bicentennial Overpass, a  smartcard payment system on the Metro Valparaiso  underground (Chile) and a toll collection system on  Perus Sol motorway.     Leadership in the global air traffic management  market    Indra has further cemented its position to become  one of the worlds leading providers of air traffic  management (ATM) systems, with air traffic  authorities in more than 90 countries relying on our  technology. In 2010 the company continued to  build on this expansion process, disembarking in  new markets in accordance with its previously- announced strategy:    In the Middle East, Indra has become Omans  technology supplier and is set to update the  technology used by the countrys air traffic  management infrastructure. In Kuwait, Indra will  modernise air traffic management, helping us to  secure our market position in the Gulf, a strategic  area of the world thanks to its rapid economic  growth.     In Asia, the company ventured into the Thai air  traffic market, winning a contract to install  surveillance and control systems at four  international airports. Separately, Indras first  contract in Indonesia opens the door to a market  with huge growth potential, with air traffic control  systems in the process of being upgraded at the  countrys 200 airports. The company also increased  its presence in India and China. The Civil Aviation  Administration of China awarded the company the  deployment of a surveillance network consisted of  more than 20 radars. Meanwhile, in India, Indra won  its biggest contract in recent years in terms of  number of air traffic control systems. The deal calls  for Indra to install nine radar stations and equip 38  airports with its air traffic management systems.    In Europe, the company continues to make progress  on the future flight data processing system iTEC  (interoperability Through European Collaboration)  as a tech partner for aviation industry authorities in  Spain (AENA), Germany (DFS) and the UK (NATS).   The system, which must be compliant with the  SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research)  Programme within the framework of the future  European Single Sky agreement, was also chosen  by Portugal to address its future air traffic control  needs.      ANNUAL REPORT 2010   38  FUTURE    The outlook is very promising.     In overland traffic, our growing range of successful  products and rail operators clear commitment to  modernisation to enhance the efficiency,  sustainability and quality of their services, ensure a  propitious future for this business. The company  will continue to devote resources to markets it  considers to be significant, including Latin America,  the Middle East, Europe, North Africa and Southeast  Asia (Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia).      In air traffic, Indra is applying the same strategic  approach: on the one hand, adding European  countries to the iTEC system and, on the other,  developing and cementing our technology in Asian  markets.  We are the leading company in ATM  systems in Latin America, and our next challenge in  the region is to break into the Brazilian and Mexican  markets.  At the same time, Indra is disembarking in  new regions of the world, such as the Solomon  Islands, Papua New Guinea, via the companys  Australian subsidiary.        Environmental sustainability   Reducing consumption of fuel per flight and  lowering CO2 emissions    In Karlsruhe, site of Germanys largest air traffic  control hub, Indra introduced a pioneering  technology adapted for the Single European Sky  initiative, a major revolution in the future system  for managing civil aviation as established by the EU.   The project marks the first time that a European  country has adopted 4D technology for trajectory  management of aircraft, in contrast to the current  system based on "fixed or semi-fixed routes." The  new system offers more efficient, dynamic and  precise air traffic management using calculations of  aeroplane trajectories in real time.  This system not  only triples air traffic capacity, it allows authorities  to reduce flight distances by finding the most direct   routes available , thereby helping to reduce fuel  consumption per flight by between 300 kg and 500  kg and to cut CO2 greenhouse gas emissions by  between 945 kg and 1,575 kg.   Social sustainability  104 next-generation mobile traffic radar  devices for Argentina    In Argentina Indra will deliver 104 mobile radar  devices, technically known as "speed traps,"  equipped with next-generation technology for  traffic speed prevention and control activities.   These mobile radar speed detectors will monitor  vehicle speeds on motorways and roads in  Argentina, allowing authorities to better detect and  manage traffic infractions across the country.  Through this contract Indra will support Argentina's  National Traffic Safety Agency (ANSV) in its efforts  to raise awareness among all drivers of the  importance of complying with traffic laws to  improve the country's road safety.     Awards and honours    Indras ticketing technology received an  Honourable Mention" at the Austin Access Awards,  which praised the company's project for the Texas  capital's Light Rail network.  The Austin City Council  noted that ticket vending machines are fully  accessible, provide visual, audible and Braille  information and are accessible by people in  wheelchairs.  In addition to MetroRails complete  automatic ticket vending system, Indras 2008  project includes ticket cancellation and validation  systems and a control centre.      ANNUAL REPORT 2010   39  13.

In 2010, Indra was awarded a contract to manage  the commercial processes of Maynilad, Philippines'  largest water company in terms of customer base.  This project will help Maynilad optimise its meter  reading and billing cycle (with the company using  portable devices to generate water bills onsite). It  will also reduce collection time and make  disconnection and reconnection services easier, as  well as improving the quality of the readings taken.    Indra was also awarded a contract by Sedapal,  Limas sanitation company, to supply, install and  maintain the company's water meters and IT  infrastructure as well as providing meter reading  services and billing distribution and alerts and  inspections in Peru's capital city, the company's  main market. The city's population tops 3,300,000  inhabitants and is the most important of the three  where Sedapal operates in terms of size, number of  users and turnover. The company will also work to  detect illegal connections and take measures to  ensure that bills are paid and stamp out fraud.    The company also carries out maintenance work at  Madrid 's regional water utility, Canal de Isabel II  (CYII). Indra maintains CYII's water operating  management software, leveraging on its broad  knowledge of this sector and the most modern  technologies to guarantee sustainable  management of this scarce natural resource. This  allows CYII to plan, over the medium and long term,  the correct use of its reservoirs, its underground  water supplies, water treatment facilities and  sediment removal. It also guarantees correct  performance of reservoir outflows, network  sectoring, positioning of large water pipes and  water deposits.    Indra bolsters its leadership position in Utilities  and Energy in Latin America    Indra was also awarded the contract to manage the  basic technical services and IT systems of  Ecopetrol, Colombia's largest and Latin America's  fourth largest oil company. The project involves  operating, supporting and maintaining the  company's software infrastructure and its more  than 500 financial, administrative and business  applications as well as managing its hardware  infrastructure and data processing centres.       ANNUAL REPORT 2010   40  Indra helps modernise the electricity sector in  Africa and Brazil    The Municipal Electricity Department of Poos de  Caldas (DME) decided to centralise the company's  information and processes into a single tool, divided  into four areas: project management, maintenance,  planning and voltage measurement management.  DME currently uses Indra's energy distribution  management system (OPEN SGD) which is installed  at over 40 power distribution companies in Brazil  and a further 130 companies worldwide. By  adopting this system DME now complies with a  ruling from 's electricity regulatory agency (ANEEL),  which contemplates, among other issues, the use of  modern technologies by companies in the  electricity industry.Brazil    CPFL Paulista Brazil's electricity distribution  company and subsidiary of the CPFL Energa group,  awarded Indra a contract to develop and roll out a  solution to physically compile a list of the  company's electricity assets and carry out an onsite  visual inspection of its power lines: this involved  locating and identifying the assets, collating data  from the owners, recording and calculating any  irregularities and verifying the information. This  project will help update the company's database to  include geographical coordinates and integrate this  with the SAP business model     Cameroon's power company AES SONEL contracted  Indra to modernise its management system by  supplying and implementing commercial  management and energy balance module systems.  The project involves redesigning the company's  commercial processes and reviewing its  organisational model as well as drawing up a field  survey to update its customers' details and  information on supply points and metering  equipment. This project cements Indra's presence in  the African energy market where it has participated  in some of the continent's most important  modernisation projects in:  Kenya, Zimbabwe,  Zambia, Ethiopia, Uganda and Libya. It is also  currently renovating, modernising and automating  practically all of Morocco's hydro plants.    Ceicom consolidates its international  leadership position in solutions and services  for the airline industry.    Ceicom, Indra's specialist airline industry division,  continues to grow its customer portfolio with more  and more companies choosing its Aracs products,  including Aracs Fx TM (a comprehensive revenue  accounting solution) and Aracs Fly (a frequent  flyer/loyalty programme solution). Spanair, a Star  Alliance member, is one of its clients.  The Aracs  solution is integrated into the main reservation,  inventory and DCS systems (Amadeus, Sabre,  Navitaire) and ERPs (SAP, ORACLE) and offers  complete control of a company's revenue cycle,  enabling significant improvements in efficiency as  it reduces processing times, improves the  information provided to take decisions and reduces  operating costs. Spanair also uses Indra's BPO  service, guaranteeing it access to the industry's  best practices through highly-specialised  professionals who help the airline adapt easily and  efficiently to new processes in this highly dynamic  and global industry.    Over 100 million passengers at 25 clients located  across four continents are now managed using  Aracs solutions.  Clients have a choice between in- house solutions which can be pay-per-use models  using Indra's Cloud Computing facilities, and  comprehensive management of their processes  using BPO solutions.    The services model continues its rise, becoming  one of the highest growth business areas.    Companies' efforts to reduce costs and increased  competition continue to drive the outsourcing and  application maintenance services model. The  company also offers a global services model via its  extensive network of software factories (on- shore/off-shore) and its Services Production  Centres which guarantee high levels of efficiency,  quality and productivity.     The outsourcing of business processes is currently  the best alternative for those companies seeking to  save on technology costs and which also demand  greater flexibility in their businesses for their  production resources and constant specialisation  and innovation.   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   41    The roll out of technological solutions  continues to grow apace     Indra is a key ERP player.    In 2010, Duro Felguera hired Indra to upgrade its  Oracle corporate systems to ensure efficient  management with the ultimate aim of optimising  and improving control over its business. The project  covers 62 companies in 13 countries and 2,000  employees.     We continue to build on our SAP offering with  important roll out and maintenance services  contracts, strengthening our position in those  sectors which we consider strategic to future  growth (tourism, services, retail and consumer  goods).  Along these lines, in 2010 we rolled out a  major project in the legal services sector for  Cuatrecasas Gonalves Pereira SRLP.  This project  has become a benchmark in vertical solutions for  the legal sector given its swift implementation,  scope and the use of a large portfolio of integrated  SAP solutions (CRM, portals, human resources, legal  services management, etc.) as well as covering  specific legal processes both on a local and  international level.    Making headway in Latin America    In Colombia, the company has been awarded a  project by Sper Tiendas and Drogueras Olmpica,  one of the country's largest supermarket and  chemist chains, to outsource the maintenance and  support systems of its entire technological platform  for work stations and points of sale (POS). The  contract involves providing service guarantee (GPS  -Garanta de Prestacin de Servicio) and IT  equipment inventory services, preventative and  corrective maintenance, incident response and  requests from users, and the installation and  configuration of software and equipment as well as  post-roll-out support.    Indra has also rolled out an advanced real-time  tracking system at Blue Express of Chile, which  specialises in outsourcing services for physical  distribution, storage, inventory administration and  international courier services. This tracking system  allows Blue Express to efficiently and optimally  manage all package and cargo deliveries by  managing its ground fleet and its customers'  products throughout Chile. Indra has integrated  over 200 PDAs which, using wi-fi or a mobile  network, provide details of the state, location and  status of a consignment when receiving or  delivering it. Thanks to this new technological  platform, Blue Express has managed to attain  international quality standards for cargo shipment  and distribution.     ANNUAL REPORT 2010   42  FUTURE    In 2010 we saw confirmation of the trend begun a  few years ago in industry and consumption with  industrial companies moving towards a services- based business model.  Thanks to its technological  offering and BPO services, Indra is extremely well- positioned to leverage these opportunities. We also  anticipate significant growth in ERP rollouts,  particularly at medium-sized companies.    We expect strong growth in the number of  international transactions in the countries where  Indra is present, as well as further advances in  those products already in the market.    In energy, increased demand and higher generation  costs have given greater impetus to more efficient  management of the energy value chain, ranging  from distribution to more energy-efficient devices  as well as the roll out of Smart Grids in the sector's  transport and distribution networks. Thanks to its  knowledge of the sector and international  experience, Indra and its clients are fully committed  to developing Smart Grid solutions which predict  and help transform the generation, distribution and  sales processes.    Environmental Sustainability  Environmental protection for the Ebro Delta    Indra will roll out a network of environmental  sensors to measure real time conditions of the Ebro  Delta in order to assess the environmental progress  of this natural area, its state of conservation, its  aquatic ecosystems and the quality of the surface  water and aquifers, and also producing a log file  where all the data will be recorded. The system  gathers and transmits the measurements collected  from a data processing centre which will help the  relevant authorities take decisions and monitor the  environmental initiatives carried out.    This network of sensors will offer real time  information on the area's hydrological situation (e.g.  water levels and flows, the state of the salt wedge  and pumping stations), as well as the state of the  sea (water levels, currents and swells). The system  will also provide information on the state of both  river and maritime sediments based on the  evolution of the coastline and banks. The quality of  surface water and the aquifers will also be analysed  and documented, as will the surface and riverbed  subsistence rate and the compaction rate of the  riverbed.    The information will be published on a website for  internal and public use. Indra will also supply the  GIS system to publish and consult this geographical  information, which will be used to study predictive  environmental progress models. The data  processing centre will be linked up to the Ebro  Hydrographical Federation and the Catalan water  authority so that information can be exchanged  easily.    Under the terms of the project, Indra will also  supply and start up a research laboratory to control  the waters.    Economic Sustainability  Household energy efficiency    Indra is taking part in the EU's 3-E Houses initiative  aimed at improving household energy efficiency. By  installing domotics systems and using ICTs, the  scheme plans to cut energy consumption. These  savings will also help reduce CO2 emissions and  water consumption at the social housing units  included in the project, which are located in  Sant  Cugat (Spain), Bristol (UK), Leipzig (Germany) and  Sofia (Bulgaria).     Gas Natural Fenosa and Indra will design and install  the technological system to improve energy  efficiency at the homes in Sant Cugat. The power  company will first carry out an energy audit at the  two buildings and will then install next generation  devices designed by Indra which will facilitate  energy savings.  Among the devices to be installed  are thermostats and presence detectors for lighting  systems and climate devices.     ANNUAL REPORT 2010   43  Once these devices have been installed, the  tenants will be able to check their real energy  consumption online with specialised personnel, who  will be on hand to advise them on the best  strategies to help flatten their energy consumption  curve. The aim is to transfer part of the  consumption to cheaper and less polluting time  slots. As an incentive, the tenants will be offered  ecopoints which they can exchange for gifts or  public transport vouchers.    The EU will assess the results of the 3-E Houses  project in these four cities to determine whether to  roll it out to more buildings.  ANNUAL REPORT 2010   44  14. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION  & HEALTHCARE    Solutions and services    Electronic administration    Land registry management systems    Citizens services    Integrated tax management    Judicial management systems    Electoral ballot counting systems    iParticipa    Unique Healthcare Record    Clinical Stations    Digital medical imaging    Multichannel citizens services portal    Electronic prescriptions    Telemedicine and monitoring    Market trends    Budget containment by the Public  Administration sector.    Increasing need for modernisation and greater  efficiency (digitalisation, automation, shared  service centres etc.) in the Public  Administration sector.    More citizen involvement in public decision- making.    Growing demand for health services as the  population grows and life expectancy  increases.    Digital healthcare: development from current  hospital model (based on cure), towards a more  preventive and automated model  (telemedicine).    eAdministration: Firm commitment to  improving the relationship between  institutions and citizens in a comfortable, safe  and transparent environment    Indra has always demonstrated its commitment to  the adoption of Information Technology by the  public administration sector. The company's  participation in the STORK project, being developed  under the i2010 initiative promoted by the  European Commission to achieve interoperability  between European electronic institutions, is a prime  example of its commitment. As a result, it will be  possible to manage the electronic identity of 400  million European citizens. The electronic National  Identity Document will be accepted by the public  administration organisations in all other European  countries.    Consolidating and growing with our businesses    Throughout 2010 we extended our presence in  Latin America, thanks to important contracts such  as the ballot counting system for the presidential  elections in Columbia, the implementation of  electronic voting in the municipal elections in  Marcos Jurez (in Crdoba province) using eco-ballot  boxes, or the consolidation of taxation, land  registry, and legal projects in El Salvador and Costa  Rica.     In Spain we have extended our presence in the  Autonomous Regional Communities, such as the  Canary Islands, where we have implemented the  Canary General Indirect Tax (IGIC). We have started  to operate in the Principality of Asturias where  Indra has been awarded the contract for developing  security and management applications for the  Principality's Information Services Management  Centre. We have also implemented sustainable  solutions such as Electronic Polling Stations (CAE)  in the Parliamentary elections in Catalonia, which  have facilitated a more ecological process through  printing ballot papers on demand.    Elsewhere, most notably, there is the ambitious  project to create the biggest wireless network in  Europe for the Regional Government of Valencia. It  will provide free access to the Internet and to an  Intranet that will connect all the municipalities in  the province of Valencia with the Regional  Government's Data Processing Centre, allow  interconnectivity between all the public  establishments within each municipality, or provide  wi-fi connectivity outside public offices so that  citizens have access to electronic administration  services and local government staff have access to  their systems.     ANNUAL REPORT 2010   45  Commitments in the education sector     Education is one of the markets experiencing major  growth. The company is contributing to building a  new education model that relies on digital content  serving as the foundation for rolling out teaching  and learning methods matched to its learners –  those born in the digital age – and which creates a  collaborative environment for the education  community. Indra has wide experience in the  design, development and implementation of  comprehensive management systems in the field of  education and is solidifying itself as a leader in this  niche market with great expectations.     Against this backdrop, the company has  established, through its academic management  platform in the Community of Madrid, a global  benchmark for the implementation of SAP in the  field of education for a geographic region with more  than a million students. It is a system which is fully  integrated into the various layers in education. Its  objective is to improve the quality of management  in education, encourage active participation and  facilitate an enduring relationship among all those  involved in the education model: teaching staff,  managers, learners and families. The initiative will  engage around 2,500 establishments and almost  two million users. Uploading all this information into  the current Unique Learner File will enable the  various agencies in the educational system to see,  in digital format, a unique and comprehensive view  of a student's history, from enrolment through the  end of secondary education.    At the same time we remain committed to cutting- edge projects such as Agrega (a joint project with  various public administration organisations  financed under the Avanza plan), whose objective is  to provide the education community with a useable  tool for integrating information and communication  technologies. We are currently in a new phase  which consists of producing a more interactive page  from this portal where those involved can  communicate as well as add their own content.  Furthermore, the success of this platform has  crossed borders: Spanish administration bodies  have provided the Education and Research Network  "Janet" in the United Kingdom with the source code  and documentation for the Agrega platform for  digital educational content.     In addition, the company is developing the project  for technological innovation in administration for  the comprehensive academic management of  members of the education system in Valencia  (Itaca) and is in charge of maintaining the education  systems for the Department of Education for the  Regional Government of Galicia.    Development of expertise in the field of  dependency    The way we deal with dependent members of  society is becoming one of the main challenges for  governments and society in general, as the  population gets older and life-expectancy  increases, amongst other factors, the number of  people in this situation is on the rise.     Over the course of 2010, Indra has been awarded a  contract for implementing a computer system  which enables the processes of intervention and  management to be unified to record and process  data, which will pave the way for the future  creation of a unique social record for every person  living in one of these centres, as well as the  development of individual care plans in all the old  people's homes in Castilla La Mancha.    Partners in the improvement of the quality of  care and modernisation of health services    Indra has continued driving the quest for new  knowledge to facilitate improving the quality of  care and modernisation of the health services,  thereby upholding its position as an undisputed  technological ally for public institutions on a  national scale.     In 2010 we reached an agreement with the  Department of Health for Cantabria in order to drive  forward R+D projects related to support systems  for drug-dependency procedures, integrated  management of the operating room, clinical  navigation and simulation platform, and support  systems for care procedures. Furthermore we have  established a presence in the Principality of   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   46  Asturias with the development and implementation  of electronic prescriptions and the digitalisation of  the Central University Hospital of Asturias.  In the  Community of Madrid, the Personalised Care Centre   has been launched, the first time Spain has had  choice in healthcare by providing citizens with a  comprehensive personalised care service.  We have  also been awarded the contract for maintaining,  evolving and developing healthcare applications in  order to establish a Centre for Maintenance,  Evolution and Development of Healthcare  Applications (Medas).     For its part, the Spanish Ministry of Industry,  through red.es, has awarded Indra the contract for  the installation and maintenance of 170 high  resolution stations in operating theatres in the  various regional healthcare services in order to  improve the quality of surgical care via direct  access to the patient's clinical history during  surgical operations.    Finally, there is an outstanding innovative project  underway for the Valencian Health Agency, which  will make this Autonomous Community the first in  Spain to benefit from a fully standardised  information system to provide support for  managing all its laboratory services.     Accordingly, Indra aims to continue playing an  important role as a partner in technology for Public  Health through our commitment to innovation and  by defining more sustainable and competitive  health models thanks in part to the experience and  knowledge acquired in the Centres of Excellence  such as those launched in 2010 in Toledo, for the  study of Digital Medical Imaging, or the Centre of  Excellence for Digital Health in Seville.    FUTURE    To seek new opportunities in those areas of  anticipated growth (taxation, justice, land registry,  e-Administration) in parts of the world where it is  our policy to operate and export our products.    Building a structure which enables international  projects to be undertaken, using two methods to  strengthen the organisation:  on the one hand,  subsidiaries and stronger hubs in public  administration organisations and, on the other,  guaranteed export capability from Spain with  guarantee possibilities (one for subsidiaries and  another to export to countries where we do not  have any presence). Accordingly, the necessary  links are being made with the network of branches  located around the world (Philippines, Argentina,  Colombia, Mexico, etc.) which will enable us with  certain guarantees to export and make our name  known on the continent.     In Healthcare the constant increase in demand and  healthcare costs is creating a need to make  changes to the healthcare model which will  contribute to the system's sustainability.  Furthermore, new diagnostic techniques are  evolving into progressively more personalised  treatment. In this area the company is opting for  systems suited to this new reality such as solutions  focused on the best means of managing interaction  with the patient, telemedicine, integrated  management of the clinical history, electronic  prescribing, etc., which facilitate improving the  quality of service to the citizen, the success of  treatment and the effectiveness of healthcare  procedures. Indra is also making its range of great  solutions in hospital management available to  those emerging countries where there is a strong  drive for building new hospitals and modernising  those that already exist.     ANNUAL REPORT 2010   47  Economic/Environmental/Social Sustainability  Indra and Abertis Telecom are to develop  "smart cities" in Lleida and Sant Cugat    Indra and Abertis Telecom are to turn Lleida and  Sant Cugat del Valls into "Smart Cities" under a  collaboration framework agreed between the  companies to develop this concept. This involves,  amongst other activities, a study on the creation in  Catalonia of a Benchmark Centre for the roll-out  and operation of solutions, technologies and  services relating to Smart Cities. "Smart Cities"  embody the concept of the cities of the future,  based on intensive use of front-line technologies to  achieve efficient management of economic  resources in the planning, management and  operation of the various municipal services  provided to citizens.  The objective is to improve  quality of life, increase the efficiency of public  services, increase participation by citizens in the  services, improve the conditions for environmental  sustainability and enhance the opportunities that  the city offers people and businesses. Furthermore,  "Smart Cities" involve more proactive, flexible and  adaptable Public Administration, better suited to  respond to the more complex needs of the citizen.     Social sustainability   Intelligent Teletreatment for diabetics     Indra has developed a prototype for the intelligent  teletreatment for diabetics for the General  University Hospital in Valencia. This project, under  the R+D programme Tratamiento 2.0, is aimed at  creating a generic technological platform which  encompasses applications designed for managing  and applying medical treatment remotely. This  system enables professionals to access from their  surgery information about their patients' variable  readings and monitor that they are following the  course of treatment prescribed.  Patients will also  be able to do their rehabilitation exercises, receive  messages reminding them to measure their glucose  levels or blood pressure, and send information  without leaving their homes.  The platform includes  educational games and intelligent tools capable of  evaluating the data received and sending warnings  to doctors and patients if data outside the normal  range is recorded. The technology developed in this  prototype may also be extrapolated and applied to  the treatment of a wide range of illnesses,  including high blood pressure or obstructive lung  diseases. Awards and recognitions     The Electronic Medical History (Ianus), presented  by the Regional Government of Galicia under the  European programme INTERREG IV Digital Local  Agenda, was judged to be the best example of  good practice amongst the 37 initiatives presented.  Ianus is the platform for integration of systems and  recording clinical information developed by Indra  which feeds into all the hospitals and approved  centres in the Galician Health Service (Sergas) and  to 442 health centres, which cover 98% of the  population of Galicia.

Merger process among financial institutions.    Increasing need for risk management and  control systems, as well as regulatory  compliance.    Growing pressure on commercial margins.    Rationalisation of resources to achieve greater  efficiency and lower costs.    Optimisation of commercial capacity.    Sharp growth in e-commerce.     Banking services over mobile devices (m- banking),    Global management for our customers.    Internationalise. Merge.     Our customers in the financial services market are  engaged in two parallel processes that significantly  influenced our strategy and activities in 2010. First,  financial services firms are steadily  internationalising their businesses, venturing into  markets that offer high growth potential, namely  Latin America. This process coincides with a merger  and acquisition (M&A) trend among technology  providers as companies seek to generate  economies of scale, synergies, efficiency and, in  short, attempt to cut costs.      Our competitive range of value-added services,  proven capacity to deliver and extensive and  substantial local presence in Latin America have  left us well positioned as one of our customers  leading technology providers, underscoring our role  as a key tech partner for large global corporations.      The following are examples of customers for whom  Indra globally manages technology services: BBVA,  for which we now manage all Latin American  subsidiaries in the countries in which the bank does  business, along with its US unit; Santander, for  which we manage the US, UK, Mexico, Brazil, Chile  and Argentina; and Mapfre, with which we signed a  global maintenance deal for the insurer's core  business, supporting its operations in the US,  Portugal, Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina from  our centres in Madrid and Bogota.     Consequently, these contracts have allowed us to  develop stable businesses in financial industries in  the US, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.     Strategic expansion in markets with promising  growth potential    Along with our strategy for accompanying large  customers in their expansion, we are building our  own presence in both the commercial and  manufacturing businesses in countries we consider  to be key due to the growth opportunities they  offer.      This strategy paid off in 2010 as the company  landed an important BPO contract with Banamex in  Mexico, in addition to a deal to outsource payment  method management for Brazils Caixa Econmica  Federal.     Key provider in financial restructuring and  merger processes     Indra plays a crucial role in the technological  aspects of mergers and restructuring processes  among banks in Spain.      While the Spanish financial industry is one of the  most competitive in the world, it is plagued by a  lack of competitiveness in the savings bank sector.  This issue is often the result of the meagre scope  and size of savings banks business and their  massive exposure to real estate risk from past   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   49  property market lending.   Sector restructuring is  therefore expected to continue in coming years,  driven both by competitive and legal pressures, and  our experience with mergers ensures that we will  be a leading technology provider throughout this  process.     While the pace of banking system restructuring in  2010 proceeded more slowly than anticipated, we  were involved in several significant mergers,  including the Institutional Protection System (SIP) 4  to merge Caja Madrid, Bancaja, Caja vila, Caja  Segovia, Caja Insular de Canarias, Caja Rioja, and  Caixa Laietana, and La Caixa's takeover of Caja  Gerona       Fostering the integration of technology  services and BPO    Indra signed a strategic deal with La Caixa to  provide technology services for the entire financial  institution, including handling the full document  management chain.  In addition, this alliance is  accompanied by another agreement for Indra to  take over the company Inforsistem (in which La  Caixa owns a 30-percent stake), which specialises  in large-scale document management.                                                                    4 A mechanism for merging lenders which is designed to protect  them by creating holding companies that will allow them to  continue to operate under their own trade names and maintain a  degree of independence while merging and circumventing  savings banks' unique political entanglements.     Further highlights in this area include document  management services outsourcing contracts  secured from Vetri (Mapfre Group), Banesto and  Santander.      Success with our new insurance solutions    Indra's efforts in recent years to develop a  proprietary core insurance solution, known as iOne,  have left us well placed in the market vis--vis  competing solutions which are based on more  obsolete technologies.  We received significant  feedback in 2010 on the high degree of  competitiveness of this solution, which should help  to bolster iOne in the commercial space.     iOnes state-of-the-art technology also allows us to  offer it under Software as a Service (SaaS) and  Cloud Computing models. This fosters customers  cost efficiency and represents a clear competitive  advantage compared with other solutions available  on the market.     Developing new products and services    In addition to iOne, we are working to develop an  array of services specifically for Cloud Computing  models.  Specifically, we have reached an  agreement with Ahorro Corporacin to sell a cash  management solution for a Cloud Computing model.      Meanwhile, we have developed a new  geomarketing and micromarketing solution,  Prospect, which combines financial industry client  information with social-demographic data for  purposes of research and deploying marketing  campaigns.  This innovative solution is now in use  at several insurance firms and lending institutions.      ANNUAL REPORT 2010   50  FUTURE    We have targeted two major opportunities going  forward: internationalisation and banking industry  restructuring in Spain.      We expect significant growth in Latin America and  the US in 2011 as a result of marketing efforts and  projects developed in 2010. Moreover, growth in  these regions may be complemented by stronger  showings in some European countries, such as the  UK, Germany, France and Poland, driven by several  major customers in those countries.       The restructuring of the Spanish banking industry  will not only generate opportunities for us in  projects to combine merging banks technology  operations, in the medium and long term it will also  produce sizeable financial institutions that better  resemble our ideal customer profile.   Economic sustainability  Payment method management for Brazils  Caixa Econmica Federal     We signed an agreement with Brazils Caixa  Econmica Federal in 2010 to provide an end-to- end solution for credit card processing.     The deal allows Caixa Econmica Federal to fully  update its payment method platform with  applications for management, administration,  authorisation and card loyalty schemes, plus  services associated with payment method  operations.     These services include call centres, business  support, back office support, recovery, fraud  prevention, monitoring, technical support for on-us  partners, credit risk analysis and knowledge  transfer in information and business technology.     Economic sustainability  Global maintenance for Mapfres core business    Indra in March 2010 began performing global  maintenance service for Mapfre's core business.   The agreement calls for Indra to run the hub used  by non-life-insurance units in all of the countries in  which Mapfre does business.      The service will be deployed on an on-site/offshore  basis, with a functional office in Madrid, close to the  client, and a development team at Indra's office in  Bogota.      The system has generated significant benefits for  Mapfre, including allowing it to shift its own  employees to more business-oriented activities,  consolidating a working pattern aligned with its  standards, cutting costs (management,  employment, etc.), and boosting quality and  productivity thanks to Indra's commitment to  Service Level Agreements (SLA).

SECURITY & DEFENCE    Solutions and services    Radar     Electronic defence     Military communications     Command and control     Simulation     Security    Space    Market trends    Cost containment in defence in developed  countries, where cost-cutting and efficiency- boosting schemes (public-private partnerships,  outsourcing, etc.) are sought, in contrast to the  sharp growth in spending on defence seen in  emerging nations.     Increase in private security investment.    Fields showing great potential: unmanned  systems, protection for forces and military air  transport, information, intelligence and  communications systems, cybersecurity,  protection of critical infrastructure, border  control and simulation.     Development of the security market    Over the past decade, the world's increased  awareness of potential threats to human safety  and infrastructure security has seen the concept of  "national security" take centre-stage and gain  ground over what the public traditionally thinks of  as "defence".    In the security market, information and  communication technologies (ICTs) play a key role  insofar as they allow for innovative solutions to be  developed so that risks can be anticipated and  prevented and so that the population can protect  itself against them and respond more effectively in  case of an emergency.    The growth of the security market worldwide  therefore represents a great opportunity for Indra,  which has products to offer in every area of  security, including threats to physical safety and  cybersecurity, and projects underway. The company  is also positioning itself as a benchmark provider in  a still emerging sector. In recognition of its global  offering, convergent with a range of security  technologies, Indra received an award from SIC  magazine at the 2010 Securmtica Fair.    The most salient projects of 2010 were in:    Border surveillance, with the implementation  of the first coastal surveillance system in  Galicia, Spain  In addition, we spearheaded an  important integrated maritime and border  security project for the European Union known  as Perseus, the objective of which was to unify  and coordinate real-time devices that target  clandestine immigration and illegal trafficking  through the intelligent use of the media and  the exchange of information among the  European countries and bodies involved.    Access control, with the implementation of a  pioneering rapid-access system at border  crossing points known as the Automatic Border  Control (ABC) System, the pilot system for  which is already in place at Barajas Airport in  Madrid and El Prat Airport in Barcelona.    Emergency management, with the  implementation of an integrated security and  emergency system for the fire service of the  regional government of Catalonia, the  Generalitat de Catalua.     Secure communications, with the broadening  of the secure communication channel between  Spain, Portugal and North Africa in order to  improve collaboration on illegal immigration  and drug trafficking    ANNUAL REPORT 2010   52  Innovation for improved human safety and  infrastructure security    Our innovation efforts are of particular importance  in the security market given the social and  technological challenges posed by the sector itself.  Consequently, Indra strives to participate in R&D  projects and create new products.     For example, in 2010, we carried out a number of  R&D projects, particularly in the area of  infrastructure protection. The most salient of these  projects include the Hesperia project, which  focused on integrating surveillance technology,  access control, biometric identification, crisis  management, 3D representation and augmented  reality; the European OPTIX project, ,which focused  on the remote detection of explosives; and the  SEDUCE project, which focused on developing  knowledge and technology to ensure the detection  of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) at  workplaces and public facilities.    Development of new defence markets    Despite the drastic budgetary cutbacks suffered by  the Ministry of Defence in Spain, our main  geographical market, which even increased  unexpectedly during the course of the year and  clearly affected orders for projects, we feel that  2010 has been a positive year for Indra since the  company has been able to penetrate new  geographical markets and create and consolidate  new products.    Highlights for the year specifically showcasing our  penetration of new markets include a major  electronic defence contract won in India, a satellite  communications terminal installation contract  awarded in Brazil, which made us a leading supplier  of this type of technology in the country; a mass  storage system that was implemented and a  geoportal for managing and disseminating  geospatial information that was developed and  implemented for the Earth Observation Satellite  System (SSOT) in Chile; a C312 System for the  geopositioning of Colombian Air Force aircraft  provided and brought online; and a 3D surveillance  and airspace control system provided to the  Uruguayan Air Force.     In Europe, we implemented electronic defence  systems in submarines for the Italian Navy and  communications systems for German F-122 class  frigates.     State-of-the-art technology for the European  combat plane    In 2010 the countries that are part of the  Eurofighter consortium approved the purchase of  88 aircraft as part of the first phase of the  program's third tranche of production. The impact  of this approval on Indra is highly positive since, as  the flagship provider of avionics equipment, it will  ensure production orders are received over the next  few years.     In addition, as part of the project, the Euroradar  consortium, in which Indra has a 19% interest,  launched the design phase of its new electronic  scanning radar known as ESCAN.    Consolidation of simulation products    2010 has been a year marked by significant  progress in our simulation activities.    We have positioned ourselves as the top preferred  supplier to Eurocopter, a client to which we have  also provided an AS-350 simulator for its training  centre in Dallas. The importance of the order lies in  the fact that the Eurocopter centre has been  certified by the United States Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA), which makes it available for  use by clients such as the Los Angeles police and  the Utah highway patrol . Above all, however, 2010  was the year in which the company consolidated its  most promising new lines of business in the area of  simulation. This was the case for the simulators  used for peacekeeping missions, with which a  project with the Spanish Army was won and the  simulation systems used to train security forces,  with which a project for the Municipal Police of  Valladolid was won.     Our increased offering of simulation products  should provide a clear opportunity for growth since   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   53  we foresee a sharp rise in investment in these  systems, driven by the cost and security  advantages they make possible and the restrictions  placed on defence budgets in leading economies.     Development of new unmanned aerial vehicles  (UAVs)    We continued to develop our capabilities in the field  of unmanned vehicles by participating in an R&D  project that aimed to develop a rotating wing and  dual application unmanned aerial system (UAS) for  both civilian and defence use.     In addition, the European Space Agency (ESA) put  its trust in Indra as the prime contractor in the  development of projects that will facilitate the  integration and use of UASs in civilian and security- related applications with the support of satellite  technologies.    Important projects in Spain    2010 marked the first anniversary of the  commissioning of the integrated emergency  management system used by the Emergency  Military Unit (UME) in Spain. The project continues  to evolve with the integration of new capabilities  that support the important work performed by the  UME in situations of crisis .    Also in 2010, the Spanish Navy took delivery of  two ships equipped with Indra's "sensor suite". This  suite includes all the on-board sensor components  needed by a ship: basic configuration navigation  radar, air and ground exploration, auxiliary radar for  flight deck aircraft operations, communications and  band radar electronic defence, and the navigation  data distribution system for all on-board systems.  The suite therefore constitutes a major milestone  in the Spanish defence technology industry.    THE FUTURE    The growing demand for critical infrastructure  protection and the company's position in pioneering  technologies in the security arena make the  prospects in this field some of the best.     In addition, awareness of information security on  the part of companies, public administrations and  armed forces worldwide has increased notably.  Cybersecurity is thus another top investment  priority for the next few years.      We will continue to invest in the creation of new  products in segments that we feel have a high  potential for growth, such as unmanned systems  and information, intelligence and communications  systems.   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   54  Social sustainability  Protection against nuclear, radiological,  biological and chemical (NRBC) threats    The Turkish Ministry of Defence awarded Indra a  contract to provide a deployable mobile laboratory  equipped to perform a confirmed analytical  identification of nuclear, radiological, biological and  chemical (NRBC) threats. In addition to the  development of the system, Indra will be in charge  of providing the laboratory with comprehensive  logistical support, which will include designing and  defining work protocols. The mobile laboratory will  be housed in a module that will allow it to be easily  moved by helicopter, cargo plane or truck to the  area of operations. The solution allows operators to  work in a clean space without putting their health  at risk. They can then study the samples collected  and announce the results once they are obtained.  The system includes a decontamination shower for  personnel to prevent the transfer of any  contaminants between the outside and inside.    Also in the area of NRBC security, the European  Defence Agency (EDA) entrusted Indra with the  development of technical and operational  requirements and architecture for the future  European Command and Control System that will  respond to nuclear, radiological, biological, chemical  and explosive (NRBCE) threats. The solution must  provide a general overview of NRBCE information  available throughout the European Union. To this  end, it will process information provided by  detection and alert devices deployed in the  territories of the various member countries. The  future system will be capable of graphically  displaying the scene of operations and all the  NRBCE information relating to it, as well as  disseminating the information collected, within a  useful timeframe, to the various agencies operating  in the area (police, firemen, health authorities, etc.)  and coordinating their actions if required.    The EDA also awarded Indra a contract to design,  develop and provide a deployable laboratory to  counteract IEDs. More casualties during  peacekeeping missions are caused by IEDs than by  any other means. Counteracting the threat of IEDs  has become the top priority of European Union  member states.     Environmental sustainability  Space solutions that help improve the  environment    The solutions that we develop as part of our space  activities often hold special meaning in  environmental terms.    For example, as part of the European Union's Global  Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES)  R&D programme, Indra developed a system that will  provide 38 European countries with accurate  geospatial information that will help in taking  environmental decisions and improve responses to  catastrophes like fire and flood   In addition, Indra launched an R&D project aimed at  developing an application that will allow citizens to  check the air quality in their city online and in a 3D  environment. This technology will particularly  benefit individuals who have cardiovascular or  respiratory problems, and will enable more effective  environmental policies to be established        Lastly, Indra was awarded a set of three contracts  by the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop a  radar system that will be used to detect objects in  space, the primary objective of which is to ensure  the safety of space missions; As a side benefit it  will also detect space "waste".

TELECOMS & MEDIA    Solutions and services   Outsourcing   Business support systems (BSS), customer care,  sales, loyalty, invoicing, payment collection,  portals   Operations support systems (OSS), networking,  planning, network inventory, network O&M,  interconnection, mediation   Management and support of audiovisual  producers   DTT services   Satellite communications stations   IT infrastructure    Market trends   Robust growth in mobile devices and broadband.   Development of mobility services (converging  with social applications).   Network rollout in emerging markets.    Convergence of services (fixed – mobile – xDSL).   Infrastructure transformation (migration to fibre  optics, wireless and convergence of IP  platforms).   Sophisticated customer management.   Cost rationalisation.   Consolidation of operators and centralisation of  decision-making.   Sharp increase in consumption and generation  of web-based content.     Acquisition of part of Telefnica Espaas R&D  business and its Brazilian subsidiary,  Telefnica Pesquisas e Desenvolvimento (TPD)    This transaction cements Indras position as a  leading integrator of Telefnicas network  management systems and enhances its market  position in one of the top strategic markets, Brazil.   This agreement gives the company skilled  resources backed by extensive experience in  commercial systems and telecommunications  operator networks.     At the same time, the company bolsters its global  reach in this market: in Spain, with more solutions  and services to enhance network capability and  expand end-client services; in Europe, with access  to new customers in Germany thanks to Telefnica  O2 Germanys broadband system, as well as in the  Czech Republic and United Kingdom; in Latin  America, with businesses in Argentina, Chile, Brazil,  Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Central  America. Specifically, in Brazil TPD maintains and  develops operational support systems for  Telefnica's Brazilian fixed-line carrier, TeleSP, in  addition to providing consulting services for  commercial systems.  In this manner, Indra has  secured a platform for future growth in the  telecoms market.     Telecoms business international reach    In line with the companys rapid growth at the  international level, Latin America remains one of  our fastest-growing areas of expansion. Further  highlights include the companys debuts in new  European markets such as Ireland and the UK, with  competitive solutions that enable us to improve  customer service.       The Chilean telecoms market underwent significant  change in 2010 as a consequence of regulatory  authorities efforts to improve services for end  users.  Against this backdrop, Indra adopted a  strategic focus on penetrating the portability  business in Chile, resulting in the launch of a solid  portability application offering all of the user- friendly features and capabilities customers  required.  These efforts paid off as Indra was  awarded portability for Carso Group companies:  Claro (mobile carrier), Telmex (fixed telephony), and  Telmexs long-distance carrier.      In Ireland, Indra joined O2 in the first phase of its  regionalisation and standardisation strategy for HR  processes and systems, developing and rolling out a  SAP CRM-based system and a SAP BCM-based  computer telephony integration (CTI) solution.  This  system allows employees of the five countries in  which O2 operates (UK, Germany, Ireland, Czech  Republic and Slovakia) to submit questions or open  requests to be processed by the Dublin shared  services centre, the EPSC (European People   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   56  Services Centre), via telephone, email or the  Internet.      Meanwhile, O2 UK awarded Indra a contract to  maintain and operate its network monitoring  systems in the UK.  The service, which includes  both progressive maintenance of the suite of O2  network monitoring applications and corrective  maintenance and operational support for these  same applications, leaves us well placed in  operational support systems (OSS) to capitalise on  this customer's future processes.    Implementation of the Santillana groups global  publishing project    Indra implemented the Santillana Groups publishing  system in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Chile  and Portugal. The objective is to institute a shared  publishing system for all group companies in order  to streamline publishing efforts at each of its 22  head offices (in Europe and the Americas) and  facilitate the exchange of products and their re-use  across markets.  As a consequence, publishing times  are shortened, productivity and material re-use  increases and repetitive tasks are avoided.      Ongoing innovation in digital television    Indra conducted a Viability Study of Creating a  Technology Park in Uruguay," geared towards the  audiovisual and interactive services industries.  This  research found that the creation of a Technology  Park is viable from market, technology and financial  standpoints.  Furthermore, the study highlighted  the country's potential for addressing current  demand for interactive AV content, and  underscored the benefits such a park would  generate for Uruguay.  The project further confirms  Indra's position as an industry leader with a  successful track record in exporting its DTT  experience from Spain to Latin America, where the  company has launched DTT pilot projects in major  Latin American capital cities.     As previously mentioned, the AV industry is a  business in which the company continues to bolster  its presence by developing significant projects.   Along these lines, Indra has helped to improve  Telemadrid's proprietary and third-party production  management by introducing proprietary systems to  support management and automation of internal  production processes (budgeting, one-stop-shop,  management of technical and human resources,  cost management, incident management and  financial management control) and third-party  production (budgeting, contracts, rights, etc.).      Moreover, we have added VEO TV to the single  advertising platform for Antena 3 channels (Antena  3, Neox and Nova), thereby encompassing the  different workflows and enabling the company to  establish business processes for the advertising  activities, management processes for advertising  programming, subsequent control for simultaneous  airing, plus control of advertising material flows,  self-advertising and content, among source  systems and broadcasting systems.      ANNUAL REPORT 2010   57  FUTURE    The rising demand for services among carriers  ensures that we can continue our European  expansion in tandem with our top clients as they  grow their businesses.     Latin America remains a highly appealing region.   Thanks to the capabilities and scale the company  has achieved following its acquisition of TDP and  through the subsidiary network we have developed  to meet the Prisa Group's needs internationally, the  company is expected to post significant growth,  particularly in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and  Colombia.     Economic sustainability  Integration of all Prisa group operational areas  in 22 countries    Indras management of all Prisa Group areas  globally (publishing, press, radio and audiovisual  media) has enabled Indra to bolster its leadership  position in the media business at the international  level and cement its position as a strategic IT  services provider for large multinationals.      In 2010 Indra merged all of Prisa Group's IT areas,  generating a more efficient, standardised  management model allowing the company to  optimise resources and lower costs.  Indra has  steadily added business units to the group that  previously operated independently, driving a  transformation towards a single global  management model.  This was the case at the  Santillana Groups IT divisions in 22 countries, TVI,  Portugals ratings leader among free television  channels, Radio Caracol (Colombias No. 1 station  and one of Latin Americas most prestigious  networks) and Radipolis in Mexico (117 stations).    Social sustainability  T-Administration Platform for the Segovia  Town Council    Indra developed an advanced digital terrestrial  television platform (DTT), which allows the public to  access local government services through an  electronic ID.  This pioneering project, the first of its  kind in Spain to facilitate e-Government, also  includes the most comprehensive range of services:  job search, e-learning and classified ads, plus a full  range of information on the province of Segovia  (telephone numbers, all-night chemists, medical  appointments, schools, tourism, sports facilities and  opening hours, restaurant reservations, transport,  events calendar, traffic delays, etc.).  Thanks to this  service, any member of the public with an  interactive DTT decoder may access the systems  complete range of applications from home and  interact with the Town Hall using only an electronic  ID.      Furthermore, the system offers several region-wide  applications whereby other town councils in Castile  Len may join the project in the future if they opt  to do so.   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   58  18.

Indra and the sector    Europes stock markets showed mixed  performances in 2010, with peripherals (including  Spain) hurt by events in sovereign debt markets.  These countries flagging economies and budget  imbalances, not to mention the impact of the  bailouts in Greece and Ireland, caused their country  risk premiums to soar, prompting investors to  unwind positions in equities of these countries  throughout the year. To illustrate, Frances CAC,  Germanys DAX and the UKs FTSE indices rose an  average of 7% in 2010, while Spains IBEX and  Italys MIB slumped 17% and 13%, respectively.   The information technology sector performed in  line with the broader European indices. The  FTSEeTX, one of the main sector indices, notched  up a 9% gain.

The company also has a variety of communication  channels available to its shareholders and  investors, specially designed to meet the  information needs of different investor types, from  retail shareholders to institutional investors:      Website: an award-winner in previous years for  the quality of the financial information it  contains, this is our main window of  communication with shareholders and  investors.      Shareholders Office: the contact channel for  all shareholders and investors which deals  with all kinds of enquiry.     Shareholders Magazine: specially designed for  retail shareholders.     One-on-one meetings    Visits with institutional investors    Furthermore, Indra belongs to the Spanish  Association for Investor Relations (Asociacin  Espaola para las Relaciones con Inversores - AERI)  and the Spanish Association of Issuers (Asociacin  de Emisores Espaoles – EE), in line with its policy   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   65  to ensure best practices in communications with  shareholders and with the financial community as a  whole.    The number of visits to institutional investors  increased by 14% in 2010, as part of Indras active  communication policy to ensure utmost  transparency and disclosure to financial markets.    In accordance with the new section 528.2 of the  Spanish Corporate Enterprises Act (Ley de  Sociedades de Capital), prior to the General  Shareholders Meeting in 2011 Indra will enable an  electronic forum for shareholders on its website to  facilitate communication with shareholders.     Apart from this legal obligation, Indra has  traditionally facilitated communication between the  company and its shareholders and promoted  shareholder participation in drawing up the agenda  for the meeting. Specifically, prior to convening the  General Shareholders Meeting, Indra publicly  informs shareholders of the tentative date of the  meeting and invites them to propose to the Board  of Directors, via the website or the shareholders  office, any items they wish to have dealt with or  included in the meeting agenda. These same means  are available to shareholders to ask for clarification  or request additional information regarding any  item on the agenda.     Indra also provides detailed information on the  procedures for granting proxies and exercising  voting rights by remote attendance to the meeting.    GOOD GOVERNANCE: THE BASIS OF  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT    Indra has certain governing bodies and governance  rules in place to ensure the good governance of the  company and contribute to its growth. It reviews  the composition of the Board of Directors and its  governance rules to verify compliance with best  practice in this field.    Review of the composition of the Board of  Directors    After Gas Natural sold its stake in Indra in April  2010, the proprietary director representing this  company, Salvador Gabarr Serra, tendered his  resignation from the board. The Board decided not  to fill the vacancy and submitted a proposal to the  General Shareholders Meeting, which was passed,  to reduce the number of directors from 15 to 14. As  a result, the Boards composition was adapted to  the capital represented on the board by significant  shareholders, with an adequate proportion between  propriety and independent directors.     Article 22 of the Regulations for the Board of  Directors establishes the criteria for the periodic  renewal of directors. In early 2005, based on  recommendations put forward by the  Appointments, Remunerations and Corporate  Governance Committee, the Board of Directors  adopted the following criteria: that independent  directors continuing presence on the board, unless  justified, should be limited to four terms  (established at three years) and that the procedure  for replacement should be gradual and phased.     Accordingly, the Board submitted a proposal to the  2010 General Shareholders Meeting, which was  passed, to remove independent director Joaqun  Moya-Angeler and appoint as his replacement  independent director Alberto Terol.     The Board of Directors has also established criteria  regarding the orderly succession of the chairmen of  board committees. As a result, in 2010 Daniel  Garca-Pita was appointed Chairman of the  Appointments, Remunerations and Corporate  Governance Committee, in place of Mr. Moya- Angeler.    Reinforcement of top management    In a bid to continue moving towards Indras full  globalisation and taking better advantage of  opportunities for growth, the Board of Directors has  decided to reinforce its management team by  appointing as President the current COO, Regino  Moranchel. It has also resolved to submit a proposal  at the upcoming General Shareholders Meeting,  tentatively an ordinary meeting to be held in the  first half of 2011, to appoint Javier de Andrs as   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   66  director and subsequently as COO. The Board also  agreed to appoint Carlos Surez, the current Deputy  Executive Vice President, as Executive Vice  President in charge of Defence. He will therefore  join the Executive Committee as member of the Top  Management team, assuming responsibility for  Defence and Space.    Constant adaptation and ongoing  improvements in our governance standards    In April 2010, the Board of Directors agreed to  amend the Regulations of the Board so as to  establish rules regarding the number of directors  comprising its committees, thereby expressly  regulating a practice already existing the company  in compliance with recommendation 26 of the  Unified Good Governance Code.     Within the scope of the review of the companys  internal rules, the Board agreed to implement a  series of minor amendments to section VII  (transactions with treasury shares) of the Internal  Code of Conduct in Matters Relating to the  Securities Markets, as it did not explain clearly  enough that the obligations contained in this sector  referred exclusively to transactions carried out by  the company itself involving its shares.    Leading CR initiatives in the Board of Directors:    Approval of the Annual Report entitled  Indra: Yes to innovation.    The Board is informed of the renewal for  the fifth consecutive year of Indras  membership of the Dow Jones  Sustainability Indexes.      The Board is notified in regard to the  various awards and prizes received by Indra  in 2010 relating to corporate reputation.    Assessment of the internal corporate  governance standards.    Reform of the Internal Code of Conduct in  Matters Relating to the Securities Market.    Indra, a socially responsible investment    Throughout the year, Indra received various awards  for being a socially responsible company.     Analysts at OEKOM, the leading German rating  agency for socially responsible investment,  assigned Indra a  Prime rating, making the Spanish  company one of the world leaders in its sector in  the field of sustainability. It also makes the  companys shares suitable for social and  environmentally responsible investments for the  firms clients.    In addition, for the fifth year in a row Indra was  included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World  Index (DJSWI) and Dow Jones STOXX Sustainability  Index (DJSI STOXX), and was once again the leading  company in the IT and Internet Services subsector.  Indra is the only European company in this  subsector and its top ranking, which it also attained  in 2007 and 2008, is based on a combination of  various economic, environmental and social criteria.

More information at  http://www.indracompany.com/en/sostenibilidad-e- innovacion/professionals     ANNUAL REPORT 2010   70  Talent is the main factor that sets Indra apart and  creates its competitive advantages. Personnel  management is therefore critical to us and to  recruiting, developing and retaining talent is a  strategic priority.    Recruitment: Indra's objective is to hire the best  professionals on the market. To this end, the company  maintains a strong relationship with universities and  business schools and attends the most important job  fairs. Indra currently has agreements with more than  150 universities, research centres and business  schools .The importance that Indra attaches to talent is  clearly demonstrated by the increase in its number of  professionals seen in 2010 (9.3%).     Graphic: Total Workforce evolution 2006-2010    Development: The career options available at Indra  are myriad and varied. They are designed to meet the  requirements of the various lines of business in which  we operate, in addition to the preferences, capacities  and needs of each professional, from those who want  to have a fast-paced career with international reach to  those who want to focus on specific technologies and  be experts on them.     Career options at Indra are associated with different  training tracks, which provide cross-cutting knowledge,  skills and capacities and techniques specific to the field  in which they work.   In addition, the reassignment policy complements skill  acquisition by exposing professionals to challenging  situations.     In 2010, 20% of Indra's professionals were promoted.     Retention: Talent management at Indra is based on an  individual, personalised treatment of the capacities,  motivations and interests of its professionals. In  addition to our development policies, which boost  motivation and commitment, we promote flexibility in  the workplace at Indra through policies that are  adapted to each of the countries where we operate so  that the company can meet the needs of each of our  professionals. As a result of these policies, Indra's  unwanted external turnover rate is one of the lowest  in its sector and stood at 7.2% in 2010.    Our professionals are the people who are fuelling the  company's current growth and will lead its growth in  the future. They will create the solutions and services  that will meet market challenges and take us to new  geographical markets.     At Indra we are proud of being able to rely on highly- committed and motivated professionals who are open  to change and have the capacity to learn.    One of the best companies at which to start your  career in Brazil    In 2011, Indra was included on the list of the best  companies in which to start your career (Melhores  Empresas para Comear a Carreira) by Brazilian  magazine Guia VOC S/A.     IMPROVEMENTS IN ASSIGNING POSITIONS,  PROCEEDINGS AND SHARING KNOWLEDGE    In 2010, our main activities in human resource  management were aimed at achieving four  fundamental goals:     Learn more about the skills of our professionals in  order to more effectively assign positions and  further develop the organisation: updated curricula  vitae were requested and changes were made to  the career management process so that both prior  experience and an employee's current position  could be taken into account.    Consolidate human resource procedures in every  country where we have major operations: The  strong growth Indra is seeing in regions like  and  Asia-Pacific is being accompanied by a gradual  implementation of corporate human resource  procedures. As a result, procedures are being  standardised and systematised worldwide, thereby  laying the foundation for increasingly mobile  9.915 23.482 24.806 26.175 28.608 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010  ANNUAL REPORT 2010   71  professionals and more knowledge exchange,  which can be leveraged to fuel company growth.   Latin America    Consolidate the new training model implemented  in 2010: Indra has revised its training model with  the aim of further aligning it with the professional  careers of our employees. This way, it can better  contribute to the development of the capacities  that are most needed in the performance of their  duties and equip them with the skills that will  enable them to progress professionally. More  specifically, the new training model is underpinned  by a new methodology and two types of school:  technical schools and functional schools.     Take full advantage of the company's knowledge:  as an information technology services company,  our professionals gain a vast amount of technical  and industry-specific knowledge that, when  shared, creates enormous possibilities in terms of  sales, efficiencies leveraged, ideation, etc.     Sharing knowledge    Sharing Knowledge is our collaborative knowledge  management  platform,  which  connects  all  the  company's professionals to one another with a view to  promoting internal collaboration, favouring knowledge  of Indra's capabilities and generating new ideas. In  short, coming together to innovate.    The platform is structured into communities and  groups defined by subject matter, which are managed  and kept active by community managers. Community  managers are renowned company experts on the  topics addressed by the community or group. Their role  is vital to the success of the initiative since they are  responsible for promoting participation and  collaboration, ensuring compliance with rules and  regulations and coming up with new initiatives and  suggestions on how to improve the platform.    The Indra management team transformation  programme receives the Cegos human resources  best practices award     The human resources best practices awards given by  Cegos in collaboration with Equipos&Talento recognise  organisations for creating innovations in management,  implementing best practices, adding value to their  activities and setting themselves apart in the market.      Indra was also recognised in the training and  development category for the management team  transformation programme held during the first half of  2010 in which 350 managers participated.       The aim of the transformation programme is to help  the management team acquire the skills and  competencies needed to be successful in their various  areas of work: the team, clients and projects.       To this end, an innovative methodology was  developed, which has fostered the exchange of  internal knowledge, a true application of all the topics  covered in the programme and the creation of  synergies across the various business units.       The main driving force behind the programme was the  practical work involved, which was based on actual  cases and made it possible for participants to identify  the keys to success when managing the different  variables of a project and the management styles used  at the company, by drawing on experience and group  discussion.       One of the most important keys to success was the  participation of the senior management team, which  served as speakers and leaders of the different  working groups. They made company cases available  for analysis and worked with participants during the  course of the programme as mentors.       One of the programmes most innovative aspects was  the use of a virtual community, which offers  participants a venue where they can discuss and  exchange opinions, knowledge, etc.       The panel stressed the idea of using transformation to  achieve goals and share best practices that will lead to  progress and go beyond the training received to  prompt change in the workplace.       Improved internal communications    Indra has different instruments available to monitor  how its professionals perceive the company. These  instruments gather information both from internal  studies conducted by the company itself and from  external sources. The various methodologies used   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   72  (focus groups, surveys, interviews, discussion groups  and benchmarkings) essentially have two objectives: to  get an accurate idea about how satisfied the  professionals are and to detect main areas of  improvement.     Specifically, these instruments include: culture and  internal communications watches, discussion groups on  different topics, interviews with the management  team, surveys on the quality of the career  management process and its communications, the  conclusions of management development workshops,  transformation programme discussion groups, etc.     In 2010, Indra designed and developed a new  "Professional Relationship Management" (PRM) portal  to consult its employees and foster the participation.  Its objective is to continue to increase the company's  knowledge of how it is perceived by its professionals  and further the involvement of its professionals in the  company's human resource decisions. This initiative  will be put into place over the course of 2011.    DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT    Indra has a long history in the management of its  workforce's diversity. Since 2004, the company has  launched numerous initiatives aimed at promoting  equal opportunities for all regardless of race, sex,  language, religion, creed, origin, financial standing,  birth or any other characteristic; respecting the  uniqueness of each individual and different cultures;  meeting the individual needs of the personnel who  work at Indra; and promoting these values throughout  the company. These initiatives include, for example, a  diversity policy, the work-life balance programme, the  equality plan, the company's certification as a family- responsible company, and the creation of a diversity  scorecard, etc.    In 2011, Indra expects to launch new initiatives to try  to further increase the diversity of its workforce. One  of these initiatives is for the company to continue to  perform specific actions aimed at hiring individuals  with disabilities (so far a protocol for hiring individuals  with disabilities has been put into place, as well as  scholarships for the disabled, etc.). One such action will  be to launch a company-wide awareness campaign on  disabilities.    The scoreboard attached to this annual report contains  a large number of indicators on diversity that show the  company's performance in this area.    Responsible mobility among our professionals    In 2010, Indra continued to foster responsible mobility  among its employees, fundamentally  through two  initiatives: my desktop and the videoconference  service. Both measures are technological tools. They  contribute to the greater efficiency and productivity of  the company and allow our professionals to achieve a  better work-life balance.     My desktop is a service that allows Indra employees  to connect remotely – from any computer, anywhere –  to net resources and the corporate systems. In this  way, my desktop provides the company's employees  with total flexibility to work where and when they  want. In 2010, there were more than 6,000 Indra  employees registered to use this service, which  complements the companys Teleworking Programme.    The company also made a special effort during 2010 to  promote videoconferencing. Indra increased its  videoconferencing equipment by 34%, which allowed  the use of this service to quadruplicate compared to  2009. Specifically, in 2010, more than 22,200  videoconferences took place. This allowed global  communication for the company and minimized  travelling, with the consequent cost savings, time  savings and savings in CO2 emissions from transport.     The result of the two initiatives was conclusive: the  harmonizing of professional and personal life, and more  efficient, rational and responsible business  management.    LABOUR RELATIONS    Union and legal representation of workers in Spain is  structured around the trade unions and employee  committees. Indra's employees in Spain are legally  represented by more than 350 individuals from  different trade unions.     Indra provides unions with information related to  the situation and performance of the company, as  well as significant aspects or initiatives at the  company. This year, workers were legally   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   73  represented in the working conditions negotiation  of industry agreements applicable at Indra  Sistemas.    At meetings at which workers were notified of and  participated in company processes that affect or  are binding on employees.    There is a difference of opinion between the trade  union representation of CC.OO (COMFIA)   in the IT area, already pointed out in the 2008 Annual  Report, with regard to the model of representation (by  workplace or company) and regarding the  system of  accumulation and use of trade union time, no  agreement having been reached in these areas.      WORKPLACE RISK PREVENTION    Indra is committed to complying with workplace risk  prevention regulations in all countries where it  operates, not only because this is a legal requirement,  but because it aims to foster a culture of risk  prevention in all its activities.    Furthermore, it has undertaken a commitment to its  employees to seek the utmost standards of health,  safety and well-being, and to strive to ensure that in  all activities all persons working for us and all those  potentially affected by our actions are adequately  protected.     To achieve this goal, Indra have set up a risk  prevention organisation that comprehensively meets  all the demands of compliance with legal obligations in  health and safety in an integrated manner.    Indras approach to risk prevention is based on a  process of continuous improvement through the  identification of dangers and the assessment of risks,  and verifying the efficiency of the preventive  measures in place. Its position is clearly to incorporate  health and safety into every aspect of the company, to  which end:     It identifies and evaluates the workplace risks  arising from the activities it performs through  annual action programmes;    It plans preventive actions based on technical  studies;     It verifies compliance with the preventive  measures adopted and their effectiveness;    It offers to monitor and ensures it monitors the  health of workers in relation to any workplace  risks to which they are exposed;    It sets up emergency and urgent health measures  at workplaces;    It establishes the means and channels for  coordinating company activities between its  clients and suppliers in the area of health and  safety;    It investigates occupational accidents to verify  and, if applicable, identify and evaluate risks and  adopt preventive measures;    It analyses workplace and group health  epidemiological studies so that, if applicable, risks  can be identified and evaluated and preventive  measures taken; and    It periodically audits the risk prevention  management system.    Indra continues to work on extending its workplace risk  prevention policy to other countries   With a view to putting the effectiveness of the  workplace risk prevention management system to the  test and detecting areas of improvement, a statutory  audit was conducted in December at the following  companies:    Europraxis Atlante    Indra BMB    Indra BMB Canarias    Indra BMB Servicios Digitales    Indra Emac    Indra Espacio    Indra Sistemas    Indra Sistemas de Seguridad    Indra Software Labs    I3 Televisin    IP Sistemas    Tourism & Leisure    In recognition of compliance with regulations and the  effectiveness of the system, the "Audited Company  Certificate" was renewed for each company at the end  of the audit process and in the absence of any major  infringements.    In addition, a major milestone reached this year was  having our workplaces in Colombia certified under the  OHSAS 18001 occupational health and safety standard     ANNUAL REPORT 2010   74  Enquiries and company involvement    Indra "considers and recognises" the importance of the  active and collaborative involvement of the company  using health and safety representatives since it helps  give matters related to workplace health and safety  the level of attention that all of us at Indra want them  to have.    The company has set up health and safety committees  at its workplaces with more than 50 workers. These  committees are joint, decision-making, participatory  bodies set up for regular and periodic enquiries about  activities in the area of health and safety. Periodic  meetings are held and the topics discussed are  recorded in the meeting minutes.    HUMANS  RIGHTS AT INDRA    Indra actively manages the various aspects of work- related human rights that affect its operations and the  relationship it has with its employees.      Child labour and forced labour: Despite the fact  that, due to the nature of its operations, which  require highly skilled professionals, Indra has a low  risk of being party to a situation involving child  labour or forced labour as a signatory of the Global  Compact, it openly states its opposition to any  form of these exploitative situations. Still, Indra  takes measures to ensure this is indeed the case: it  verifies the age of each worker at the time of hire,  keeps information systems up-to-date with the  particulars of each employee and monitors the  work days of each employee, etc. For illustrative  purposes, this annual report contains a diagram  showing the age pyramid of Indra's professionals.    In addition, Indra holds its suppliers to this  commitment under the Framework Principles for  Relations with Suppliers and the forthcoming  Supplier Code of Ethics       Freedom of association and collective bargaining:  As part of its commitments under the Global, Indra  respects the right of its workers to join trade  unions and to bargain collectively. In addition,  Indra's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct  establishes equal opportunities, respect for others  and freedom from all forms of discrimination,  specifically due to union membership, as basic  principles of conduct at the company.    The "Labour Relations" section of the "Employees"  chapter of this annual report describes the model  used for relations with trade unions in Spain.    The working conditions for Indra's professionals  are based on existing industry-based or collective  bargaining agreements in the respective countries  where we have significant operations. As such, in  2010, 93% of Indra's staff was protected under a  collective bargaining agreement.     Indra is present in countries where freedom of  association is limited or persecuted. Nevertheless,  our actions in these countries are governed by the  same general principles of respect for the right to  join trade unions and to bargain collectively.      Equality and freedom from discrimination: in  addition to our accession to the Global Compact,  Indra has put into practice various policies and  initiatives to ensure equality among its  professionals and freedom from discrimination. The  Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct states  Indra's respect for diversity, people and a  discrimination-free environment and  fosters these  principles among its professionals. This code is  supported by other policies, such as the Equality  Plan, the Diversity Policy, the Unacceptable  Behaviour Protocol, etc.       Promotion and job security: Indra represents a  source of job creation in the communities where it  operates and its commitment to creating and  keeping positions is demonstrated by the constant  growth of its workforce over the past few years. In  the 2006-2010 period, for example, Indra's  workforce has grown at a (compound) annual rate  of 30%.       Occupational health and safety of Indra's  professionals, as well as those who work for us.    In addition, under the "Workplace risk prevention"  section of the "Employees" chapter of this annual  report, a full description of Indra's activities in the   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   75  area of occupational health and safety in 2010 is  provided.       Salaries, benefits and working hours: Since 2005,  we have had equality and work-life balance  policies in place, which take on different forms in  each of the countries where we operate.     The "Employees" chapter of this annual report  contains information on the activities of the  equality and work-life balance programmes in  2010.      Training: Talent development is a fundamental  element of a company like ours, which is staffed by  knowledge professionals . As such, in this context,  we attach great importance to the training of our  professionals, as demonstrated by the fact that  the training hours received by our professionals  increased at a (compound) annual rate of 33%  between 2006 and 2010.     The chapter "Employees" of this annual report  contains information and indicators on Indra's  performance in this area in 2010.

CUSTOMERS    Main policies and initiatives    The Strategic Quality Plan 2008-2012: details  the main lines of action for 2009-2012 based  around three priorities: corporate quality,  operational quality and CE Marking.    Indra Project Management Methodology  (MIGP): Indra has proprietary project  management methodology to guarantee  project predictability, quality and productivity.

More information at   http://www.indracompany.com/en/sostenibilidad-e- innovacion/clients    ANNUAL REPORT 2010   79  GLOBAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT   In 2010, Indra has continued to further the  effective integration of quality management across  the organisation, through specific initiatives based  around two key elements:     Extending corporate quality management  system in new countries where we have  significant operations: In addition to the  renewal of Indras Quality System  Certifications (ISO 9001, PECAL 2110 and  EN9100), during the course of 2010, our  company Indra Radar Technology has obtained  ISO9001:2008 accreditation. Furthermore,  activities are now underway for the  implementation of the Quality Management  System in centres in China, Argentina, Chile  and the Czech Republic.     Ensuring commitment to quality management  from all professionals working for Indra: For  this purpose separate initiatives relating to  document management, training and  communication have been launched.    Document management, training and  communication     In 2009, Indra developed a document manager  which was successfully introduced in 2010,  allowing for the electronic management of Indras  quality regulations (manuals, procedures and  instructions) and for documents to be signed  electronically. Indra is currently extending this tool  to other countries with significant operations.Spain  In 2010, Indra also strengthened technical training  for its Quality Engineers and corporate technical  staff with specialized technical courses and specific  monographic courses on environmental issues and  EC marking.     Finally, within the sphere of communication, the  content relating to quality and the environment on  the corporate intranet has been improved, with  Quality Bulletins being distributed to Indra quality  and operational staff, with key indicators for  improving management.    200 professionals certified as PMPs     In 2010 Indra launched five courses providing PMP  certification to 150 professionals within the  company who hold direct responsibility for projects.  This has enabled us to reach the target of 200  accredited staff by the beginning of 2011. This  strength of training forms part of an ambitious plan  which aims to have 500 certified staff in 2012.    PMP certification is one of the most internationally  recognised professional accreditations, which  provides those holding the certification with public  recognition of their competency in the area of  project management.   CUSTOMER SATISFACTION    Customer satisfaction is a management area that is  focusing major efforts and is manifestly  demonstrated by the following tools:    An annual external corporate survey of a  significant sample of our customer portfolio,  by sales volumes, to compile information about  customers perception of the quality of the  services rendered.    A systematic, in-house survey polling the  project managers upon project completion.    The creation of quarterly and annual  monitoring and results analysis reports     The ongoing improvement of processes  directly relating to customers.      ANNUAL REPORT 2010   80  Annual Corporate Survey    In 2010, work has been carried out to increase the  sample size for the customer satisfaction survey,  and, specifically through the launch of the survey in  some of the countries where our presence is more  significant. As a result, the new edition of the  survey has been extended to  Chile and Argentina.    Graph: Customer satisfaction 2006 – 2010. 1-5 scale.       Again, as in previous years, the main areas of  improvement detected relate to compliance with  project deadlines, the efficiency of administrative  processes and Indra methodology, although  always with assessments above 3.0 points    Since 2008, Indra has introduced significant  improvements to project management methodology  specifically designed to improve performance in  these areas.      ENSURING PROJECT QUALITY    The design of the Indra Project Management  Methodology as well as the Indra corporate  systems, since its creation in the 1990s, have  contributed to and supported methodological  excellence and compliance with deadlines, using  the basis defined by the standards for earned value  management (Practice Standard for Earned Value  Management, PMI Project Management Institute),  allowing for periodic monitoring of the progress of  projects. Through evaluating the compliance  indicators for cost and schedule, applying this  standard allows knowledge to be gained on the  status and general health of the project with a high  degree of precision, from 20% completion onwards,  and to anticipate possible problems during the  course of the project.    However, in 2008, given the areas of improvement  identified in the customer satisfaction survey, and  in response to the performance of the markets and  the needs of clients, a methodology update was  implemented (MIGP 2.0), with the first  modifications to the corporate project management  systems being carried out to provide wider  coverage to operational risk management process,  as well as project milestones, scope and issues.  Correct application of these processes facilitates  early detection of any deviations from plans, and, in  turn, facilitates the implementation of any action  plans designed to return the project to the desired  situation. At the same time, significant training was  undertaken to disseminate these processes and  management practices to the team in charge of  projects, resulting in the training of around 1.800  people in these processes.     In 2010, a standardisation process was launched  for the use of milestone management, adapted to  the different operational management teams to  ensure that the process provides better monitoring  of project deadlines. This improvement in  monitoring of milestones will facilitate the  implementation of preventative or corrective action  for situations which could negatively impact on  compliance with Project objectives.    Project Audits    To complement the quality assurance mechanisms  established by MIGP, Indra carries out annual  internal audits of its projects to verify that the  corporate quality criteria are complied with and to  detect possible areas for improvement. In 2010,  147 internal audits were carried out, of which 136  of them were internal and the other 11 to specific  processes of subcontractors.      3,60 3,81 3,65 3,78 3,71 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010  ANNUAL REPORT 2010   81  Full mature software development  methodology     During 2010, the Indra Method for Development,  Adaptation and Services (MIDAS) has been  improved by two key contributions:     Some customers have proactively made  contributions to improving MIDAS, with the aim  of eliminating possible barriers in ways of  working from both organisations, to facilitate  effective communication between both  methods and to generate positive synergies.     In addition, our experience in Air Traffic  Management (ATM) has allowed us to  incorporate new best practice libraries into our  Indra Method for Development, Adaptation and  Services (MIDAS), developed under CMMi3  maturity levels and fully adopting high- maturity practices. These new libraries  represent a significant contribution to the  competitive and innovative know-how of  Indra. Likewise, we also envisage incorporating  those successes into MIDAS dynamic practices.     Furthermore, with the aim of disseminating  development best practices internally and further  standardising ways of working, in 2010 training on  the Indra Method for Development, Adaptation and  Services (MIDAS) was included as part of Indra core  training (mandatory training). The MIDAS training  plan includes different training itineraries with  specific methodology content for each role, and is  based on the most cutting-edge methodology, both  with in-class and on-line support. The project was  launched in 2010 and will continue to be developed  over the coming years.     INTEGRATING SUPPLIERS INTO QUALITY  MANAGEMENT    At Indra we are aware that achieving the levels of  excellence required by our customers inevitably  requires involving all agents in the supply chain for  our solutions and services. For this reason, Indra  includes a quality evaluation in its approval process  for all subcontractors, and carries out annual  internal audits for non-standard processes. During  2010 this has resulted in the re-evaluation of 76  subcontractors and the approval of 69 new  subcontractors, as well as 11 audits on non- standard subcontractor processes.     INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT AT  INDRA    In 2010, the action plan for the Information  Security Management System (SGSI) included some  new aspects, most notably:    Widening the Network monitoring platform to  countries with significant operations.     Implementing Access restriction to the  Network (NAC), an important proactive  measure allowing for assessment of the  security of the platforms before granting  access. This avoids any risks in advance.    Integration of critical security alerts detected  in the monitoring consoles within the incident  management process, which speeds up  resolution and management.    Creation of the Data Protection Office for  Projects    Special mention must be made of the achievement  of the Management of IT services in relation to  regulation UNE-ISO/IEC 20 000 certification. During  the certification process, no non-compliance was  found. In addition to the benefits of the regulation  itself, resulting in the implementation of 13  processes for governing IT services, the  certification adds value insofar as it complements  our vision for the development of Indras  Information Security Policy.     Indras Security Policy is available to all Indra  professionals through the intranet.    Launching of the Data Protection Projects  Office     Indra has established this new internal service to  ensure compliance with Spains Data Protection Act   for projects that are developed in Spain, and as  such, reduce the operational risks to the company.     This service contains two main areas of activities:     Data protection advisory services  Resolution  of queries and enquiries relating to data  protection and development regulation, as   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   82  applicable to projects dealing with personal  data on behalf of customers.      Audits on data protection risks: Audits of  projects based on the risk of non-compliance  with the regulation, as well as the financial  impact and the impact on security and image.     Spanish data protection legislation is one of the  most rigorous in the world.    MANAGING THE RISK OF CORRUPTION AT INDRA    Indra operates in 114 countries across the world,  which means that we operate in countries with  very different levels of transparency.     During the course of 2010, more than three- quarters of our sales came from countries with a  high degree of transparency (6 out of 10 or above,  according to the Transparency International Index),  while the remaining sales were generated in  countries where a relative risk of corruption exists.       Chart: Distribution of Indra sales by degree of transparency of  the countries where the sales were made   Source: Transparency International, Corruption Perception Index  2010,  http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/c pi/2010/results  Compiled by author.     Furthermore, Indra believes its business operations  should be law-abiding and comply with free market  and fair competition principles, while being  conducted in an ethical and transparent fashion.    Indra extends this commitment to all its  professionals through its Code of Ethics and  Professional Conduct, which expressly prohibits,  under article 3, participating in any acts of bribery  when dealing with authorities and/or government  employees or to offer or grant to senior  management, employees or external collaborators  benefits or advantages of any nature that are  outside the realm of lawful market practice or  which could be construed as being aimed at  inappropriately influencing the normal progress of  the business, administrative or professional  relationships that Indra takes part in    With the aim of involving all professionals in the  fight against corruption, Indra carries out training  activities on a yearly basis, and has made a Direct  Channel available to professionals as a tool for  communicating any queries arising during the  course of their business activities.    In addition, Indra maintains a policy of total  transparency in relation to incidents of corruption  communicated through the Direct Channel. As  indicated in the chapter Our focus on  sustainability, in the section on the  implementation of the Code of Ethics and  Professional Conduct, in 2010 Indra received only  20,4% 76,8% 0,3% 1,7% 0,7% 8 - 10 6 - 7,9 4 - 5,9 2 - 3,9 0 - 1,9 and N.A.

In addition, Indra has an Internal Audit service  which reports to the Audit and Compliance  Committee, represented on the Board of Directors,  which carries out reviews of the different  processes/units within the company to determine if  the controls established to mitigate any inherent  risks from the company are sufficient and are  operating effectively. During 2010, Internal Audit  reviewed and evaluated 32 units/processes in the  company, both operational and corporate.

SUPPLIERS    Suppliers  Subcontractors Main policies and initiatives      Standardisation of suppliers: Indra has a  procedure for assessing suppliers on their  economic, social and environmental  performance for pre-qualification purposes.    Supplier evaluation: Indra assesses the  performance of a sample of suppliers on an  annual basis.    Suppliers guiding principles: establish the  desired framework relationship between Indra  and its suppliers.     Suppliers satisfaction surveys: Indicator of  suppliers satisfaction with their relationships  with Indra.     Suppliers code of ethics: Indra's basic ethics  principles shall be extended to the entire value  chain from 2011 onwards.    For more information:   http://www.indracompany.com/sostenibilidad-e- innovacion/125-alianzas-tecnol%C3%B3gicas   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   86  Roll out of new ERP to improve relations with  suppliers    Throughout 2010, Indra continued to roll out its  new corporate ERP at all group businesses. In  addition to the direct benefits this initiative may  have in terms of efficiency, improvements to IT  systems or reducing the time spent on  administrative processes, the application is also  expected to improve communication and  transparency with suppliers through the creation of  the new Purchasing Portal.     Better logistics to improve efficiency and  reduce the environmental impact    In 2010, Indra carried out a pilot test to improve its  logistics processes in the US. The project involved  consolidating the origin of deliveries by setting up  regional logistics centres to minimise air freight and  optimise long haul and transcontinental flights.  Consolidation at origin will involve using the  railways as a priority means of transport, which has  environmental benefits in addition to the positive  impact on costs. This replaces the previous practice  of: direct delivery from the place of origin using  long-haul flights. The result is the rationalisation of  the use of air freight as a means of transport.    In 2011, this initiative is expected to be expanded  to other regions.    Suppliers Code of Ethics    At the end of 2010, Indra finished drafting a  Suppliers Code of Ethics. Suppliers will be requested  to adhere to this code in 2011. The Suppliers Code  of Ethics will be included in suppliers' contracts  from 2011 and suppliers already holding a valid  agreement with Indra shall be asked to accept it.     The new code is predicated on the company's  previous internal Code of Ethics and Professional  Conduct and establishes a series of basic  commitments in relation to professionalism,  integrity and respect towards customers, including  the non-profit organisations that Indra collaborates  with.     The Suppliers Code of Ethics also stipulates the use  of the same Direct Channel currently available to  Indra employees, therefore establishing a single  channel for receiving all communications and  incidences.     The Suppliers Code of Ethics seeks to complete  initiatives already underway at Indra, extending to  the entire value chain the company's commitment  to Corporate Responsibility, summarised in the  Supplier Guiding Principles.     Promoting the integration of disabled people  through our suppliers    In 2010, Indra designed a framework regulation to  encourage the hiring of employees through  specialist employment centres, with the twofold  objective of improving company productivity and  contributing to the social integration of disabled  people.     To do this, Indra analysed the problems relating to  contracting staff from specialised employment  centres and defined solutions aimed at preventing  or mitigating these problems. These solutions are  included in the Framework Agreement drawn up for  specialised employment centres which will be fully  operational in 2011.     This initiative is in addition to other projects to  integrate disabled people carried out by Indra's HR  department.

PARTNERS    Strategic  Tactical and transactional  Local Main policies and initiatives      Alliance management: Indra has a system for  managing its alliances.    Partner satisfaction surveys: Indicator of  suppliers satisfaction with their relationships  with Indra.    More information at   http://www.indracompany.com/en/sostenibilidad-e- innovacion/suppliers-and-partners          ANNUAL REPORT 2010   89  Following a review and assessment conducted in  2010 in conjunction with the Corporate Alliances  Department, Indra resolved to separate the report  on its performance vis--vis technology partners  from the chapter on suppliers, since we believe that  this report structure better addresses the unique  characteristics of each audience (suppliers and  partners) and better reflects the differences in our  internal management approaches to each group.    Indras technology partners are an essential part of  the company's business, as they act as strategic  knowledge partners, enhance our range of products  and services and sales capabilities, and, oftentimes,  assist in strengthening our presence in certain  locations.     Innovation development with partners is based on  an Open Innovation model which establishes a  maximum level of cooperation with the partner  throughout all stages of the process: from initiative  selection and proposal, pilot development and  concept testing, solution generation, to final joint  sales activity.     Improving internal management    Indras partner ecosystem currently takes the form  of formalised relationships with 146 companies of  all kinds in terms of size, specialisation and location,  etc.          Chart: Number of partnerships in place  Indra Sistemas  Chart: Breakdown of suppliers by type of alliance (%)    This ecosystem is dynamic and undergoes constant  and rapid industry merger and acquisition activity  at both the domestic and international levels.    Consequently, it is paramount that we implement  an active surveillance process that will keep us  ahead of the curve on potential movements in the  ecosystem, by segmenting and concentrating  strategic relationships around partners that offer  the most compelling story on two key elements of  relationship development: globalisation and  innovation capacity.       In 2010 Indra improved its internal management of  alliances.  To this end, it created new tools to better  gauge the quality of relationships, identify areas of  improvement, design initiatives and monitor the  progress of said initiatives.  Specifically, Indra  launched a new in-house website for alliance  management worldwide, along with a management  scorecard with a series of indicators for monitoring  partner relationships.      Furthermore, these tools were complemented by an  enhanced in-house communication regime, geared  towards engaging the entire corporation in alliance  management.  The company published several  news items on its intranet site in 2010 announcing  new contracts, expansion of the scope of  agreements, etc.     Finally, Indra placed particular emphasis on the  most strategic partners in the iGAN (Indra Global  Alliances Network) segment, which consists of  agreements with Indra's most important tech  partners in terms of innovation capacity and  globalisation.     Local  42,9% Internac.  23,8% Global  33,3% 51 110 125 126 146 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010  ANNUAL REPORT 2010   90    Tech partners, key allies for innovation    In 2010 Indra significantly increased the number of  projects it undertook jointly with tech partners.  These projects perfectly illustrate that two  corporations, heavily based on innovation and  talent, are capable of generating highly complex  technological solutions and services to address  even the most difficult-to-overcome challenges.     This was the case, for instance, with a contract  secured to modernise and expand a  communications integration and management  system for Spains Military Emergency Unit (UME),  undertaken in conjunction with our partners  Telefnica and Cisco.       Improving communication with our partners    A company like Indra, which is engaged in multiple,  varied and complex activities with a wide array of  partners, must have the best possible in-house and  external communication tools in order to maintain  relationships with the companys varied target  audiences and raise awareness of its goals and  achievements.     In this regard, initiatives such as a satisfaction  survey, global and multilingual alliances website, an  active internal and external communication policy  and a monitoring and management system  implemented in the past year represent substantial  progress in our important efforts to leverage and  highlight relationships.     In order to strengthen our relationships with  technology allies, in 2010 we enhanced our  communication efforts, specifically by distributing  Indra's e-magazine, Actual.  More than 400 partner  contacts now receive this publication.      PARTNER SATISFACTION    In the second edition of the Partners survey, there  was a slight improvement in the satisfaction index,  from 3.4 to 3.5, while some of the areas that  showed some progress last year underwent further  improvement: the return on investment perceived  by the partner and the suitability of the number of  resources contributed by Indra, with scores of over  3.1.    In addition, the Partners highlighted positively the  qualifications and quality of Indra employees, as  well as their level of knowledge about key ICT  technologies, with both attributes scoring above  4.0 points.    The results of the survey will be included in Indras  Corporate Social Responsibility Master Plan for  2012 in order to design initiatives that will improve  relations with our Partners.

Employee awareness: training initiatives to  increase environmental awareness among our  professionals.    More information at  http://www.indracompany.com/en/sostenibilidad-e- innovacion/reduce-our-impact-3%25-a-year    ANNUAL REPORT 2010   93  Indra is aware that certain natural resources are  being depleted and deteriorated by human activity  and understands that reducing its own  environmental footprint is part of its responsibility  as a company and key to its sustainability, in  addition to helping to better the environment  through its range of solutions and services.      Specifically, Indra considers that its largest  environmental impact derives from the power  consumption of the IT equipment used to develop  its solutions and services, which in turn generates  the most indirect CO2 and greenhouse gas  emissions. Even though this is the most significant  impact, there are other negative environmental  impacts, such as the use of paper (with high indirect  CO2 emissions), water consumption and waste  generation.    Over the last few years, we have worked to reduce  the consumption of power and natural resources  and reduce waste, while at the same time working  to create IT systems that allow us to better  understand our environmental impact and help us  to become more transparent.     ENVIRONMENTAL STEERING COMMITTEE    We have set up an Environmental Steering  Committee comprising the General Services,  Corporate Responsibility and Quality and  Environment Departments, entrusted with drawing  up Corporate Responsibility and Environmental  Master Plans, contributing ideas as to the  strategies to undertake and studying ways of  improving our Environmental Management System.    WORKPLACE CERTIFICATION    The Indra Environmental Management System was  rolled out in 2010 with five new workplaces being  awarded ISO14001 accreditation: two in Spain  (Cerro de la Plata in Madrid and Seville) and three in  Colombia (Calle 57 and Carrera 65, both in Bogot,  and another in Barranquilla).     A single audit was carried out in Colombia  to certify  the company's Quality Management, Environment  and Occupational Health and Safety systems (ISO  9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001).    Indra now boasts 18 ISO 14001 certified  workplaces, i.e. 52.1% of the company's employees  (compared to 49.4% in 2009). For the full list of  certified workplaces, go to  http://www.indracompany.com/en/sostenibilidad-e- innovacion/reduce-our-impact-3%25-a-year      In 2010, Indra was also awarded FSC Chain of  Custody accreditation for its three workplaces in  Colombia. This certification covers paper  management and assesses the forestry supply  chain, starting with the trees and finishing with the  end product, through all stages of processing,  transformation, manufacturing and distribution, to  verify that the wood does not come from  undesirable sources.    ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING AND AWARENESS  CAMPAIGNS    In addition to the training courses for  environmental management employees involved in  the workplace certification processes, in 2010  Indra's Quality Engineers were offered courses on  the requirements of our Environmental  Management System and on how to manage the  requisite environmental obligations in customer  contracts (Environmental Impact Plans).    In addition to these training sessions, all employees  were offered specific awareness campaigns on the  purchase and use of recycled paper and on how to  reduce electricity and water consumption. Also, in  2010 the company began a series of awareness  campaigns which will run throughout 2011 on  managing hazardous and non-hazardous waste, as  well as on reducing electricity consumption at  workplaces in Spain.     ANNUAL REPORT 2010   94  Accin CO2 project    Indra actively participates in the Fundacin  Entorno-BCSD Espaa energy and climate change  group, with particular emphasis on the Accin CO2  project.     The Accin CO2 project was set up in 2008 as a  voluntary commitment by companies to reduce CO2  emissions.  Members attend benchmarking sessions  to share best practices and training programmes  aimed at encouraging actions by their employees.  Among its training schemes, in 2010 the Fundacin  Entorno devised a personal calculator for  employees to estimate the money they could save  by applying some of the recommended energy  efficiency measures, thereby encouraging them to  commit to these measures.    Indra signed up to the Accin CO2 project in 2010  and as the first initiative of awareness, distributed  the personal calculator to all its employees.     At year end 2010, a total of 620 employees had  used the calculator, resulting in a commitment to  reduce CO2 emission by 422 tonnes, equivalent to a  saving of 84,000. This makes us the Fundacin  Entorno member with the largest commitment.    In 2011, Indra also plans to distribute to employees  the new online tutorials designed by the Fundacin  Entorno.  ENVIRONMENTALLY-RESPONSIBLE SOLUTIONS  AND SERVICES     Throughout 2010, Indra continued implementing  the measures required under European regulation  concerning chemical and hazardous substances  (REACH), begun in 2009.  The following actions  were taken:     The chemical substances used by Indra were  catalogued.    A preliminary calculation was drawn up of all  chemical products acquired within and outside  the European Union in 2009   In compliance with Royal Decree 208/2005 on  electrical and electronic equipment and  management of its waste, Indra reports to the  Ministry of Industry on the numbers placed on the  market on a quarterly basis.     Also, in compliance with Act 11/1997, Indra  prepares an annual statement on packaging and  packaging waste. This register is used to create a  database to determine the amount of packaging  and packaging waste by geographical area, volume,  characteristics and packaging and waste flows.    ONGOING SUPPORT FOR REFORESTATION IN  THE  PHILIPPINES    Following its launch in 2009, this year Indra and its  employees once again participated in the Adopt a  Tree project in the . The project aims to raise  awareness among paper companies of the essential  role of forests in maintaining the biodiversity and  health of river basins.Philippines    Since its launch, Indra employees have "adopted"  over 400 trees.      In the last 50 years, 66% of forest surface area in  the  has been destroyed, making it one of the  regions with the fastest pace of deforestation on  Earth. Philippines    Reducing "information pollution"    In November 2008, Indra rolled out a new initiative  aimed at improving communication and cooperative  work among employees: its instant messaging  system.     This service allows users to send messages in real  time and hold conversations with two or more  colleagues.     In addition to the obvious advantages of  encouraging communication, collaboration and  teleworking practices, the environmental impact of  this initiative is very favourable.  The combination  of instant messaging and emails reduces the need  for data storage infrastructure or "digital pollution".  It can also help reduce the amount of paper used by  limiting the need to print out emails.      ANNUAL REPORT 2010   95  Use of this service rose sharply in 2010, further  helping reduce the associated environmental  impacts.     Chart: Number of instant messaging conversations (data in  millons).    SUPPLIERS' REQUIREMENTS    In total, 430 Indra subcontractors were assessed on  practices involving waste, emissions and spills. Of  the 430 companies assessed, 110 passed in 2010  and 66 in previous years, while 50 companies are  still pending of valuation. The remaining 204 were  not assessed given the scant environmental impact  of their work.     Also, based on the waste, spills and emissions  management assessment, we have seen that 75%  of our subcontractors adequately comply with  environmental legal requirements.  We are still  waiting to receive and analyse certain  documentation to conclude our assessment of  some subcontractors.  4,69 10,30 2009 2010 x2,2  ANNUAL REPORT 2010   96  GASTOS E INVERSIONES MEDIOAMBIENTALES    2006  2007  2008  2009  2010    Bringing  environmental  conditions at  workplaces into line  with updated  legislation    Implementing the  Environmental  Management  System in Aranjuez  (in process) and  conducting internal  audit of the  Tringulo building    ISO 14001  certification of the  Tringulo building    Measurement of  noise levels at the  Tringulo building    Waste minimisation  study in the DASS  clean room    Floor study at San  Fernando, Torrejn  and Aranjuez    Bringing  environmental  conditions at  workplaces into  line with updated  legislation    Implementation  and certification of  Environmental  Management  System in Aranjuez  and Barcelona    Internal audit at  workplaces    Measurement of  noise levels at  Aranjuez    Waste  minimisation study  at Aranjuez    Lighting at  Aranjuez.

Our aim is to cut direct and indirect CO2 emissions  by 3% a year in 2010 and 2011 compared to 2009.    To achieve this we have designed a programme  with four priority action areas:     Air conditioning and heating affect  emissions generated by gasoil and natural  gas boilers and electricity consumption.    Lighting, largely affects electricity  consumption.    Efficient use of computer equipment  largely affects electricity consumption.     Mobility refers to emissions generated by  our employees in their day-to-day travels.     The emissions generated by business trips are not  included in this objective.  However, given the scale  of these emissions, we shall include this category in  our awareness campaign aimed at cutting  emissions by 3% a year in 2010 and 2011.

Universities, research centres and other  knowledge institutions are strategic partners in our  business activities, as they are the source of highly  skilled professionals and act as crucial peers in the  development of innovation and R&D projects.     Indeed, the university is the main source of knowledge  upon which Indras Open Innovation regime is based,  and we therefore support the university system,  which generates a competitive economy.     Indra's strategy thus consists of forming solid,  permanent and mutually beneficial cooperative  relationships with these institutions.  These  partnerships will often be formalised through  framework agreements and academic chairs.    Types of cooperation between universities and  Indra      Recruitment of talented people (recruitment  plans, awards, scholarships, job search forums).    Training and dissemination of knowledge  (participation in courses and masters degrees,  seminars, visits to Indra, institutional participation  in conferences, etc.)    R&D&I activities (direct recruitment, Avanza, Cenit  and other projects).    Strategic activities (access to new markets,  strategic alliances).    AGREEMENTS AND ACADEMIC CHAIRS    Academic chairs exemplify this spirit of long-term  collaboration between universities and Indra.  These  chairs' activities involve a range of fields related to  Indra's areas of strategic interest.     The new Indra Outsourcing Chair at the  European University of Madrid    In 2010, Indra and the European University of Madrid  established the Indra-Outsourcing Chair to encourage  work and research in the field of information and  communication technologies solutions and services.     The project encompasses research, training,  technology transfer and teaching, among others, as  well as the launch of the first Outsourcing Observatory,  which will foster the writing, publication and  distribution of periodic research reports on outsourcing  services.  Additionally, an e-magazine on the  outsourcing world will also be founded to create a  communication venue for professionals and  researchers in this field.     This chair represents a natural evolution following  years of cooperation with the European University of  Madrid, particularly via its University Masters  programme in Comprehensive IT Management.      New Chairs in Accessible Technologies     Moreover, in 2010 Indra endowed three new academic  chairs in accessible technologies: two of them at  Spains University of Extremadura which will be  devoted to creating a task sequencing system to  facilitate the integration of people with cognitive  disabilities into the workplace; and the other at  Argentina's National University of Crdoba to develop  innovative projects and solutions to facilitate disabled  individuals access to technology and jobs. The latter  programme includes the launch of an Accessibility  Observatory, which will research the current Accessible  Technologies environment in Latin America and in  Argentina in particular.

Encouraging an entrepreneurial culture among  university students     For the second consecutive year, we underwrote the  Junior Achievement Foundations Graduate Programme  Awards honouring excellence in entrepreneurship.  These prizes are intended to foster an entrepreneurial  spirit and promote the education of entrepreneurs in  the university environment. Students draw up a  business plan, with an option to put it into practice at  the end of the programme.    AWARDS    Indra in 2010 received three awards praising its  commitment to technology transfer and cooperation  with universities.     Award for R&D cooperation from the University of  Valencias Social Committee (November 2010).     Award for research cooperation from the  Polytechnic University of Madrid (November  2010).

More information at  http://www.indracompany.com/en/sostenibilidad-e- innovacion/society    ANNUAL REPORT 2010   106  Under the concept of Society, we include all the  relationships we have with agencies in the social  sphere, from governments and public sector  organisations, to local communities, social networks  and non-profit making organisations.     Our relationships in this sphere are based on  transparency and a contribution to social  development through the promotion of knowledge  and innovation. We believe that technology is  efficient and useful for society and, so, we aim to  foster investigation and the development of  projects with a two-fold purpose:  to make  technology accessible to everybody and to make  use of it to narrow the so-called digital gap.     This gap is different in scope and significance in the  various markets where Indra operates. The aim is to  help narrow the gap, using our solutions and  services to promote accessibility and extend the  use and enjoyment of quality content to improve  education and people's quality of life.     INDRA AND ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGIES    Accessible technologies represent Indra's most  significant project in the sphere of social action, in  that they truly reflect our vision: the development  of technology to contribute to the improvement of  society and narrow the digital gap.    This vision is founded on the firm conviction and  belief that our best contribution to society is not  through monetary assistance but through providing  what we know best: technology.    Accessible technologies make up 44% of the  resources we allocate to social action and have a  great impact in both the community and the  company itself.      About accessible technologies    Accessibility and inclusion together comprise a  fundamental area in which information  technologies can offer substantial improvements  for people and social groups. Taking account of this  need, Indra has firmly established itself as a leader  in the development of accessible technologies to  assist in the social integration of people with  disabilities and make technology accessible to  them.    At Indra we have been pursuing a series of  collaborations with various universities and  knowledge institutions for several years as a means  to develop these technologies. Specifically, we  have launched the Professorships in Accessible  Technology to bring together the projects  undertaken in collaboration with the Fundacin  Adecco (the majority) and various universities to  develop solutions and innovative services in the  areas of accessibility and inclusion.     The main areas of work for the professorships are  aimed at facilitating the integration of people with  disabilities into work and society in general:    Independent living    Accessible education.    Accessible employment    At the moment we have five professorships in  various universities in Spain and Argentina: the  University of Lleida (Spain), the University of  Extremadura (Spain), the Madrid Polytechnic  University (Spain), the University of Castilla la  Mancha (Spain) and the National University of  Cordoba (Argentina).    HeadMouse, the virtual mouse    This virtual mouse is designed to allow people with  limited mobility to access information technologies.  It enables people to control the computer cursor  through head movements (for dragging") and face  movements (for "clicking"). Based on artificial vision  logarithms developed for the mobile robotics area,  it enables users to use the virtual mouse intuitively  and naturally.    In 2010 the new version of HeadMouse 3.0 was  launched, which enables the application to work  more quickly and is more accessible for a greater  range of users with severely limited head  movement. These improvements mean that, with  HeadMouse 3.0, lateral movements are no longer  necessary to start up the application.   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   107    In addition this new version incorporates a new  user detection mechanism, which enables other  people to be nearby without interfering with the  application and the tool's usability. As regards  conditions in the surroundings where it is used, the  new version makes it possible to function without  any problem in poorly-lit conditions. The new  system also extends its compatibility with most  types of web-cam, even with built-in cameras in  lap-top computers.    VirtualKeyboard, a keyboard for people with  limited mobility    Complementing the HeadMouse, VirtualKeyboard  enables people with limited motor skills to write  texts using a virtual keyboard which appears on the  computer screen and which can be used with the  HeadMouse, or with a conventional mouse, a  joystick or a touchpad, for example. It features five  dictionaries and is adaptable to the writing style of  each user, optimising word prediction in various  contexts.     VirtualKeyboard 2.0 was launched in 2010. The  new version offers greater functional  approximation to physical keyboards in terms of  shortcut keys, numeric keypad and it also has  improved capability in predicting the current and  following word being written. Tests carried out  writing literary texts and reports show that the  improvements implemented in the new version  achieve a 40% to 50% saving on keystrokes  compared with the previous version.     Furthermore, version 2.0 of the keyboard has an  important new feature making it possible to write  in different languages through compatibility with  the symbol and character sets of more than 20  languages. The keyboard has also been remodelled  and generally improved so that the majority of  regular options and functions may be used with a  single click. In doing so, new applications have been  introduced, such as the numeric keyboard, simple  ways of performing "cut" and "paste" actions, and  the direct button to erase a word in the dictionary,  very useful if you write a word you don't want to  save in the dictionary.    Both HeadMouse and VirtualKeyboard are  completely free solutions available publically at  www.tecnologiasaccesibles.com, as a result of  collaboration between Indra, the Fundacin Adecco  and various universities.     POSET task sequencing portal    The purpose of POSET is to develop a task  sequencing system for special employment centres  and occupational workshops which enables people  with learning difficulties such as autism, Asperger's  syndrome or Attention Deficit to work with a  greater degree of autonomy.    The Portal will make it possible to allocate these  persons a set task, with step-by-step explanations  on a monitor through a sequence of videos. The  solution will enable users to check what stage they  are at, how to complete the stage and carry on to  the next task, with a reduction in their dependence  on others.    This is the second project initiated by the  Professorship at the Universidad de Extremadura,  created in February 2010, and will run alongside  the earlier project, DIUWA 2.0., which is still at the  development stage.     First Chair in Latin America    In 2010, we signed an agreement with the the  National University of Cordoba (Argentina).  to establish the first Professorship in Accessible  Technologies in Latin America.    The Professorship, which will be based in UNCs  Faculty of Mathematics, Astronomy and Physics  (FaMAF), seeks to foster innovation and  technological development in the sphere of  accessibility and inclusion in Argentina and Latin  America by developing innovative solutions and  services to assist in giving access to technology to,  and the integration of, people with disabilities.    The first project for the Professorship to take on  will be the launch of an Accessibility Observatory,  which will research the current Accessible   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   108  Technologies environment in Latin America and in  Argentina in particular. To achieve this, a  scholarship will be awarded by Indra to a PhD  student, to undertake research with three strands:  web-accessibility; accessible digital audiovisual  communication and systems; and accessibility to  mobile devices and terminals.    "Share accessible technology" campaign    In December 2010, to coincide with international  disability day, Indra launched the "Share accessible  technology" campaign. With this campaign we  intended to raise awareness of the realities of  disability and disseminate the Accessible  Technology initiative through our Christmas  greeting message. This initiative was also  publicised through social networks and invited  everyone who received the message to share it and  contribute to raising awareness of the realities of  disability and the need for integration. This  dissemination campaign is still ongoing at:  http://www.indracompany.com/en/sostenibilidad-e- innovacion/share-accesible-technologies  For the last three years Indra has allocated its  budget for its Christmas campaign to financing  Accessible Technology projects.    Accessible Technologies in  Marketplace  Enterprise 2020    In 2010, Accessible Technologies were one of the  four Spanish business initiatives selected to take  part in MarketPlace Enterprise 2020, the  European Market for Corporate Social Responsibility  (CSR). The event, organised by CSR Europe, is the  Europe-wide meeting place for the best initiatives  and social responsibility projects; Indra's  participation has earned it recognition for its policy  of Corporate Responsibility combined with  Innovation, of which accessible technologies are  the best exponent in todays world.    Telecom's XI Premio Cidadania do Anuario     The Premio Cidadania del Anuario Telcom,  organised by the company Plano Editorial, has been  going for 11 years and is aimed at recognising the  most significant projects in corporate responsibility  of companies in the country's telecommunications  sector.    In the last round of awards, Indra's HeadMouse and  VirtualKeyboard were selected as among the 5  most important CR projects in Brazil, by a jury  composed of important personalities in Brazilian  society.    Corporate Citizen of the Americas Award    In 2011, Indra has received the Corporate Citizen  of the Americas Award in the Vulnerable  Communities category, in recognition of its  Accessible Technologies programme, HeadMouse  and VirtualKeyboard. This award is presented  annually by the Trust for the Americas, a  foundation affiliated with the OAS (Organization of  American States). Some of the criteria considered  for award-winners were: impact of the initiative,  replicability, sustainability and innovation.    HeadMouse and VirtualKeyboard, Award for  the 100 best ideas     The magazine Actualidad Econmica gave an award  in the 100 best ideas category to the HeadMouse  and VirtualKeyboard solutions, developed under the  Indra-Fundacin Adecco-sponsored Professorship at  the University of Lleida.    WE LAUNCH THE CORPORATE VOLUNTEERING  PORTAL FOR OUR EMPLOYEES     Taking account of the concerns of our employees  on the one hand, and the demands of society on the  other, and in order to consolidate a number of  volunteering initiatives already taking place in the  company, we have launched the Corporate  Volunteering Portal.    Our volunteering programme reflects Indra's  commitment to society and is intended to develop  activities which help to narrow the digital gap, with  particular emphasis on assistance to people with  disabilities.    The portal contains, first and foremost, information  about the activities that Indra intends to carry out,  as well as the campaigns it is launching. In addition,   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   109  in view of the number of applications received from  non-profit making organisations, we have made a  space for them to advertise their needs to Indra's  employees so that they can supply information  about initiatives and provide our employees with  other opportunities for volunteering apart from  those offered by the company itself.     The portal also features a blog where employees  can relate their experiences of volunteering, both  within and outside Indra and, at the same time,  encourage others to get involved in such initiatives.    The portal has been launched in Spain initially, with  a view to it being extended into other countries  where the company has significant activities.      Support for the Gawad Lalinga sustainable self- sufficiency programme in the Philippines    Indra's employees in the Philippines have supported  the Bayan-Anihan self-sufficiency food  programme of the charitable organisation Gawad  Kalinga. This is the first farming programme for  families in the Philippines. Its objective is to provide  sustainable means of food production to poor  families in the Philippines.     The initiative involved a charity run to raise funds  for the programme and help with the programme  itself through voluntary work in which volunteers  built fences, painted and helped with the  construction of the farms.    The funds raised were used to give each family a  plot of land for cultivation measuring 10 square  metres for conversion into a family small-holding.  The families were also provided with equipment for  harvesting crops and given a course on how to  grow crops ecologically for their own consumption.    CONNECTING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS:  ADDING TO OUR PRESENCE ON SOCIAL AND  PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS     Throughout 2010 we concentrated on improving  channels of communication with our stakeholders,  especially by enhancing our presence on social and  professional networks.    Currently we are on:     Twitter: under the name Indracompany. At  the end of 2010 Indra had 485 followers.    Facebook: with a page for Indra . At the end  of 2010, Indra had 1,628 followers.    XING: we have created the Indra group as a  meeting place and a space for collaboration  by all members of the group. It represents a  space where everyone can share their  expertise in technology and innovation.    Youtube: under the name  theindracompany. Gives access to  corporate videos and videos of Indra's main  solutions and enables the user to see some  of our most advanced technological  solutions in practice.    Through Twitter and Facebook we can let our  stakeholders know about events, news, topics of  interest, etc. relating to Indra and technology.  These networks also provide spontaneous channels  from which to receive enquiries, suggestions or  comments from Indras stakeholders.    INDRAS PRESENCE IN TAX HAVENS DURING  2010    As we explained in the declaration "Indra and tax  havens", published for the first time by the  company in the 2008 Annual Report, and available  through web corporativa, Indras operations in  countries considered to be tax havens are in no  way tax-driven, reflecting rather its international  business development, and must always be  approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee  and by the Board of Directors.    In 2010, Indra had a significant presence or carried  out projects in the following countries which are  considered to be tax havens, either according to the  most recent list published by the OECD , or by the  organization, the Tax Justice Network .       Philippines: Indra has a workplace in the  Philippines with more than 500 employees,  part of the companys Software Labs network  and providing support for Indra operations  worldwide. Indra also develops important  projects in the country, such as the   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   110  management of the commercial service of the  water company, Maynilad, or the modernisation  of the Justice Administration. Indras  commitment to the local Philippines community  is shown through many different social action  projects, such as supporting the sustainable  self-sufficiency programme of Gawad Lalinga,  or its participation in the Adopt a Tree project.  For more information, see  http://www.indracompany.com/pais/filipinas.       Panama: our presence in Panama consists of a  workplace with more than 160 employees who,  as part of the Software Labs network, are  supporting Indra's worldwide operations.  Besides, Indra is engaged in important projects  in Panama, such as the modernisation of the  information management systems of the  Panama Maritime Authority (PMA). In fact, less  than 1% of our income derives from this  country. For more information see  http://www.indracompany.com/pais/panama.       Uruguay: Indra has a workplace with around 80  professionals, who provide support for the  projects the company undertakes in the  country, especially for clients in the energy and  insurance sectors.     Additionally, in 2010, Indra had temporary  operations in countries or territories such as  Andorra, Bahrain, Belize, Cyprus, Dubai, Gibraltar,  Ireland, Luxemburg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Santa  Lucia, Singapore or Switzerland, which are also  considered to be tax havens according to the  aforementioned institutions.    Altogether, Indras sales in 2010 in places  considered to be tax havens represented 1% of the  company's total sales.

THE PRINCIPLES  GOVERNING THIS REPORT    Since 2008, Indra has published an Annual  Report which describes the company's  activities and its performance both from a  financial viewpoint and from the social and  environmental aspects. Indra considers that by  issuing such a report we can present the  company in a more realistic way and offer a  global and comprehensive view of the impact  of our activities on all the companys  stakeholders.    This report aims to give an indication of how  the company has evolved during 2010, through  a description of the most significant policies  and initiatives set in motion during the year,  along with the most relevant quantitative  indicators. To find out about other policies and  initiatives set in motion in previous years we  suggest the reader visits Indra's web site,  which contains detailed information about how  Corporate Responsibility is dealt with by the  company. Furthermore, as a guide to the  reader, each chapter of Our stakeholders  contains a summary of the current main  policies and initiatives which apply to each of  our target groups.    The annual report is drawn up in accordance  with the March 2011 edition of the Global  Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guide to Producing  Sustainability Reports (known as G3.1), to the  highest application level (A+), and in  accordance with the provisions of the AA1000  APS Accountability standard (2008 edition).     Economic, social and environmental information  contained in this report have been externally  verified by independent third parties. The  scope, description of the work involved and  conclusions of this verification are contained in  the section entitled Verification Letter.    In accordance with our commitment to  continuous improvement, since compiling its  first report on corporate social responsibility  and sustainability (in 2003) Indra has been  working to extend its reporting to all  companies within the group.     The scope of the information presented is  described at the beginning of each chapter of  the report. The complete list of Indra  companies at 31.12.2010 appears in Annex I of  the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements  and Management Report. For any information  covering areas or time periods other than those  mentioned at the start of each chapter, the  differences are explained alongside the  information in question.     As is the case every year, this report has been  produced with the involvement of those  internally responsible for relations with each  stakeholder with whom the company operates,  which involves not only pooling information but  also making constant improvements to the  systems of communication between Indra and  its various stakeholders.     The procedure for preparing this report helps  ensure compliance with the principles defining  its content (materiality, stakeholder  participation, explanation of the context of  sustainability and completeness), as well as  with the principles pertaining to the reports  quality (balance, comparability, accuracy,  timeframe, clarity and reliability) required by  the G3 Guide and by the three founding  principles of the AA1000 APS Standard (2008)  (responsiveness, exclusive to the AA1000   ANNUAL REPORT 2010   117  principle; and inclusivity and materiality,  principles that are shared with GRI but  interpreted according to AA1000).    The information supplied in this document is  derived from various management and  information systems in each of the company's  areas. These areas supply information to the  Department for Brand Development and  Corporate Responsibility, which is responsible  for coordinating reports on the company's  financial, social and environmental  performance, as well as for promoting the  Corporate Responsibility Master Plan. All  information concerning the characteristics or  performance of markets constitutes Indras  own opinions, drawn up by the companys  experts.    There are a number of internal mechanisms in  place to control information handled by the  management and information systems. Indra  makes every effort to improve its systems for  generating, adding and consolidating data, so  as to enhance the quality of the information  presented in the Sustainability Report.    The steps taken to produce this report, from  November 2009 to March 2010, were as  follows:    1.  Interviews were held in the final quarter  of 2009 with each of the managers in  charge of relations with the various  stakeholders, with a twofold purpose:  firstly, to update the Corporate  Responsibility Master Plan by defining  new actions to be implemented or  promoted; and secondly, to compile  information regarding the sustainability  status of the company in order to prepare  the submission of accounts for the year.  To produce the "Activities Report"  interviews were also held, as in previous  years, with the managers responsible for  the companys operations, both in vertical  markets and activities, in order to report  on the main trends and actions in the  business areas where the company  operates. However, continuing the  initiative implemented in 2008, a  particular effort was made to identify the  possible social and environmental impact  of Indras businesses, as set forth in the  Our Business section of this report.    2.  Internal managers responsible for  relations with each stakeholder were  issued with a formal request for  information concerning the GRI (G3.1)  indicators. Likewise, information was  compiled concerning responsible value  policies, programmes, initiatives and  actions introduced during the year, such as  those included in the companys Corporate  Responsibility Master Plan or developed  from other strategic lines and having  synergies in sustainability and  responsibility.    3.  After the report was drafted, it was sent  to each internal manager in charge of  relations with the various stakeholders,  and to those responsible for company  operations, in order to verify that the  information on their management area  was faithfully reflected.     4.  The draft report was also sent to  representatives of the trade unions,  CC.OO., UGT, USO, CGT and ATC to take  into account their suggestions.     ANNUAL REPORT 2010   118      Explanation of the principle  according to GRI G3 or  AA1000 APS (2008)  How we adhere to this principle  Principles regarding the definition of contents in the report  Stakeholder  involvement/  Inclusiveness  Identification of the groups and  response consistent with their  reasonable expectations and  interests, and stakeholder  participation in the development  and achievement of a  transparent and strategic  response on sustainability.  Indra has several systems for periodic consultation with the following stakeholder groups:  shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers. It also maintains communication with knowledge  institutions and society as a whole. Indras main systems for specific consultation with each of its  stakeholders are described in the relevant chapters. Departments also have their own tools to  identify and prioritise stakeholders.    Indras Communication and Marketing department held meetings with the heads of relations with  investors, employees, customers, suppliers and partners, the environment, knowledge institutions  and society to identify the topics to be included in the report and the following up of objectives set  in previous years. Furthermore, the report was drafted with the participation of managers of  relations with each stakeholder, and in addition various operations managers were consulted in  order to gauge the sustainability of Indras range of solutions and services.      Indra aims to move forward in the formalisation of these identification and prioritisation processes.  Materiality/  Relevance  (GRI and  AA1000 APS  2008 principle)  What is significant, important  and relevant and impacts upon  the responsibility and  sustainability of our activity.    In accordance with AA1000 APS  (2008), materiality must be  applied to the business so that  Since 2007, before drafting the report Indra has been conducting a materiality analysis on issues to  determine relevant topics for reporting. To do this, it analyses the topics covered in the  sustainability reports prepared by IT and Defence sector companies.  Then, it researches press  reports to identify the topics the media have focused on, looking particularly at any potential  damage to its reputation that the company may have suffered. Lastly, the company takes as a  benchmark the topics that socially responsible investors (e.g. members of the Dow Jones  Sustainability Index) consider material, as well as the views of opinion leaders, not only in the  sectors where Indra does business but in society as a whole.     ANNUAL REPORT 2010   119  material issues are of strategic  importance for the company.    The purpose of the Corporate Responsibility Master Plan is to identify key topics for the company  and actions to be taken. The company updates the Plan annually based on external and internal  sources. It takes the previous years Plan and includes the topics considered relevant in the  materiality analysis and the recommendations arising during the previous years verification  process. It also considers the results of surveys measuring employee, customer and supplier  satisfaction, descriptions of which are included in the respective chapters of the report. As a new  element, since 2008, customer and supplier surveys include, for the first time, specific questions  aimed at ascertaining the degree of importance they assign to the various aspects of corporate  responsibility. In addition, standards such as the GRI and the opinions of socially responsible  investors are taken into account. Finally, information can be obtained from other, less formal  sources (e.g. watchdogs and focus groups).    The report production process enables the organisation to align the material aspects arising from  the Corporate Responsibility Master Plan with the financial information disclosed in the Annual  Report.      Indra aims to continue working on improving the process in order to make it more standardised for  forthcoming versions and to gradually expand the scope of the report.  Responsiveness  (exclusive to  Standard  AA1000 APS  2008)  The different mechanisms by  which the organisation responds  to its stakeholders  expectations.  In accordance with Standard  AA1000 APS 2008 this  principle, which is worthwhile  from a communication and  action viewpoint, places  Through consultation processes and periodic surveys of shareholders, employees, customers and  suppliers, Indra includes its stakeholders expectations and values in its sustainability management.  Indra discloses its stakeholders expectations and values in the various chapters of the Annual  Report. The process of drawing up the report is described in this Chapter.    In the Corporate Responsibility Master Plan (the compilation process of which has been explained in  the section on stakeholder involvement and inclusiveness) Indra aims to include all the main actions  which respond to the needs identified by the various stakeholders.     ANNUAL REPORT 2010   120  particular emphasis on  understanding the response.   As a result of communication with its stakeholders, Indra has realised that it must improve how it  communicates regarding its CSR and sustainability. Furthermore, it will continue striving to improve  how it documents the implementation of its responses and how it follows up the viability of each of  the actions identified.  Sustainability  context  Ways in which the organisation  contributes to local, regional and  global development.  Indras  vision of responsibility is combined with innovation.    Management approaches to economic, social, human rights, environmental and product performance  (presented in the section entitled Our Approach to Sustainability) include observations relating to  this context.     Since 2008 Indra has identified in this Report the impact (economic, social and environmental) of  the activities it carries out.   Completeness   Scope, coverage and time frame  of the report. Reasonable and  appropriate presentation of  data, and relation to quality.   The report production process and internal and external verification process help to ensure that the  report is complete.   Principles regarding the quality of the report  Balance  The report must reflect the  positive and negative aspects to  enable a reasoned assessment  of the company's overall  performance.  The 2010 report provides data on positive aspects and areas for improvement, as well as future  objectives vis--vis each stakeholder, and the degree of compliance with past objectives and  commitments.    The process of identifying material subjects (see Materiality principle) also contributes to  compliance.  Comparability  The report must enable analysis  of trends and changes.  The 2010 report includes a record of data since 2006, so that trends can be analysed. The report  also notes any changes in calculation methods.  Accuracy  The report must be sufficiently  accurate and detailed to enable  assessment of the  The aim has been to submit accounts at the very highest level of application, A+, and where  appropriate to explain when indicators are not applicable, not available or only refer to parts of the  company.    ANNUAL REPORT 2010   121  organisations performance.  The verification process for this report ensures the accuracy of the quantitative information and  confirms the evidence and appropriate context for the qualitative information.  Timeframe  The report will be presented on  time and according to a regular  schedule.  Indra has published a Corporate Responsibility Report every year since 2003. Since the 2008  Report, the Annual Report has replaced the Corporate Responsibility Report as the report on its  economic, social and environmental performance. The Annual Report will also be published annually,  at the same time as the other annual reports the company publishes.  Clarity  Information must be presented  in a way that is understandable  and accessible.  Indra produces a digital version of its report for public access through its website:  www.informeanual2010.indra.es    Furthermore, it sends this report to shareholders, leading customers, the media, responsible  investment institutions and other interested parties who request the report.   Reliability  The information compiled in the  report is verified by a third  party. The data included is  supported by documentation  and the relevant internal  controls.  In line with its commitment to transparency, Indra has requested that independent third parties  verify the economic, social and environmental information contained in this report. The scope,  description of the work involved and conclusions of this verification are contained in the section  entitled Verification Letter.
