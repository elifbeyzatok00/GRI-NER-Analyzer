Every year Sonae publishes its Sustainability Report through which stakeholders* are informed about the strategy,  management system, performance and economic, social and environmental commitments of its activity.  This Sustainability Report relates to the financial year of 2011. It was drawn up following the guidelines defined  by Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)*, in its version 3.1, self-declaring the A level, whose compliance was verified by  KPMG, SROC, SA, through an external verification, allowing to obtain the A + level. The information contained in this  Report refers to Sonaes activity, with particular emphasis on its Retail business area.  The Report is organised into 4 main chapters: 1. A Greater World to Invest – includes information on strategy and the Companys overall activity, incorporating  consolidated performance indicators;  2. A Greater World to Involve – presents the Groups consolidated information, describing the Sonae Groups  corporate governance model, risk management and the enhancement of its human capital. Furthermore, it includes  information about relationships with stakeholders and the results of the annual process to sound out their views; 3. A Greater World to Discover – integrates information on Retail-specific management approaches and respective  social and environmental performances as well as the state of compliance with those commitments assumed publicly  by this business area and the presentation of commitments for 2012. These commitments have also been published  in the REAP – Retail Environmental Action Plan* of the Retail Forum for Sustainability, an initiative of the European  Commission and EuroCommerce. It also has a summary of the performance of the core partnerships of Sonae:  Sonaecom and Sonae Sierra. Both companies have independent and detailed Sustainability Reports available in the  fields of Corporate Responsibility of the respective sites: www.sonae.com and www.sonaesierra.com. 4. A Greater World to Evolve (annexes) – sets out Sonaes indicators in accordance with the Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI) guidelines, the GRI table index and also the declaration of verification by an independent external  entity. Note: Whenever the scope of reported information does not encompass all of Sonaes activities, this will be mentioned  in the Annexes. The relevant themes to be included in this document were identified via a benchmark* analysis and by a process  whereby the opinions of the companys main stakeholders were heard carried out in 2011. * See Glossary  07 Should you require any further clarification about the information published in this Report or about  Sustainability at Sonae, please contact:  Catarina Oliveira Fernandes Head of Communication, Brand and Corporate Responsibility E-mail: catarina.fernandes@sonae.pt Tel.: 22 0104000 The Sonae Sustainability Report 2011 is also available online at: www.sonae.pt – Sustainability area.  The impact of the sovereign debt crisis and the ensuing austerity measures taken by the Iberian Peninsula  governments have been harsh indeed. Private consumption has been on a downward spiral – particularly in Portugal  – and the banking system is facing major challenges. Companies have been subject to severe credit restrictions and  this, in conjunction with the high cost of financing, have placed constraints on growth strategies, making economic  recovery an even stiffer task. A slow recovery is expected in the confidence of agents on the Iberian Markets and  improvements in economic activity beyond the 2012 horizon. We are still positioning the company for international growth and for value creation. We hope to attain this by making  the most of the management experience and leading position we have attained on the domestic market. We have continued to show renewed interest into expanding to new markets abroad, seeking to counterbalance the  negative impacts of the domestic economy. However, we have been forced to scale down and adapt our international  growth strategy in order to meet the sharp falls observed on non-food markets in the Iberian Peninsula and the  difficulties encountered in accessing credit in the Portuguese banking system. Our international growth efforts have been maintained solely thanks to the resilience shown by the majority of  our businesses, keeping EBITDA* margins up and generating cash flows capable of ensuring the financing of these  investments, a reduction debt and the payment of dividends. We are still firmly committed to the communities  where we are located. We are also committed to sustainability and we believe that our investors recognise this as a fundamental strategic  force for organisational growth. We care about our employees and our customers and we also measure our success by  the well-being of the former and the satisfaction of the latter. We are a demanding company guided by the principle  of meritocracy, rewarding top performers and developing a strong, unified culture for success. In 2011 our teams  managed to overcome major tests on their capacity and resilience – in 2012 that we will once again be put to the test.  We are approaching the short-term evolution in retail sales both in Portugal and in Spain with some caution owing  to the economic uncertainty and the low levels of consumer confidence which are set to continue throughout 2012. We wish to continue to be seen as a growing, well-reputed company which is highly valued by the customers, but also  by the communities we serve, by our employees and by our shareholders and partners. We have firm belief in our commitment to sustainability and in the value added aspects we have to offer our  customers by striking up long-lasting relations with our business partners.  In the context of our sustainable development mission, we are continuing to undertake various actions and initiatives  to support the Community, with such endeavours being of paramount importance in the current economic context,  amounting to a total of 10.1 million euros invested. These supports have benefitted 3,051 organisations which aid  communities and families nationwide, allowing the undertaking of actions in various areas such as welfare, culture,  education, sports and the environment.  Here at Sonae we are working to take on the current challenges whilst simultaneously constructing potential for the  future. Paulo Azevedo CEO Sonae * See Glossary  At Sonae we view sustainability as value creation for all our stakeholders in permanent fashion over time,  meeting the highest ethical standards. In this regard, in 2011 we continued to implement our mission,  remaining by the side of all our stakeholders. We increased salaries, cut debt, improved our efficiency and  cooperated with our suppliers and partners. All of this in a difficult climate in which each and every one of us  is asked to make a greater effort, but it is also more rewarding. ngelo Pauprio, Executive Board Member Our mission is to create long-term economic and social value, taking the benefits of progress and innovation to a  growing number of people and guiding our actions by values resulting in ethical, responsible behaviour. We are willing and ready to cooperate with central and local governments, in order to improve regulatory, legal and  social frameworks, and to ensure the best solutions for the communities within which we operate, but we also take  care to maintain our independence in relation to all such entities. We aim to optimize the use of resources and maximize their return, seeking cost efficiency, and avoiding any waste or  extravagance. As a priority, we focus on achieving operating efficiency, promoting healthy competition, and delivering  high impact projects. Ambition is born from continuously establishing goals which will stretch us to our limits, stimulating our energy and  reinforcing our determination. Ambition drives us and keeps us dissatisfied with the status quo, forcing us to go beyond  our past successes. We have an active sense of social responsibility, and try to contribute to improving the communities within which we  operate. Our behaviour takes into account the most recent environmental concerns and sustainable development  policies. Setting constant challenges and being open to change are crucial in attracting ambitious people. Our people are a  determining factor in the markets where we operate and, for that reason, we invest in developing their capabilities and  skills, and thereby further enrich our culture. Innovation is at the heart of our businesses. Innovation involves risks, but we are aware of the importance of identifying  and managing these risks, so as to maintain them within reasonable limits. We know that only by innovating can we grow  sustainably. We are committed to creating economic value in the medium and long term, built on relationships founded on integrity  and trust.  13 Business Areas Sonae is a Retail company with two major partnerships in the fields of Telecommunications, Software and Information  and Media Systems (Sonaecom) and Shopping Centres (Sonae Sierra).

This initiative involves the Junior Achievement –  Young Enterprise Europe, an association specialized in training in entrepreneurialism, the European Round Table  of Industrialists (ERT*), an organisation which brings together the main European business leaders (including  the CEO of Sonae, Paulo Azevedo) and European Schoolnet, a network which brings together the Ministries   of Education of 30 European countries with a view to innovating in education and training. We signed up to the Retail Forum for Sustainability, an initiative of the European Commission and  EuroCommerce to promote consumer models which are more sustainable from an ecological perspective. This Forum only accepts Retailer Associations or companies which, inter alia, have signed up to the  REAP – Retail Environmental Action Plan.This is an environmental action plan which identifies individual  commitments in terms of the retail companies that sign up. This involvement entails the dissemination of sustainability commitments assumed annually by Companies/ Associations as well as the annual monitoring of respective compliance (the state of compliance of these  commitments is stated in chapter 3). * See Glossary  Where we are going and why Sonaes corporate strategy is based on value creation through three strategic aspects, to wit, internationalization,  diversification of the investment style and leverage of the asset base in Portugal. Internationalization  In Portugal: Format leader in mature  markets;  Broad-spanning  competencies;  New opportunities  to create value.   To maintain the Board of Directors and employees high ethical standards when interacting with various stakeholders in different countries. To contribute towards the economic, social and environmental growth of regions and countries where Sonae operates. Defend human rights and meritocracy. To improve the Companys environmental performance by investments that reduce its Ecological Footprint*.  Capital light approach  (rental vs. ownership;  partnerships vs. full control): Accelerate growth  and reduce debt;  Release capital via the sale  of real estate assets; Minimise risks. Leverage on assets  and core competencies  in Portugal, and  develop new projects  in adjacent areas;   Strengthen the asset base  and protect the core  markets. Diversification of  investment style Leverage the exceptional  asset base in Portugal Governance Environment Social Main  strategic  priority Risk  dilution  per country New  growth  methods Wholly owned  businesses Adopt the most  appropriate  investment  style Partnerships Minority  stakes Generate new  businesses Innovate Strengthen  competitive  position To achieve the strategic objectives, our activity is based on 3 performance pillars: * See Glossary  21 Internationalization  Internationalization focused on core businesses and adjacent business areas, will become the main future growth  vector during the course of the coming years. Due to this being the main strategic priority, all necessary resources  will be allocated to it, because it grants the opportunity to increase the companys presence abroad and to transform  Sonae into a great multinational Company. Diversification of the investment style The intention is to leverage Sonaes resources and the efficiency of the implementation strategy, adopting a  style or mix of styles most suited to each business, ranging from detaining the entire capital to detaining several  majority ownerships, but also including minority interests with or without special rights. Sonae may participate in  the share capital of companies over which it has no control, in situations where it does not have the necessary  resources or when third-party contribution may serve as a factor for creating superior economic value. Under these  circumstances, consolidation processes will be promoted in addition to other restructuring movements in the sectors  involved, such as entering new territories as partners with the capacity to bring technical expertise and develop the  necessary network of high-level professional relationships. Levering the exceptional asset base in Portugal To continue to explore new business opportunities that derive from the exceptional asset base that Sonae holds in  Portugal, as a means in which to create a set of options for future growth.  These projects must possess the majority of the following characteristics: (i) clear internationalization potential;  (ii) attractive levels of potential profitability;  (iii) enable them to take advantage of great global trends;  (iv) represent the strengthening of competitive position;  (v) have the potential to become large business in the medium term.  A significant portion of capital will be allocated to these new projects, depending on their capacity to generate growth  and economic value.  Similarly, special attention will be given to detect as early as possible, signs of success or failure of these investments,  so as to, in a timely manner, make decisions regarding further investments, mergers or divestments. Application of the strategy in the different businesses: 1. Focus on leadership and profitability This global strategy is applied to each and every Retail business area, individually and according to their specific  characteristics. In the food retail business(Sonae MC), the strategy is directly related to consolidating market  leadership in Portugal; studying new adjacent business areas and managing the business in Portugal as a cash-flow  generators, whilst at the same time dedicating efforts to seek international opportunities. Sonae Sierra intends to maintain its main focus on shopping centres, continuing to include the ownership,  development and management of shopping centres as well as the customer services. The Companys goal is to  create unique shopping centres, developing innovative concepts that bring together the right mix, architecture,  environment, services, continuing to focus on assets in its area of influence and to associate with retailers and other  partners of selected industries in order to develop new shopping experiences. Sonaecom is a growth-oriented company which has set its sights on being the best provider of communications  services in Portugal, creating an environment of choice for the development of the best professionals potential. It  specifically commits to creating products, services and innovative solutions which meet the needs of the markets  and generate greater economic value.  2. Focus on growth and internationalization  Regarding Specialized Retail (Sonae SR), the focus is on growth via internationalization, namely in the Spanish market by  the continuous investment and strengthening of Sonaes presence in Spain. The management of business opportunities  in new territories, based on franchise agreements and joint-ventures, is also part of the accelerated growth strategy,   as well as the consolidation of the leadership position in the Portuguese market and the increase in profitability. Sonae Sierra intends to continue its international growth and get into new and emerging markets, where the retail  industry is experiencing strong growth and the consumers purchasing power has a significant potential for growth.  Greater growth in operations is expected in the Mediterranean Basin and Latin America. It is also analysing potential  markets in Eastern Europe and Asia, especially China, based on the rendering of services to third parties. 3. Monetization of real estate assets In the Retail Real Estate business (Sonae RP), additional sale and leaseback asset transactions are planned, with the  objective of freeing up capital invested in real estate assets to finance growth. Notwithstanding, the current macroeconomic and financial scenarios have lead Sonae to concentrate the majority  of its assets in generating and preserving capital, which alters the Companys plans and tactics significantly, but no  its outlook on the future. Sonae Sierra is committed to dynamic portfolio management and it is seeking to improve capital intelligence and  follow unleveraged investment strategy. This strategy includes rendering services to third parties and taking up  minority interests in new partnerships. It envisages a reduction in capital stakes and, in some cases, the disposal of  non-strategic shopping centres on mature markets; this will release capital to finance the development portfolio on  growing markets. In 2011, Sonae MC consolidated its leadership on the Portuguese market through a rapid, effective adaptation of its offer  to the consumption habits of its clients and it has continued to explore new adjoining business opportunities. Sonae MC has  expanded its presence in Portugal, opening up 5.5 thousand m2 and it concluded the brands unification process under the  Continente brand. It was selected as the Trusted Brand by the Portuguese in 2011, for the 9th consecutive time. Sonae SR continued its internationalization process, expanding its main brands in Spain. Concurrently, it continued to  consolidate its leadership on the Portuguese market, assuming it as the basic market for new brand and format development  tests. In 2011 it has opened up 44 specialized Retail stores (under brands Worten, Sport Zone, Modalfa and Zippy), totalling  over 46 thousand m2. Sonae Sierra has continued to grow on emerging markets, particularly in Brazil and in service companies. It has also grown  in terms of services to third parties, taking advantage of the experience acquired as a retail real estate and real estate asset  management promoter. Sonaecom achieved a record year in 2011 in terms of profit and cash flow generation, having distributed the first dividends in  its history. It maintained its focus on the growth of the mobile business, obtaining gains in mobile market share, particularly  in the mobile data segment and in cash flow generation, strengthening its efficiency programmes.   23 The Sonae RP business, management and development of real estate assets continued in 2011 to actively manage  the Retail real estate assets with a view to increasing Sonaes capacity to achieve its growth objectives. In 2011 the Investment Management area continued its value creation work for Sonae through support to the  implementation of corporate and business strategies, the maximisation of returns to shareholders, active support  to the planning and implementation of mergers and acquisitions as well as strengthening business relationships with  players from industry, consultants and investment banks.  Further information, about Sonaes economic performance, is available in the annual report and accounts (vide   www.sonae.pt/en/investors/financial-data/).

The objective of risk management is to create value by managing and controlling the threats and opportunities that  can affect the business objectives and companies in terms of keeping the latter as going concerns. Along with Environmental Management and Social Responsibility, it is also one of the pillars of sustainable development,  contributing to the continued, sustainable development of businesses through better knowledge and more effective  management of the risks and opportunities which can impact organisations.

The Board of Directors and the Auditing and Finance Committee are responsible for monitoring Risk Management  activities. The risks of the reliability and integrity of the financial and accounting information are also assessed and reported  by an External Audit unit. At the end of May 2011, the Internal Audit and Risk Management department was separated into two separate  departments as a way of strengthening the teams and increasing the focus on each of the respective areas so that  they can meet Sonaes requirements in the best way possible nationally and internationally and it was thus opted to  present the information of both areas individually. In 2011 the Risk Management Department continued with the de Enterprise Wide Risk Management (EWRM*) with  the involvement of the Risk Monitoring Groups (GAR) formed by members of the Executive Committees of Sonae  MC, Sonae SR and Sonae RP, in accordance with the activities described below: Evaluation of BRM (Business Risk Model) Risk Management Activities  Validation Identify risks Evaluate BRM risks (impact and probability) Analise proposal  for risk ownership Validation of Risks Map (individual prioritisation) Relativize importance  of each risk Assignment of risk ownership Define with Risk Owners: Company Policy (degree of risk  to be accepted) Appetite for and tolerance of risk Actions to mitigation (how to  control risks) Risk Indicators (how to  measure each risk) Monitoring actions Formalize  attitude  to risk Monitoring and  Reporting Method Survey Six monthly review  of risk by owner Interviews Workshop Outputs BRM validated Six monthly report  on risk trend Risk Map RMG (Risk Monitoring Group) Risk Management This is charged with the mission  of ensuring companies attaining their  objectives through a systematic, struc- tured approach to opportunity and risk  management and identification.  Internal Audit Evaluates the effectiveness  of management and of the  controls of the risks of  processes and information  systems. Management Control and Planning Promotes and supports the  integration of Risk Management into  the company management control  and planning  process. * See Glossary  41 In order to support this activity throughout Sonae, in 2011 the internal development of an applicational tool was  concluded based on the international Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)*  which encompasses the following stages: Monitor and implement  action plans Monitor Risk Indicators Report Select risks from Sonaes Risk Matrix Answer questionnaires Reprioritise risks Identify risk owners Identify drivers and triggers  of risks Monitor Risk Indicators Identificar os indicadores  chave de risco (KRIs) Identify treatment options  of risks MONITORING  AND REPORTING IDENTIFICATION  OF RISKS RISK FILES Crisis Management Manual  Continente modelo  Application of Risk  Management Crisis Management Manual Continente bom dia  Reinsurance Audits  2011/12 Control Risk Self Assessement 2nd half EWRM Sonae SR Control Risk Self  Assessement 1st half EWRM Sonae RP EWRM Sonae MC Risk Management  of Continente Online  Risk Management of the Customer  Loyalty Card Main milestones of Risk Management activity in 2011 * See Glossary  The following Risk Management activities have been planned for 2011:   Implementation of Enterprise Wide Risk Management programmes in the businesses of Sonae MC, Sonae  SR and Sonae RP.

Management of the annual insurance programme. Our Human Resources policy is carried out with a view to attaining the sustainable creation of value in alignment  with business strategy. As the largest private employer in Portugal in 2011, we have had a major impact on the  qualification and development of our staff.  At Sonae we set out to maintain a working environment which is balanced, healthy and safe, respecting the rights  of equality of opportunity and non-discrimination in recruitment and development opportunities and career  advancement. At the end of 2011 our headcount stood at 39,819. Of the latter around 77% have open-ended contract, 59% are  young people aged under 35 and 65% are women.

This  legacy of values is the basis for growth and success and, in 2011, it was laid down in writing in a document called  our way which sums up our attitude in life and business. OUR VALUES Ethics and Trust People at the centre of our success Ambition Innovation Social Responsibility Frugality and Efficiency Cooperation and Independence HOW WE WORK With excellence With frankness and clarity With merit With boldness With common sense With curiosity With creativity By being customer focused With a sense of ownership Communicating OUR TEAMS Richness and diversity of the  backgrounds and profiles of our people Teamwork is the key to our success Innovation and talent Respect Quality and accuracy Good working environment Transparent and sincere relationships OUR MANAGERS Leadership Availability Delivery Positive manner Challenge Excellence Firmness Honesty Courage Recognition Open mind Credibility Example  This document describes the attitudes and behaviour expected from employees and addresses to each the  responsibility, in their relationship with the various groups of stakeholders on a day-to-day basis, for ensuring that  this constitutes a true reflection of the organisation.  Sonae has already been recognised abroad for its best practices, intrinsically related with our values. An example  is the fact that we are now on the list of the 100 most ethical companies in the world, an acknowledgement of  our commitment to create economic value based on ethical, trusting relations. We cultivate these relations and we  believe that they promote a good working environment. Cyclically, we monitor the internal social climate through  diagnostic studies which allow us to identify opportunities for improvement.  The employees also have a Sonae Ombudsman who ensures the management and communication of their  complaints, claims or suggestions. In 2011 we promoted a study aimed at the public and employees of Sonae, Sonaecom and Sonae Sierra to sound  out their perceptions and opinions about the theme of Employer Brand (EB – organisations image as an employer)  and Employment Value Proposition (EVP – set of attributes perceived as a value gained by employment with the  organisation). Based on an appraisal of the drivers, Compensations, Opportunities, Organisation, Work and People, it was sought  to pinpoint the strengths and opportunities for improvement in terms of attracting and holding onto employees  according to the following analysis perspectives: Perceptions  about Sonae  as an employer Relevance  and attractiveness  of Sonae Identification  of expectations as  regards the ideal  employer External knowledge  levels about  the Sonae reality Study target segments: Internal public: Sonae employees (Sonae MC; Sonae SR; Corporate Centre), Sonaecom and Sonae Sierra  to discharge duties in Portugal, Spain and Brazil. External public: New graduates looking for their first job and graduates who have been working for over  3 years residing in the areas of Greater Lisbon and Madrid.  45 Against a backdrop of business growth and internationalization, the investment in the development of our best people  forms an integral part of the implementation of our strategy. In this regard, the correct identification, evaluation and  boosting of the development of the best talents has become a priority.  2011 was characterised by a major investment in the revision of the process to manage the performance of our  permanent employees, creating a new performance management model – Improving Our People. This new model  sets great store by the broad range of employee backgrounds and profiles, accommodating the wide range of  businesses and locations where we can be found.  Improving Our People  The new performance management model is based on continuous interaction and accountability shared  between the superior and the employee, fostering a commitment by our teams to their own development.  Based on the merit and added value that employees bring to their jobs and to Sonae, it defends a clearness  of purpose, thoroughness of results and openness as regards recognition. It is against this backdrop that Improving Our People GT (Growth Toolkit) arises, associated with the Improving Our  People process. This talent management tool is geared towards the more senior employees of the organisation, as  well as those employees identified as having the greatest potential for growth. In 2011, around 40 Senior Executives were involved in this process and in 2012 it is set to integrate around 60  employees with great potential.  Here at Sonae we are endowed with a career model whose general objective consists of supporting the management  of the talent pipeline in the organisation, promoting an alignment between business priorities and the professional  development expectations of employees. It reveals and clarifies the set of functional requirements, mobility criteria  and natural trajectories to evolution, boosting the vertical, horizontal and zig-zagging mobility of our employees, as  well as the transversality and broadness of their competences by way of intra and/or inter functional areas and inter  company experiences. This model reflects two management approaches: an initial approach, focused on the human resources planning  needs of the organisation and a further approach was more aimed towards the employee as an actor in his own  professional and personal development. Emphasising and valuing the proactive, enterprising role of our people in terms of the management of their own careers,  the model seeks to support the optimisation of their potential and the acquisition of a clear vision about the different  development options provided by the organisation both at the company and at the other companies of Sonae. Training  Training at Sonae plays a major role in the personal and professional development of our employees, stressing as  the main benefits the exposure to up-and-coming themes and current trends; the discussion and debating of the  challenges and problems of the business with top experts, as well as the creation of discussion fora and networking  with peers from other organisations.  In this way we have sought to provide our employees with diversified, differentiating training programmes at  renowned national and international schools which enable the strengthening of key competences: management and  leadership competences as well as personal and interpersonal competences. As well as each business unit having its own training and development system, since 2004 we have been endowed  with the Sonae Learning Centre (SLC), a space dedicated to the ongoing training of senior managers. In 2011 this  executive training structure had 1,356 participants, totalling 11,652 hours of training. Programa Contacto (Contact Programme) 2011  Rede Contacto (Contact Network) The Rede Contacto (Contact Network), created in 2010, was one of the first world networks launched by  an economic group with a view to detecting and recruiting talent. It constitutes a way of Sonae companies  contacting participants, thereby narrowing the relationship with the university community. After registering  at www.programacontactosonae.com, students have the chance to test their knowledge by taking innovative  challenges and quizzes. They also have the chance to be kept up-to-date about the special offers and whats  new at Sonae Companies. Their participation is scored and the best ones will access the Contact Day. At the  end of 2011 the Network had around 15,000 registered users. Dia Contacto (Contact Day) The Dia Contacto (Contact Day) consists of an initiative aimed at the best Higher Education final-year  students in Portugal, selected by means of the Rede Contacto (Contact Network). During the day participants  have the chance to be in direct contact with Belmiro de Azevedo, the Chairman of Sonae and Paulo Azevedo,  CEO of Sonae, and to find about the businesses of the Sonae Companies, the development plans and  strategy for the future. In total almost 4,000 young people took part in the Dia Contacto (Contact Day). The Dia Contacto (Contact Day) event was distinguished as one of the good practices of Sonae by EuroCommerce.  Call For Solutions Universities  This initiative is an open innovation program for Masters finalists which takes place once a semester. Candidates  attend internships in various areas of Sonae, contacting directly with business reality. It lasts for 4 or 5 months and  its main purpose is to achieve creative solutions for the challenges posed by business, identifying and detecting  talent among the participants. At the end, the solution is turned into a thesis or a final course project. In 2011, the 3rd and 4th Call for Solutions Universities were carried out, with the participation of 22 and 20 trainees,  respectively. Call for You 2011 Call for You consists of a Sonae traineeship programme aimed at knowing and training young talents in the  various business areas. It is aimed at those who have graduated from higher education recently (preferably 2nd Cycle – Masters),  with no more than 2 years professional experience. This is a programme where there is room for the curiosity  of those who wish to learn quickly and the generosity of those who make sharing a further mainstay of  constant innovation. The selection of some of the Call For You applicants occurred via Rede Contacto (Contact Network).  In 2011, 27 trainees had the opportunity to develop its competences and start professional activity under  this Programme, with 18 subsequently joining the Sonae teams.  47 Novas Oportunidades (New Opportunities) Programme In 2011, 958 employees frequented the Novas Oportunidades Programme, with 310 having obtained the respective  skills certification.  Knowledge-sharing at Sonae We periodically promote the carrying out of various fora with a view to sharing opinions, knowledge and the  promotion of good practices amongst the various businesses, promoting innovation, sharing and the adoption of  good practices. Sustainability Forum   Purpose: To share knowledge of Sustainability and the best practices, raising awareness at Sonae about matters  with regard to which synergies need to be fostered and cohesion to deal with the various challenges in this area.  This work group meets every 2 months and it comprises representatives from all Sonae companies. It sets out to  make an active contribution to improving processes and procedures which are performance-enhancing in terms  of Sustainability (e.g.: paper reduction; consumption optimisation and many other themes). FINOV – Forum dedicated to innovation   Purpose: To stimulate and support a culture geared towards innovation at Sonae, capable of withstanding high  levels of value creation Management Control and Planning Methodologies Forum   Purpose: To promote and discuss the implementation of the best control methodologies throughout the company Legal Forum   Purpose: To share experiences and knowledge between legal teams, promoting a broad discussion about  fundamental legal topics and fostering a common approach to legal interpretations and procedures. Marketing and Communication Forum   Purpose: To coordinate negotiations with Media companies and promote the sharing of best practices in the  Marketing area. Engineering, Construction and Safety Forum   Purpose: To discuss the implementation of the best practices, particularly focusing on areas and matters related  with health and safety Negotiation Forum   Purpose: To analyse and discuss negotiation strategies, identify joint negotiation opportunities and share  experiences and knowledge. In addition to the fora, we have three advisory groups, which meet frequently with a view to sharing information and  coordination (internal training organization), including the ongoing review of existing organisational policies in these  areas, and two committees aimed to serve as a platform for sharing knowledge and experiences: Human Resources Risk Management Information Technologies Audit Finance Advisory Groups Committees  Over the years, we have been promoting well-being and the development of knowledge and culture in partnership  with other organisations by supporting various projects and actions. In 2011, we supported 3,051 organisations.  In 2011, 10,134 thousand euros were invested in initiatives to support the community. Additionally, through our  initiatives, customers donated directly about 726,000 euros to the community through projects such as Misso  Sorriso (Smile Mission). Support to the Community 2011 (in thousands of euros) Volunteering Business volunteering is also an important component of Corporate Responsibility which we intend to increasingly  develop with our employees. Volunteering enriches our employees and benefits the communities where it is carried  out and we have thus continued to promote a culture involving an active participation in society, incentivising and  developing new volunteering initiatives. In 2011 our employees dedicated over 6 thousand hours to volunteering actions with the involvement of around  1,350 participants. Our volunteers have supported over 125 institutions in Portugal in actions which have included technical and social  support to third sector organisations such as the Agrupamento Escolar do Cerco (Cerco School Grouping), Acreditar,  the Gil Foundation, the Sol Association, the SOS Villages, Casa do Caminho, Doctors of the World, the Lavoisier  Association, the Humanities Association, the Banco Alimentar Contra a Fome (Food Bank) and many more. Cultural Support  Casa da Msica (House of Music)  In 2011 we maintained the patronage agreement with Casa da Msica with a view to cultural dissemination and  the stimulation of innovation. Under the terms of this agreement support was lent to the initiatives Pas-Tema  (Country-Theme), Residncias Artsticas (Artist Residencies) and 3 Fim de Tarde (Tuesday Afternoon) which  form part of the musical scheduling of Casa da Msica.  Corporate Centre   636.7  Sonae Sierra  1,483.6 Sonae RP  146.1 Sonae MC  6,309.1 Support to the  Community  10,860  Sonaecom   94.1 Sonae SR  2,188.6 Investment  Management   1.8  49 Serralves Concurrently with patronage support, we have joined forces with the Serralves Foundation to launch, for the first  time, an Artistic Residence Programme, an innovative, pioneering project in Portugal based on cooperation between  two different worlds: companies and cultural agents.  The Sonae/Serralves Project has enabled the invited artists to undertake their work in Oporto and contact cultural  agents, students and the community. This action, fitting in with our Corporate Responsibility policy, set out to  promote creativity, innovation and approximation between the arts and the surrounding communities, namely  through the discovery and development of young talents.  Support to Young People We have a commitment to the education of younger people and the development of an enterprising society capable  of generating wealth. The promotion of entrepreneurialism is thus one of the priorities we have set in the context  of our social corporate responsibility policy and which has led us to foster the volunteering of our employees in the  promotion of innovation, creativity and entrepreneurialism.  Junior Achievement Portugal – Learning to be enterprising 2011 saw our fifth year of participation in Junior Achievement Portugal (JAP), a non-profit-making association  committed to taking programmes to the schools which develop a liking for entrepreneurialism amongst children and  young people. In the context of the partnership we have set up, employees provide training at schools in the fields  of entrepreneurialism and personal finance, with a view to preparing young people to succeed in a global economy  through entrepreneurship education, skills for employability and financial literacy. In the academic year 2010/2011 we had 209 employees involved who gave their time to help implement the  programmes, having affected over 2,750 students. The programme with the most enrolments was Brao Direito  (Right Arm), a programme in which students follow a professional for one day in his/her working environment, acquiring  knowledge about culture, work ethics and the various career options available.  In total, the Sonae volunteer group undertook 1,342 hours of volunteering in Junior Achievement Portugal actions.  Since 2009, around 430 employees have joined this project, with an impact on approximately 7,300 students. All he  volunteers considered the experience to be very positive, and would do it again, also stating that they will incentivise  other people to be JAP volunteers. Some testimonies: Sonaes support has been vital in terms of the sustainable growth of JAP, with a particular emphasis on the  number of volunteers involved in the various actions nationwide. The connection to JAP and the commitment  demonstrated to cover an increasing number of students has enabled us, over these five years work, to  reach around 112,000 students in Portugal. We are deeply grateful for this partnership which will undoubtedly  produce more enterprising young people.  Junior Achievement Portugal In my opinion, volunteering forms part of our civic duty as members of a community, but rather than a  sense of duty, what really drives me on is the opportunity to make the difference in the life of someone,  putting at the disposal of others all my enthusiasm, experience and knowledge. Its a great experience  which is really rewarding! Filipa Oliveira (Sonae Sierra), elected the Volunteer of the Year by Junior Achievement for the academic  year 2010/2011  In 2011 Sonae was elected the Company of the Year for having been the company which  provided the greatest number of volunteers nationwide. Porto de Futuro  This challenge was laid down by Oporto City Council to companies, with a view to supporting the management  and development of 17 school groupings in the region by bringing the school and business communities closer  together. During 2011 we continued to support this initiative at Agrupamento Escolar do Cerco (Cerco School  Grouping) by means of:   advisory support to general school management;  logistical support (including works management and supplier control);  support to underprivileged students;  promotion of entrepreneurialism and creativity;   professional/ongoing training; and  rewarding the cases of excellence. By dint of its nature which is decisive for the development of a sustainable society, education is a task which must  mobilise us all as there is no doubt that all the measures implemented today will be vital for the future of new  generations.  In the context of the Sonae/Cerco partnership, some of the projects supported by us were:    Junior Achievement, with the presence of the Sonae volunteers to train in the context of the classroom, on different  themes: The Family, The Community, Economics for Success and The Company.   Tag rugby, sports promotion project and training of young people through the values of rugby – team work,  responsibility and integrity.    Mundo das Profisses (World of Professions), with study visits and promotion of employees of partner companies  going to schools so that children have a sense of the different professions.   Brao Direito (Right Arm), a volunteering action in the context of the Porto de Futuro Project in which Sonae  employees host secondary school students from Agrupamento Escolar do Cerco (Cerco School Grouping) to follow  their daily duties in a real work context for a day. Global Enterprise Project  Sonae is one of the 19 founding companies of The Global Enterprise Project (GEP), an initiative which sets out to  promote entrepreneurialism amongst young secondary school students throughout Europe. GEP involves the Junior  Achievement-Young Enterprise Europe, an association specialized in training in entrepreneurialism, the European  Round Table of Industrialists, an organisation which brings together the main European business leaders and the  European Schoolnet, a network which brings together the Ministries of Education of 30 European countries with a  view to innovating in education and training.  During the three years of the initiative, 40 thousand young Europeans aged between 15 and 18 will have the chance  to create and manage a real company, to discuss globalisation, strike up partnerships with colleagues from other  countries, learn entrepreneur competences and apply the knowledge acquired.  With the support of teachers and volunteers young people will be challenged to work with different professionals and  be challenged to learn on the job.  51 In 2011 we continued the strategy of dialogue and involvement with our stakeholders so as to ensure the satisfaction  of their needs in the long-term and to identify the attendant risks and opportunities in due time.  In this context, we believe that we have a role to play in terms of finding solutions, but we know that we need to work  in partnership with our strategic stakeholders. As such, in addition to the publication of annual Sustainability Report,  we are endowed with a series of mechanisms for periodically communicating with each stakeholder group.

Our brands are permanently focused on orientation towards the client – who is increasingly  demanding and better informed – so as to be able to anticipate his expectations and develop innovative solutions. In 2011, bearing testimony to our dedication and commitment to ongoing improvement, the food Retail area  maintained International Certification of the Complaints Management System in accordance with NP EN  10002:2007, awarded by SGS* ICS – International Certification Services. It should be pointed out that Sonae MC  was the first company in Europe to receive this Certification in 2010. Also in the Food Retail area, we published the Complaints and Suggestions Management Policy. This policy  stands out for the implementation of a single customer approach method, the systematisation of the whole of  the complaints management process, the provision of a base/structure for the analysis and ongoing revision of  the complaints processing procedure and of the improvements made by setting objective and indicators and the  monitoring of customer satisfaction. All these factors promote greater credibility with the client as regards the skill  at resolving complaints in consistent, systematic and uniform fashion as well as motivating employees to fine-tune  their skills in terms of customer contact. This policy sets out the suggestions and complaints management system objectives, to wit:   To obtain the satisfaction of consumers at the time when they express their dissatisfaction and share their  suggestions as a reason behind the success of the business;   To ensure that the development of a complaints and suggestions management system is the upshot of an ongoing  concern to comply with all the requirements, following careful procedures, so as to fit them in with their objectives;   To ensure a more professionalised organisation which allows an improvement in the quality of the service rendered,  ensuring the company has greater productivity and that Employees have greater satisfaction in the performance of  their professional activity;  To achieve closer relations with Clients with a view to establishing more relations built on confidence;   The strict compliance with applicable regulations in all our fields of action. In 2011 Worten also officially received Certification of the Iberian Complaints Management System. In this way, a  further step was ensured in the commitment to offer our customers quality service, to wit in the context of the way  in which suggestions and complaints are dealt with. Sonae Ombudsman We pay special attention to all the contacts addressed to us. In this regard, we provide our employees, clients,  suppliers and the general public with access to the Sonae Ombudsman which is intended to ensure appropriate  follow-up to any complaints, claims or suggestions addressed to it. The Ombudsman will answer any contact addressed to our business areas (Sonae MC, Sonae SR, Sonae RP,  Investment Management, Sonae Sierra, Sonaecom) as well as of Sonae Indstria and Sonae Capital, duly forwarding  it and controlling the responses. The Sonae Ombudsman is directly answerable to the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sonae. Customer satisfaction In addition to the complaints and suggestions management system and the Sonae Ombudsman, with a view to  improving our products and services, we undertake various customer satisfaction studies in line with the themes  to be assessed (e.g.: image, quality of the product, customer service) and appraisal methodologies (e.g.: quarterly  report, mystery client, online panels). Each of these studies has individualised results which are analysed in such a  way as to ensure the best possible response to customer needs. * See Glossary  53 In 2011 we undertook a study into corporate social responsibility3 with a view to establishing the environmental and  social practices that the clients consider to be most important in the Retail area as well as measuring the popularity  of the social initiatives undertaken whose main results we have highlighted:   The products provided to clients with the least income are considered to be the most important in all  brands, with the exception of Continente bom dia where the products provided to promote a healthy diet are  highlighted. This practice is regarded as the second most important in the other brands.   The most popular social initiatives promoted by Sonae MC and Sonae SR amongst clients are: Misso Sorriso ,  Troca de Lmpadas, Causa Maior and Pilha de Livros (Continente); Campanha Arredonda (Worten); Ns  (Modalfa e Zippy) and sports events Corrida da Mulher and Meia Maratona (Sport Zone).   The clients expressed interest in finding out more about the activities undertaken by the 8 brands in the context  of environmental protection and support to the community. Annual stakeholders dialogue process In order to identify stakeholders expectations and consequently set sustainability priorities and objectives, in 2011  we undertook the annual stakeholders dialogue process. This consultation allowed the identification of the main  material themes and opportunities for improvement which allow a direct connection to be created between the  sustainability challenges which are faced and the business strategy. The selection of stakeholders to dialogue was based on the identification of strategic stakeholders in the Retail area. This  being the case, a sample of 171 stakeholders was identified, belonging to the following stakeholder groups:    The process ran off by means of a questionnaire via an online platform for suppliers and employees and via a phone  conference for the rest, feedback was obtained from five stakeholder groups, totalling 89 replies. The questionnaire  was structured into four main sections with the following main conclusions: Regulating  and government  authorities and  municipalities Community Suppliers Employees Investors/ Analysts 3  610 surveys were conducted on customers: Continente (507), Continente modelo (247), Continente bom dia (92), Worten (382), Vobis (45), Sport Zone (231), Modalfa (215)  and Zippy (105). The collected sample is predominantly female, between 25-44 years old and belonging to the Lower Middle Class. Sustainability Performance he majority of the sample of stakeholders sounded out  believes that Sonae has a clear vision of its economic,  environmental and social responsibilities. Reputation and Image The stakeholders sounded out believe that Sonae  has a Very Good performance as regards  the optimisation of consumption and recycling*  of water and water risk assessment  in the supply chain. Relevant themes Those themes with the greatest percentage  of references by the stakeholders were the  Sustainability strategy and future committments;  Human capital development; Environmental policy/  Environmental management systems.  The themes Policies and practices for the preferential  selection of national suppliers, Forms of involvement  with a larger number of stakeholders and  Development of human capital were themes for  which improvement opportunities were identified by  the groups of stakeholders. Sustainability Report The majority of the stakeholders sounded out  had access to the Sustainability Report 2010  by e-mail and at the Sonae web site. Of the sample of stakeholders who read the  report (75%), either in part or in full, 68%  classified the information  provided by Sonae  in the Sustainability Report 2010 as Good"  or "Very Good" and 16% as "Sufficient".

We have a firm commitment to sustainable development and this  also involves providing our clients with the best products at the lowest prices, particularly in scenarios such  as that which we went through in 2011. Lus Moutinho, CEO of Sonae MC 2011 proved to be a period of consolidation of the internationalization strategy of Sonae with the entry onto  new dynamic markets which are interesting to our brands and where our formats are making their mark as they  stand out and where consumers recognise our plus points and we expect to keep up a good rate of openings. Miguel Mota Freitas, CEO of Sonae SR In 2011 we strengthened our position as leaders on the food and specialized Retail market in Portugal. In the case of  Sonae MC, this reinforcement was based on a rapid, effective adaptation of the offer to the alterations in consumer  habits in Portugal whilst in the case of Sonae SR, the strategy to explore franchising and joint-ventures opportunities  was continued as a way of speeding up growth internationally. Sonae RP continued its activity of actively managing the Retail real estate assets of Sonae with a view to increasing  the Companys ability to achieve its growth objectives. In 2011 the Retail business increased the number of stores to a total of 1.016, corresponding to a total sales area of  around 1 million m2. Sonae MC Sonae SR 454 stores  in Portugal,  22 of which under  a franchising  regime in Portugal 564 thousand m2  of sales'  area 423 thousand m2  of sales' area 562 stores 133 stores  abroad 21 franchising  units* * 11 in Portugal; 5 in Saudi Arabia; 3 in Spain; 1 in Kazakhstan and 1 in Egypt   59 Retail business areas turnover (in millions of euros) The contribution of the own  brands' portfolio and first  prices for sale continued  to increase, accounting  for around 30p.p  in the relevant categories  during 2011. In 2011 Sonae MC  managed to strengthen  its leading position on the food  market in Portugal by around  1p.p of share, with  a 2p.p increase in sales  to 3,327 million euros. Sonae SR achieved 1,235 million  euros and it is worth stressing  the 43% growth in sales  on international markets,  with sales in Spain alraedy  accounting for 25%  of total sales of the unit, 5p.p  above the amount recorded  in 2010. The joint sales  of our retail units  – Sonae MC and Sonae SR –  increased by 0.3p.p  in 2011  to 4,562 milllon euros. Sonae   4,562 Sonae MC  3,327 Sonae SR  1,235 Sonae RP  119 Investment Management  130 2011  The Internal Auditing Department aims to make an effective contribution to the achievement of the organisations  objectives by carrying out audits on those processes which are most critical and relevant to the business, the  implementation of audits to verify compliance with internal procedures and legislation, the carrying out of food  safety audits and the auditing of those systems which support the activities of the various areas.  Organisation of the Internal Auditing Department The Internal Auditing Department is made up of 30 employees and it carries out its activity in the companies Sonae  MC, Sonae SR, Sonae RP and the Corporate Centre.  The annual activity plan for Auditing duties has as its main inputs the strategic lines of the various businesses,   the biggest risk areas and the demands of the various Management levels. Internal Auditing reports regularly to the Audit Committee and to the non-statutory body the CAF (Audit   and Finance Committee). There is also a body to coordinate internal audit activity of Internal Audit in Retail, the Audit Committee, to which   it makes a quarterly report. Main responsibilities of the Internal Auditing Department:  To audit the most critical and relevant processes of the businesses;  To audit compliance with legislation and procedures;   To audit the information systems;  To audit compliance with legislation and procedures in the food safety area;  To coordinate Retail auditing activity at Sonae companies and;  To support the Audit Committee in operational terms. Process auditing  and compliance Food Safety  Audit Information  Systems Audit Internal  Audit Audit  Committee CAF Sonae's  Executive  Committee  61 International certification programmes: As regards the carrying out of Internal Auditing duties in 2011, we are still consistently sponsoring those employees  who apply for international certification in various programmes. In the Retail area, Sonae is one of the organisations which has the largest number of employees certified in internal  auditing in Portugal. Furthermore, it has teams certified in the auditing information systems auditing and food safety  auditing. In 2012, Sonae will continue to sponsor this important programme for the training, development   and international certification of its auditing employees in accordance with the best international practices. Main actions implemented in 2011 Process Auditing and Compliance In 2011, 450 audits were carried out to verify compliance with legislation and internal procedures at Sonae MC and  Sonae SR in the fields or Procurement, Sales, Brochure Product Stock Breaks and Inventories. The main aims of these audits are the reduction of fraud risks and breaches of rules and procedures, a reduction  in financial losses and verification of the control level at the Organisation, as well as an increase in the customer  satisfaction level and to contribute to the maintenance of the image and reputation of the company. Audits were also carried out on a series of critical processes at Sonae MC, at Sonae SR and at the Corporate Centre  with the aims of pinpointing the main associated risks, the potential impacts on business and the controls which need  to be implemented or improved so as to ensure the mitigation of said risks.  In addition, we carry out a series of key indicators monitoring measures in critical business areas (in 2011, around 500  audits were carried out on 30 indicators). Information Systems Audit  During the course of 2011, 16 audits were carried out on the information systems which support the Retail critical  processes with a view to identifying and correcting any potential vulnerabilities which may have a negative impact  on the business and on information security. Food Safety Audit Worthy of special note is the implementation and consolidation of a food safety audit programme on stores,  cafeterias, depots and manufacturing centres, highlighting the surveying and reporting of the main conclusions in  terms of the company and orientation towards the taking of corrective actions.  This audit programme sets out to systematically verify compliance with the legal standards and internal rules  regarding food safety. In 2011, around 300 food safety audits were carried out.  At the end of 2011 the Retail area team was made up of 36,713 employees whereof 90.7% are carrying out duties  in Portugal, 7.75% in Spain, 1.44% in Brazil, 0.1% in China and 0.05% in Turkey. Just like in the previous year, of the  set of top managers only 1 is not in his country of origin. This reality reflects Retail recruitment policy in terms of  operational duties which is based on recruiting locally, thereby contributing the employability of those regions where  the organisation is to be found. Main Retail area indicators Professional development In 2011, in addition to the performance appraisal process applicable to 100% of Retail employees, a further edition  of Upward Feedback was staged. This is a 180 appraisal tool whereby employees give feedback to their Direct  Superiors with regard to their action as team managers in a series of relevant areas: Work organisation, Motivation  and Development and Communication. Upward Feedback is a personal and professional development tool which intends to serve as an anchor for an ongoing  process of change and individual growth. 67% of employees  are female  and 33% male 75% of employees have  indefinite term contract  and 25% definite term 71% perform duties  full time  and 29% part time 36 hours of training  per employee 56,455  training  actions 32%  of new admissions 59% of employees  aged under 35 1,315,145  hours  of training  63 Sonae Retail School In 2011, the Sonae Retail School provided over 1.2 million hours of training out of a total of 56,455 actions, making the  team more active in the identification of new challenges and improvement areas and it rapidly designed programmes  to disseminate the best practices transversally to the organisation.  Investment in people is our starting point. In this regard, our programmes are designed in conjunction with national  and international reference partners. We believe that the content, methodologies and resources which we supply are  amongst the best on the market. We encourage internal training, currently having 2,295 internal trainers available.  Sonae Retail School Sonae Retail School consists of a series of schools and academies with training processes structured into  sustained functional profiles, illustrating the alignment with the business, bearing in mind the strategic lines  defined in the Retail area.  Health and Safety at Workplace Health and Safety at Work (HSW) is an important aspect for sustainable development and corporate social  responsibility, thereby constituting an essential mainstay, as it allows the optimisation of all the potential of our  human resources, a differentiating aspect and the engine behind all our success, strengthening the respect for  Employees, their families and society as a whole. Our concern with Safety at Work is reflected by a strong commitment to the adoption of a preventive programme  which includes the carrying out of audits on workplaces and emergency drills, the existence of an HSW training  programme and the carrying out of raising awareness actions with a view to reducing accident and absenteeism  rates.  We are also committed to Medicine at Work based on the appraisal of occupational risks and the consequent  evaluation of health and well-being associated with the duties and activities of workers. We develop miscellaneous  internal campaigns to raise the awareness of everyone about prevention in the Health area and the adoption of  healthy lifestyles. Sonae has set April 28th, the World Day for Safety and Health at Work, as a day of reflection and the starting point  to strengthen all the proactive – attitudes which allow the achievement of the main objectives: Zero Accidents and  Zero occupational illnesses. As a way of commemorating this day, we give all employees a gift commemorating  Health and Safety at the Workplace.  Main Health and Safety at the Workplace (HSW) Indicators    78,893 participants in raising awareness and training actions in the context of Health and Safety at the Workplace  (HSW) with a total of 105,000 hours of training;  Existence of an HSW course catalogue with 75 different courses;    HSW communication campaigns carried out during the course of the year have involved the active participation  of a total of 236,144 employees4;  Over 100 health professionals;  Carrying out of 30,000 medical examinations;  Safety inspections and audits at 903 units;  47,178 employees consulted in the context of Health and Safety at the Workplace  Implementing of 256 emergency/evacuation drills.

The series of certifications of installations obtained allows us to have at our disposal at least one certified store at  each Operations Department of the food stores, the same being the case with regard to the Worten stores located  in Portuguese territory. This set of certified installations, which covers all the types of installations run by Sonaes  Retail area, to wit, food and non-food stores, depots and manufacturing centres, demonstrates the Companys  environmental management capabilities. In addition, in 2011, Building Research Establishment (BRE*) officially approved the Building Research Establishment  Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM*) Certification report of the Azambuja Eco-Industrial Park (Certification  level: GOOD). In this way the buildings of this logistics pool – where the Plaza 1 and Plaza 2 warehouses are installed  – have become the first buildings endowed with BREEAM Certification in Portugal and the first industrial buildings to  obtain this certification in the Iberian Peninsula.  We obtained recognition at the European Good Practice Awards, awards  given by the European Agency for Safety and Health at the Work which  distinguish the best practices in health and safety at organisations. The  distinction results from the set of good practices followed by Sonae,  namely of the ongoing actions with a view to reducing the risk of accident  in all the processes which involve maintenance and repair works.  The Continente store in Guia (Algarveshopping) was rewarded for good  practices in Health and Safety at the Workplace. The raising awareness  action about the Safety, a matter of attitude theme, undertaken by  this store, was the basis for the awarding of this prize. This award is part of the initiative launched by Sonae Sierra to promote  Health and Safety at its shopping centres worldwide and they seek to  reward those storekeepers with the best practices in Health and Safety. Continente in Cascais obtained renewal of the Certification in the Health,  Safety and Hygiene at the Workplace Management System in accordance  with the Standard OHSAS* 18001/NP 4397:2001. This certification  recognises the quality of the Health, Safety and Hygiene at the Workplace  Management System and the good practices implemented by the parent  company in this area. European Good Practice Awards Personae –  Tenant Awards  Certification  of Continente in Cascais * See Glossary  Climate Change* Our activity impacts climate change and there is a concern and an endeavour is made to mitigate such change. In the  context of the Retail area these impacts may be direct, resulting from fuel* consumption in the transport of goods –  diesel is the fuel used by the main fleet – and indirecti.e.associated with energy consumption at stores and warehouses.  This is why we are concerned with obtaining a contracted fleet which is fuel efficient in accordance with Euro* standards.  A computer tool is being applied to optimise the supply routes of the stores and the cargo volumes transported. In the context of the regulatory framework for electrical micro and minigeneration, photovoltaic energy production  plants have been installed at some of our stores (39 production plants and 19 minigeneration plants) and one of the  things we are committed to is the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. In view of the fact that we consider the involvement of our stakeholders essential (employees, clients, suppliers), we  invest in the dissemination of information and raising awareness about the questions related with emissions and energy  consumption through campaigns, promoting day-to-day management and efficiency. In terms of the indirect impact  through our consumers, opportunities were identified which may alter their behaviour, mainly in the consumption of  electronic and electrical products. The campaigns carried out promote the acquisition of new, more efficient products. Finally, we are also aware that climate changes may affect the agricultural production level which may have  consequences in terms of the availability and quality of food goods and other products of organic origin. The  quantification of these impacts is difficult meaning that we remain attentive and position ourselves in proactive  fashion to minimise potential impacts on the Retail business.  Energy and Emissions Energy consumption is one of the main environmental impacts deriving from the Retail activity. The main form  of energy we consume is electricity which represents around 78% of total energy consumed by the Retail area,  followed by fuel consumption (essentially, gasoil associated with transport by the contracted fleet). Total energy  consumption, in 2011, corresponded to 2,274,098 GJ. Distribution of energy consumption (GJ) Electricity  consumption (GJ) 1,773,315 77.98% Natural gas  consumption (GJ) 17,203 0.76% Gasoline consumption  by employee  vehicles (GJ) 772 0.03% Diesel consumption  by employee  vehicles (GJ) 74,802 3.29% Diesel consumption  by goods haulage  vehicles (GJ) 401,700 17.66% Propane gas consumption (GJ) 1,457 0.06% Diesel consumption  at stores (GJ) 4,850 0.21% * See Glossary  67 As regards electricity consumption, in 2011, this stood at 492.6 GWh*, corresponding to 1,773,315 GJ and emission  of 181,977 tonnes of CO2e .  Evolution of electricity consumption (GJ)  Compared with the previous year, there was an increase in electrical energy consumption of 6.6%, the reflection of  a series of concurrent factors:  Increase in the number of installations, with special focus on Specialized Retail stores;   Accounting for annual electricity consumption of the most recent stores, opened at the end of last year, and  these partially contributed to the total consumption of electricity in 2010;  Extension of opening hours to Sundays and Bank Holidays of Continente hypermarkets. Notwithstanding, bearing in mind the comparable universes at the series of food installations and depots, which  represent 77% of the electrical energy consumed by the Retail business, a 1.9% reduction was recorded. This performance, which we regard as very positive – since it counters the trend towards the growth in energy  consumption deriving from the growing cold production needs for food upkeep as well as from the comfort  conditions thermally and in terms of lighting, of our clients – results from the consolidation of a vast set of measures  systematically implemented in previous years, as well as the contribution of new measures implemented during the  course of 2011 whereof we highlight:   The replacement of normal T8 and T5 bulbs with T8 and T5 Eco bulbs;  The optimisation of lighting levels in different Store areas;   The installation of new temperature control technology in the cooling units (E-Cube), with a direct impact on  production needs/the supply of refrigeration to these units. The specific consumption of electrical energy by sales area which, in 2011, stood at 0.56 GWh /1000 m2, remaining  at a level identical to that of previous years, denoted, even so, a slight increase deriving from the influence of the  consolidation of annual consumption of a set of stores with very reduced sales areas, to wit from the brands Wells  and Bom Bocado. Evolution of electricity consumption by sales areas   Electricity consumption (GWh/1000m2) Electricity consumption by sales' areas  0.60 0.50 2009 2010 2011 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.10 0.00 0.56 0.54 0.53 Electricity consumption 2,000,000 1,637,330 1,663,895 1,773,315 2009 Electricity consumption(GJ) 2010 2011 1,500,000 1,000,000 500,000 0 * See Glossary  Also in the field of electrical energy, 2011 was also characterised by an increase in the autonomous production of  energy deriving from renewable sources, as well as by an increase in the installed production capacities. In actual fact,  the 39 Production Plants under a microgeneration system (37 photovoltaic and 2 aerogenerators) installed along  previous years, produced and injected into the National Network 194.6 MWh*, corresponding to 42% growth on the  production recorded in 2010 and resulting in avoided emission of 91.5 tonnes of CO2e. Evolution of electricity produced through renewable energy source Furthermore, we have strengthened our production capacities, with the installation in the last two months of 2011 of  nineteen of 19 kWp* photovoltaic plants under a minigeneration system which results in total installed power of around  500 kWp. As regards global Greenhouse Gas (GHG)* Emissions associated with the total consumption of energy by Retail  which includes electricity (stores, depots, offices and manufacturing centres) and fuels used at Stores and in the  transport of goods and employees, these stood at 218,708 tonnes of CO2e, representing an increase of around 10%  on 2010. This increase is in the main related with the emissions associated with electricity consumption which, in  2011, represented 181,977 tonnes of CO2e. Also in the context of the calculation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the  gasoil and petrol emission factors used in 2010 were updated.  Evolution of total emissions of CO2e (tonnes of CO2e) In 2011 carbonic intensity recorded an increase of 4 tonnes of CO2e and per million euros of turnover. This increase  was contributed to by the increase in electricity consumption in the Retail area and an increase in the respective  emission factor which, in the current year, recorded the value of 0.369 kg CO2/kWh* (7% greater than the electricity  emission factor in 2010). The updating of conversion factors for propane gas, diesel and gasoline also influence,  though on a lesser scale, the increase in carbonic intensity, compared with 2010. Evolution of electricity produced through renewable energy source 51.7 136.9 194.6 Electricity produced (MWh) 2009 2010 2011 250.0 150.0 100.0 200.0 50.0 0.0 Emissions (t CO2e) 100,000 Total emissions  250,000 218,708 2009 2010 2011 200,000 150,000 50,000 0 199,369 209,017 * See Glossary  69 Evolution in carbonic intensity (tonnes of CO2e/Millions of euros of Turnover)5 Distribution of emissions in 2011 (t CO2e)  60 55 41 45 2009 t CO2e/ M of turnover 2010 2011 50 40 30 20 10 0 Emissions associated  with electricity consumption (t CO2 e) 83.2% Emissions associated  with gasoil consumption  by employee vehicles  (t CO2 e) 2.5% Emissions associated  with gasoil consumption  by goods haulage  vehicles (t CO2 e) 13.6% Emissions associated  with propane gas consumption t CO2 e) <0.1% Emissions associated  with natural gas  consumption (t CO2 e) 0.4% Emissions associated  with gasoil  consumption  by stores (t CO2 e) 0.2% Emissions associated  with petrol consumption  by employee  vehicles (t CO2 e) <0.1% 5 For calculation purposes, the turnover of Sonae MC, Sonae SR, Sonae RP and Investment Management was considered.  Transport and logistics In 2011, the contracted fleet travelled around 37 million kilometres, representing an emission of 29,726 tonnes  of CO2e, reflecting a reduction of around 9% compared with the previous year. The reduction in Greenhouse Gas  Emissions is directly influenced by the updating of the gasoil emission factor in 2011. We have maintained our requirements with the haulage companies with a view to improving the vehicle pool put at the  service of the contracted fleet, wholly managed by our logistics area. At the end of 2011, 87% of the vehicles put at  the service of the contracted fleet complied, at least, with Standard Euro 4, representing year-on-year growth of 5p.p. As illustrated by the two specific activity indicators, to wit, by the number of boxes transported per kilometre  travelled and the equivalent emission of CO2e by box transported, the aim to improve logistical efficiency was wholly  achieved . There was an 11% reduction in CO2 emissions per 1000 boxes transported and a 3% increase in the number  of boxes transported per km travelled.  Evolution in indicators relating to transport and logistics  Distance travelled kg CO2e/1000 boxes transported 129 135 120 Distance  (thousand km) Emissions/1000 boxes  (kg CO2e/1000 boxes) Nr. of boxes transported/ km 2009 2010 2011 8.0 6.4 6.5 6.7 2009 2010 2011 6.0 4.0 2.0 0.0 No. of boxes transported/km travelled 150 100 50 0 40,000 2009 2010 2011 30,000 20,000 10,000 0 36,951 34,712 37,418 2009 2010 Contracted fleet emissions (t CO2e) 2011 28,751 32,754 29,726  71 Refrigerant gases* In 2011, we continued with the programme defined to replace cooling plants defined previously, with a view to improving  their efficiency and, simultaneously, reducing the use of refrigerant gases which are potentially more harmful to the  environment. Hence, various plants with R 427a and a plant with R22 were replaced by plants using R404. Evolution in the type of coolant fluids used at the cold production plants  Water consumption In 2011, there was total drinking water consumption at Continente hypermarkets and supermarkets of 724,414 m3,  representing a 4,4% reduction on the total consumption observed in 2010 (the water consumption observed in 2010  stood at 757,734 m3). As regards the comparable store universe, a 5.8% year-on-year reduction was observed. In turn, in 2011, specific  consumption by sales area stood at 1.40 m3/m2, representing a 4.1% reduction compared to 2010. Evolution of the public water supply consumption by sales area (m3/m2)  The consistent improvement in performance with regard to water consumption which has occurred, year after year,  at food stores derives not only from strict monitoring, but also from the ongoing implementation of wastage control  measures, using more efficient equipment and the behavioural measures of the store teams and also the speed of  resolving accidental leakages. The water consumed is essentially deriving from the public system, though there are boreholes at some stores  whose water is used for the irrigation and washing of outdoor paving. We still dont have a systematic means for  controlling the consumption associated with the use of underground water.

In order to ensure that the effluents meet the applicable legislation, these stores are endowed with  waste water treatment plants which have biological treatment (secondary treatment). We do not have measurements of the quantity of effluents discharged, though we estimate that, in 2011, the  stores have generated around 579.531m3 of liquid effluents (a 5% reduction on 2010), applying the factor used in  engineering for these cases which assumes that 80% of consumed water results in liquid effluents.  Waste Waste management in the Retail area encompasses not only the waste produced in the context of its activity but  also the waste dumped by some clients at our stores, a consequence of the promotion which we have carried out for  responsible environmental citizenship.  Hence, in 2011, the waste managed by the Retail area attained 66,848 tonnes, up 1.5% on the previous year. Of this  total, only 3% corresponds to hazardous waste. In line with previous years, paper/cardboard waste represents 48% and the solid urban waste (SUW*) represents  37% of the total waste managed, corresponding to the largest fractions of the different waste types managed by  the Retail area.  Waste managed/type in 2011 (t) Waste managed by type (t) In terms of the specific flows of waste and compared with the previous year we would highlight: 129% increase in the collection of the coffee capsules (Worten stores), which in 2011 stood at 188 tonnes; the 50%  increase in the collection of cork stoppers (Continente stores) which attained 37 tonnes; the 10% increase in the  collection of WEEE – Waste Electrical and electronic equipment (Worten and Continente stores), having collected  5,446 tonnes. WEEE* 5,446 8% Plastic 3,292 5% Wood 867 1% SUW 24,793 37% Others 708 1% Cardboard 31,741 48% * See Glossary  73 2011 was also marked by the onset of widespread collection of used cooking oil to customers in around 100 stores  Continente, where the logistical and security conditions so allow. As a result of this process there was a very significant  increase in the quantity of such waste, which amounted in 2011 to 9.8 tonnes, showing a growth of 240% compared  to 2010. As a whole, the waste recovery rate attained 77.3 % in 2011, having registered a 0.4 p.p. increase on 2010. The lower  growth in the value of this indicator compared with previous years reflects the efforts made both by the company  and by our suppliers to reduce the packaging materials, with impacts on the quantities of cardboard and plastic waste  managed by our stores.  The main destinations of our waste are recycling*, landfill, energy recovery and organic recovery, highlighting,  compared with 2010, a 20% increase in sending waste off for organic recovery.  To mark the International Year of Forests, Continente, in partnership with Quercus, launched the initiative  Rolhas que do folhas (Corks make sheets). This project, in progress until April 2012, has the aim of  raising the awareness of school, family and friends communities for the recycling of cork stoppers and for  the support of reforesting in Portugal.  The corks collected are sent off for recycling and the amount raised will allow Quercus to carry out reforesting  actions through the Green Cork project. This project sets out to promote the reforesting and the cork as  ecological material.  Promotion of healthy food In the context of the commitments assumed and the objectives of the European strategy for illness prevention and  health promotion, we have been adopting a series of educational initiatives with a view to promoting the adoption  of healthy lifestyles and keeping consumers informed, ensuring them the clarifications required so they can make  nutritionally balanced choices. In terms of the provision of products, in 2011 we saw to the optimisation of the nutritional profile of the products of  certain categories of the Continente brand, reducing the contents of at least one of the following nutrients: fatness,  saturated fat, sugar and salt. Concurrently, we maintained our product ranges which promote a healthy diet:  Equilbrio (Balance) range, a healthier alternative for equivalent products to be found on the market.   rea Viva (Living Area) range which includes products intended to meet the specific nutritional needs and other  food standards such as, for example, vegetarianism. Final destination of waste 70% 60% 50% 40% Recycling Organic  recovery Energy  recovery Landfill 30% 20% 10% 0% 62.2% 63.3% 62.9% 4.3% 5.2% 6.1% 8.7% 2009 8.5% 24.8% 23.1% 22.7% 8.3% 2010 2011  As regards the offer of Private Label products in the Equilbrio and Biolgico ranges, there was a growth in both  ranges, in the main as regards the offer of products of the Equilbrio range. We put on sale 199 items in Continente  Equilbrio and 56 in Continente Bio, spread amongst the various commercial departments. In terms of the labelling of products using the Nutritional Traffic Light system, we provide consumers with  simplified information about the nutritional characteristics of Continente brand food products. Seeking to extend  the applicability of this system, we provide a converter card with reference values of the nutrients considered in the  Nutritional Traffic Light, thereby allowing a comparison with the other products available at the store. Finally, we also act in terms of raising awareness and information to the population, consumers and employees,  having undertaken the following initiatives in 2011;    Carrying out of clarification sessions about food and healthy lifestyles at various schools, from the north to the  south of the country, including themes like Nutritional Traffic Light to aid the clarification about the nutritional  labelling and the campaign to promote the consumption of fruit and vegetables Prova dos 5 (The 5 Test).    Provision, at various Continente stores, of a free nutritional advice service, ensured by qualified nutritionists/ dieticians who provide clarifications to facilitate daily choices in terms of healthy diet.   Promotion of the Food Fortnight initiative during October which takes place at the Continente stores from  the north to the south of the country and includes activities such as the carrying out of consultations and blood  pressure screening, body mass index, fat mass index and also weight, making speeches about healthy diet and  fruit and vegetable tasting and other activities which incentivise the consumption of fruit and vegetables.   Internal raising awareness actions through the making of speeches about diet, health and nutritional screening  undertaken in partnership with Medicine at Work.   Promotion of physical activity in the communities where we operate, to wit through the rehabilitation of urban  spaces in the open air intended to practice physical exercise as a family (Continente Parks and HiperNatura  Gardens), as well as the donation of sports equipment to schools. 2010 2011 Continente Equilbrio 123 199 +62% Continente Bio 49 56 +14% The Nutritional Traffic Light was developed in accordance with the criteria defined in the Front of Pack  Traffic Light Signpost Labelling of the Food Standards Agency. This system is to be found on the front of  Continente product packaging.  Each circle colour corresponds to a different concentration of the nutrients present in food. If a nutrient  is green, this means that its concentration in the food is low, thereby constituting a healthier option. If it  is orange, its concentration is average, though it is still a good option, and if it is red its concentration is  high, having to be consumed occasionally or in lesser quantities.  To complement this system the corresponding percentages were associated to the daily reference values  (DRV*) for these nutrients.  * See Glossary  75 Advertising aimed at childrens When we advertise products aimed at children on the various media – TV, internet and the written Press – in  campaigns whose content is specifically aimed at the under-12s and whenever over 50% of the audience  thereof is actually made up of children from this age bracket, we refrain from advertising food products with  nutrients which show high values of fat, saturated fat, sugar or salt (in other words, Continente products or  others which correspond to the nutrients marked in red in accordance with the National Traffic Light system). In addition, we do not carry out commercial communication related with food products at first cycle schools,  unless specifically requested or agreed with the school, with this being for educational purposes. Hiper Saudvel (Hyperhealthy) Project In 2011 we went ahead with the Hiper Saudvel project which includes the following activities.  Nutritional advice in store In 2011, we continued to advise the Portuguese to have a healthier diet through the team of nutritionists at  Continente Stores which was extended to three nutritionists/dieticians, with the space in store having been  uniformised. Under the terms of this activity we have already advised over 19,000 clients. Launch of the Hyper Healthy Movement The Hyper Healthy Movement is an initiative which sets out to promote an improvement in the dietary  habits of Portuguese families and motivate them to have a more active lifestyle through different platforms:  "Minuto em TV", a specific site of the www.movimentohipersaudavel.continente.pt movement and the  Facebook page of the movement. 3rd edition of the Hiper Saudvel Fortnight In 2011 we maintained the focus on children through an invitation to various schools to be present at our  stores where we were able to liven up various educational games. We also carried out screening and  nutritional advice as well as fruit and vegetable tasting. Drawing up of contents for Magazine Every month the nutrition team draws up a text about healthy diet and proceeds to choose a list of healthy  products commercialised at our Stores. Relaunch of the nutrition microsite The microsite – www.hipersaudavel.continente.pt – provides miscellaneous information about health, diet  and healthy lifestyles. We have started the option of making on-line appointments for nutritional advice and  actions with schools.  3rd edition of the Hiper Saudvel Fortnight In 2011 we maintained the focus on children through an invitation to various schools to be present at our  stores where we were able to liven up various educational games. We also carried out screening and  nutritional advice as well as fruit and vegetable tasting. Drawing up of contents for Magazine Every month the nutrition team draws up a text about healthy diet and proceeds to choose a list of healthy  products commercialised at our Stores. Fruit distribution on the Algarve Beaches In August 2011 Hyper Healthy was on various beaches of the Algarve promoting the consumption of fruit by  giving away nectarines and peaches (15,000 pieces of fruit). The prime aim of this initiative was the promotion  and raising awareness of the importance of consumption of at least five pieces of fruit or vegetables per day as  recommended by the World Health Organisation and the Continente campaign Prova dos 5. Workshops for clients We started various cycles of workshops for clients about the themes: Healthy summer; Child/youth diet;  Edible Seeds; Buying Healthy; Healthy Diet at an adult age and Celiac Disease Expansion of gluten-free products In 2011 we proceeded with the insertion of the Portuguese Celiac Association. At present we have over 20  products marketed under this logo and other products have already been approved by this Association. The Private Label product range has continued to use the A healthy choice logo of the Portuguese  Cardiology Foundation. Optimisation of Nutritional Profile In 2011 we continued to reduce sugar, fat and salt levels in some Private Label products, to wit: 8 tonnes per year of sugar in various yoghourts; 1.7 tonnes per year of fat and 7. 5 tonnes of saturated fat in the toast range; Switch from palm oil to olive oil in the bread snacks range.

School Actions – fostering of actions to raise the awareness of the importance of the adoption of healthier  diet with children and young people. Around 200 actions have already been boosted which focused on our  main campaigns such as the Nutritional Traffic Light and Prova dos 5, depending on the target public. Educational Programme Passaporte para uma vida Hiper Saudvel (Passport for a Hyper Healthy Life) For the second year running we took the Educational Programme Passaporte para uma vida Hiper Saudvel to  the schools, free and aimed at 1st cycle students. These actions included the presentation of the theme deploying  dynamic techniques, practical application through educational activities and games and guided tours to the store  back office (warehouses and cameras). Partnerships established in the context of the promotion of a healthy diet Various entities are our partners in these initiatives which make an active contribution to the success of the Hyper  Healthy Movement, to wit:  Directorate-general of Health/Platform against Obesity  Portuguese Nutritionists Association  Higher School of Biotechnology, Universidade Catlica  Faculty of Human Motricity  Higher Institute of Health Science Egas Moniz  Portuguese Society for Studying Health at School  Universidade Atlntica and Universidade Fernando Pessoa Supplier qualification and selection In order to integrate sustainability into the supply chain and align the Retail practices of suppliers with Sonaes  policies, we develop supplier qualification and selection mechanisms, bearing in mind sustainability requirements,  including aspects related with the environment, working conditions, human rights, safety and quality. Whenever  possible, we continue to prefer national suppliers and in 2011, similarly to the previous year, they represented 80%  of the amount purchased from suppliers. Our supply contracts include environmental, employment and human rights clauses, applicable to national and international  suppliers. Complementing the General Supply Contracts, all suppliers are given the Sonae Environmental Policy.   In the context of the contracts with suppliers under the management of Commercial Department for  Perishables, there are requirements in the General Supply Contracts which promote sustainability along the  supply chain, to wit:    To respect and comply with the maximum legal fishing catch quotas and act in accordance with the  sustainable fishing policy;   To only supply products from fish caught exclusively on vessels which are not on the Greenpeace black list;   To comply with all the applicable standards and legislation about the work rendered by minors, human  rights and the prohibition to discriminate between workers.   Depending on the degree of risk and origin of suppliers, certifications may be required of production, quality, environmental,  hygiene and safety and/or social systems, suitable for the type of products to be supplied, also, in complementary fashion,  having carried out supplier qualification and selection audits in accordance with Retail own check-list.  We seek to maintain demanding criteria meaning that, whenever necessary, and as occurred in 2011, we proceeded  to update and strengthen the evaluation and control plan on the supply chain in the context of suppliers/product  safety and environmental risk in accordance with the European directives CE* and REACH*.  Qualification audits seek to evaluate whether suppliers comply with or continue to respect our rules and this  may or may not result in their qualification and integration in our supplier group. Further to these audits, various  improvement and correction actions were implemented in conjunction with suppliers. In the case of international suppliers, the International Trade Department is responsible for the international  supplier qualification and evaluation programme, applicable in the process to select potential suppliers, as well as  in the process to qualify the current supplier base. The qualification and selection audits applicable to international  suppliers are based on a questionnaire with 286 questions, grouped into 20 sections. The number of audited  international suppliers has increased year after year. Since 2009 the amount registered is 1.244 audited suppliers,  located at over 30 different countries.  International Trade Management Audits (2011)  116 suppliers subject to selection audits  114 suppliers subject to qualification audits  10% active suppliers  Total relative proportion of suppliers audited as value of purchases: 12%  Relative proportion of international suppliers audited as value of purchases: 26.32%  22 suppliers audited with level C (not acceptablel) – 11% of those audited * See Glossary  79 Food area audits  In view of the nature of our activity, the food area is worthy of particular mention and the rate of supplies of this  type subject to audit is thus significant, standing at around 72%, in 2011. Notwithstanding, last year we extended  the scope of the supplier audits to other areas, having audited around 3% of suppliers from the textile area and 1%  of electronics suppliers Continente Producers Club In 2011 we saw to an alteration of the name of the Sonae Producers Club to Continente Producers Club (CPC).  Created in 1998 with a view to promoting the national products in accordance with high quality and safety  standards, CPC supports members in consistent, structured fashion. The producers thus have ensured a route for  the runoff of its production, with Sonae having the certainty that it is offering its clients Portuguese products of  tried and tested origin and quality. The basic principles of the Continente Producers Club are:   Planning: promotes the runoff of national production by optimising production capacity, technical support and  access to miscellaneous protocols;   Certification: ensures the standardisation of the quality and food safety of products, promotes the self-appraisal  of production system, communicates and discusses future challenges of the market, ensures traceability to the  consumer and promotes environmental responsibility;   Knowledge sharing: analyses the production systems and the national production needs, the consumer profile,  market trends and the commercialisation strategy, promotes the innovation of products and processes, training  and information, with fluidity of communication, bearing in mind a common goal – competitiveness. In 2011, the Continente Producers Club was certified by SGS, complying with the requirements laid down in the  Technical Specifications of the Continente Producers Club. This specification, unique on the market, recognises the  innovative nature of this association and reveals a proactive attitude vis--vis clients, demonstrating high, tried and  tested quality and safety standards. This certification has recognised the commitment to an ongoing improvement  policy of the Continente Producers Club so as to combine the wealth of genuinely national products with the great  strength of a hypermarket chain with millions of consumers nationwide. 2009 2010 2011 70.9% 86.3% 63.0% 70.4% 74.6% 75.7% Percentage of national suppliers audited Percentage of foreign suppliers audited Evolution of percentage  of food area suppliers audited 90% 77.6% 70.8% 72.4% 2009 2010 2011 80% 70% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 60% 0% Evolution of percentage of national  and international food area suppliers audited 100% 90% 80% 70% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 60% 0%  Main figures: 244 members 2,974 Individual Producers 176 Million  in purchases from Club members (5% up on the 2010 figure) Evolution of the purchases value from members of the Continente Producers Club (millions euros) In 2011 the Continente Producers Club was represented at various events whereof we would highlight:   PORTO.COME II in the Edifcio da Alfndega (former Customs Building) which was aimed at promoting the tips and  tastes of the North of Portugal;  Mega Pic-Nic Continente held in Lisbon which 500,000 visitors went through;   Flavours Market with around 35 thousand participants and whereby Producers from the Algarve and the  Alentejo distributed 1.2 tonnes of products.   Flavours Market Continente II staged in Lisbon;    Over 60 producers stands of the Continente Producers Club allowed national delicacies to be tried and tasted at  various events. In the context of this programme we are also developing the Continente Producers Club Innovation Award which is  already in its 2nd year where we distinguish members for their commitment to and compliance with Retail policies. Fishing Sustainability Policy Under the Fishing Sustainability Policy published in 2009 we assumed the commitment to promote the non- -commercialisation of threatened species as well as to select their suppliers in accordance with the fishing methods  used in order to contribute to the protection of marine biodiversity.  In addition, Fishing Sustainability Policy has defined, monitored objectives with a view to minimising the fishing  effects on the diversity of some species which are under threat or under extinction.  In 2011 we invested in the following actions:   Raising awareness of cod suppliers so that they are certified by MSC – Certified Sustainable Seafood*;  Major increase in the total volume of purchases on the fish market compared with 2010;  68% reduction in the commercialisation volume of Guinean sole;  13% reduction in the commercialisation volume of Red Fish;  27% reduction in the commercialisation volume of White Scabbard Fish;  23% reduction in the commercialisation volume of Flounder;  48% increase in the commercialisation volume of Hake caught using the Hooking method.

In this regard, in 2011 we saw the  implementation and consolidation of a series of activities so as to ensure compliance with our commitments in  this regard. Product Safety In the Retail area we verify whether the national and international suppliers have certifications of food management  and/or quality management systems (ISO* 9001, ISO 22000, IFS, BRC, inter alia). In 2011, in the Food Retail area, the following initiatives were undertaken with regard to product safety: Supplier management:    Audits of suppliers of acceptance of European Union suppliers certified in Food Safety Systems and/or Quality  Management Systems;    Audits carried out on the stores Continente, Continente Modelo and Continente Bom Dia by outsourced entities  such as external Laboratories and Vets by Quality Technicians and the Food Safety Audit Directorate. Product handling/quality:   Microbiological analyses carried out on surfaces and equipment where food products are handled at the Stores of  said 3 brands;  Microbiological analyses of the store products handled at the 3 Continente brands;   Microbiological and physical-chemical analyses carried out on Continente brand products either for their launch  onto the market or routine (complying with an annual, predefined schedule); and   Laboratory analyses on Private Label product safety so as to ensure their compliance before making available for sale.  Product labelling:   Private Label product labelling complies with various requirements so as to ensure safety, their proper use,  information about the products appropriate destination* at the end of their working life and information about  the post-sale service.  Sustainable products – Specific requirements of each product type   The food products are endowed with miscellaneous additional information about various aspects:   nutritional composition – by means of the nutritional traffic light;   allergens;   preparation and storage;   Seal of the Portuguese Cardiology Foundation A healthy choice and also  Prova dos 5 logo.   In the textile area there is mandatory control of substances which may generate an environmental or social  impact and safe use of the product to ensure that they fall within the required limitations. Also in this area we  give preference to suppliers that hold Oeko-Tex* certification which ensures the absence of substances which  are harmful to health and the environment, with the tests being carried out in random fashion on the presence  of forbidden substances. All the catalogues of the textile brands continued to be produced on paper with FCS  certification (Forest Stewardship Council)*.   In the field of Childcare, the information is marked on the products and on their labels, respecting the standards  and alerting consumers, in particular, about safety issues during use   In the Footwear area we maintained part of the range with Biocalce Certification*, highlighted on a label placed on  the items.  * See Glossary  83   In the Sports, area all products have maintenance instructions for the items on the labels and/or on the packaging.  All our pamphlets have the PEFC seal (Programme for Endorsement of Forest Certification)*, which ensures that  it is a product originating in forests with sustainable forest management and controlled sources.   In the field of Electrical Appliances and Consumer Electronics, the products are subject to an initial assessment  whose objective is to ensure compliance with the mandatory internal/external requirements including, inter alia,  certifications such as standard ISO 9001 and the information requirements on the packaging which include an  indication that all the packaging material is recyclable and an indication, through signs, as to which ecopoint is  appropriate for the packaging waste. In addition, there is an assessment of requirements related with energy  efficiency, electrical safety, electromagnetic compatibility as well as the requirements of the RoHS* directives  (heavy metals) and REACH (hazardous substances)*. Compliance with the requirements minimises the impacts  that our products may have in terms of the health and safety of their users. Private Label products As regards Private Label we would highlight the following launches in 2011:    Launch of the new First Price Brand –  Continente: In order to provide help with budget management of  Portuguese families with an assurance of trustworthy products at lower prices, in 2011 we created a new brand for  products with first price positioning and the Continente brand.   Relaunch of the MYLABEL Beauty Brand: There was an overhaul of the MYLABEL brand image, making it  more modern, up-to-date and appealing, repositioning the products of this market segment in accordance  with their quality.  Consumer electronics (Worten and Vobis) In 2011 we carried out several initiatives in the field of Consumer Electronics aligned with the three operating axes  we have defined: a) To promote environmental citizenship through the incentive to collect and forward WEEE (Waste Electrical and  electronic equipment) We undertook various campaigns related with the protection of the Environment whereof we would like to highlight:      Equipa Worten Equipa (EWE) – In 2011 we collected 5,446 tonnes of WEEE, concerted into the supplying of new  equipment to over 300 Portuguese welfare institutions nationwide with an investment in excess of 320,000  euros. In November and December 2011 Worten launched a special edition of EWE whereby it doubled the support  provided to welfare institutions. In this special edition, instead of the customary 50, for each tonne of old  equipment collected Worten offered 100 in new equipment, having considered 14 institutions from the districts  of Faro, Lisbon, Oporto, Setbal, Viseu and Leiria, with the delivery of 312 new items of equipment. The deliveries  of equipment supplied, from the collection of WEEE from January to October, will be carried out by April 2012.   Recycling of CRT* – Worten challenged the Portuguese to hand in their old TV sets at its stores. With the delivery  of used equipment the client gained a 25 discount on every 250 of the new item in the range of LCDS*, LEDS  and plasmas at the store.    Recycling of large electrical appliances: Under this initiative, by handing in their used electrical appliances (large  electrical appliances), the client acquires a 25 discount on every 250 of value of the new item.   Recycling of photos + IPOD + GPS + Portable DVD Reader: By handing in their used electronic equipment, the  client acquired a 10 discount on every 100 of value of the new item. * See Glossary    Energy Efficiency – Worten once again opted to promote efficient energy consumption, launching the Energy  Efficiency campaign in which it offered immediate discounts on the purchase of washing machines and fridges with  energy classes A+, A++ and A+++ on the basis that the larger the energy class of the product, the larger the discount.    Hi tech recycling – Vobis offered discounts on the acquisition of pamphlet items when handing in an old one for  brochure items.    Inkjet cartridge campaign – Vobis launched a campaign to discount 3 from receipts when handing in used inkjet  cartridges. b) To promote the acquisition of more efficient equipment The aforementioned initiatives, related with CRT monitor recycling (Cathode Ray Tube) and replacement with  LCD monitors, recycling of large electrical appliances and energy efficiency, were initiatives also dedicated to the  acquisition of equipment with better energy efficiency levels.  As regards the percentages of more efficient equipment, year-on-year growth of 7.5% was observed (from 88.5% to  96%) for Class A or Superior items. A reduction was also observed in Class A electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) and an increase in the superior  classes, expressing a tendency towards the acquisition of ever more efficient equipment. By contrast, this situation  indicates that the efforts made by Worten in this area have been effective Percentage of products sold at Worten by energy efficiency class (2011) c)  To promote reuse In 2011, 11,102 inkjet cartridges were recognised, denoting notable year-on-year growth of 162%.  As regards EEE recovery, in 2011 it was observed that a total of 596,083 items were recovered (573,202 customer  items; 22,881 recovered internally and sold at the Outlet), thereby avoiding their potential transformation into WEEE. 2009 2010 A A+ A++ A+++ B C D 2011 Var. 2010/2011 67% 66% 42% -24 p.p. 20% 22% 41% 19 p.p. 1% 1% 10% 9 p.p. 13% 12% 6% -6 p.p. 1% 1 p.p.  85 Reusable bags In 2011 there was a sharp fall of about 59% in the sale of all reusable bags compared with 2010. This reduction  is closely related not only with the negative economic environment experienced in 2011, but also, and first and  foremost, with the alteration to the reusable bag of the APED* (Portuguese Distribution Companies Association)  which, owing to the use of a new, more resistant material, reduced substitution requirements, with its price also  having concurrently increased by 0.1 /unit to 0.7 /unit. By contrast, the sale of Continente reusable bags maintained the growth trend recorded, year after year, since its  introduction into the new stores and in 2011 there was year-on-year growth of 27%. Incentive to Saving by Portuguese families In 2011 we strengthened the low pricing policy, the upshot of a specific commitment by Sonae to be by the side  of Portuguese families in a particularly difficult economic period. Clients in the Retail area benefitted from a 23%  increase in the volume of discounts granted on cards and receipts for a total of 330 million euros.  The volume of discounts resulted in an effective savings for all customers of the Food Retail brands (3.1 millions) and  Specialized Retail, who enjoyed discounts on cards and receipts.

The 2nd strategic cycle was preceded by the 1st strategic cycle7 for the  quarter 2008-2011 which we concluded in 2011. Strategic Cycle  Analysis of internal  and sector data Listening to Sonaecom  stakeholders Analysis of internal key  indicators and external variables,  conclusions about stakeholder  concerns (Sustainability Bureau,  Manager and those responsible  for data quality control) Frontline managers workshop:  definition of guidelines  and commitments. Executive  Committee: approval  of guidelines and commitments 7 Consult previous sustainability reports to obtain more detailed information about the 1st strategic cyle of Sonaecom.  Sustainability Challenges  The conclusions of the stakeholders consultation and the issues identified at internal and sectorial level allowed the  identification of areas to be improved and list the actions needed to achieve the proposed objectives. Seven themes  were identified and defined the three challenges of sustainability in Sonaecom for the next three years: Employees Responsible life To act with our employees, customers, suppliers and business partners in a responsible way.  Ethics Responsible  marketing Supply Chain Privacy  and security Green Life To manage the environmental impacts of our business and make a positive contribution through ICT to the  reduction of the environmental footprint of other organizations and society.  Society E-Life To develop products and services with a high social, economic and environmental value.  Environment  99 2011 In 2011 Sonaecom generated 881.0 million euros, with 685 million euros having been distributed amongst the  employees (13%), State (1%), society (6%), suppliers (77%) and banks (3%). 8 Excludes employees dedicated to equipment sale. 2010 Turnover EBITDA Net  earnings Mobile  clients Revenue from  IT service per  employee 8 Employees 2,073 133.8 3,604.1 41.3 M 194.0 M 920.7 M 2,035 135.3 3,639.4 62.6 M 231.0 M 863.6 M 38% 1.1% 1.0% 51.3% 9.8% -6.2 % 2011 Variation  2011-2010 EMPLOYEES 92,443,327  GOVERNMENT  5,214,735  SOCIETY 41,704,947  BANKS 17,413,176   SUPPLIERS 528,282,278  Wealth distributed Amount distributed  to our stakeholders 685,058,463  Wealth created Client takings 881,019,232  Amount withheld 195,960,769   Responsible Life The Responsible Life sustainability challenge sets out to act with our employees, clients and suppliers in a responsible  way, encompassing five themes: Employees, Ethics, Privacy and Safety, Responsible Marketing and Supply Chain.    Performance appraisal and the actions for career development of employees at Sonaecom constitute one of  most important processes for the organisation. In 2011 our performance management model was revisited so  as to make it more effective and adapted to business requirements. Career development and performance  appraisal (ADDC) evolved into IOP – Improving Our People, deriving from the process implemented throughout  Sonae. In order for the implementation of the new model to be effective, a series of measures was developed,  highlighting the training and certification of all management units with appraisal duties (395 management  units out of a total of more than 2,700 hours of training). The other employees learnt of the new appraisal  model under the e-learning regime. The training hours fell slightly on the 2010 figure (6.9%), attaining a total of 54,144 hours, corresponding to 26.6 hours  of training per employee.

For this reason, certified procedures are in force for the selection and appraisal of suppliers  in accordance with the Environment and Quality Management System.  Case Studies How to awaken the sense of responsibility of employees and make them active agents and committed to the  company information security process? The idea consisted of turning the company employees into Sonaecom agents. A James Bond from the world of  telecommunications entrusted with a highly important mission: to protect information from  external attacks  (such as computer viruses, for example) and to ensure total data security and confidentiality. In order to have success, they had to deploy some arms, essentially full compliance with the standards set out in  the Sonaecom Information Security Policy. Through this campaign, Sonaecom employees were able to understand that their individual day-to-day actions  are vital for compliance with such a wide-ranging mission: to ensure the security of company information. Optimus Mundo To meet the specific requirements of the immigrant community in Portugal, representing 5% of the  population, Optimus launched the Mundo tariff which includes national and international calls. Complementing this, we have created the Minutos Mundo voucher which enables Mundo customers to get top- -ups easily without going to an ATM. Each voucher has a PIN and costs 5 which is converted into a balance  when the Customer activates his PIN.

APCC* Portugal Best Awards 2011 Optimus won the Best Customer Service in Portugal award in all the categories assessed. Optimus Clix was  given the award for the Best Customer Service in the Telecommunications category. Green life The Green Life sustainability challenge sets out to reduce the environmental impact of the business and develop  innovative products and services that help to reduce the footprint of other organisations and society. It should be pointed out that Sonaecom operates in a sector with strong potential to reduce the environmental  impact of its clients and of society as a whole. The services are essentially based on digital technologies, providing  information and communication solutions which promote dematerialisation, the reduction of the impact in terms of  the consumption of natural resources and the consumption of direct and indirect energy.  In 2011, the total consumption of energy associated with Sonaecoms activity stood at 412,962 GJ, 11% down on  2010, corresponding to total GHG emissions of around 37,107 t CO2e. Despite the reduction in energy consumption, there has been an increase in associated GHG emissions owing to the  increase in the carbonic intensity of electricity consumed at the installations, the upshot of more adverse hydrological  conditions, which were borne out by a reduction in renewables in the energy mix of the electricity suppliers of  Sonaecom and the change in the calculation methodology9. If said alterations had not occurred, Sonaecom would  have reduced its GHG Emissions by 8%. During 2011 some initiatives were implemented which allowed a reduction in energy consumption and CO2e emissions,  to wit:   18% reduction in the electricity consumption of Optimus through the modernisation of the GSM North network  (Saving of 5,069,171 kWh which is equivalent to 1,191 tCO2);  Reduction in energy consumption of the computer pool (Saving of 526,000 kWh which is equivalent to 124tCO2);   LED* lighting at Optimus stores (Saving of 102,272 kWh which is equivalent to 24tCO2);  Energy Efficiency at the Pblico installations (Saving of 111,400 kWh which is equivalent to 45tCO2).

By 2010 we only used the emission  factor of EDP Universal Service when determining the emissions associated with electricity. In 2011, and in order to be more accurate, in addition to the EDP Universal Service  component which supplied around 60% of energy, we included the component supplied by EDP Comercial. * See Glossary  103 In 2011 the total waste produced by Sonaecom suffered a very significant reduction of around 18%. As regards waste,  the recovery percentage stood at 70.1%, there having been a reduction justified by the fact that the SUW of the NS  and MSC installations of Senhora da Hora are now collected and routed to a landfill by a private company.  Case Studies WisEnergy This Optimus Connect solution, in partnership with LMIT, Innovation & Technology, is aimed at companies in the  industrial and services sectors and it sets out to support strategies designed to increase energy efficiency, the  sustained reduction in consumption and the efficiency of buildings and infrastructures. The whole service would  not work out without being based on communications, with major requirements in the data acquisition process. This differentiating product represents a change in model when comparing to the traditional form of energy  management and it involves a series of opportunities in terms of the optimization and efficiency, which  meets current company requirements. From the perspective of the corporate client, a potential saving in the energy invoice of 15% to 20% is  envisaged without resorting to second investments and, consequently, a reduction in CO2 emissions.

Sonaecom recognises the importance of the role of Telecommunications and Information Technologies in the  improvement in social inclusion, the assignment of power to people and the stimulation of a knowledge society. Based on this premise, e-life was defined as a strategic mainstay which is based on the commitment to develop  products and services with an impact on the quality of life of people and which seeks to meet three objectives:   To ensure access for all clients regardless their age, capacity, language, culture and literacy in information technologies  through the development of products and services with a high social and environmental value;   To contribute to an increase in those activities which generate economic value in the local community (local  recruitment, investments in the community, local suppliers etc.);  To make ICT into an innovation factor and contribute to the information society. SMILE – Community Intervention Programme This programme intends to contribute to literacy, to wit Information and Communications Technologies  (ICT), ensuring access and training civilian society in the use of ICT, regardless the age, incapacity, language,  culture and literacy in ICT. Smile Operating areas:   Smile Competncias (Competencies): Involvement and support to the community through what are our  professional skills as a Company – ICT.

Centred on the user and focused on prevention, this service sets out to monitor users in permanent, effective  and economically advantageous way, in particular those suffering from chronic illnesses. The solution, which  intends to find answers in the context of an aging population, is based on communication between machines  for remote monitoring of the elderly, allowing the early diagnosis and prevention of risk situations, as well as a  more efficient management of care provision and an improvement in the response capacity of health units. With the implementation of One Care, trips to the Health Centre can be reduced by up to 40% and the number  of calls made directly to the Health Centre by around 30%. The pilot-project was started in 2011 in partnership with the Family Health Unit CelaSade, in Coimbra, which  involved the installation of the One Care solution at 5 homes, monitoring 7 users aged between 30 and 92. Project K – The corporate responsibility of Optimus Since 2010, Optimus has developed a corporate responsibility programme based on the supply and offer to  special public groups of all-in telecommunications solutions.  The programme allows distances to be cut through the intelligent deployment of new technologies,  simultaneously contributing to education and the fight against infoexclusion and promoting the responsible  and correct use of equipment, which it provides to such a special public group. This programme derives from partnerships between Optimus, Acreditar, SOL Association, Gil Foundation and  Salvador Association. By the end of 2011, Optimus had provided 69 latest generation laptops with Kanguru  mobile Internet, free communications and maintenance support. About 21 thousand hours use of this  equipment and communications by users from the organizations was recorded, which generated 1,278 GB,  accounting for around 32 thousand euros.  * See Glossary  The success of our activity involves the constant appraisal of the interaction between economic, social  and environmental objectives. We believe that this balance is vital for the sustained development of the  company. We continue to be an international reference for sustainability in the Shopping Centre sector as  was borne out recently by our funds being ranked as the most sustainable in Europe in accordance with the  Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark.

A report  from the International Energy Agency highlights that switching to efficient lighting could cut the worlds  electricity bill by 10% and save 16,000 megatonnes of CO2 in the years up to 2030. Improving electricity efficiency is one of Sonae Sierras public commitments, and with this in mind Luz del  Tajo in Spain recently introduced an innovative measure to avoid wasteful consumption.  The team identified that lighting was not needed in the shopping centres lifts when they were not in use, and  therefore decided to install presence sensors that would automatically switch the lights on and off. Fluorescent  light bulbs were also substituted by more efficient LED bulbs by the maintenance contractor, Schindler. The team calculated that the hours of operation would drop from 22 hours a day (on average) to eight hours;  representing savings of almost 7,000kWh per year. This is equivalent to the annual electricity consumption  of a large household, and allows us to save costs of 1,386 per year after a payback period of 3.2 years to  cover the investment costs – a major accomplishment considering that this is achieved through changes to  three lifts and four hoists! All light bulbs that need replacing at Luz del Tajo will from now on be substituted with LED light bulbs. Efficient equipment and creative campaigning save water at GranCasa Sonae Sierras shopping centres in Spain are among the most water efficient in the portfolio – using 2.3 litres  of water on average per visit in 2011. GranCasa decided to implement a programme to reduce visitors water  consumption in the shopping centre even further by acting on two different fronts: awareness raising and  technical measures. Between March and June 2011, the shopping centre organised five campaigns, at a total investment of  2,130. With the theme of saving water in everyday activities, these campaigns used different media such  as awareness messages; television; leaflets with water saving tips and even a competition to incentivize  shopping centre visitors to take shorter showers. Furthermore, improvement works being undertaken in the  shopping centre toilets were seen as an opportunity to procure and install waterless urinals which would allow  significant water savings. These works arose, however, some challenges: the work had to be done outside of  business hours and the necessary investment had to fit within our existing budget. We were able to complete  the work by spreading it between January and September 2011 and by rationalising costs, managing to fund  the whole project for 7,000 in total.  Overall in 2011, GranCasa reduced its total water consumption by 0.5% in comparison with 2010.   111 GaiaShopping mobilizes the local community to protect the forests Forest fires can cause extensive damage to human life and the natural environment. In Portugal, where forest  cover occupies around 38% of the total land surface and various forest products are important contributors  to the export market, forest fires present a significant risk and can be devastating. Like other shopping centres which have a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) in place, in 2011 GaiaShopping in  Portugal held a discussion with CAP members on the International Year of the Forest. Inspired to take action  to protect local woodlands, the CAP members decided to work together to reforest an area that had been  previously burned down in a forest fire. With little budget and a lot of people to involve, the GaiaShopping team made great efforts to organise the  reforestation day. The nature conservation organization Quercus, which is represented on the GaiaShopping  CAP, identified the area where the work should be done and advised on the particular species which should be  planted taking into account the conditions of the soil and climate, and the need to mitigate the risk of forest  fires from spreading in the future. A total of 53 people volunteered, including staff from tenants shops and  shopping centre service suppliers and representatives from local entities which are part of the GaiaShopping  CAP, such as the forestry department, local firemen, the local council and charitable organizations which  support social and environmental causes. The day was a great success. Everyone collaborated as a team and all stakeholders involved were very  pleased to have the opportunity to make a positive contribution to their community and the environment.  Engagement with suppliers at Le Terrazze brings positive results  In January 2010, we began the construction at Le Terrazze in Italy. With 38,600 m2 of Gross Lettable Area  (GLA), 80% of which is already let, Le Terrazze will be the biggest shopping centre in La Spezia province.  Since the beginning of the construction works, we have been implementing our SHEMS on site to reduce risks  for workers and the community, and lower our impact on the environment. We have faced several difficulties:  on a practical side, the relatively small size of the site made it difficult to store some materials or install some  equipment needed to implement the good practices prescribed by the SHEMS, and the characteristics of  the site made it prone to flooding. We also had to challenge the conventional habits and attitudes of our  suppliers, presenting SHE practices which were new to them. All worked hard to solve these challenges, rationalising the available space, implementing water run-off  improvements and continuously engaging with our suppliers and assessing their SHE performance. We  delivered extensive training every month, totalling 1,876 man hours since 2010, to ensure that all new staff  were appropriately informed about different SHE aspects. The water and power consumption and waste production associated with construction activities were monitored  and considerable efforts were made to minimise the amount of waste sent to a landfill. For example, the soil  removed from the construction site was used for nearby areas construction works and waste separation was  improved thanks to clearer instructions on waste compactors. The team installed a rainwater collection system  to spray roads for dust prevention and reused water to wash trucks. A series of measures were adopted to minimise safety risks and hazards and carried out observation  exercises every month to establish and report on potential non-conformities with Sonae Sierras SHEMS. After inspecting the construction site in July 2011, auditors from Lloyds Register Quality Assurance  recommended Le Terrazze for ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certification, and Le Terrazze became the first  construction site in the world to simultaneously obtain this double certification.  113 On-going commitments to investing in education benefits over 70 students in Brazil Investment in education is recognized as an important factor in the reduction of social problems. It increases  the opportunities that citizens have to enter the labour market, broadens their perspectives and strengthens  both personal and professional values. Two of Sonae Sierras shopping centres in Brazil have implemented a pioneering programme that offers free  classes to the public and the possibility for students to complete their high school graduation. The idea was  developed by Shopping Metrpole which had identified the need to empower employees and service providers  who had the potential and willingness to learn, but were unable to complete their studies owing to financial  limitations, a lack of family support or their working hours. In 2006, Metrpole Educa was launched. Based on this model, Shopping Penha set up the Penha Educa  programme in December 2008. Access to the programme was extended to local residents after a survey  conducted by the centre indicated that there was also an interest and demand for this type of scheme in the  community. Since its implementation, Shopping Penha has invested more than R$175,000 (75,360) in the  programme. This covers classroom infrastructure; furniture; audio-visual resources; the periodic purchase of  educational materials such as books and school supplies; the contract with the department for industrial social  services (SESI) for the payment of qualified teachers; an academic advisor and the organization of graduation  and publicity. The approximate annual investment is R$56,000 (24,110). Both Shopping Metrpole and Shopping Penha point to the testimonials of its students as evidence of the  success of the project. Many of them have stated that they feel more prepared for the labour market, have greater self-esteem and are  highly motivated to continue; with a good number of students staying on to complete the second level of studies.  This year the Metrpole Educa programme enrolled an initial class of 18 students and a second group of 15  students are preparing for graduation. Currently there are 38 students enrolled in the Penha Educa programme.  Stimulating creativity and initiative to build a culture of innovation  Sonae Sierra believes that innovation training can bring real benefit to the business. CLICK (Creative Learning, Innovation and Continuous Knowledge) is a programme designed to enhance Sonae  Sierras innovation capacity. First launched in 2009 with a focus on developing creativity, in 2011 we held the  second part of the programme, CLICK2, to promote an initiative with the strapline Become the change you  want to see. It is our view that combining creativity with initiative is the formula for creating innovation.  The content of the CLICK2 programme was developed by the Innovation Office, in co-operation with Sonae  Sierras Human Resources Department and sponsored by the CEO and all Executives. It consisted of one day  workshops in small groups and was facilitated by Sonae Sierras own Innovation Champions, selected staff  from all business functions and levels who have been trained by external consultants to deliver the programme.   CLICK2 received good feedback from employees at all levels of the business, with an 84% participation rate  and an average evaluation of 3.7 on a scale of 1 to 4. It also increased the satisfaction and motivation of the  Innovation Champions and allowed them to work closely with people from other departments to share their  knowledge about innovation and help embed an innovation culture across our organization.

In case of doubt or misinterpretation the Portuguese version will prevail) To the Executive Board of Directors of  SONAE S.G.P.S., S.A.   Introduction 1. We have been engaged by the Executive Board of Directors of Sonae S.G.P.S., S.A. (Sonae) to  provide limited assurance on the sustainability information included in the Sustainability Report  2011 (the Report) of Sonae for the year ended 31 December of 2011.   Responsibilities 2.   The Executive Board of Directors of Sonae is responsible for:   The preparation and presentation of the sustainability information included in the Report in  accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (G3.1) of the Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI), as described in the chapter "Our Report" in the Sustainability Report and  for the information and assertions contained within it; and,   For establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management and internal control  systems from which the reported performance information is derived.   3.   Our responsibility is to perform a limited assurance engagement and to express a conclusion  based on the work performed. We conducted our engagement in accordance with International  Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits  or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and  Assurance Standards Board. That Standard requires that we comply with applicable ethical  requirements, including independence requirements, and that we plan and perform the  engagement to obtain limited assurance whether nothing came to our attention that causes us to  conclude that the sustainability information included in Annual Report for the year ended 31  December 2011, is not free from material misstatement.   Scope 4. A limited assurance engagement on a sustainability report consists of making inquiries,  primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and  applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate. These procedures  included:    Inquiries of management to gain an understanding of Sonae processes for determining the  material issues for Sonae key stakeholders groups;    117 2  Interviews with relevant staff, at corporate and business units, responsible for providing the  sustainability  information in the Report;    Comparing the information presented in the Report to corresponding information in the  relevant underlying sources to determine whether all the relevant data derived from such  underlying sources has been included in the Report; and   Reading the information presented in the Report to conclude if it is in line with our overall  knowledge of, and experience with, the sustainability performance of Sonae.   5. The extent of evidence gathering procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement is  less than that for a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore a lower level of assurance is  provided. Consequently, it does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware  of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit or a reasonable assurance  engagement. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or a reasonable assurance  conclusion.  Conclusion 6.  Based on the procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that  causes us to believe that the sustainability information included in the Report of Sonae for the  year ended 31 December 2011 is not presented fairly, in all material respects with the  Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (G3.1) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as described  in the chapter "Our report" of the Sustainability Report.   7.  Our limited assurance report is made solely to Sonae in accordance with the terms of our  engagement. Our work has been prepared only with the objective of reporting to Sonae those  matters for which we were engaged in this limited assurance report and for no other purpose.  We do not accept or assume responsibility to any third party than Sonae for our work, for this  limited assurance report, or for the conclusions we have reached.

EN26: Initiatives to mitigate the environmental impacts of products and services and the degree of impact reduction Sonae promotes various initiatives to mitigate the environmental impacts associated with products and services. Worthy of special mention is the commitment to the production of renewable energies with the installation of  microgeneration and minigeneration plants which in 2011 registered year-on-year growth of 42%. The acquisition  of a more efficient fleet with a view to improving the vehicle pool which complies, as a minimum, with Standard  Euro 4 that at year-end 2011 represented 5 p.p. growth on the previous year (Further information in chapter 3.1.3 –  Environmental Responsibility). The range of sustainable products on offer to consumers is also a concern in the Retail area. Since 2009 Sonae has  promoted the Fishing Sustainability Policy with the commitment not to commercialise endangered species and  select those suppliers that promote the protection of marine biodiversity. This policy sets out specific objectives  with a view to minimising the effects on the diversity of some species which are endangered or at risk of extinction.  In 2011 Worten registered a reduction in Class A electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) (down 24 p.p.) and an  increase in the higher classes of A+, A++, A+++ (up 19 p.p, 9 p.p and 1 p.p, respectively). As regards the sale of  reusable bags, two types are commercialised, APED bags and Continente bags. In 2011 the APED bags recorded  a sharp fall in sales related with the use of a new material which led to an increase in the price per unit. The  Continente bags maintained their sales trend, recording growth of 27% on the 2010 figure (Further information  in chapter 3.1.6 – Sustainable Products).

From the time  of installation of a new unit, it is necessary to proceed with all contacts with local authorities and entities to obtain  the permits and licenses and ensure the conditions, so as to cause a minimum negative impact on the communities.  During the operation numerous initiatives are undertaken to support the communities at a central level and through  each brand, promoting well-being and social cohesion in the communities. These are very often carried out in  partnership with local entities. Information about these initiatives and examples will be described in the report. SO2: Percentage and total number of business units which are subject to the analysis of corruption risks In its risk management process Sonae implements the international methodology Enterprise Risk Management –  Integrated Framework (COSO), which allows the identification of the different types of risks and threats to business  development both strategically and operationally.

The Code of Conduct and Ethics in the Retail area also takes  this risk into account and no case has been reported. For further information about the risk management process –  vide chapter about risk management and internal audit. SO3: Percentage of employees who have carried out training in the anticorruption policies and practices   of the organisation Although the corruption risk is not regarded as a priority risk for the business, in 2011 7,586 employees, not managers,  received training related with anticorruption policies or procedures.

Similarly to last year, the matter of the opening of hypermarkets on  Sundays remains. Worthy of special mention is the participation of Sonae in the Global Enterprise Project of ERT  (European Round Table) /JA (Junior Achievement)  The Global Enterprise Project is an organisation which brings together the main European business leaders and one  of the great benefits of participation in this organisation is the capacity to influence education so as to incorporate  the overall business context and entrepreneurialism in school CVs.
