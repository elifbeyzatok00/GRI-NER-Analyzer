Additionally there are also forums where  employees can approach the highest  authority to get their issues/concerns raised.   4.   the elimination of  all  forms of forced  and  compulsory labour  We do not practice Forced Labour in any  form. Holding back the original document  and any other personal property of the  persons hired is prohibited, and clearly  defined in the HR policy manual of the Moser  Baer.    Our philosophy behind the HR Policies and  Labour Practices are to avoid any kind of  harassment of workforce.    Not a single case of Child Labour, forced  labour and discrimination has been reported  till now. The same has also been endorsed by  various external auditing agencies during  Statutory & Regulatory Compliance audit.  This shows the effectiveness of  implementation of these policies.

We  follow various transparent systems that  encourage employees to take part in decision  making and ensure fairness and affirmative  action. Regional diversity in hiring the  employees also depicts non discrimination in  the recruitment.  7.   Businesses should  support a  precautionary  approach to  environmental  challenges  For Moser Baer, addressing environmental  concerns and stakeholders needs  simultaneously is the key towards sustainable  development. Environment, health and  safety (EHS) are an integral part of Moser  Baer and focus on building a robust culture  of EHS by involving employees at all  verticals. EHS also encompasses other  environmental issues like improving energy  efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emission  and use of renewable energy. Our EHS  department is responsible for implementing  EHS policy across plant locations. We have  environment management systems, certified  by international bodies, conforming to ISO  14001 and OHSAS 18001.

Businesses should  We  believe,  conducting  ethnical  business Pages 17-18     work against all  forms of  corruption,  including  extortion and  bribery  requires adequate consideration to a number of  issues outside the traditional scope of making  money, of which building an ethical & values  based culture is most certainly one. Therefore,  a lot of emphasis is laid on conducting  ethical business with the stakeholders to  develop  mutual  trust  and  long  term  relationships. To achieve the same, there are  stringent systems in place to check the  unethical practices and behaviours and  ensure corruption free environment. To  consistently reinforce our core values related  to anticorruption, every associate of our  organization carries  a Values booklet,  which clearly articulates Acceptable and  Not Acceptable behaviours to ensure clear  understanding of what they mean in the  organizational context.
