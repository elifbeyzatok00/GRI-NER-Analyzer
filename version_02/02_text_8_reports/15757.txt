Statement by the CEO    At Energinet.dk we believe that the future energy will be green.   The world as we know it is about to change. Within a few decades societies  across the world will transform their energy systems and base them entirely on  renewable energy sources. The prospect of climate change, strained access to  fossil fuels and a need to explore growth in future oriented technologies have  spurred a green transition worldwide. In Denmark, the goal is reaching energy  consumption based 100 % on renewable energy by 2050. Within just 8 years  half of all electricity consumption in Denmark will be powered by wind turbines.   A transition of this scale holds substantial challenges. Efficiently exploiting re- newable energy sources, maintaining a secure energy supply, and expanding  the concept of the energy system will be addressed by smart solutions and an  intelligent, robust and inter-connected energy system. We believe that Ener- ginet.dk has a responsibility in contributing to drive the green transition along- side other players of the energy sector, and we are highly motivated to do so.     When Energinet.dk operates the energy infrastructure, develops sustainable  energy facilities and carries out strategic planning of the future energy system,  we strive to ensure that our conduct is sustainable. Essentially, we observe our  social responsibility by for instance carefully balancing costs of large scale pro- jects and the societal value derived there-of, by showing consideration for citi- zens that are directly affected by our facilities through on-going dialogue, and  through close monitoring of the environmental impact of our activities.    Energinet.dks employees are equipped to deliver the solutions to the massive  challenges our society will be facing in the coming years. Apart from having  excellent technical skills, Energinet.dks employees have a mindset driven by  values of responsibility and propriety, which keeps our company at its toes at  all times. It is the core muscle of our corporate culture and it is the prerequisite  for Energinet.dks ability to perform the tasks that we have been entrusted.    In order for us as a company to project the change, we strive to bring about in  this world, we aim to walk the talk in the way we run our business. Clear  guidelines for company conduct are necessary through policies and best prac- tice, as are a substantial insight into the supply chain and vendor credentials as  well as the environmental impact of the companys activities. Since 2009 Ener- ginet.dk has committed to supporting the ten principles of UN Global Compact,  which also guide our corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Specific  CSR objectives have been identified within the areas of employees, climate &  environment and procurement. We continuously evaluate how we measure,  track and develop our companys CSR efforts in order to maintain a strong  sense of responsibility and awareness. Working with CSR in a systematic way  these past three years has helped us do this, and will continue to do so in the  future.     I hope you will enjoy reading our third progress report to the UN Global Com- pact.     Peder . Andreasen, CEO   Dok. 21740/12, Sag 12/183    4/19  2.  Energinet.dk – A brief introduction    Energinet.dk is an independent public enterprise owned by the Danish state  represented by the Danish Ministry of Climate, Energy and Building. Our mis- sion and vision are as follows:     Mission   As the entity responsible for the electricity and natural gas systems, we own the  main energy infrastructure, ensure reliable energy supply and create the  framework for well-functioning energy markets and effective integration of re- newable energy.     Vision   Using international and preferably market-based solutions, we will facilitate the  increased use of renewable energy and help to solve the global energy and cli- mate challenges.    Energinet.dks main responsibilities in the electricity and gas markets are to:    Maintain overall security of supply in the short and long term    Develop the main Danish electricity and gas infrastructure    Create objective and transparent conditions for competition on the energy  markets and monitoring that competition works    Carry out coherent and holistic planning involving future transmission capacity  requirements and long-term security of supply    Support environmentally friendly power generation as well as the develop- ment and demonstration of technologies for environmentally friendly energy  generation    Calculate the environmental impact of the energy system as a whole.    We own the gas transmission network, the 400 kV electricity transmission grid  and the 132 kV grid in northern Zealand. The Enterprise co-owns electricity  interconnections to the Nordic countries and Germany and has the Danish elec- tricity transmission grid above 100 kV at its disposal. Energinet.dk also owns  Lille Torup natural gas storage facility. Additionally, Energinet.dk co-owns Euro- pean Market Coupling Companies as well as power exchanges for electricity and  gas.    Energinet.dks finances are based on a break-even principle. The primary  source of income is in the form of tariffs. In 2011 the gross revenue was DKK  7.369 billion and the profit DKK 128 million. The balance sheet total by the end  of 2011 was DKK 22.507 billion and the equity DKK 5.669.      For a further introduction to Energinet.dk we recommend our annual report  2011 and our website www.energinet.dk.             Dok. 21740/12, Sag 12/183    5/19  3.  Strategy, governance and engagement    3.1  Introduction to CSR in general  Energinet.dk is a public enterprise entrusted to perform our tasks from a holistic  and social perspective taking security of supply, economy, the environment and  efficient energy markets into consideration. Working with corporate social re- sponsibility is a natural extension hereof.    We view our corporate social responsibility from three levels of perspective; the  role of Energinet.dk as facilitator of The green transition, enabling 100% re- newable energy in the energy system by 2050. Focus on sustainability in con- duct associated with Energinet.dks core activities, ensuring the company walks  the talk and make a sensible difference through business driven CSR. The per- spective of company mindset refers to those minor initiatives in-house, that  reinforces the corporate culture of responsibility and propriety.    The green transition  In Denmark, there is broad political consensus for reducing the emission of  greenhouse gases significantly through increased utilization of renewable ener- gy. The plan by the Danish Government, "Our Future Energy" published in  2011, seeks to spur green growth and facilitate the enabling of converting to  100% renewable energy use in Denmark by 2050. By 2020, the initiatives laid  out in the plan will lead to extensive reductions in energy consumption, ena- bling half of the countrys electricity consumption to be covered by wind power.  Energinet.dk will play a central role in this transition.     In 2011, Energinet.dk presented a new corporate strategy for 2012 – 2015,  addressing the challenges of integrating and supporting a substantial increase  of wind power in to the energy supply system in both the short, medium and  long term. As the transmission system operator, Energinet.dk is responsible for  integrating renewable energy sources into the mix without compromising the  security of energy supply. In 2011, 28% of the electricity consumption was  covered by wind power without a single black out in the transmission grid.    Energinet.dks large scale projects that are at the core of this transition are  further described on www.energinet.dk.     To walk the talk  Energinet.dk is dedicated to reflect our sense of responsibility to society in the  way we operate our business, to walk the talk so to speak, as a large scale  contractor, employer and purchaser. We do this by keeping in mind the UN  Global Compacts ten principles when going about our daily business. The wel- fare and fundamental rights of the approx. 600 Energinet.dk employees are  naturally a vital focal point to the management and strategy of the enterprise,  as are environmental considerations in all activities, big and small.   Clear guidelines for company conduct are put in place through policies and best  practice, as are a substantial insight into the supply chain and vendor creden- tials as well as the environmental impact of the companys activities.       Dok. 21740/12, Sag 12/183    6/19  Company mindset  A fundamental sense of responsibility and propriety characterises the mindset of  Energinet.dks employees and is supported by our corporate values1. As an in- dependent public enterprise, responsible for the secure energy supply in Den- mark, it is essential to be sensitive to the responsibilities, framework and au- thorizations of our particular business.     For Energinet.dk, the company mindset constitutes the very fabric of our license  to operate, as it determines how we conduct our business. Therefore, even mi- nor initiatives are encouraged in order to support a culture of sustainability and  responsibility, for instance by installing energy-efficient lightning bulbs at our  office facilities, changing printer configurations to reduce paper waste, etc.   Furthermore, a responsible mindset is addressed by including CSR in the com- panys business case templates, as part of internal training courses for project  management, etc.    3.2  Engaging with stakeholders  Energinet.dk allocates substantial resources for engaging in dialogue with vari- ous stakeholders ranging from local citizens to enterprises, NGOs, universities  and governmental institutions. We host several stakeholder groups of which the  Advisory Stakeholder Forum is the largest. The Advisory Stakeholder Forum is  appointed by the Danish Minister for Climate, Energy and Building and consists  of 23 representatives from various organisations, including the electricity, gas  and heat sectors, consumers, universities and environmental NGOs. Hosting a  stakeholder forum provides us with a valuable opportunity to familiarise our- selves with and evaluate the public opinion of our activities and to take appro- priate action based on the feedback we receive.     Paying attention to local concerns as well as engaging in dialogue with people  directly affected by for instance our building projects is a priority for Ener- ginet.dk. In connection with new and on-going construction projects to establish  new gas or electricity infrastructure, considerable efforts are made to involve  local stakeholders and uphold a high level of communication through informa- tive meetings and dialogue. Concerns by people related to experiencing noise,  magnetic fields, visual impacts, etc. are taken very seriously be Energinet.dk,  and measures are taken to fairly balance and constructively address the ex- pressed concerns.     3.3  Procurement  Code of Conduct  Energinet.dk procures products and services for more than DKK 2 billion every  year. The purchases are wide ranging, from substantial investments in the Dan- ish electricity and gas systems to smaller purchases within administration and  maintenance. Energinet.dks activities are mainly based in Denmark, but we  also participate in large-scale projects with neighbouring countries. Procure- ment wise, the majority of Energinet.dks suppliers are operating in global mar- kets and are often based outside of Denmark.        1 Energinet.dks corporate values: Development, Commitment, Business mindedness,  Responsibility   Dok. 21740/12, Sag 12/183    7/19  In 2009-2010, we implemented Energinet.dks Code of Conduct in connection  with procurement for large-scale construction projects. All new suppliers are  informed of our Code of Conduct and are required to acknowledge their ac- ceptance of it. The Code of Conduct outlines a set of standards that suppliers,  as a minimum are expected to observe. Although we assume responsibility for  instilling the Code of Conduct in the first links of the supplier chain, we also  encourage our suppliers to communicate our Code of Conduct to their suppliers  further down the supply chain.     Sphere of Influence  It is a substantial challenge for Energinet.dk to ensure that the principles of UN  Global Compact are not indirectly violated through the procurement processes  of the enterprise. Frequently policies and systems are reviewed and the Sphere  of Influence is analysed. Our Sphere of Influence can be categorised into  three main groups:    Unique custom made products for Energinet.dk  A substantial part of our procurements can be categorised as unique custom  made products, e.g. offshore transformer platforms, customised cables etc.  Through requirements in public tenders and contract negotiations we experi- ence possibilities to require a supplier focus on CSR.     Industry-specific products  Some procurements are industry-specific products, e.g. transformers and other  electronical devices for our grids. In our experience, it tends to be harder to  make requirements for procurements in this category, as products are more  standardised, there are a large number of buyers, and Energinet.dks order  sizes are typically relatively small compared to other buyers. Energinet.dk is a  member of a Nordic procurement network to address this issue. This network  has implemented a prequalification system for its suppliers. We believe that  collaboration with other companies within the industry will provide us with more  comprehensive information, detailed and qualified audits and the ability to  stand stronger in negotiation with large multinational suppliers.     Mass-manufactured products  Mass-manufactured products are not specific for our industry, e.g. mobile  phones, laptops and other office supply. Because of smaller order sizes it can be  difficult for us to make requirements to these suppliers. We address these is- sues by the use of public reviews and assessments of different suppliers. We do  not perform our own audits of these suppliers.     3.4  Company profile - employees  By the end of 2011 Energinet.dk employed 572 people, mostly college and uni- versity graduates (53%), technicians (20%) and office assistants (12%). Ener- ginet.dk is an enterprise that operates within the field of engineering, which is  traditionally occupied by men. This may explain why the majority of our em- ployees are men (71%). Table 1 gives an overview of the composition of our  workforce.

Composition of employees.      4.  Human Rights    Health – work – life balance  Initiatives to improve health-work-life balance and job satisfaction include our  health scheme and health policy, our retention policy in case of long-term ill- ness, and paid holidays to newly qualified employees. In addition to maternity  leave for women employees, a 12-week paid parental leave is offered to fathers  with children at the age of 0-5 years. We acknowledge that balancing work life  with family life can at times be challenging, and contracts therefore offer flexi- bility in terms of for instance working hours.    Lifestyle diseases related to smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity have  increased in society in recent years resulting in substantial socio-economic  costs. At the individual level employees suffering from lifestyle-related diseases  may experience poorer health, reduced productivity as well as loss of life quali- ty. As Energinet.dk wants to contribute to both preventing and solving this sig- nificant social problem, our employees enjoy the advantage of a nutritionally  balanced lunch scheme, training facilities and annual voluntary health checks.   Dok. 21740/12, Sag 12/183    9/19  4.1  Commitment and policies    UN Global Compact Principles  Energinet.dk policies and key ac- tivities  Businesses should support and re- spect the protection of internationally  proclaimed human rights; and      Health policy    Policy for safety and working envi- ronment    Policy for long term illness     Supplier acceptance of Code of  Conduct    Audits    Cooperation in a Nordic procure- ment network  Make sure that they are not complicit  in human rights abuses.    Supplier acceptance of Code of  Conduct    Audits    Cooperation in a Nordic procure- ment network  Our policies are available at our website Energinet.dk.      Preventive actions  Energinet.dks employees are our most valuable asset and a fundamental pre- condition for accomplishing our tasks and meeting our responsibilities. Conse- quently, their welfare and rights are natural focus areas in the management and  strategy of the enterprise. Both human rights and the rights of workers are  highlighted in The UN Global Compact principles highlights as being crucial are- as for the social responsibility of any enterprise. In Energinet.dks work with  social responsibility, we place particular emphasis on employees conditions and  job satisfaction.    In our Health policy we support activities that proactivly supports the preserva- tion of a good health. Energinet.dk offers its employees a health care scheme,  which comprises a health policy with physical and psychological initiatives and a  retention policy in cases of longterm illness. In this way, we strive to take active  responsibility for a growing social issue of lifestyle-related diseases.     External employees and suppliers  In signing up to the ten UN Global Compact principles, we also show our con- cern for the working conditions in the world around us. This we address in par- ticular through our Code of Conduct for our suppliers. Our collaboration in the  Nordic procurement network is an important driver to achieve our goals.      4.2  Actions and results  During the last years Energinet.dk has focussed on a high level of work satisfac- tion amongst its employees. Motivation, engagement and commitment are im- portant characters to strengthen for a successful result. Table 2 shows the re-  Dok. 21740/12, Sag 12/183    10/19  sult of the latest analysis. It shows that Energinet.dk maintains a very positive  overall level on the European Employee Index (EEI).

This requires an increased focus on technical and personal de- velopment.    Health and safety  Since 2009 we have on a yearly basis conducted analyses of health status  among voluntary employees. Table 3 shows significant improvements since  2009. Also the level of absence due to illness is very low and is expected to be  a result of targeted action to increase the health and well-being of our employ- ees by offering workout facilities, stop smoking courses, and a healthy and var- ied lunch diet.

Dok. 21740/12, Sag 12/183    11/19  In addition to a continued focus on reducing occupational accidents in 2011  there has also been attention to the number of accidents by the external work- force especially at our construction sites. In 2012 we expect to put emphasis on  nearby accidents in order to further strengthen avoidance of accidents (see  Table 4).

Energinet.dk focuses on job satisfaction as well  as personal and professional development of both individuals and teams. Em- ployee development is ensured by methodical job appraisal reviews and per- sonal development plans involving participation in courses on personal and/or  technical subjects. The satisfaction among employees is frequently tested. In  recent years our employees have rated our programmes for personal and pro- fessional development very high compared to the European Employee Index  (see Table 4).

Employee development.      Graduates  At Energinet.dk we want to take action on the increasing unemployment among  young people. We invite graduates fresh out of university to apply for admission  into a two-year graduate programme, in the course of which they will work in  three different departments. Each year a new group of six graduates are ac- cepted into the graduate programme. It offers rotation to different departments  of the enterprise, as well as personal development and technical courses. So  far, more than two thirds of the graduates have subsequently been offered  permanent or temporary positions at Energinet.dk.          Dok. 21740/12, Sag 12/183    13/19  Traineeships  It has become increasingly difficult for young people to find traineeships in  Denmark especially for non-ethnic Danes. Energinet.dk aims at engaging an  increasing number of both ethnic Danes and non-ethnic Danes in the coming  years. Energinet.dk frequently host master thesis students working on different  subjects related to our core tasks. We believe that businesses play an important  role in education of young people.     Gender equality  The proportion of female leaders and executives in Denmark does not reflect  the gender composition in Energinet.dks workforce. There is increasing political  focus on this issue. At Energinet.dk 84 pct. of all leaders are men. Energinet.dk  wants to contribute to addressing this society-specific issue, and we therefore  aim for the number of female leaders and specialists to be directly proportional  to that of the general composition of our staff. We aim to have an increasing  number of female leaders from 15 pct. to 20 pct. and female specialists from 15  pct. to 19 pct. in 2012. We frequently identify the invisible barriers to women's  opportunities for senior positions in Energinet.dk. In addition, we organise spe- cial development programmes for female leadership talents.      6.  Environment    The operation of the Danish electricity and natural gas systems mainly results in  the following activities, which directly or indirectly impact the climate and the  environment:     Transmission losses in the power grid   Environmental impacts in connection with the installation and operation of the  electricity and gas systems   Consumption of heat, electricity and water in offices and facility buildings   Transport energy consumption.    We actively take steps to reduce the environmental impact of all the points  listed above. This may be achieved in several ways, although typically it in- volves reducing consumption, replacing processes or materials with more envi- ronmentally friendly or efficient ones, or consciously selecting a specific tech- nology at the planning stage because it is more environmentally friendly.    In addition there may be environmental impacts from constructing new grid  connections. From 2012-2015 we expect to invest in new infrastructure for  about DKK 14 billion. These construction projects will have an environmental  impact assessment phase and all follow local authorities environmental re- quirements. Moreover the major entrepreneurs and suppliers involved in the  construction projects all have to submit to our ethical code of conduct, which  also includes environmental obligations.

Reduction of transmission loss  As transmission system operator Energinet.dk must reimburse the cost of  transmission loss. The transmission loss is about 1-2 per cent of the total  amount of electricity (132-400 kV) transported in the grid. In absolute figures  the transmission loss has increased from about 800 GWh (GigaWatthours) in  2009 to about 1000 GWh in 2011. In 2010, however, we established a new  connection between Eastern and Western Denmark which caused part of the  increase in transmission loss.     Energinet.dk has continuous focus on reducing the transmission loss. Within the  next three years, however, we wish to strengthen this effort and have set up a  specific target to reduce the overall transmission loss by up to 15% from 2011- 2015 by monetary and technological means. Measures will include improved  procurement of transmission loss, careful dimensioning of new powerlines, cost   Dok. 21740/12, Sag 12/183    15/19  effective management of the grid, etc.. A reduction in transmission loss means  a reduction in compensative energy production and this will be beneficial to the  environment.      Figure 1: Total annual transmission loss (132- 400kV).         Reduction of total lifetime costs  Energinet.dk has set up a target to reduce total lifetime costs of new electricity  transmission projects by 5 pct. compared to 2010 levels. During the current  company strategy period (2012-2015) several initiatives are launched to set up  a method to implement the target. One result will be detailed analysis of all  lifetime costs and cost effective operation and maintenance to be carried out  already in the planning phase of all new projects. The objective is defined by  economic scale, however it is expected that it will be environmentally advanta- geous as well, because reduction of energy consumption and emissions can  come into focus.      Demand/response at our premises  As the transmission system operator, Energinet.dk daily faces the challenge of  balancing production and consumption of both the electricity and gas grid. The  power production from wind farms increases the demand for flexibility in pro- duction and consumption.     In 2012 we will explore the possibility of smart energy use by our cooling sys- tems for office facilities, in order to lower energy use in hours with peak- demand (peak-shaving). In addition Energinet.dk frequently analyses different  measures to add flexible power consumption into own facilities.    Low energy office buildings  During 2011 approximately 100 colleagues moved into their new office building  in Eastern Denmark. The office building is a low-energy construction that com- plies with the strictest of standards. As a particularly environmentally friendly  feature, the roof of the building is covered in a moss-like material, a form of  organic carpet that limits solar thermal stress on the building. A catchment sys-  Dok. 21740/12, Sag 12/183    16/19  tem is installed to collect rainwater for flushing toilets. LED lights illuminate the  building which also has other energy efficient light and heat controlling systems.      Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions  Transporting and maintaining national transmission grids for natural gas and  electricity causes direct and indirect emission of greenhouse gasses. Direct  emissions of greenhouse gasses occur during maintenance of both the electrici- ty and the gas transmission grids (Table 5). Indirect emissions are for example  caused by the use of energy to pump natural gas into the underground gas  storage facility (Table 6).      Figure 2 shows the total annual energy consumption of Energinet.dk excluding  transmission loss. The majority of the energy consumption is in gas transmis- sion and gas storage. The figure shows an overall decrease in absolute energy  consumption since 2009. The decrease reflects both an overall effort to reduce  energy use, and a decrease in the amount of natural gas transported in the  grid. To that effect there are underlying mechanisms not clearly depicted in the  figure. For example the amount of natural gas transported in the grid decreased  from 2010 to 2011 by one-sixth due to less demand and warmer temperatures.             Figure 2. Total annual energy consumption in GJ from 2008-2011.          Dok. 21740/12, Sag 12/183    17/19  The energy consumption causes either direct or indirect emission of CO2. This is  shown in Figure 3 including emission from transport of employees. The CO2  emission is calculated by using the environmental impact statement for the  specific year. It describes the environmental impacts caused by the supply of  one kWh of average electricity. The environmental impact statement covers  average electricity supplies from the transmission grid for which reason losses  in the transmission grid are included. The environmental impact statement for  one kWh electricity varies from year to year due to variation in both production  and amount of renewable energy sources.          Figure 3.

The  objective of the programmes is to develop Danish energy systems, particularly  focusing on the gas and electricity infrastructure, and contributing to setting up  the worlds best renewable energy-based energy system. In this way we help  the Danish government to fulfil its climate targets. Energinet.dk collaborates  with other Danish energy research programmes and research institutes in Den- mark and abroad. Our activities also include the development of the electricity  and gas markets.     We also have a statutory duty to initiate a number of internal research and de- velopment projects with a view to maintaining the high degree of security of  supply, and to developing the electricity and natural gas systems for the benefit  of the environment, society and customers. Through the ForskIN programme,  Energinet.dk implements large and small R&D activities for the development of  the Danish power system, primarily in the electricity sector. This is done in co- operation with external partners and research institutes.      7.  Anti-corruption  At Energinet.dk anti-corruption has high attention caused by the central posi- tion the company has within the Danish energy sector. Energinet.dk has clear  policies for board members, directors and employees, and addresses the issue  in its Code of Conduct for suppliers.    7.1  Commitment and policies    UN Global Compact Principles  Energinet.dk policies and key ac- tivities  Businesses should work against cor- ruption in all its forms, including ex- tortion and bribery.     Policy for insider knowledge      Programme for internal audits     Policy for representation, gifts etc.    Whistleblower programme    Supplier acceptance of Code of  Conduct    Cooperation in a Nordic procure- ment network  Our policies are available at our website www.Energinet.dk.      Insider knowledge  Members of the executive board, board of directors and other employees are  assigned to clear policies concerning insider knowledge. For instance, they are  not allowed to trade with greenhouse gas emission allowances. Stock trading  within the energy industry at the Copenhagen Stock Exchange etc. is strictly  regulated as well in order to prevent the abuse of inside knowledge.       Dok. 21740/12, Sag 12/183    19/19  Programme for internal audits  Energinet.dk has a programme for internal audits to make sure that the busi- ness procedures are in compliance with policies for confidential business infor- mation etc. The programme for internal audits is regulated by law, and Ener- ginet.dk must deliver an annual report highlighting problem areas and action  plan.     Policy for representation, gifts etc.  Board members, directors and other employees are only allowed to give or ac- cept smaller gifts from suppliers or other business relations. Larger gifts must  be approved by the management.      7.2  Actions and results    Whistleblower system  Measures have been taken by the Board of Energinet.dk to put in place a so- called whistleblower system. Whistleblowing enables employees or other stake- holders to report anonymously on suspicion of possible violations of ethical  guidelines and/or financial fraud.    The whistleblower system, which is established through an external supplier,  will be accessible by phone and the internet. The system is expected to be in  effect by medio 2012.
