Promoting the Use of Wind Power  Asahi Breweries began funding the Aso-Nishihara Wind Farm, a wind power business operated by  Electric Power Development Co., Ltd., in 2003. The Aso-Nishihara Wind Farm generates 25 million  kWh of electricity annually.   Introduction of the Pre Isomeriser & Evaporator (PIE) method       36 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities - The Environment Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD. All rights reserved. Asahi Breweries has successfully removed some of the flavor that negatively affects the beer, by  boiling the hops in a small apparatus separately from the wort on their evaluation of the heat energy  needed in detail by considering the amounts necessary for each reaction of constituents of the wort.  With the PIE method, CO2 emission is reduced by 30 % in the boiling process of beer brewing and the  amount of hops used has also been decreased by about 5%. Additionally, the method effectively  increases the protein content, which allows the beer to maintain a head for longer.     Utilizing Green Power to Produce Asahi Super Dry  Promoting the use of natural energy, Asahi Breweries has proven itself an industry leader through its  green power utilization at its breweries. One example of this utilization is at the Kanagawa Brewery of  Asahi Breweries, which has been commissioning wind-powered generation through the Green Power  Certification Program since 2002.  Taking this effort a step further, we signed a new agreement with Japan New Energy Co., Ltd. in April  2009 for use of green energy for the production of Asahi Super Dry and other flagship products.  Based on this agreement, 33.5 million kWh of energy needed to produce 350 ml canned Asahi Super  Dry and beers used in gift sets are being generated by green power. These products carry a Green  Energy Mark and are contributing to green power promotion and education. In 2009, we were  awarded the 14th New Energy Award from the Director-General of the Agency for Natural Resources  and Energy in recognition of this effort.  Furthermore, we began using green power to generate all the electricity (6.5 million kWh) consumed  at our Head Office building from 2009. This brings our total annual use of green power to 40 million  kWh, making us the largest user of green power in the food industry.     Capturing CO2 through the Corporate-Owned Asahi Forest  The corporate-owned Asahi Forest, managed by Asahi Breweries since 1941, spans a total of 2,165  hectares and absorbs 12,200 tons of CO2 each year. The Asahi Forest received FSC certification in  2001.     Use of Solar Power  Asahi Breweries installed a solar power generation system at the Hakata Brewery in March 2007. The  system generates approximately 153,250 kWh each year, which reduces the amount of annual CO2  emissions by approximately 85 tons. The electricity generated by solar power is equivalent to the  annual electricity used in areas of the brewery where visitor tours are conducted.     Participation in the Challenge 25 Campaign  Asahi Breweries is a participant in the Challenge 25 Campaign—a national movement promoted by  the Japanese government—and is pursuing efforts to prevent global warming.          37 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities - The Environment Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD.

All rights reserved.  Efforts for Water Resource Preservation   Reduction of Water Consumption, Control of Wastewater  To save service water, we are reducing the amount of water we use for washing and sterilizing our  tanks and pipe works and efficiently using water collected from the breweries. To control wastewater  quality, Asahi Breweries purifies wastewater generated through the manufacturing process of  beer-type beverages using anaerobic processing systems within our breweries before discharging it  into sewers and rivers.     Preventing Soil Contamination  We set up breakwaters surrounding all entrances and storage tanks at our breweries to prevent soil  contamination by cleansing agents and other chemicals used during the manufacturing process. To  provide additional safeguard against any possible leakage of these liquids from tanks and other areas,  we have established a system for ensuring the liquids are treated as wastewater by our in-house  wastewater processing facility. In addition, we stringently control analytical reagents through inventory  and usage records and locked storage, and we restrict their use to indoor analysis rooms to  completely prevent them from contaminating the soil.     We have obtained confirmation under ISO 14001-based audits that these activities are being  maintained on a continuous basis.    Waste   Targets and Accomplishments Related to Waste  Asahi Breweries has continued recycling waste and by-products at all breweries since 1998. We have  also been targeting 100% recycling of waste for the Asahi Group. This milestone was achieved in  2009 at all Group manufacturing sites.   In addition to 100% recycling, we are also endeavoring to reduce the volume of waste generation and  input of raw materials.

With respect to primary containers that directly hold the content, in 2006  we raised the ratio of recycled materials with high silicon content used for  cans and made the cans thinner. In addition, with respect to secondary  containers that hold the primary containers, we reduced the tsubo volume  (weight per 1 m 2) for multi-packs by approximately 4%.  Development of technology (SuperEnd  206-diameter) for reducing aluminum  usage in aluminum caps  (Asahi Breweries, Ltd.)  In 2007, we developed a technology (SuperEnd 206-diameter) that  reduces the amount of aluminum used in caps for beer-type beverages by  9% compared to conventional caps.  Reduced use of aluminum by using  pressurized sterilization manufacturing  method  (Asahi Breweries, Ltd.)  We developed a manufacturing method for high-gas volume can products  using pressurized sterilization in a joint effort with Toyo Seikan Kaisha, Ltd.  The technology relatively reduces internal differential pressure and  enables the use of can bodies with lower compression strength, thereby  reducing the amount of aluminum used by 18% compared to conventional  cans.  Development of uniquely shaped can for  reducing aluminum usage  (Asahi Breweries, Ltd.)  We developed a can body shape that reduces surface area by  approximately 6% and sheet thickness by 0.01 mm in a joint effort with  Showa Aluminum Can Corporation, thereby reducing aluminum usage by  approximately 9% (0.3 g per sheet).  Reduced CO2 emissions through  Tarunama shrink caps  (Asahi Breweries, Ltd.)  We successfully developed Tarunama shrink caps using raw materials of  plant origin (polylactate), reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 60%  compared to conventional materials.  Lightweight wine bottles  (Sainte Neige Wine Co., Ltd.)  In collaboration with Ishizuka Glass Co., Ltd., we reduced the weight of  wine bottles (volume: 720 ml) by 18% without changing their length.  Use of bioplastics for PET bottle labels  (Asahi Soft Drinks Co., Ltd.)  We adopted bioplastics for 490ml PET bottle labels of Asahi Juroku-Cha  and became the first in the soft drink industry to be certified with the  bioplastics mark.  Reduced weight of container material,  use of easy-to-peel labels  (Asahi Soft Drinks Co., Ltd.)  We reduced the weight of container materials by creating a dimple in the  PET bottle, and adopted ultra-thin heat-sensitive labels that are easily  peeled off.  Use of eco-grip caps  (Asahi Soft Drinks Co., Ltd.)  We gave concavo-convex shape to PET bottle caps to make them easier  to grip and lighter in weight.  Use of cartocan paper containers  (Wakodo Co., Ltd.)  We adopted cartocan paper containers certified with the Forest Thinning  Mark, indicating that more than 30% of its content consists of domestic  materials containing over 10% of domestic forest thinning. Timber thinning  generated by the corporate-owned Asahi Forest is used as part of the  cartocan material.  Use of Eco streamers and More Eco  streamers  (Asahi Soft Drinks Co., Ltd.)

All rights reserved. Environmental Consideration in Technological Development  Asahi Breweries is actively engaged in research and technological development to reduce impact on  the environment.     Development of Technology for Simultaneous Production of Sugar and Ethanol from  Sugarcane  Asahi Breweries and the National Agricultural Research Center for the Kyushu Okinawa Region have  jointly developed a combined process for producing sugar and ethanol that uses a new variety of  high-biomass sugarcane. With 1.5 times more biomass than the sugarcane used in sugar production,  it can be used to produce large quantities of biomass at low cost while maintaining sugar production  volume. The process not only allows for simultaneous production of sugar and ethanol through a  single process, but also enables ethanol production without fossil fuel consumption.This is possible  through the use of bagasse (residue generated from sugarcane production) as a sole energy source.  We began conducting verification tests on the technology on Ie Island in Okinawa from January 2006  to March 2010. We successfully verified that it can yield over five times the production volume of  ethanol from the same area of cropland, compared with conventional technology, while maintaining  the current level of sugar production volume. We also confirmed that the process reduces greenhouse  gases by approximately 40 tons per hectare of cropland, or 57 times more than the conventional  technology. The tests proved that the technology offers both economic and environmental benefits.  The result of our experiment has been ranked among the Ten outstanding topics of Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries Research Results, 2010 compiled by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries. It is regarded as a promising technology that may also be effective in reducing greenhouse  gases.    In FY 2011, a new variety of sugar cane (KY01-2044*) intended for use with Japans first  simultaneous sugar and ethanol production was registered. In addition, we are progressing forward  with development of technology, including the verification of production technology at  commercial-scale, that harnesses the sugar canes inherent economic and environmental merits and  moves the product towards commercialization.  * Developed by the National Agricultural Research Center for the Kyushu Okinawa Region     Development of Technology for Low-cost Production of Cellulase Enzyme from Wastepaper  Asahi Breweries was the first company worldwide to develop a technology that uses wastepaper as  raw material for producing cellulase enzymes that break down cellulose—a main constituent of plant  fiber and cell walls—into sugar.  Our technology has made it possible to produce cellulase at less than one-tenth of the cost of  conventional methods without involving genetic modification, and is thus expected to contribute  significantly to food processing and the diffusion and promotion of bioethanol. We intend to continue  developing mass production technologies from various cellulose raw materials, as well as  technologies for commercializing cellulase.     Development of Production Technology for High-Glutamic Acid Yeast Extract  In order to effectively utilize the brewing yeast produced during the brewing of beer, Asahi Breweries  has been producing and selling, since 1966, yeast extract using high nutritional value brewing yeast.  In recent years, a new yeast extract has been developed that includes approximately five times the  amount of glutamic acid, the chemical ingredient of umami, of our previous extract. This new extract is  being sold as HYPER MEAST HG by Asahi Food and Healthcare Co., Ltd. and received a Product  Power Award at the Ifia Japan food ingredients and additives exhibition held in 2011. Going forward,  we intend to continue developing high value-added yeast extracts that meet the needs of our  customers.         45 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities - The Environment Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD. All rights reserved. Development of New Wastewater Processing Technology to Help Build a Low-Carbon  Society  Asahi Breweries became in 1988 the first company in the Japanese beer industry to adopt  anaerobic wastewater treatment technology (using UASB technology) in cooperation with water  treatment plants, and continues to be an early adopter and active developer of wastewater  technology. In 2009, we began development of technology to realize the anammox (anaerobic  ammonium oxidation) process touted as the low-cost, low-energy next-generation solution to  wastewater processing. The anammox process, discovered in 1995 by a Dutch group, is a  nitrogen elimination process using autotrophic bacteria. This technology is theoretically able to  reduce electrical consumption by approximately 40% compared to existing nitrogen elimination  processes that use circulation methods, and it is purported to produce a low amount of waste  sludge. However, adoption of the technology was prevented by the difficulty in growing the  anammox bacteria. Asahi Breweries was able to develop a new anammox reactor capable of  high nitrogen elimination rates with low residence times by using as carriers for the anammox  bacteria our proprietary carbide Malt Ceramics, whose ingredients are beer barely husks. Efforts  in 2011 were successful at increasing the scale of the reactor, verifying that long-term stable  operation in actual wastewater treatment is possible. The importance of this technology was  recognized when The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan awarded a 2010 Outstanding Paper  Award to a research paper featuring one aspect of our new technology in the Journal of  Chemical Engineering of Japan.        46 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities - The Environment Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD.

Use the gifts of nature with care   (1) Properly use the gifts of nature   (2) Use the gifts of nature more effectively  (3) Study the relationships within nature, and undertake research and development to make use   of them well    3. Take action with people around the world  (1) Share this Declaration throughout the Asahi Group and put in efforts with our   employees  (2) Make use of our products and services to clearly convey the importance of natures gifts   (3) Take action globally and in cooperation with our business partners    * The Declaration on Biodiversity of the Asahi Group was formulated with reference to the Declaration on Biodiversity of the  Nippon Keidanren (Japan Business Federation).           47 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities - The Environment Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD. All rights reserved. Efforts for Ecosystem Preservation  We engage in original efforts for preserving the ecosystem at each brewery of Asahi Breweries and  Group companies.    Efforts for ecosystem preservation  Theme  Company  Content  Biotope construction  Ecosystem  preservation efforts  through the  corporate-owned  Asahi Forest  Asahi Breweries,  Ltd. Ibaraki  Brewery  An employee with Class-II biotope management qualifications of the  Ecosystem Conservation Society-Japan created a biotope in the  corner of the open garden in which local children released Luciola  lateralis firefly larvae. In 2009, several larvae matured into adult  fireflies. We intend to continue our efforts to revive natural habitats.  Asahi Beer Malt,  Ltd.  With the factorys advantage of being near the abundant natural  environment at the foot of Mt. Mikami (also known as Omi-Fuji), a  biotope was constructed in the green space on the factory grounds  through the efforts of all the employees. Its pond is home to killifish,  carp, Japanese bitterling and dragonfly larvae, and over it various  dragonfly species glide about, including the red dragonfly, darner and  commons skimmer as well as damselflies. The biotopes protected  forest is visited by pheasants, sparrows, bush warblers, bulbuls,  starlings and other birds.  Asahi Breweries,  Ltd. Kanagawa  Brewery  Constructed a biotope in which firefly larvae have been bred 2002,  when the brewery was completed. The pond has become a habitat  supporting the birth of many fireflies.  Asahi Breweries,  Ltd.  We received FSC certification* from the Forest Stewardship Council,  an international forest certification organization, in 2001 for conducting  forest management that emphasizes environmental preservation. In  2008, we became the first to receive CO2 absorption certification from  a third-party organization. Since then, we have continued to promote  forestation and the nurturing of planted forests as well as the  protection of native forests based on FSCs 10 Principles and Criteria  for forest management, including regular monitoring using a GIS  (Geographic Information System).  Water preservation  activities for  breweries  Asahi Breweries,  Ltd.  To save forests, an essential element of our business, Asahi Breweries  has made a continuous effort to preserve the forests serving as water  resources for each brewery. Employees and their families from all  Asahi Breweries and Group companies consistently volunteer for  community-based activities, including planting saplings, trimming  shrubs and overgrown branches, in addition to thinning, with the  cooperation of local NPOs, forestry unions, administration offices, and  the National Land Afforestation Promotion Organization. This has  raised the cumulative total of such initiatives to 67 since their start in  2004 through fiscal 2011, with a total of 3,500 participants.   * FSC certification: A system under which an independent third-party organization screens and certifies that a forest is  being managed appropriately.       48 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities - The Environment Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD.

Quality Assurance System                                                        Quality Committee and Group Quality Committee  In 2003, Asahi Breweries launched the Quality Committee as a cross-organizational team to address  quality issues through discussions with the members of related internal departments and to enhance  its quality assurance system. In December 2005, we established the Group Quality Committee*, an  organization for promoting these activities at a Group level. It has since met every other month to  exchange quality-related information. Among other activities, the Group Quality Committee drafts  Group quality policies and quality assurance strategies for each company, and formulates plans for  integrating these strategies into each companys medium-term management plan and annual plan. In  2009, the committee formulated a plan to support Group companies in meeting Quality Assurance  Requirements representing the management items needed to satisfy quality assurance levels for food  companies. In fiscal 2011, the committee conducted deliberations and verification regarding the  Group's quality assurance system for radioactive substances (establishment of policies, inspection  systems, etc.) and response system for cases of quality incidents accompanying the change to a  holding company structure.      * As of the end of fiscal 2011, membership includes quality assurance divisions and related departments at Asahi  Breweries, Ltd.; Asahi Soft Drinks Co., Ltd.; Asahi Food & Healthcare Co., Ltd.; LB Co., Ltd.; Wakodo Co., Ltd.; and  Amano Jitsugyo Co., Ltd.           54 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities – Quality Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD.

Public Expression Examination Board  Asahi Breweries established the Public Expression Committee in 1995 (renamed Public Expression  Examination Board in July 2011) to examine and review product labeling and advertising content from  various perspectives.  Subsequently in 2001, we strengthened its functions, membership and support system by adding  such areas as product labeling and support materials to its oversight. The Board's members are  selected from 16 departments*2 of the company and meet weekly. We only launch products and  advertising materials that have been authorized by the Board.

Quality Audits  Since 1996, Asahi Breweries under the leadership of the Quality Assurance Department has  implemented quality audits at the production worksites of Asahi Breweries. In 1999, we began  conducting audits for the head offices and production worksites for the Group companies and  restaurants. In these quality audits, we review the status of implementation of the quality system in  accordance with auditing standards described in the Internal Audit Rules.    Sites subjected to quality audits  Fiscal Year  Sites  2007  Asahi Breweries production worksites, Nikka Whisky production worksites, Asahi Food & Healthcare  head office and production worksites, Wakodo head office and production worksites, Sainte Neige  Wine, Asahi Beer Malt head office and production worksites, Asahi Beer Garden head office and  stores* 3, Asahi Food Create head office and stores, Usquebaugh head office and stores, Asahi  Ecology, Nippon Freeze Drying, Coordination Division for China Business, Yantai Beer, Shangdong  Asahi Green Source High-tech Farm, and others  2008  Asahi Breweries head office and production worksites, Nikka Whisky production worksites, Asahi Food  & Healthcare head office and production worksites, Nippon Freeze Drying, LB (Tokyo)* 2, LB  (Nagoya)* 3, Sumidagawa Brewing* 1, Asahi Beer Garden head office and stores, Asahi Beer  Communications head office and branch offices, Asahi Beer Annex*, Sendai Nikka Service, Hokkaido  Nikka Service, Haitai Beverage (South Korea), Hangzhou Beer (China), and others   2009  Asahi Breweries production sites, Nikka Whisky Distilling, Sainte Neige, Satsumatsukasa, Wakodo,  Amano Jitsugyo, Nippon Freeze Drying, Wako Food Industry, LB (Tokyo), Asahi Food Create,  Usquebaugh, Beijing Beer, and others  2010  Asahi Breweries production sites, Asahi Food & Healthcare head office and production worksites,  Wakodo head office and production worksites, Amano Jitsugyo, Nippon Freeze Drying, LB (Tokyo)* 2,  LB (Nagoya)* 3, Asahi Food Create, Usquebaugh, Beijing Beer, and others  *1 Sumidagawa Brewing and Asahi Beer Annex were dissolved as a result of their merger with Asahi Food Create, Ltd. on  January 1, 2010.  *2 LB (Tokyo) and LB (Nagoya) merged their operations on January 1, 2011 to become LB Co., Ltd.  *3 Asahi Beer Garden, Ltd. was dissolved following a merger with Asahi Food Create, Ltd. on April 1, 2011.       57 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities – Quality Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD. All rights reserved. Activity Report                                                            Response to Product Complaints and Accidents  We formulated the Group Quality Crisis Management Guideline to structure our response to serious  accidents related to our products. Under this guideline, incidents are promptly reported through a  designated emergency channel to the president, who then chairs a Crisis Response Meeting, and a  task force is established to handle the situation.  In responding to accidents, we place top priority on safeguarding the lives (health) of our customers  and make a company-wide effort to minimize any damage through the following basic approach.  (1) We endeavor to ascertain the facts and circumstances, promptly disclose necessary information  and contain potential damage and increase in concern.  (2) We take the initiative in taking every appropriate action for our customers and society, including  disclosure to the mass media, corporate announcements (information calling for attention), recalls,  and so forth.  (3) We promptly report to the supervising authorities and quickly respond to any requirements.    No voluntary recalls took place within the Asahi Group during fiscal 2011.    Efforts to Ensure Quality and Product Safety at Each Stage of the Supply Chain    Major efforts at the product development stage (Asahi Breweries, Ltd.)  Topic  Content  Incorporating customer  feedback into product  development  We share various opinions and requests collected by our nationwide sales staff and  the Customer Relations Office via our intranet. Our development department  analyzes this data and incorporates it into product development.  Stability inspections on  product quality  We conduct inspections to confirm that the required quality can be maintained until  the best before date. Inspections utilize specific checklists for each product  category for a total of 12 categories and as many as 100 checkpoints.  Compliance tests  based on the Food  Sanitation Law and  internal standards  At every stage of new product development, from raw materials to the final product,  we review compliance with quality standards as stipulated by the Food Sanitation  Law as well as our stricter internal standards.  Securing safety and  durability of containers In selecting containers, we evaluate the quality assurance capability of suppliers  and inspect the safety of materials based on Food Sanitation Law compliance tests,  while also taking into account diverse perspectives reflecting the various ways in  which customers may use the product. This includes characteristics such as ease in  opening, drinking, holding and carrying. In addition, we verify quality by means of  external monitoring, tests and durability reviews at research laboratories to evaluate  products in accident conditions and adverse conditions such as being dropped or  exposed to extreme high or low temperatures. We also review the environmental  impact of materials used for containers.  Securing appropriate  labeling  At Asahi Breweries, internal review entities such as the New Product Development  Process Verification Meeting and the Public Expression Committee confirm the  appropriateness of expressions concerning raw materials, best before dates,  nutritional content, allergens, and original production sites of raw materials.  Securing safety and  quality during the  manufacturing process  and transportation  We hold Initial Production Control Confirmation Meetings and Mass Production  Confirmation Meetings to confirm a products readiness for mass production as well  as quality inspection methods for each process, from the receipt of raw materials  and supplies to shipment. In addition, to confirm that quality is maintained in  containers during transportation, we conduct tests using transport simulation  equipment at our research laboratories as well as tests under actual conditions in  which products are loaded onto trucks and checked for ink staining and durability.         58 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities – Quality Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD. All rights reserved. Major efforts at the raw material procurement stage  Topic  Content  Signing quality contracts with  suppliers  We review information such as lists of agricultural chemicals used,  agricultural chemicals application records and analytic data received  from suppliers, and only sign quality contracts with suppliers who  can guarantee security and safety.  Quality audits of suppliers  We conduct quality audits of suppliers for the consistent quality of  materials. The Procurement Department regularly visits suppliers  material plants to check their quality control systems and sanitary  conditions, from receiving materials to production and shipment. If  we discover any problems in the quality provided by a supplier, we  offer instructions for improvement. If necessary, we will cancel  orders from suppliers who fail to demonstrate improvement.  QA (Quality Assurance) Meetings  We hold QA Meetings with each of our large-volume suppliers to  maintain and enhance quality.  Actions related to residual  agricultural chemicals  With respect to malt and hop, the main raw materials for beer, Asahi  Breweries compares standards for residual agricultural chemicals  under Japans Positive List system with those of countries in which  the suppliers are located. The company also seeks information on  the usage of agricultural chemicals from suppliers that operate under  lower regulatory standards than Japan. If a supplier is using any of  these chemicals, we request analytic data to confirm compliance  within residual standards set by Japans Positive List system.  Genetically modified food  products  The use and labeling of genetically modified food products differ  according to the laws of each country. With respect to genetically  modified agricultural products and processed foods using such  products as raw materials, Asahi Breweries complies with all  pertinent regulations in the countries in which it operates.  Launching of raw material  information management system  In June 2006, we launched the AAA System, which guarantees  integrated management of information on raw materials and  products. Under this system, the procurement department registers  information on raw materials such as quality, nutritional components,  raw materials and additives. Registered information is confirmed and  approved by the Quality Control Center responsible for this system,  allowing the goods to be used as raw materials for our products.  Quality inspections of raw  materials  We have established standards for raw materials, raw material  inspections and raw material risk management. We have also  defined items, methods, frequency and standard values for analytic  testing to check the quality and stability of raw materials every day  upon receipt and prior to use. Before introducing any new materials,  we obtain samples to confirm their safety.  Safety management of water  sources  With respect to water, the key ingredient for Group products, such as  beer, soft drinks, whisky and wine, we conduct inspections to  ascertain safety and applicability to beer brewing based on the  26-point criteria of the potable water quality standards under the  Food Sanitation Law and the 50-point criteria of the Ordinance on  Potable Water Quality Standard as stipulated by the Water Supply  Law. In addition, we also conduct additional inspections as  necessary based on our own criteria, including residual chlorine  concentrations, analysis of components that affect brewing and  analysis of agricultural chemicals.         59 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities – Quality Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD.

Content  Number of meetings  2009  2010  Discussions on quality goals, issues related to quality  and technical development, information sharing  Total: 86  Total: 93    Major efforts at the production stage (Asahi Breweries, Ltd.)  Topic  Content  Taikoban  Guarantee  System  Since introducing the Taikoban Guarantee System, a unique quality assurance  system, in 1991, Asahi Breweries has been guaranteeing that products delivered to  customers have been manufactured through prescribed processes and that  designated standards have been achieved. The staff responsible for each process in  our brewing, packaging, engineering, and quality control departments checks the  quality and operational status of equipment for each lot and issues quality  warrantees using TECOS21, a factory network system. Finally, the staff responsible  for quality assurance checks all warrantees and applies a Taikoban seal that  confirms quality prior to shipment. If any abnormality is discovered, the system is  designed to prevent a product from proceeding to the next step until the cause has  been identified and quality can be ensured.  Total Freshness  Management  Activities  Beer requires careful handling*. These activities are intended to maintain quality and  freshness in every possible way, from post-production storage and delivery to  handling at retailers and restaurants. For example, as a result of these activities we  reduced the average number of days from production to shipping from 20 in the  1980s to 3 for the main Asahi Super Dry brands.  * Lengthy exposure to sunlight, changes in temperature or vibration may alter flavor balance  and cause odors or turbidity in the beer.    Points on quality control in the production process (Asahi Breweries, Ltd.)  Topic  Content  Sensory  inspection  Inspection based on the human senses, such as taste and smell. Conducted not only  at the final production stage, but at all stages, from raw materials, brewing and  fermentation to maturation and storage.  Chemical  analysis  Analysis is conducted under stringent quality standards during each stage from  brewing to the finished product.  Anti-oxidation  We monitor percolation and packaging to prevent exposure to oxygen and have  installed equipment to prevent the entry of oxygen during the brewing process. We  also select malt suitable for producing products that do not readily oxidize as raw  materials.  Hygiene  management  We formulate control standards based on the Food Sanitation Law, eliminate pests,  conduct voluntary inspections and undergo inspections by outside specialists.  Microbial  inspection  We conduct strict checks to prevent the entry of microorganisms during each  production process and maintain hygienic conditions.  Appearance  inspection  No product is delivered that has not successfully passed through a series of checks,  ranging from content volume to the text printed on packaging.         60 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities – Quality Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD. All rights reserved. Major efforts at the distribution stage (Asahi Breweries, Ltd.)  Topic  Content  Shorter lead times  It is important to deliver beer as soon as possible after production so that  customers can enjoy its fresh taste. For this purpose, it is essential to  shorten the lead time from factory to points of sale, which requires  effectively coordinating delivery methods and the time between Asahi  Breweries and its wholesalers and retailers. Therefore, sales and logistics  personnel regularly visit wholesale distribution centers to keep abreast of  the delivery environment. In addition, they make arrangements with the  logistics staff of the wholesalers to ensure efficient delivery with the best  possible timing.  Factory and distribution  center efforts  In the course of directly delivering our products to wholesalers, we prevent  product deterioration from extended storage in warehouses by knowing  the required shipment volume ahead of time and shipping immediately  after production. When we use a distribution center, we select a transit  distribution center that immediately sorts and delivers products upon  arrival to avoid a reduction in quality from holding inventory on site.  Efforts during transportation  To avoid quality deterioration from exposure to sunlight or vibration during  loading or unloading from delivery vehicles, Asahi Breweries has been  introducing wing vehicles that accelerate loading and unloading and AIR  SUS vehicles that cushion the shock to the load. These vehicles now  account for about 90% of our delivery fleet. In addition, we are also  enhancing the function of the Asahi Quality Sheet to shield products from  sunlight and are introducing heat-insulated cars.  Efforts in cooperation with  business partners  We always ensure that the drivers of partner carriers have experience in  the transportation of Asahi Breweries products and require that drivers  delivering their first loads fully understand the checkpoints in loading and  handling our products before they make the delivery. In addition, the  distribution departments in each region share the Asahi Breweries Group  Quality Policy with partner carriers to eliminate drunk driving and excess  loads, prevent serious accidents and damaging accidents, and promote  educational activities on safety.    Major efforts during distribution and sales (Asahi Breweries, Ltd.)  Topic  Content  Freshness management at  mass retailers  To control product freshness at stores, employees regularly visit individual  outlets of mass retailers and collect date-of-manufacture data. The data is  compiled at our head office and used in production and logistics planning  to continually improve freshness management efforts.  Asahi Breweries Keg Fresh  Beer Quality Seminars  We conduct Asahi Breweries Keg Fresh Beer Quality Seminars that  combine video and experience to educate wholesalers, retailers and  restaurants.  Product Knowledge  Training for sales staff  We hold Product Knowledge Training for new recruits and recently  appointed sales staff. The training simulates the causes of diverse  defectives that can occur in the period between shipment from the factory  and final delivery to customers so that trainees can ascertain the problem  based on a specific defect.  Information sharing through  Asahi Quality Access  The Asahi Quality Access Web site provides customers information about  the Asahi Super Dry they are consuming at that time, by whom and by  which factory it was produced together with the producers thoughts. By  simply entering a portion of the manufacturers code printed on the bottom  of the can or the back of a bottle, customers can review comments from  the factory manager and staff responsible for production of the specific  product.  Development of highly  convenient and efficient  tarunama dispensers  We jointly developed the tarunama dispenser Happy-End Kun with  Kyokko Inc. This is the industrys first computerized draft beer dispenser  that prevents loss due to spurts that occur as the keg becomes empty. It  also detects grime on the dispensers beer hose and alerts the user when  cleaning is recommended if cleaning has not been regularly done.       61 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities – Quality Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD. All rights reserved.  Labeling and Advertising Efforts   Labeling    Labeling and expressions on product packages (Asahi Breweries, Ltd.)  Topic  Content  Recycling mark  The recycling mark indicates that packaging material can be recycled  and encourages active support for reuse and recycling.  Warning against drinking while  pregnant, breastfeeding, or  under 20 years of age  We display warnings against drinking by pregnant and nursing  women in addition to the expression, You are not permitted to drink  alcoholic beverages if you are under 20 years of age.  Braille  To assist visually challenged customers in distinguishing alcoholic  beverages from soft drinks, we have put the Braille for alcohol on  the top of all canned alcoholic products.  Display of best before date on  six-can packages  We led the industry in responding to customer requests to make the  best before date easier to read, and began printing the production  date and other information on the upper side of the six-can package. Alcohol mark on low-alcohol  beverages   To prevent underage consumers or customers who do not drink  alcoholic beverages from mistakenly consuming them, we ensure  that a large Alcohol mark appears on every low-alcohol beverage  container.  Display of nutritional contents  We are expanding the scope of displays of nutritional content, sought  by many customers, such as calorie data, to more products, including  beer and low-alcohol beverages. We also publish on our Web site  nutritional content data on beer, happoshu and low-alcohol  beverages.  Displays regarding content of  new materials  When emphasizing new ingredients, we provide explanations and  information on suitable levels of intake to prevent misunderstanding  or misconception.                             62 Summary of Asahi Group CSR Activities – Quality Issued June 2012  Copyright  ASAHI GROUP HOLDINGS, LTD. All rights reserved.  Advertisements  The purpose of our advertising is to communicate to customers information such as the  characteristics, quality and world view of Asahi Breweries products in the hope of winning their  patronage.  We promote advertisement activities to gain customer sympathy and trust by establishing detailed  policies for expressions and displays under our Voluntary Advertisement Standards, and voluntarily  controlling ad content in light of concerns over moderate and responsible drinking and limiting TV  commercials during the daytime. In addition, we established our Public Expression Conference as a  cross-organizational review entity to ensure that every step is taken toward appropriate labeling and  expression.

Therefore, as a corporate group centered  around alcoholic beverages, the Asahi Group will continue to take action as a company that society  trusts to eliminate problems associated with inappropriate drinking habits and to promote moderate  and responsible drinking so that many can share in the joys and pleasures of alcoholic beverages.    Basic Philosophy    The Asahi Group will work towards developing a healthy alcohol-related culture while at the  same time, fulfilling its social responsibility by acknowledging the characteristics of alcoholic  beverages and promoting moderate and responsible drinking in a systematic and continuous  manner, thereby contributing to the realization of a healthy and affluent society.

The overall director of the  business unit or another  manager at a comparable  level reviews the evaluation  and makes a final  determination to prevent  unfair assessments due to  variations in evaluation  standards.  Supervisors thoroughly  review with employees the  results of these personnel  evaluations, as well as  their own comments.     Participation in training (Asahi Breweries, Ltd.)

Each worksite convenes a monthly Occupational Safety and Health Committee consisting of  representatives of labor unions and management as a forum for reviewing problems and  improvements in workplace safety and health and implementing solutions. We intend to strengthen  our health-related efforts with special emphasis on mental health.  Since 2005, safety manager trainings have been conducted under the guidance of visiting lecturers to  raise safety awareness across the entire Asahi Group. In addition, information exchange sessions are  regularly held to share knowledge and expertise, and safety policies have been formulated to increase  workplace safety throughout the Group.     Certification of Occupational Safety and Health Management System (OSHMS)*  The Asahi Group has been seeking to obtain certification for the Occupational Safety and Health  Management System (OSHMS) to further promote the development of a safety culture that is  appropriate to the actual conditions at each worksite and to eliminate industrial accidents.

Lowering the age at which employees become eligible to receive check-ups for  lifestyle diseases from 35 to 30.   Expanded the age range of employees eligible for a complete medical  check-up from 40 to 30 or 35.

Introduction of  reinstatement system A system for supporting the return to work of employees suffering from  work-related disabilities (mainly mental health problems) caused by illness or  injury (introduced May 2006)   Application of shorter work hours when returning to work after an extended  leave of absence resulting from illness or injury   Follow-up in collaboration with the attending doctor and industrial physicians  depending on individual health conditions   Utilization of outside experts including psychiatrists, certified clinical  psychologists and occupational therapists    Prevention of Service Overtime and Work Hours Log  We introduced a system that allows supervisors to monitor and control employee sign-in and sign-off  times. Under this system, employees submit their work information to their supervisors for  confirmation and approval on the administrators screen.  Since the system was based on self-reported data, however, service overtime was possible.  Therefore, Asahi Breweries introduced an additional overtime management system in December  2007 that displays log-in and log-off times on employees computers to encourage proper reporting of  work hours. The system records when employees log-in and log-off their computers and displays this  data as a point of reference on each employees computer screen as well as the screen for supervisor  authorization. Any significant discrepancy from self-reported data is displayed as highlighted text to  alert the related worker. We intend to use this new system as an opportunity for raising employee  awareness of appropriate self-reporting and work habits and to encourage them to adopt more  productive practices.
