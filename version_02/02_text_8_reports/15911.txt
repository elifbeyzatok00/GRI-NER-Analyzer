For us,  sustainability is at the core of the  concept of quality and part of our  corporate values.  Our customers are the heart of our  business. They are increasingly  showing an interest in sustainability  and we want them to feel confident  that everything they buy from us is  produced with respect for people  and the environment. Adding  sustainability value to our products  is therefore an important way of  strengthening our customer offering. H&M is a design-driven and  innovative fashion company. We  currently have five brands and  around 2,500 stores in 43 countries  on four continents. In 2011, we  entered exciting new markets in  Singapore, Romania, Croatia and,  via franchise, Morocco and Jordan.  In 2012, we plan to open first stores  in Bulgaria, Latvia, Malaysia,  Mexico, and, via franchise,  Thailand. Our goal is to increase  our number of stores, in both new  and existing markets, by 10–15%  each year.  In pursuing this growth, we want  to make more sustainable fashion  accessible and affordable to more  people around the world. To  achieve this, we must tackle the  challenges that H&M and the entire  fashion industry unquestionably  face. These include climate change,  working conditions and wages at  supplier factories and the long-term  availability of natural resources, to  mention just a few. Our vision is  clear: All our  operations  should be run  in a way that is  economically,  socially and  environmentally  sustainable.  Our customers   are the heart   of our business. H&M CONSCIOUS Contents  2   H&M Conscious Actions Sustainability Report 2011 A meSSAge frOm OUr CeO To put this vision into practice,   we have developed H&M Conscious  – our approach to integrating our  sustainable thinking into everything  we do. Last year, we set out our seven  strategic commitments. Working  to fulfil these commitments, we are  continuously creating what we call  Conscious Actions throughout our  business. These are activities and  targets designed to move us closer   to our vision. In this report, you can   read about the progress we have made  in taking these Conscious Actions. Im very proud of all our  achievements over the past year,  but a number of things really stand  out. One of the highlights of 2011  was that we, together with various  stakeholders and experts, developed  a dedicated plan to support social  development in Bangladesh.  Bangladesh is one of our most  important sourcing markets and  we want to ensure that the garment  industry has a positive impact  on the countrys development,  not just by contributing jobs,  but also skills, education, health,  and improvements in labour and  womensrights.  To build a more sustainable   fashion future, our industry needs   to keep finding new ways of  using resources as responsibly and  efficiently as possible. I am particularly proud to see that  H&M is now using more organic  cotton than any other company  in the world. This is just the start.  Our target is to use only sustainable  cotton by 2020. A further increase  in our use of organic cotton will  be a part of that, but this year also  saw the first clothes made from  Better Cotton hit H&M stores  around the world. Reducing stress  Adding sustainability  value to our products   is an important way   to further strengthen  our customer offering. Im proud to see that  H&m is the worlds  biggest user of   organic cotton. on the environment and improving  social conditions for farmers, Better  Cotton will have a key role to play  in helping us reach our target.  We also continued to introduce  new innovative materials. Our first  garments made from organic hemp  were launched. This fibre has a limited  environmental impact and, we  believe, great potential for thefuture. H&M CONSCIOUS Contents  3   H&M Conscious Actions Sustainability Report 2011 A meSSAge frOm OUr CeO Given H&Ms size and increasingly  global reach, we have a big impact  on the world around us. But just as  big are the opportunities we have  to make a difference through the  Conscious Actions we take.  Our scale means that we have the  opportunity to promote change  well beyond the borders of our  own operations – for example, by  promoting improvements in the  working conditions of the more  than one million people around the  world who work in our suppliers  factories. But in order to tackle  the complex challenges across our  industry, we need to collaborate  with others. We play an active role in initiatives  like the Sustainable Apparel  Coalition, the UN Global Compact  and the Better Cotton Initiative,  which are vital to meeting our goals.  In 2011, we joined the Fair Wage  Network, an initiative that works   to promote fair wages in global   supply chains; an ambition that   we fully support. We also engaged  Our scale means  that we have the  opportunity to  promote change  well beyond the  borders of our  own operations. with Greenpeace and teamed- up with a number of fashion and  sportswear brands to help lead our  industry towards zero discharge of  hazardous chemicals in our   value chain.  We are proud of all the achievements  we have made during the year. But  we are also aware of the challenges  ahead. We strive to be as transparent  as possible about the progress we  make. This report is an important  part of that. Thank you for taking  your time to learn about our  Conscious Actions. Karl-Johan Persson CEO, H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB H&M CONSCIOUS In order to   fulfil our  commitments  and tackle   the complex  challenges in   our industry,   we need to  collaborate   with others. Contents  4   H&M Conscious Actions Sustainability Report 2011 H&M CONSCIOUS OUr STrATegy H &M Conscious is the  name for all H&Ms work  for a more sustainable  fashion future. It is an approach to  managing our business based on the  vision that all our operations should  be run in a way that is economically,  socially and environmentally  sustainable. This means that the  needs of both present and future  generations should be respected in  everything that we do. People, planet and profit: at H&M,  we believe that being fully aware of  the interconnected nature of these  three elements is the key to the long- term success of our business.  In order to help us achieve our  vision, we broke it down into seven  strategic, long-term commitments. 1 Provide fashion for  conscious customers 3 Be ethical 5 Reduce, reuse,   recycle  4 Be climate smart 7Strengthen communities  6 Use natural resources  responsibly  Choose and reward  responsible partners 2 Contents  5   H&M Conscious Actions Sustainability Report 2011 a prOduCTS lifE CyClE H&M CONSCIOUS OUr STrATegy These commitments are an integral element  of our business strategy and they cover every  stage of our product life cycle, from designing  our fashion to how our customers care for the  garments they buy.   Based on constant dialogue with our external  stakeholders and our colleagues across the  business, we have built a process to identify and  prioritise the actions that we need to take over  the short and medium term to help us to meet  each of these long term commitments. We call  all these our Conscious Actions. Throughout  the year we monitor the progress we make  towards completing these actions, review and  improve our methods and add more actions  as our understanding of how to fulfil our  commitmentsimproves. This report sets out the Conscious Actions we  have taken or worked towards during 2011 and  describes how far we have come in making the  vision of H&M Conscious a reality. H &M aims to offer fashion and quality  at the best price. In doing this, we have  an impact on the world around us. We  create job opportunities and contribute towards  economic growth, but we also use natural  resources and cause carbon emissions. As a result,  we face a number of sustainability challenges  throughout our value chain. H&M Conscious  aims to tackle these challenges and, in doing so,  create new opportunities for long term business  success. To demonstrate what we mean, on the following  pages we have set out the biggest challenges at  each stage of the life cycle of our products. Below  each stage we have listed in which section of this  report you can find more information about the  Conscious Actions through which we work to  address these challenges. For those challenges most closely related to our  core operations, H&M has the ability to directly  influence the impact we make. For others, our  influence is more indirect; for example, we can  make a difference through our choices about  what goods and services we buy, by working  closely with our business partners, or by  collaborating with our stakeholders to tackle the  challenges that we share with our industry and  with the communities in which we operate.  t-shirt, orGaniC Cotton Contents  6   H&M Conscious Actions Sustainability Report 2011 OUr VAlUe CHAIN AND ITS CHAlleNgeS fabriC  prOCESSiNg leVel of influenCe: direct  indirect fabric production can require  intensive use of chemicals,  raising concerns for the  environment and for the health  of workers. we do not have  direct business relationships  with fabric mills, but we have  nevertheless started to build up  voluntary partnerships with a  number of mills to work together  towardsimprovements.

There are a lot of people that  contribute to the success of our  business, from cotton farmers and  workers in our suppliers factories  to our in-store colleagues and our  customers. Each of our stakeholder  groups has their own perspective on  our business. Throughout the year, we try to  maintain regular dialogue with each  major group. This helps not only to  gain an insight into their needs and  viewpoints, but also serves to ensure  that we benefit from the broader  understanding of our business that  they can often offer. Usually, this engagement is done  directly through our relevant  in-house teams. Other times, it  is through actively taking part,  and often a lead, in various multi- stakeholder initiatives. The table on page 9 sets out our  key stakeholder groups, some of  the ways we engage with them and  what we have learned their main  areas of concern to be. We want to take Conscious Actions  on the issues that are most material  to our business and the input we  receive from our stakeholders  helps us to prioritise the Conscious  Actions we take and the resources  we invest in them.  hm.com/whatotherssay H&M CONSCIOUS eNgAgINg WITH OUr STAKeHOlDerS 63%  Of OUr COlleagUeS   are COvered by   COlleCtIve bargaININg  agreeMeNtS eStIMated  10m  INtervIewS wItH   faCtOry wOrkerS   CONdUCted 8.7m  faNS ON faCebOOk Contents  9   H&M Conscious Actions Sustainability Report 2011 CUStOMerS  COMMUNItIeS eMplOyeeS SUpplIerS pOlICy-MakerS NgOs INveStOrS  H&M is a customer-focused  company.

Our Sustainability Report, which  is produced annually, covers  our sustainability activities and  programmes and our progress in  making our operations and products  more sustainable. The scope of the  Report includes the global Group  operations of H & M Hennes &  Mauritz AB, including all its brands  (H&M, COS, Weekday, Monki,  Cheap Monday) as well as its fully  or partially-owned subsidiaries  globally. It reports on performance  during the period from 1December  2010 – 30November 2011.  Additional information is available  online at hm.com/sustainability.  hm.com/sustainability Our last Sustainability Report  was published in April 2011.  We are signatories to the UN  Global Compact, and our annual  sustainability report also acts as our  Communication on Progress (COP).  All data is collected by our  Sustainability team from the  relevant functions within our  organisation and from external  parties. It is reviewed by our  controllers and relevant experts in  our Sustainability team. Unless specified, all data concerning  suppliers and supplier factories  includes all suppliers and factories  that were approved for production  during the reporting period. Each  supplier may own or subcontract to  various factories. Factories included  in our scope include manufacturing  or processing (i.e. washing or  dyeing) factories that are owned  or subcontracted by our suppliers.  The provided number of worker  interviews is an estimate based on  all audits conducted, including those  performed on factories that did not  get approved.  Please note that currency  conversions from SEK to other  currencies are approximate figures  based on the conversion rate valid  on 30 November 2011. Exact figures  are provided in SEK only.

We also recognise that many of our  stakeholders expect our reporting to  be independently assured. During  2011 we evaluated different options  for assuring our report and we will  continue this process during 2012.

Clothing  manufacturing employs several  million people and accounts  for a large proportion of the  countrys exports. As a long-term  buyer, h&m wants to contribute  to lasting improvements for  people working in the clothing  industry. that is why, in 2011,  we developed an ambitious  plan to support long term social  development in bangladesh.  the plan includes projects to  support improved social dialogue  and better fire safety in garment  factories, training and access to  health care for garment workers.  as part of the plan we also work  to strengthen the position of  women in the community by  providing grants for female  students in higher education  and by setting up a helpline for  women exposed to violence and  discrimination.

From increasing profitability  to envisaging the h&m store of  2020, this initiative aims to give  our best managers the tools both  to improve performance today  and to understand the long-term  challenges and opportunities  h&m faces. by committing to detox its supply  chain, H&m is not only setting the  trend for this season and the   future, it is also sending a clear  message to other brands that using  toxic chemicals to make our clothing  is no longer in vogue. H&ms  landmark commitment has the  potential to be a catalyst for wider  change across the fashion industry.  H&m must now use its size and  influence to lead the entire fashion  industry towards a toxic-free future,  by working with other committed  brands to bring about cross-  industry and systemic change. marietta harjono, Toxic Campaigner   at greenpeace international TOwardS zErO  diSChargE during 2011, h&m engaged  with Greenpeace regarding our  shared ambition to eliminate  the use of hazardous chemicals  and achieve zero discharge of  such substances in global textile  production. since 1995 h&m  has been working to reduce the  use and impact of hazardous  chemicals using an approach  based on the Precautionary  Principle. as a leading actor  with a well reputed approach to  chemicals management, h&m has  the size and ability to encourage  change within the industry. in  2011, h&m, together with adidas  Group, C&a, li ning, nike, inc.  and Puma, developed a joint  roadmap and an ambitious action  plan to set a new standard for  environmental performance  and lead our industry towards  achieving zero discharges of  those chemicals by 2020.

But its also about informing and  educating our customers about  what we do to make fashion more  sustainable in a transparent and  understandable way. and it means  that we have to keep inspiring our  customers with the designs we offer,  the materials we use, the innovations  we introduce and the constant  improvements we work to achieve  ineverything we do. O ur business idea is to offer fashion and  quality at the best price. To us, quality  includes that our products should be  produced, transported and sold with care for people  and the environment. Our customers are at the core of everything we do  and our success depends on our ability to deliver  what they want. We always want to inspire and surprise our  customers and strengthen our customer  offering. As they become increasingly conscious  of environmental and social issues, adding  sustainability value to our products is one way to  achieve this. By making more sustainable choices  available to all our customers around the world,   we can together contribute to a more sustainable  fashion future. Our regular coordinated Conscious Collections are  at the forefront of both fashion and sustainability.  They show very clearly that choosing greener  fashion does not mean compromising on design  or price. Our permanent broad range of various  Conscious Products makes a better choice easier   for our customers and applies these innovations   on a biggerscale.  But this is only the beginning of our journey. We  keep working every day to make all our products  more sustainable, piece-by-piece and throughout  our entire range.

The user phase accounts for about 40% of the  climate impact of a garments lifecycle. Reducing the  washing temperature from 60 degrees to 40 degrees  or less can save 50% in energy use. To inspire our  customers to reduce this impact, in 2011, we started  working on complementing our care and washing  instructions with climate-smart alternatives. We  have been in close discussions with Ginetex, the  owner of the current global standard care labelling  system, to support this goal.

I think H&Ms culture  of empowering employees to make  the right decisions is an important  part of the mix. H &M does not own any of the factories  that manufacture our products. Instead,  production takes place at around 1,650  factories that are owned or subcontracted by almost  750 suppliers. Managing our value chain effectively  to ensure that quality and ethical standards are  maintained is a major challenge. Large parts of our  global Sustainability and Production Office teams  are dedicated to this task. Garment production is often located in countries  where human rights violations are a risk and  environmental awareness is less developed. Respect  for people and the environment is an essential part   of H&Ms values. We use our influence to promote  better working conditions and environmental  consciousness throughout our value chain. We   focus on strengthening our suppliers ability to   take ownership for their sustainability issues and   on working towards greater involvement of the  workers themselves. This contributes to stability   in the producing countries and tends to translate to  more efficient operations and higher quality products. Our commitment is to choose and reward  responsible partners who share our values and are  willing to work with us to improve their social and  environmental practices. Increasingly, to leverage  similar sustainability and commercial benefits, we  are also working to improve conditions in other  parts of our valuechain. We have a set of policies in place that guide us  in our daily work. Additionally, we developed  Conscious Actions through which we are working  to fulfil this commitment.

The  Supplier Relationship Management strategy rests  on creating mutual benefits and long term strategic  business relationships with our best suppliers.  Well-managed business relationships can turn into  successful strategic alliances, based on shared risks  and shared rewards supporting sustainable business  performance. H&M considers open communication  and trust to be critical to the success of the  relationship. As part of this approach, suppliers are  grouped into different categories. Platinum and  Gold suppliers, for example, are long-term strategic  partners that share values and long term goals. Such  long-term partnerships provide mutual benefits for  the supplier, for example by securing stable business  through long term capacity planning up to 5 years  ahead. By the end of 2011, 150 of our 747 suppliers  were graded platinum or gold. These 150 suppliers  represent 58% of all production for H&M (see graph  2.3).

We work to constantly improve our audit methods  in order to ensure that we are getting an accurate  picture of supplier performance. This also helps  H&M and our suppliers to understand and address  the root causes of any non-compliance. Additional  independent monitoring helps verify our audit  systems. In 2011, we conducted a total of 2,024  audits (98 of these using our LAP-method). 964 of  these were head audits and 1,060 follow-up audits.  As a result of our efforts to increase the share of  unannounced head audits, their ratio went up to  78% (2010: 68%) (see graph 2.6). While the audit  intensity may differ substantially from country to  country based on the level of risk identified, on  average every factory was audited 1.2 times during  2011.

During 2011, we conducted 1,339 capacity building  activities, investing an estimated 5,300 person  hours. These activities are part of our strategy  to go beyond monitoring. Together with audits,  management systems analysis and screenings, this  leads to a high intensity of sustainability activity per  factory (2011: 3.3 activities per factory). Due to their  higher importance to our sourcing, we put a stronger  focus on key factories, leading to an average of 5.6  activities (see graph 2.19, p45).  hm.com/beyondmonitoring STrENgThEN SuppliEr OwNErShip  OvEr SuSTaiNabiliTy ThrOugh  CapaCiTy buildiNg this programme was still being rolled out at the end  of 2011, there were some very promising initial  results.

Often, however, suppliers do not have the  necessary competence in house to manage EHS issues  effectively. To address this, in 2011, we launched the  Building of Supplier EHS organisation programme.  This aims to build a corresponding role at our  supplier factories that works and communicates with  our production office EHS experts to help drive  improved performance. Looking at how this impacts  on compliance, we can see a clear positive trend (see  graph 2.10).  Building on this, in 2011 we initiated a capacity  building project together with internationally  renowned consultancy TUV Rheinland. Ten factories  with wet processes participated in the programme, as  these types of factories are often chemical intensive.  The aim was to support them in maintaining a system  for workplace organisation and cleanliness, while  significantly improving health and safety and  chemical management using the 5S method.

Following our first audits we  have seen a major improvement in practices in this  sector, which has rarely been the subject of auditing  by international brands. We have also had to reject  nine mills due to severe incidents of non-compliance,  mainly on minimum wages, missing fire alarms and  the use of banned chemicals (see graph 2.12).

This way, our suppliers  learn to identify weaknesses in their operations  better and we can mutually agree on targets for  improvement and actions to achieve these. The Joint  Audit Programme will initially be available only  for our strategic partners with an advanced in-house  sustainability organisation.

We have raised this concern with the Bangladeshi  Government and engaged the Bangladeshi University  of Engineering and Technology and a specialist  consultant to assess the electrical installation in  two factories. These assessments will be finalised in  Spring 2012. We have produced two training films  to increase fire safety awareness amongst employees  at all levels in garment factories.

The concept of a Fair  Wage takes into account living costs, profitability  and whether or not wages are set through  negotiations.

In order to understand the  underlying reasons for these worrying incidents,  H&M appointed external experts to evaluate these  factories. The challenge has been to find out why  these incidents happened only in Cambodia and at  factories producing different kinds of products, which  made it difficult to find a pattern. The investigation  reports do not point out one single reason or  explanation. Instead, they identified a number of  improvement opportunities, as well as a lack of  communication between managers and workers,  some of which was due to language barriers.

Westrive to be as energy efficient as possible and   to ensure that an ever-greater proportion of our  energy comes from renewable sources.  In the long term, we aspire to contribute to more  greenhouse gas reductions globally than our  operations emit. To achieve this aspiration we  need to use our influence to raise awareness and  encourage action on climate change well beyond  the scope of our direct operations. We are developing and supporting emissions  reduction initiatives – by working with transport  providers and supplier factories, by raising  awareness among the general public and by  lobbying governments for stricter legislation.

O ffering our customers fashion and quality  at the best price means that we need to  keep unnecessary costs down. Making the  most of the resources we buy and avoiding waste  at every stage of our value chain is central to this.  This resource efficiency also helps us to minimise the  negative environmental impact of our operations. Manufacturing waste, transport and product  packaging, shopping bags, shop fittings and  construction waste from building new stores are all  sources of waste generated across our operations.  We want to reduce, reuse or recycle wherever  possible. Our ultimate aim is to send zero waste  tolandfill. However, at H&M we believe that our commitment  to waste reduction should go beyond this.

This broad variation of circumstances poses a  challenge to implementing a consistent Group- wide approach. Our general requirement is that all  waste should be reused or recycled, such as transport  packaging and hangers. In order to have better  knowledge and control over our waste impacts  at a Group level, we are currently developing  a global waste strategy.

That is why we have switched to a recycled material  for all of our standard plastic consumer bags.

We have  also started to demand recycling reports for our  construction projects. F or many years, we have worked to use as little  transport packaging as possible.

At H&M, we recognise how important it is for all of  us to use natural resources responsibly, considering  the needs of both present and future generations.  Growing scarcity tends to mean rising costs, so  resource efficiency will increasingly be seen as a  source of competitive advantage in our industry.

As part of the plan, we also work  to strengthen the position of women by providing  grants for female students in higher education and by  setting up a helpline for women exposed to violence  and discrimination.  hm.com/bangladeshplan furThEr CONTribuTE TO a pOSiTivE  dEvElOpmENT iN baNgladESh 	7.0	 COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS RESULTING FROM  SALES OF CAUSE-RELATED PRODUCTS AND  DONATIONS RAISED AMONG CUSTOMERS 15,136,057 11,491,276 Cause-related products In-store donations Contents  CONSCIOUS ACTIONS 82   H&M Conscious Actions Sustainability Report 2011 COMMITMENT 7 — STRENGTHEN COMMUNITIES Timescale: onGoinG sTaTus snapshoT: 2,079 PeoPle with imProVed skills T he majority of our customers, our employees  and also our suppliers employees are women.  Strengthening their position in society and  in the labour market is therefore important to us.  Atthe same time, improving education among youth  and creating job opportunities for young people is  essential for the future growth and development of  many of the communities we operate in. Beside our  direct economic contribution, we invest in a number  of projects to support employment and education  among women and young people. Some are broad  programmes, such as our All for Children project (in  collaboration with UNICEF) and Hand in Hands  Village Upliftment Programme (a project supported  by the H&M Conscious Foundation). Others are  tailor-made local projects, such as our Women in  Retail project in Saudi Arabia, our own training  centre in Bangladesh, and scholarships for women in  Bangladesh. In 2011, 5,688 children enrolled into a  bridge school or formal education through our All for  Children project and another 2,079 people improved  their skills through otherprojects.  hm.com/communityprojects iNvEST iN mOrE EmplOymENT aNd EduCaTiON amONg wOmEN aNd yOuTh I want to give my  children a good  education.

To improve the situation for young workers, the  H&M Conscious Foundation has cooperated with  the Center for Child Right Corporate Social  Responsibility since 2009 to provide personal  development training sessions for young workers.  These focus on communication skills and career  and life planning to boost their social development.

Besides the  environmental benefits of this shift, sustainable cotton  production can improve the lives of millions of farmers  in developing countries. BCI helps to provide farmers  with the know-how and tools to improve farming  practices. This helps them to produce more with less  input, which reduces their impacts on the environment  and increases profitability and the welfare of the local  communities. Over 120,000 farmers (approximately  66,000 in India, 47,500 in Pakistan, over 10,000 in  Mali and 104 in Brazil) have been involved in the  initiative so far, all receiving dedicated training. H&M invested EUR 600,000 in 2011. A further  EUR700,000 each is committed for 2012 and 2013.  This helps us to increase the production of Better  Cotton in line with our demands for the 2012 and 2013  production seasons.  hm.com/cotton  bettercotton.org iNvEST iN bETTEr livElihOOd iN COTTON CulTivaTiNg arEaS by EduCaTiNg  farmErS ON mOrE SuSTaiNablE farmiNg TEChNiquES ThrOugh ThE bETTEr  COTTON iNiTiaTivE MONEY INVESTED IN BCI FARMER TRAINING 2010–2012 (IN EUR) 600,000 700,000 (planned) 700,000 (planned) 2011 2012 2013 NUMBER OF FARMERS TRAINED  120,000 66,000 104 10,000 47,500 Total Pakistan Mali India Brazil 	7.1	 	7.2	 Contents  CONSCIOUS ACTIONS 85   H&M Conscious Actions Sustainability Report 2011 COMMITMENT 7 — STRENGTHEN COMMUNITIES I n response to the devastating hunger catastrophe  in East Africa, H&M has donated USD 100,000  (SEK 637,020) to support UNICEFs relief  efforts.
