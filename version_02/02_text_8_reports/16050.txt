The business of Credit Suisse  AG, the Swiss bank subsidiary of the Group, is substantially   similar to the Group, and we use these terms to refer to both   when the subject is the same or substantially similar.

At   Credit Suisse, we had to address issues in three main areas. The first  was the extremely adverse operating environment triggered by the  sover eign debt crisis in Europe, historically low interest rates and  volatile financial markets. These factors impacted investor confidence  and significantly reduced levels of client activity. The situation was  exacerbated by the further strengthening of the Swiss franc. Second,  2011 brought new and far-reaching regulatory developments. As well   as preparing for Basel III, we had to address the impacts of Switzerlands  new Too Big to Fail legislation, which imposes a substantial capital  surcharge on major banks. The third challenge related to the cross-border  wealth management business. Here, the main themes were the  bilateral tax treaties signed by Switzerland with the UK and Germany,  as well as the US tax matter, which have significant implications for   the entire financial center. Against this backdrop, we remained focused on our first respon- sibility as a global bank of operating profitably across the economic  cycle, taking actions to generate sustained value for our clients, share-  holders and employees. In view of the challenges facing our business,  we took proactive steps to further evolve our integrated strategy.  These include measures to enhance profitability in Private Banking, to  reduce risk-weighted assets in Investment Banking and to redeploy  resources to faster-growing and large markets. As part of these steps,  we also announced a reduction in the size of our global workforce.  This was a very difficult decision, particularly in view of our commitment  to being a reliable long-term partner to our employees. We are ap-  proaching this measure in the most fair and responsible way possible.  As well as posing a challenge at an operational level, the adverse  environment in 2011 accentuated political and public concerns about  the stability of the financial system and provoked an intense debate  about the role of banks and their business models. In view of the high  degree of skepticism facing the financial sector and the continuing  controversy over compensation, it is crucial for our industry to learn the  necessary lessons and act appropriately. At Credit Suisse, we recog-  nize the need for banks to build sustainable business models. This   is vital for the long-term success of our industry. For the past five  years, we have been adjusting our business model, strengthening  capital and liquidity, reducing risk and exiting businesses that   are no longer viable in the new environment. We have worked with  regulators to help build a more stable financial system and adopted  the relevant measures at an early stage. To rebuild trust, we have also intensified our dialogue with stake-  holders. This dialogue must be used first and foremost to promote a  better understanding of the pivotal role that banks play in the economy  and society as a whole. Credit Suisses dialogue with stakeholders  Brady W. Dougan, Chief Executive Officer (left),   and Urs Rohner, Chairman of the Board of Directors  3 takes many forms. One example is our role in the regulatory debate –   particularly in Switzerland, where we continued to engage in intensive  discussions with politicians, regulators and other industry repre sen- tatives to help formulate proposals for the new Too Big to Fail  legislation in 2011. Having expressed our willingness to embrace  tougher regulations, we translated our words into action through   our early adoption of new capital rules as well as the private placement  of CHF5.9billion Tier1 Buffer Capital Notes and the public issue   of USD2billion Tier2 Buffer Capital Notes – demonstrating the  viability of the market for contingent convertible bonds and reaffirming  our position as a first mover.  Our dialogue with clients is more critical than ever at times such  as these. We listen carefully to our clients in order to understand their  evolving requirements, gauge their level of satisfaction and find ways  of enhancing our products and services. Our cross-border platform is  an important part of the way we serve private banking clients around  the world, and we made good progress in further reinforcing our com-  pliance and control culture in this area during the year.  We know from our dialogue with the public that business practices  in the finance industry are coming under increased scrutiny amid   calls for a more responsible and sustainable approach to banking.   At Credit Suisse, we are committed to operating in strict accordance  with the applicable rules and regulations in all our markets globally.   We believe that each and every employee has a role to play in this con-  text. In 2011, we adopted our revised Code of Conduct, which provides  the framework for our approach to corporate responsibility. It defines   a series of ethical values and professional standards that are binding  on all Credit Suisse employees worldwide and guide us in our daily  work. The Code of Conduct also sets out our commitment to sustain- ability and our pledge to uphold key agreements such as the United  Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEPFI) and the  UN Global Compact.  As a global bank, we are very conscious of the importance of   a stable social environment for our long-term success. We recognize   the need to help build strong communities where individuals and  businesses can thrive. From our dialogue with young people – of which  our international Youth Barometer survey is one example – we know  that unemployment is one of the greatest concerns among todays  younger generation. As well as offering attractive apprenticeships,  training positions and career start programs for high school and uni-  versity graduates, we have continued our efforts to tackle youth  unemployment in our Swiss home market  funding coaching for  school-leavers seeking employment and providing risk capital to small  and medium-sized enterprises that can create jobs.  Our social commitments also extend beyond our core activities   as a bank. For many years, we have been committed to improving the  life chances of disadvantaged individuals around the globe. Here, our  activities focus on two main themes – education and microfinance –   and are designed to empower people to find a way out of poverty and  realize their aspirations. Our Global Education Initiative works on the  principle that access to schooling gives young people a brighter future,  while our Microfinance Capacity Building Initiative aims to help those  at the base of the income pyramid by promoting financial inclusion.  Employee engagement is another important element of our social  commitments: many of our people want to make a personal contribu- tion by participating in social projects or volunteering schemes in our  individual regions. In 2011, 17,415Credit Suisse employees worldwide  volunteered a total of 189,000hours to help others.  Our philanthropic commitments are complemented by the work   of the Disaster Relief Fund of the Credit Suisse Foundation, which  offers financial aid to the victims of natural or manmade disasters   such as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. In addition, our regional  foundations support a broad range of charitable activities – particularly  in the field of education – in their respective areas of operation. Credit Suisses focus on environmental and climate protection is  also a critical aspect of our corporate responsibilities. We are com-  mitted to sustainability and to conducting our business in an environ- mentally friendly manner. We therefore operate an ISO-certified  environmental management system, which helps us to make more  efficient use of resources throughout the company, reduce the  environmental impacts of our activities and comply with green stan-  dards. Our efforts to protect the environment are also reflected   in many of our client-facing activities: our Green Business Initiative  plays a key role here, bringing together experts from across the   bank to promote products and services in areas such as renewable  energies and clean technologies. We also routinely assess trans- actions with clients that could pose environmental or social risks using  our internal risk review process and apply our own policies and   guidelines – such as the forestry and mining policies we revised in   2011 – to business activities involving sensitive industries. Credit Suisse  has been active in the area of climate protection for over a decade.  During this time, we have not only succeeded in reducing our green-  house gas emissions while growing our business but have also inten-  sified our focus on climate-related aspects in our provision of products  and services  as demonstrated by our market-leading position as a  supplier of financing for the wind and solar energy sectors.  As you read this report, you will see that we take our corporate  responsibilities seriously at Credit Suisse: they are part of our culture  and help to shape the way we create value for our stakeholders.   This publication is also a tangible expression of our commitment to  engaging in an open and constructive dialogue. An active exchange   of views is more critical than ever in todays closely interconnected  world if we are to collectively find solutions to the challenges we   all face. In this spirit of dialogue, we welcome your feedback on the  topics presented in our report. Best regards    Urs Rohner  Brady W. Dougan Chairman of the Board of Directors Chief Executive Officer March 2012  Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Our Understanding of Corporate Responsibility 4 Our Understanding of Corporate  Responsibility At Credit Suisse, we are convinced that our responsible approach to  business is a decisive factor determining the long-term success   of our bank. As well as complying with the professional standards   and ethical values set out in our Code of Conduct, we strive to   assume our corporate responsibilities in every aspect of our work.   We do so based on our broad understanding of our duties as a  financial services provider, member of society and employer. Our  approach also reflects our commitment to the environment and   the importance we assign to our dialogue with our stakeholders   (see chart on page 5).

Competence, diligence  and responsible conduct are key to the  success of our business. We also strive to  take social and environmental aspects into  account when carrying out our operations. Responsibility   in Society   Role in Economy and Society   Social Commitments  Sponsorship Credit Suisse sees itself as an integral   part of society and recognizes its respon-   sibilities beyond banking. That is why   we support a number of humanitarian and  charitable organizations and projects  around the world, as well as cultural and  sporting events. We also encourage   our employees to volunteer their time to  assist charitable projects. Responsibility   as an Employer   Credit Suisse as an Employer  Global Diversity and Inclusion Qualified and motivated employees are   a vital success factor. We want to be   an employer of choice worldwide and  therefore offer our people progressive  working conditions, attractive training  programs and varied career opportunities  in a multicultural environment. Responsibility   for the Environment  Environment, Climate and    Operational Ecology The protection of the natural environ- ment is one of the most pressing issues  of our time. At Credit Suisse, we take  our responsibilities seriously by pro-  moting the efficient use of resources   and by engaging in a dialogue with our  stakeholders. We also develop products  and services that focus on environmental  themes for our clients. Dialogue and Transparency     Dialogue with Stakeholders  Reporting on Corporate Responsibility We cultivate an open dialogue with our clients, shareholders   and other stakeholders by participating in events, engaging   in personal discussions and contributing to the public debate.   This increases mutual understanding and helps us to identify   the needs of our stakeholders, while rapidly responding to new  trends. Code of Conduct Our Code of Conduct, which sets out binding principles   for all our operations worldwide, increases the personal  responsibility of all our employees and Board members   and creates a framework where each individual is familiar  with Credit Suisses corporate responsibilities.

We want to act as a reliable and professional partner to our clients  placing   their interests first and delivering expert advice to help them realize their   financial objectives. We are also convinced that our capital strength and strict  compliance and control culture give stakeholders confidence in our bank. Gaining and maintaining the trust of our stakeholders is  critical to the long-term success of our company. As a  global bank, we strive to act as a trusted and pro fessional  financial partner to our clients worldwide  private indi- viduals, companies, institutions and governments  in every  phase of the economic cycle. We aim to inspire confidence  by executing our core activities skillfully and responsibly    providing access to capital, managing assets, steering  capital flows and assessing risks. Our integrated model,  which combines our Private Banking, Investment Banking  and Asset Management businesses, delivers the entire   expertise of our global team of specialists to our clients. Our  know-how and the relationships of trust we have built  become even more critical in economically challenging times  such as 2011, as clients seek additional support and advice. Analyzing Our Clients Needs The structured advisory process in Private Banking is one  example of our client-centric approach; it helps us to  understand our individual clients and to gain an insight into  their overall financial position in order to develop holistic  solutions to meet their needs. The advisory process is based  on a series of clearly defined steps, making it trans parent  and giving clients a greater sense of security and confidence.  The quality and depth of our advice is enhanced through  instruments such as our Portfolio Risk Analyzer. This tool is  used to assess whether a portfolio matches the clients  profile and to identify the returns that can be expected in  mild markets or the potential risks in volatile markets    Ensuring Advisory Quality: Certification of Relationship Managers As part of our commitment to continuously improving  the quality of advice we offer our clients in Private  Banking, Credit Suisse runs a mandatory certification  program for employees with direct client contact.  The certification, which is valid for three years, forms  part of the Frontline Training initiative launched in  2009 to ensure all relationship managers can provide  clients with clear and comprehensive information  about products, explain potential investment risks  and returns, and tailor their offering to individual  client needs. The certification process entails three  components: two Web-based modules to test   the candidates knowledge of subjects related to  their function and a Client Interaction Simulation   in the presence of financial experts. In 2011, a total  of 1,824relationship managers successfully passed  the certification process. Credit Suisse intends to  complete the certification of all frontline employees  in Private Banking by the end of 2012. thus providing clear and objective information to support  client investment decisions. In Investment Banking, our client-focused strategy  forms the basis for the long-standing relationships we   have cultivated with many of our key clients. We are able   to deliver expert advice to these com panies because   we know their businesses intimately and can work with  them as partners  and our relationship evolves alongside  them. Trust is built continuously with each successful  transaction.  The suitability and appropriateness of the advice  offered to clients is an increasingly prominent theme in our  industry, where measures are being taken to strengthen  investor protection and regulate the client consultation  process. Credit Suisse is committed to ensuring that clients  have a full understanding of the financial products offered  to them and can bear the associated risks.  Financial Strength Inspires Trust Credit Suisse has been pursuing an integrated client-  oriented and capital-efficient strategy since 2007. Capital  strength and stability are other critical factors that many  clients now consider in their choice of financial partner   especially in the current climate of change and uncertainty.  Our focus on prudent capital management  coupled   with our conservative funding position and robust risk  oversight  have served the bank well during a period of  unprecedented market volatility. As a result, we attracted  Continued on page 8  Four-year trend: overall satisfaction Very  satisfied Not  satisfied Satisfied 2008 59%  91% 32%  9%  2011 61%  95% 34%  5%  2010 56%  93% 37%  7%  2009 55%  91% 36%  9%  Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility in Banking 8 CHF40.9billion of net new asset inflows in 2011 from  clients seeking the professional service and advice   of a solid and stable global bank. The numerous accolades  we received during the year  including the prestigious  Euromoney awards for Best Global Wealth Management  House, Best Private Bank Globally and Best Bank in  Switzerland  are also an expression of our clients satis-  faction with our offering and their high level of confidence   in our bank.  Committed to Compliance and Control Maintaining a robust compliance and control culture is  another important way in which we gain the trust of clients,  as well as investors and regulators. At Credit Suisse,   we strive to conduct our activities according to the highest  standards of due diligence and in strict compliance with  legal and regulatory requirements in all our markets globally.  We expect each employee to be personally accountable   for ensuring the activities within their remit are compliant  with our internal rules and policies and for reporting or  escalating issues of concern. This is essential to safeguard  the interests of clients and investors and to protect our   own business activities and reputation. Our focus on  compliance is also mirrored by our proactive steps to further  strengthen our cross-border framework. We want to  maintain the highest professional standards while operating  in different legal and regulatory environments around   the world. Our cross-border framework helps us to achieve  this by providing training, practical information and   country-specific guidance to employees with direct client  contact to make sure they understand which activities   are permissible in which countries. We continuously monitor  developments relating to this field and adjust our internal  policies accordingly. A Pioneering Response to New Regulations  The need to restore trust in the global financial system  remained a dominant theme through 2011. At Credit Suisse,  we played a constructive part in the debate about banking  supervision and supported regulatory reforms within our  industry. For example, we continued to engage in intensive  discussions with politicians, regulators and other parties   in Switzerland surrounding proposals for the new Too Big  to Fail legislation during the year. We also played a pio-  neering role in the development of contingent convertible  bonds  announcing the private placement of CHF5.9bil- lion Tier1 Buffer Capital Notes and the public issue of  USD2billion Tier2 Buffer Capital Notes in February 2011.  Global Service Monitor Program: Evaluating Client Satisfaction We take the issue of client satisfaction very seriously.  We want to ensure that our products and services  meet the needs of our clients, that our value propo-  sition is clearly visible and that client relationships  are managed professionally and responsibly. Each  year, our dedicated Client Insight Management team  conducts the Global Service Monitor Program – a  study of more than 20,000Private Banking clients  and service users worldwide – to assess their overall  level of satisfaction with our offering based on a set  of experience criteria and to find out whether they  would recommend Credit Suisse as a financial part-  ner. We also look at the main factors driving the  acquisition of new clients and benchmark our perfor-  mance against our competitors. Our findings are  then translated into action. We may take steps at   an individual level if respondents share their names  with the company or we implement measures   at market, divisional or regional level in the case   of other feedback. The results of the 2011 Global  Service Monitor Program indicate that 95%   of our Private Banking clients are satisfied with   our offering.  9 Developments in Global Banking At Credit Suisse, we view our business from a global  perspective. We offer products and services on a  cross-border basis  known as international banking   as well as on a local basis, referred to as onshore  banking. In response to changing client needs,  Credit Suisse has been growing its global presence  and onshore services for many years. Credit Suisse  is now active in more than 50 countries worldwide,  including our Swiss home market. Our Private Banking  operates 21 booking centers outside Switzerland,  which means that we can administer our clients  assets in their home country or in an international  hub. At the same time, the Swiss financial center  remains attractive to international clients in the area  of our cross-border business in view of its numerous  strengths relative to other financial centers around  the globe, such as its efficient system of uni-  versal banking  with the hallmarks of expertise,  reliability and quality  as well as favorable  framework conditions such as political and eco-  nomic stability, a strong currency, first-class  services and highly-qualified employees. The  banking services offered out of Switzerland   will therefore remain important  particularly in  response to the needs of sophisticat ed clients   in emerging markets. Ensuring strict compliance  with all applicable legislation when offering cross-  border services is an indispensable part of our  business model at Credit Suisse. We have therefore  been working intensively for years to make sure   that all our activities adhere to the applicable rules  and regulations in Switzerland and abroad. Challenge: Address cross-border legacy and tax compliance  issues.  Response: Credit Suisse addressed these issues in various  ways: We included an explicit statement in our Code of  Conduct not to assist clients in activities intended to breach  their tax obligations. We continued to support the withhold- ing tax concept as well as the related tax treaty negotiations  of the Swiss government with Germany and the UK. In  connection with the government discussions about legacy  issues relating to the Swiss banks cross-border business,  we supported the ongoing efforts of the US and Switzerland  to reach a resolution that is acceptable to both countries.  We continued our considerable efforts to establish the origin  of the funds that Private Banking clients deposit with the  bank, e.g. through anti-money laundering measures. Challenge: Find a solution to the Too Big to Fail issue  while maintaining the international competitiveness   of the Swiss banks.  Response: We participated constructively in the Swiss  Expert Commission and in the parliamentary debate about  the Too Big to Fail issue, providing input and propos-  als and offering an international perspective. We were also  actively involved in the relevant consultations and com- municated our views either directly or through industry  associations. In addition, we played a pioneering role in the  development of contingent convertible bonds, announcing  the private placement of CHF5.9billion Tier1 Buffer Capital  Notes and the public issue of USD2billion Tier2 Buffer  Capital Notes in early 2011. Challenges and Responses 2011 This transaction was a landmark moment in the establish- ment of the market for contingent convertible bonds and  represented a further step in Credit Suisses early transition  to the new Swiss capital requirements. We anticipate that  2012 and 2013 will be years of significant transformation  within our industry and we intend to further evolve our  integrated strategy in line with these changes. At the same  time, we will continue to support the process of regulatory  reform, which we regard as an essential factor in rebuilding  confidence and creating a more sustainable banking   sector. Maintaining our strong compliance and control culture  throughout the bank remains a priority in 2012. www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/banking  Credit Suisses principal locations are:   Zurich, Geneva, London, New York, So Paulo,  Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo.  Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility in Banking 10 Corporate Governance The way we interact with our stakeholders is fundamental for our business   and our success. We strive to act with integrity, responsibility, fairness,   transparency and discretion at all times in order to secure the trust of our   clients, shareholders and employees, as well as other stakeholders. Credit Suisses corporate governance complies with  internationally accepted standards. We fully adhere to the  principles set out in the Swiss Code of Best Practice,  including its appendix stipulating recommendations on the  process around setting compensation for the Board of   Directors and the Executive Board. In connection with   our primary listing on the SIX Swiss Exchange, we are  subject to the SIX Directive on Information Relating to  Corporate Governance. Our shares are also listed on the  New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of American   Depositary Shares. As a result, we are subject to certain  US rules and regulations.  Our Governance Framework Our corporate governance policies and procedures are laid  out in a series of documents governing the organization   and management of Credit Suisse. The Board of Directors  has adopted a set of corporate governance guidelines  aimed at explaining and promoting an understanding of our  governance structure. Other important corporate gover- nance documents include the Articles of Association, the  Code of Conduct, the Organizational Guidelines and  Regulations, the Charters of the Board of Directors and   of each of its committees, and the global Compensation  Policy. Adherence to our Code of Conduct is binding for all  employees and members of the Board of Directors.  Furthermore, our employees must maintain the highest  standards of compliance with all legal, regulatory and inter-  nal requirements. They are asked to observe strict standards  of professional conduct at all times. Compliance consider- ations are critically important when selecting employees,  developing training tools, and defining processes and rules,  and are a vital element of all our supervisory and control  systems.  Shareholder Rights As part of our continued efforts relating to good corporate  governance, we encourage investors to participate in the  Annual General Meeting and to execute their voting rights.  To support their decision-making process, we are committed  to ensuring the accuracy and transparency of our reporting  publications and our Investor Relations website. We are  committed to producing precise, reliable and comprehensible  financial reports that clearly explain our performance,   our mission and our strategic rationale. Moreover, we are  committed to employing a responsible compensation  approach that ensures a prudent approach to risk-taking  and aligns our employees interests with those of our  shareholders, thus motivating the creation of sustainable  shareholder value (see box). In line with best practice,   the Board of Directors submits the compensation report   of Credit Suisse to its shareholders for a consultative vote   at the Annual General Meeting. Managing Risk  Our Risk Management function plays a central role in our  organization as it fosters a disciplined risk culture and  creates appropriate transparency, providing a sound basis  for management to define a suitable risk profile. Risk  Management is instrumental in ensuring a prudent and  intelligent approach to risk-taking that appropriately bal-  ances risk and return and optimizes the allocation of capital  throughout the Group. Moreover, through a proactive   risk management culture and the use of state-of-the-art  quantitative and qualitative tools, we strive to minimize   the potential for undesired risk exposures in our operations.  Further information on corporate governance can be found   in the Annual Report 2011 of Credit Suisse Group or at:   www.credit-suisse.com/governance  Taking a Responsible Approach to Compensation Credit Suisse is committed to pursuing a responsible approach to compensation that  focuses on long-term performance and aligns the interests of employees and shareholders.  For 2011, we reduced discretionary variable incentive awards (variable compensation),  reflecting the lower absolute performance of the Credit Suisse Group compared to 2010.  Variable compensation awarded for 2011 was down 41% compared to 2010. For the Group  overall, 49% of variable awards for 2011 were deferred. Each member of the Executive  Board had 100% of their variable compensation deferred. For 2011, deferred variable  awards were granted in the form of share awards, of which the majority are performance  share awards that are subject to claw-back provisions, and in the form of 2011 Partner  Asset Facility (PAF2) awards for senior employees. PAF2 units are linked to a diversified  portfolio of derivative counterparty risks. The PAF2 plan is therefore a transfer of risk from  the Group to employees, thereby contributing to risk reduction and capital efficiency.  11 At Credit Suisse, we are convinced that we can only achieve  long-term success by adopting a responsible approach   to business. This includes striving to meet the highest  standards of trustworthiness, integrity, risk awareness and  transparency when performing our activities. We therefore  expect our employees to approach their work in a highly  professional, fair and prudent manner. Our Code of Conduct  provides us with a binding framework of ethical values   and professional standards that apply to all employees  worldwide and to the members of our Board of Directors.  The obligation to observe the Code of Conduct is an  integral part of our employment contracts and is included   in the annual employee review process. The Code of  Conduct also sets out Credit Suisses commitment to  sustainability and our pledge to uphold the corresponding  national and international agreements. In addition,   our Statement on Sustainability sets out our objectives,  principles and processes in this field. In 2011, we up-  dated this document to take account of factors such as our  internal sustainability management and our conscientious  approach when addressing sustainability-related risks. Upholding International Agreements A key international sustainability agreement for banks is   the United Nations Environment Programme Finance  Initiative (UNEPFI), of which Credit Suisse was one of the  first signatories in 1992. More than 200banks, insurers   and investment funds are now involved in this initiative to  promote a sustainable approach to business within the  finance industry. As well as participating in the UNEPFI  Global Roundtable, Credit Suisse contributed to the   work of groups of experts on topics such as biodiversity   and human rights. Another important agreement is   the UN Global Compact, of which we were one of the first  signatories in 2000. Together with over 6,000other  companies, we have pledged to observe 10principles in   the areas of human rights, labor standards, environ-  mental protection and anti-corruption efforts (see table on  page58). Due Diligence and Sustainability Credit Suisse has to continuously earn the trust of clients and other stake holders  to achieve long-term success. We therefore expect our employees to meet   the highest standards of conduct and professionalism and to comply with   legal regulations, due diligence requirements and industry guidelines. When  perform ing our core business activities, we also take account of environmental  and social issues. Respecting Human Rights At Credit Suisse, we recognize our responsibility to respect  human rights in line with the principles on human and labor  rights set out in the UN Global Compact and the UNs  Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We also base our  approach on the Protect, Respect and Remedy Framework  drawn up by the former UN Special Representative   on Business and Human Rights, Prof. John Ruggie, which  defines the responsibilities of states and companies   for human rights and sets out the corresponding guiding  principles to implement them. To support the adoption   of these principles in the banking sector, Credit Suisse and  other European banks are currently working proactively   with academic experts to develop industry-specific recom-  mendations for how they can be applied in practice.  The area in which Credit Suisse has the most direct  impact on the protection of human rights is in its relationship  with employees. This includes aspects such as guarantee- ing fair working conditions, equal opportunities and  protection against discrimination, as well as recognizing the  right of employees to join or establish a union. Even if Credit Suisse only has indirect influence over  suppliers and external service providers, this is nevertheless  an area in which human rights issues can arise. In 2010,   we introduced our Suppliers Code of Conduct that prescribes  new standards with the goal of ensuring that our suppliers  and service providers also respect human rights, labor rights,  employment laws and environmental regulations and,   in particular, do not tolerate the use of child labor or forced  labor. We also encourage our business partners to make  continuous improvements in this area and to go beyond the  minimum legal requirements. Another area in which Credit Suisse could be indirectly  confronted with human rights issues is in our relationship  with clients. Challenges arise if clients engage in activities  that could lead to potential violations of these rights  as in  the case of major resettlements or measures affecting the  sacred sites of local communities or indigenous peoples.   In such cases, Credit Suisse examines sensitive aspects of   Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility in Banking 12 the transactions in a clearly defined, comprehensive risk  review process and rejects transactions that do not meet  our standards.  Voluntary Industry Standards As well as observing international agreements, Credit Suisse  complies with voluntary industry standards that set out spe-  cific due diligence requirements for certain areas of business.  We conduct our project finance activities in accordance with  the Equator Principles, which are based on environmental  and social standards defined by the World Bank Group.   More than 70 international financial institutions have pledged   to examine the possible human or environmental effects of  resource or infrastructure projects on the basis of social and  environmental impact assessments and to call on clients to  develop specific measures to reduce or correct any potential  negative consequences before agreeing to provide finance  or advice. Credit Suisse was one of the first companies to sign  up to the Equator Principles in 2003 and we have since report-  ed annually on our efforts to implement them. Since 2010,  we have been actively involved in the Equator Principles  Steering Committee, as well as in some of its working groups  to discuss the scope of the Principles and to conduct   a dialogue with non-government organizations (NGOs).   As a member of the Governance Task Force, we are also  contributing to the development of the Equator Principles III.  By adopting the Carbon Principles in 2008, Credit  Suisse pledged to implement an additional industry  standard for managing carbon-related risk in the US power  generation sector. A key feature is an enhanced due  diligence process that applies when a client is planning to  build new coal-fired power plants. In 2011, Credit Suisse  was involved in three transactions that were subject to the  Carbon Principles and its due diligence process, which   calls for the use of shadow carbon pricing to understand  how the future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions   may affect power plants.

Future  economic growth will partly depend on the supply   of energy or raw materials by these sectors. At   the same time, it is vital for them to operate in a  sustainable manner. Our sector policies and guide-  lines set out the environmental and social standards  that we expect clients in certain sensitive sectors to  observe when conducting their activities. They also  exclude certain activities. Exceptions may only be  granted individually based on our Reputational Risk  Review Process (RRRP). Summaries of these  policies and guidelines are available online at:  www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/doc/  policy_summaries_en.pdf  Forestry and Agribusiness Policy  Responsible management of the following issues:  habitat depletion; fragmentation and degradation;  water contamination and usage; hazardous materials  management; air emissions; worker and community  health and safety; public involvement; consultation  and disclosure.

Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility in Banking 14 Guidelines for Sensitive Industries We are aware of our increased responsibilities when doing  business with clients that operate in sensitive industries  such as oil and gas, mining, hydropower, forestry or palm oil  production. In the case of potential transactions with clients  from these sectors, we have introduced specific policies  and guidelines that apply to our business globally and require  these clients to minimize the environmental effects of their  operations, to ensure the health and safety of their employ-  ees, and to respect the human rights of the population living  in the surrounding areas (see summary on page 13). These  industry-specific policies, which are in line with the standards  applied by international organizations such as the UN and  the World Bank Group, also feature a list of activities and  business practices that we explicitly will not finance. Further Development of Policies and Standards As part of the further development of our guidelines for  these sectors, we extended our forestry policy in 2011 to  include agricultural operations such as plantations or   cattle ranching on land that has been cleared of forests.   In our policy on mining, we state that we will not finance   the practice of mountain top removal  a process used   in coal mining that is harmful to the environment (see box   on page16). The strict position adopted by Credit Suisse   in this area has been recognized by environmental protection  groups such as the National Resources Defense Council  (NRDC) and Rainforest Action Network (RAN). Following  the entry into force of the International Convention on  Cluster Munitions, Credit Suisse has taken steps to ensure  that it does not engage in any business relationships with  the manufacturers of these types of arms and that any such  business activities are being terminated. Furthermore,  Credit Suisse will not hold any securities on its own account  in companies that manufacture these munitions or include  them in investment funds that it actively manages or in client  portfolios covered by discretionary portfolio management  agreements. At Credit Suisse, we endeavor to systematically take  account of themes such as human rights, biodiversity,   the scarcity of resources and climate change when assess-  ing risks in our business relations with clients. This poses   a number of challenges that we will continue to address in  the future to make progress in this area. The very nature   of our business means that it is sometimes necessary for  Credit Suisse to take decisions on controversial trans- actions, the environmental and social impacts of which can  be viewed very differently depending on the opinions and  standpoints of the relevant stakeholders. We are committed  to transparency and we engage in an intensive dialogue  with a broad range of stakeholders to deepen our under- standing of the issues concerned and to make it easier for  external parties to understand our processes and standards  Sustainability Risk Assessments in 2011   Transactions assessed1  Equator Principles transactions2    2011  2010    2011    2010       Number 3  Volume4  Number 3  Volume4 By region  282  279  13  4,388  5  336 Americas  44  47  0  0  1  30 Asia Pacific  86  105  7  443  0  0 Europe, Middle  East and Africa  71  58  2  1,020  0  0 Switzerland  81  69  4  2,925  4  306 By sector  282  279  13  4,388  5  336 Mining  104  105  8  463  4  161 Forestry  21  38  0  0  0  0 Oil and gas  52  50  3  275  1  175 Energy  16  24  2  3,650  0  0 Hydropower  1  2  0  0  0  0 Chemicals  18  9  0  0  0  0 Defense  16  15  0  0  0  0 Other  54  36  0  0  0  0 By category 5      13  4,388  5  336 Category A      4  2,820  2  225 Category B      9  1,568  3  111 Category C      0  0  0  0 By financial  product type      13  4,388  5  336 Project finance      12  3,388  5  336 Project finance  advisory      1  1,000  0  0 1 Excluding Equator Principles transactions. 2 More comprehensive data on Equator Principles transactions is available on our website   (https://www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/en/banking/equator_principles.jsp). 3 Transactions screened for the first time in the reporting year. 4 In USD million.            5 Equator Principles projects are divided into different risk categories (A–C; A being the highest risk),  and additional clarifications and action are initiated if required by the degree of risk involved.  15 (see page 52). We encourage our clients to follow the   same approach. Risk Review Process We expect all our employees to preserve the integrity of   our bank and to safeguard its reputation. Credit Suisses  business policy therefore excludes the provision of ser-  vices or the execution of transactions that are not compatible  with the agreements in place or with our own internal  guidelines and policies, or that could pose unacceptable  risks. If we have grounds to believe that a transaction   could pose such a risk, Credit Suisse first carries out a  detailed internal risk review process  consulting with  independent external specialists where necessary. During  this process, detailed assessments are carried out  regarding the nature and purpose of the transaction, the  identity of the potential client and the regulatory, political  and social background, as well as the potential environ- mental and social impacts of the clients activities.  If the transaction entails a potential risk for environ- mental or human rights-related reasons, the analysis is  performed by Sustainability Affairs. This internal specialist  unit evaluates whether the potential client complies with   the relevant industry standards and whether the transaction  is compatible with Credit Suisses policies and guidelines   for sensitive sectors. It also examines whether, for example,  any disputes have arisen between the client and local  communities or NGOs. The findings of this review process are submitted to a  regional officer within Legal & Compliance or Risk Manage- ment who  independently of the client-facing unit  can  assess the transaction and decide whether to approve it,  approve it subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions,   or reject it. In the case of especially complex or interregional  transactions, the final decision may be referred to the  Reputational Risk Sustainability Committee (RRSC), which  is the most senior decision-making body in the reputa-  tional risk review process and develops the strategy for this  area. The RRSC consists of members of the Executive  Board and cross-divisional specialist units (including Legal  & Com pliance, Risk Management, Communications and  Public Policy) and is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer of  Credit Suisse. In 2011, we analyzed a total of 295transactions using  the risk review process to determine whether they posed   an environmental or human rights-related risk. In total, 246  (83%) were approved  including 59 (20%) that were  authorized subject to certain conditions  and 49 (17%)  were rejected or not pursued further. In most cases where  transactions or clients were rejected, this decision was  reached because they were not compliant with Credit Suisse  policies and guidelines or because they presented an  unacceptable risk for the bank. Where transactions were   not pursued, this was primarily due to adverse market  conditions or the fact that significant additional investiga- tions were required, the outcome of which was uncertain.  These statistics do not include potential transactions or  business relationships that were submitted to the relevant  relationship manager but were not subsequently included   in the formal risk review process. This reflects the fact that  they were immediately identified by the relationship man-  ager or his or her line manager as being non-compliant  with the banks requirements and guidelines and were  therefore rejected. Risk Review Tools We further refined our risk review tools in 2011. For   example, factors such as Credit Suisses role in the  transaction, the industry sector and country of operation,  client commitment and capacity are now systematically  taken into account using our risk assessment tool.   We also made technical enhancements to our intranet- based risk review system. In addition, we developed   a new learning module that focuses on sustainability risks  and implemented a training concept that includes the  following three modules:  General training on Credit Suisse and sustainability.  Training on the risk review process for employees   with client contact.  Sector-specific training courses on the risk review  process for relationship managers serving clients   in industries that are of relevance for the environment.  As well as further developing our guidelines and   policies for sensitive industries, we will continue to develop  our processes in line with evolving challenges in the   future. In 2012, we will strive to identify and address issues  such as climate risks even more systematically using   our risk review process by examining aspects such as the  CO2 intensity of companies, their energy efficiency and  related future targets. Preventing Misuse of Our Products,   Strengthening Our Control Culture The legal and regulatory environment in which global banks  operate has continued to evolve over the past few years.   In this new environment, Credit Suisse remains committed  to adhering to the laws and regulations that are applicable  to our businesses, and we expect all our employees world-  wide to meet the highest standards of integrity. To secure  the long-term success of our business and protect our  reputation, employees must comply with applicable laws  and regulations and prevent the improper use of our   products and services by third parties. To support these  efforts, we implement internal controls, work with the  relevant authorities and adopt important rules such as those  relating to business relations with politically exposed   Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility in Banking 16 Credit Suisses Position on Mountain Top Removal Mountain Top Removal (MTR) is a form of surface  mining that involves removing surface layers   of coal-rich areas using explosives to expose the  coal seams beneath. Once the coal has been  extracted, the debris  generally laden with mining  by-products  is often dumped in neighboring  valleys, potentially contaminating streams. Studies  have shown that MTR can have severe environ mental  impacts, such as the loss of biodiversity, as well as  being detrimental to human health due to exposure  to polluted streams or the inhalation of toxins   and dust. Recognizing the social and environmental  effects of this mining practice and the regulatory,  reputational and financial risks it poses, Credit Suisse  strengthened its position on MTR in 2009 by exclud-  ing financing MTR operations in its Global Mining  Policy. In 2011, the US NGOs Rainforest Action  Network and the Sierra Club once again produced a  Mountain Top Removal (MTR) Policy Scorecard   to assess the position of 10 leading banks in this  area. In view of our strict stance and the clear way in  which it is enforced within our business, Credit Suisse  was again assigned the grade A– in 2011 – the  highest ranking of all the banks covered.  persons and those relating to the prevention of money  laundering and terrorist financing.  International regulatory authorities have emphasized  the need to prevent acts of corruption in recent years.   In response, we have revised our global minimum standards  relating to the prevention of corruption. Our employees   are required to regularly complete online training on subjects  such as the prevention of money laundering and terrorist  financing, as well as legislation relating to compliance with  sanctions and the prevention of corruption. Credit Suisse  also contributes to the further development of industry stan-  dards concerning the issues of money laundering and  terrorist financing through our involvement in the Wolfsberg  Group, an association of 11 global banks. More generally, Credit Suisse employees are required  to report instances of potential legal or regulatory infractions  or cases of possible ethical misconduct to their line manager  or the General Counsel division. Credit Suisse employees  worldwide can also report any such incidents or concerns  by contacting our Integrity Hotline, where they can speak   to an advisor anonymously. Finally, our Internal Audit depart-  ment monitors the banks compliance with our policies on  an ongoing basis. www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/banking Challenge: The nature of certain areas of business means  that we must sometimes take decisions on controversial  transactions, the environmental or social impacts of which  can be viewed differently by various stakeholders. Response: We are aware of these challenges and therefore  conduct a detailed risk review process, consulting with  independent specialists where necessary. We strive to  comply with laws, regulations and strict industry standards  when reviewing risks, and we consistently adapt our internal  processes to reflect new developments. Challenge: A business transaction may be legal but could  nevertheless have negative consequences for the bank   by posing a financial risk or a reputational risk due to its  environmental or social impacts. Response: We apply our bank-wide risk review process and  policy to thoroughly examine actions and transactions  before they are executed. A total of 295transactions were  examined in 2011.

Our investments  target sustainable companies and technologies and, at   the same time, accommodate the growing client interest in  this area. When developing products and services in   this field, Credit Suisse works with experts from research  institutes, non-governmental organizations and leading  think-tanks. These partnerships enable us to meet our clients  need for the latest information on promising, future-  oriented business opportunities. Private Banking Credit Suisse recognizes that investors may have unique  investment goals when selecting solutions that meet their  financial and extra-financial goals. To help investors navigate  this potentially complex field, our Responsible Investment  and Philanthropy Services (RI-PS) Framework (see page21)  maps investment solutions based on three pillars:  Philanthropy Services, including both the establishment  of trusts or foundations and the provision of services   such as asset management for entities where the investors  priority is to support social and/or address environmental  causes through charitable donations.   Impact Investments, which seek to generate a social and/ or environmental impact combined with moderate financial  returns. Sustainable Products and Services Sustainability is viewed by investors as an important megatrend and increasing  numbers of them are showing an interest in investments that incorporate eco- nomic, environmental and social considerations. At Credit Suisse, we offer a  broad range of sustainable products and services that give investors access to  these new market opportunities.   Sustainable Investments, which target maximized risk-  adjusted financial returns via sustainability trends such as  renewable energy.  In the area of Philanthropy Services, Credit Suisse has,  for many years, been assisting clients in Switzerland who  wish to support charitable causes (see box on page19). In  2011, we launched SymAsia  the first charitable foundation  for our Asian clients. Another new initiative is the Global  Philanthropy Campus held in New York in September 2011,  which provides a platform so that clients can engage in  philanthropic endeavors and establish international contacts. In terms of Impact Investments, our flagship activity is  our microfinance platform (see page19), which was launched  in 2002 and encompasses activities in all three of our  business divisions  including investment funds for clients  who want to make a lasting and measurable impact on   the lives of people in emerging and developing economies.  In the area of Sustainable Investments, Credit Suisse   has built on the CS Solutions (Lux) Megatrends Fund  an  investment fund focusing on the three global megatrends  Multipolar World, Demographics and Sustainability  identified by our Private Banking Global Research team.   By launching the megatrend theme Sustainability, which  integrates socially responsible investment strategies into  Credit Suisses megatrend concept, the awareness for  environmental, social and governance issues was further  Continued on page 18  Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility in Banking 18 increased among financial analysts, relationship managers  and clients. Our Global Research team analyzes these  megatrends and develops a sustainable investment strategy  based on the selection of stocks. Investment Banking Credit Suisses Investment Banking division has the largest  market share in the wind and solar energy arenas, making   it the global leader in the renewable energy sector. For  example, we served as joint global coordinator for the Global  Depository Receipt listing for the largest solar equity   financing transaction in 2011 by the Korean silicon producer  OCI. The transaction was executed successfully in a   highly volatile market environment. We also served as lead  left arranger and joint bookrunner for Invenergy Wind  Powers USD 200 million senior secured notes offering and  as lead left bookrunner on First Wind Capitals USD200mil- lion 10.25% senior secured notes offering. In addition,   we were joint bookrunner for the USD150million IPO   of the next-generation biofuels producer KiOR in June 2011.   The Credit Suisse Power & Renewables Group advises  buy-side and sell-side clients on mergers and acquisitions,  project finance and measures to raise capital in the debt  and equity markets for the wind, solar, geothermal, bio-  mass, biofuels and smart grid sectors. With deals totaling  USD15.6billion, we led the trend in renewable energy  mergers and acquisitions and were named top advisor of  2011 by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The Strategic Transactions Group (STG) within the  Fixed Income business worked in close cooperation with  clients to provide more than USD220million in late-stage  funding for renewable energy projects. Since 2009, the  STG has committed over USD700million to our clients.  Asset Management Our Asset Management division offers investment solutions  and services worldwide and invests in a broad range of asset  classes, including alternative investments:   The Customized Fund Investment Group (CFIG) has   USD700million of client commitments for investments in  clean technology, making it one of the leading private   equity investors in this sector. CFIG invests in funds and  companies that actively invest and operate in a wide   range of renewable energy and cleantech sub-sectors,  including solar, wind, waste-to-energy, smart meter   and transpor t ation. Examples include a 70-megawatt solar  park in Italy and the provision of EUR15million of financing  for a 153-megawatt wind park in France.   In February 2011, we issued the Exchange Traded Fund  (ETF) on the Credit Suisse Global Alternative Energy   Index  an exchange-traded investment fund on an index of   30companies in the fields of wind energy, solar energy,  bioenergy, natural gas, geothermal energy, hydroelec tricity,  fuel cells and batteries.  The sustainable Swiss real estate fund Credit Suisse   Real Estate Fund Green Property established in May   2009 recorded CHF300million of asset inflows in 2011.  The fund invests exclusively in real estate in Switzerland  that meets the strict criteria of the greenproperty quality  seal  an initiative launched by Credit Suisse.

The tallest building in Switzerland  Swiss  Prime Sites Prime Tower in Zurich  has already received   a triple certification with greenproperty Gold, Minergie   and LEED Gold. Green Business Initiative We established the Green Business Initiative in 2009   with the aim of optimizing and expanding our range   of green products and services to meet the diverse needs   of our clients. This internal forum enables specialists   from all our regions and divisions to combine the expertise  available within the bank and to cooperate in the promotion  and development of new products in clean technology,  including alternative energy, water technologies and sustain-  able agriculture. Our activities have also been recognized  by external parties such as Bloomberg Markets magazine,  which graded Credit Suisse in the top tier of its inaugural  ranking of the worlds greenest banks. The publication identi-  fied the greenest banks based on their investments in clean  energy and efforts to reduce their environmental impact.  Microfinance: Enabling Economic Development Credit Suisse recognized the potential of microfinance at an  early stage and has been active in this segment for 10years.  Microfinance, the term used to describe the provision of  small loans, insurance products and other financial services  to economically disadvantaged people in emerging and  developing countries, is a proven means of helping people  to help themselves. For example, microloans can help  individuals to build up a small business and to thus establish  a basic livelihood. In this way, it also plays a role in achiev-  ing the UN Millennium Development Goals including the   eradication of poverty and the provision of universal primary  education.  As a leading bank in the microfinance arena, Credit  Suisse joined forces with other banks in 2002 to establish  responsAbility Social Investments AG, one of the prin-  cipal social investment companies focused on developing  countries and emerging markets. Today, all three of our  business divisions offer microfinance-themed products   and services. In Private Banking, our current microfinance  offering includes several global microfinance funds and   a private equity fund of fund that enables investors to par-  ticipate in small businesses serving economically disad- vantaged people in emerging and developing countries.  We have also added a new product focusing on   women – the IC Asian Women Microfinance Fund – since  many microfinance institutions have found that women are  more conscientious when it comes to using and repaying  their loans. The success of microenterprises run by women  appears to have a positive impact on their families and on  the communities in which they live, as women tend to invest  their earnings in better health care and schooling for their  children. In our Private Banking division, a team of analysts  specializing in microfinance provides in-depth analysis and  insights on the sector through monthly publications on  topics such as the portfolio diversification potential offered  by microfinance investments or the special features of   the microfinance segment in Sub-Saharan Africa.  In 2011, Credit Suisse launched and invested in an  innovative product, the Local Currency Microfinance Note,  in close cooperation with the microfinance institution  FINCA International, which is a long-standing partner of  our Microfinance Capacity Building Initiative. This innova- tive product, funded by Credit Suisse and our Private  Banking clients, addresses the strong and untapped  demand for local currency financing in the microfinance  sector in eight developing countries including Kyrgyzstan  and Uganda.  Continued on page 20 Charitable Giving by Our Clients T hrough the Swiss charitable foundations Accentus,  Symphasis and Empiris, which were established  over 10 years ago, we offer clients in Switzerland the  opportunity to establish sub-foundations to achieve  their own charitable aims. Credit Suisse assumes most  of the related administration costs. More than 1,000  projects worldwide have been supported by our clients  sub-foundations over the last decade (see image  below: Lomadef project). In 2011, we became the first  bank to launch a charitable foundation for clients in   Asia Pacific. SymAsia provides a suitable infrastructure  to allow our Asian clients to make strategic, structured  charitable donations.

In addition to our current range of microfinance funds  that enable microfinance institutions to raise capital,   our Asset Management division manages the custody and  administration of a number of large microfinance funds.   By the end of 2011, the volume of assets invested in these  funds managed by Credit Suisse totaled USD1.1billion.   This sum is divided between more than 500microfinance  institutions in more than 50countries and benefits over  700,000microentrepreneurs. Our Investment Banking division offers a range of  advisory services on IPOs and other capital market trans-  actions to the microfinance sector.  The microfinance sector has evolved and experienced  strong growth in recent years. This rapid expansion has,  however, given rise to challenges in areas such as client  protection and institutional governance. Credit Suisse  therefore contributes to the responsible development of   the industry. The Microfinance Capacity Building Initiative  (see Booklet, pageV), established in 2008 and funded   on a not-for-profit basis, provides human and financial  resources to enhance the management and processes in  microfinance institutions and to promote industry dialogue  and best practices. In addition to our projects involving  microfinance institutions, we published a study on the sector  based on input from microfinance investors and their  advisors in Europe, the US and Asia. The findings revealed  that the respondents continue to take a positive view of   the microfinance sector and would like to see more products  in this area but are also demanding increased transpar-  ency on key issues such as overindebtedness and social  performance. To help microfinance institutions address such issues  and to supply them with the relevant expertise, Credit  Suisse officially launched the Global Citizens Program in  2011 after completing a pilot in 2010 (see Booklet, pageVII).  Several employees completed three-month placements   with our microfinance partners, assisting them in areas such  as the development of financial management systems   to improve efficiency and transparency, the development   of an auditing and financial management tool and the  implementation of credit scoring methodologies.  In an effort to build on a decade of leadership in micro-  finance and to broaden our focus on the base of the  economic pyramid, Credit Suisse collaborated with the  Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship in   2011 in the presentation of the Swiss Social Entrepreneur  award. The Credit Suisse Research Institute and the  Schwab Foundation also developed a publication entitled  Investing for Impact: How Social Entrepreneurship is  Redefining the Meaning of Return, which was presented at  the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in  January 2012. Environmental, Social and Governance Factors At Credit Suisse, we recognize that environmental, social  and governance (ESG) factors can have a material   effect on economic and social value. Our sustainable invest-  ment approach allows us to systematically integrate   ESG criteria into the investment process in an effort to  improve long-term risk-adjusted financial returns.   We have continuously refined the tools we use to offer  clients professional and forward-looking advice about  sustainable investments. This includes the full integration   of ESG indicators into our existing Stock Navigator and  Bond Finder tools.  Our systems now enable relationship managers to  screen client portfolios for a wide range of ESG criteria.  This includes conducting best-in-class assessments of  managerial capability, excluding specific business activities  (e.g. the production of alcohol, tobacco or arms) and  identifying sensitive ESG issues. In addition, we strive to  systematically apply ESG considerations to all asset  classes, including alternative investments. This enables   us to identify suitable investment solutions for each client  and to offer tailored investments in this area. Barrier-Free Banking Services Credit Suisse is committed to ensuring that our  products and services are accessible to everyone.  More than 50 of our ATMs in Switzerland have   been positioned so that wheelchair users can  operate them easily, and we have installed over   400talking ATMs. The accessibility of our   branches and office buildings is also constantly  being improved. In addition, we issue bank  statements printed in Braille and large type, and   we have implemented a barrier-free design for our  website and our online banking service. In 2011,   we focused on creating barrier-free documents and  commissioned the programming of software that  enables PDF documents to be generated that are  accessible to visually impaired readers. To assist   the employees who maintain Credit Suisses website,  we have also tested a software program that auto-  matically checks whether Web pages are barrier-free.  The program will be made available in 2012 to all  employees who require it for their work. In 2011,  Credit Suisse once again took steps to increase  employee awareness about the issue of accessibility:  during the year, more than 700employees in  Switzerland attended disability awareness training  courses. To date, a total of 2,900employees in  Switzerland have been trained in how to address the  needs of people with disabilities.   21 Research and Publications Throughout 2011, Private Banking Global Research pro-  duced regular publications on sustainability topics, including  a special focus on clean mobility and a series on the  impacts of the Fukushima nuclear accident. The Global  Research team provides thematic coverage and thought  leadership on sustainability issues including alternative  energy, resource efficiency and clean technology. A team   of dedicated thematic analysts and strategists identifies  long-term environmental trends and challenges and trans-  lates them into actionable green investment ideas. In 2011, Credit Suisse collaborated with the World  Wildlife Fund (WWF) on a study about the role of banks in  the transition to a low-carbon economy, including the  opportunities and risks associated with climate change and  the steps that can be taken to address them. Approaches  include mobilizing new capital sources or focusing real estate  funds on sustainable properties. Furthermore, at the em-  ployee event Crops, Capital and the Environment in New  York, an expert from WWF US and a representative of  Credit Suisses Investment Banking Equities Research unit  explored the topic of sustainable agriculture from both a  conservation and a financial perspective, identifying areas  of common ground.  www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/banking Challenge: Increasing need for funding in local currencies   in the microfinance sector. Response: We launched the Local Currency Microfinance  Note to help microfinance institutions in eight developing  countries to reduce their currency risks. Challenge: Growing demand for information on non-financial  factors potentially affecting investment decisions. Response: We integrated environmental, social and  governance (ESG) indicators into our Stock Navigator   and Bond Finder tools.  Challenge: Supply capital to fund the development of  renewable technologies to meet global energy needs. Response: We actively pursued advisory, lending and  underwriting opportunities for renewable energy companies,  projects and technologies. For example, we were named   top advisor in renewable energy mergers and acquisitions   in 2011 by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

At the same time, we want to support the economy through   our activities and to play a constructive role in the broader social   environment. At Credit Suisse, we are committed to conducting our  business in a way that serves the best interests of   our clients, shareholders and employees  thus fulfilling   our primary responsibility as a global bank. At the   same time, we are very conscious of the fact that we are  inextricably linked with the economy and society.   This high degree of interconnectedness is evident at many  levels. For example, in our function as a financial inter- mediary, we align the financing and investment needs of  companies, private individuals, institutions and the public  sector. This includes supplying vital capital to businesses   to help finance their expansion and foster innovation –   ultimately driving economic growth and the creation of jobs.  The role we play in the economy is also illustrated by the  fact that in our Swiss home market, we are a partner to over  one-third of all companies and are especially committed   to supporting the export sector. In addition to providing  international payment operations, trade finance and other  services that are essential to do business in the global  marketplace, we helped Swiss exporters to address the  impacts of the strong Swiss franc in 2011. Supplying  financial expertise and advice to the economy is another  aspect of our work. Challenges in an Evolving Industry The global banking industry was confronted with significant  challenges in 2011. From an economic perspective, the   year was dominated by the escalating debt crisis in Europe,  which was accompanied by a general slowdown in the  global economy, historically low interest rates and volatile  financial markets. The resulting climate of uncertainty  undermined investor confidence and significantly reduced  levels of client activity  forcing banks to adapt their cost  structures in line with declining revenues. At Credit Suisse,  we responded to these challenges by announcing steps   to further evolve our integrated business strategy  including  a significant reduction of risk-weighted assets in our Invest-  ment Banking business, the implementation of measures to  enhance profitability in our Private Banking business, and  the redeployment of resources to faster-growing and large  markets such as Brazil, China and Russia.  Industry reforms were another dominant topic for banks  in 2011, as regulators and politicians around the globe  pursued their efforts to strengthen the stability of the finan-  cial sector with a particular focus on capital, leverage and  liquidity requirements. At an international level, regulatory  developments centered on the Basel III framework that   is designed in part to increase the resilience of systemically  important financial institutions. In Switzerland, the Too   Big to Fail debate was once again a major theme in 2011.  Here, Credit Suisse engaged in a constructive dialogue   with poli ticians, regulators and other industry representa-  ti ves  contributing our financial expertise to the discussions  (see also page52). This process culminated in the adoption  of the corresponding legislative proposal by the Swiss  Federal Parliament in September 2011. At Credit Suisse,  we essentially support the new Too Big to Fail bill in   view of the particular importance of the major banks for the  Swiss economy. We believe that we can meet the new  requirements within the prescribed timeframe by building  capital through earnings and by issuing contingent capital   or other instruments that qualify for the various buffers   Credit Suisse as a Client and Contractual Partner In 2011, Credit Suisse purchased over CHF 7 billion of goods, services and licenses  across our four regions. We are committed to conducting our business in an ethical,  legal, and socially and environmentally responsible manner. As part of our relationships  with major suppliers, we require them to acknowledge their corporate responsibilities  in areas such as employee health and safety and environmental protection. We build  sustainable relationships with these suppliers to not only ensure that quality and   value are delivered but that they continue to manage their corporate responsibilities  appropriately. In connection with these efforts, we run various targeted programs,  including those that promote collaboration with firms owned by women or individuals  from ethnic and other minorities across an increasing number of geographies.  Continued on page 24  Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility in Society 24 and progressive capital components. At the same time,   we believe that adequate consideration of regulatory devel-  opments in other countries is also necessary to preserve   the international competitiveness of the Swiss financial  center. In this context, the strict financial reforms proposed  in the UK in summer 2011 are evidence that a more level  playing field is gradually emerging. In 2012, Credit Suisse  will continue to implement the previously announced  measures to proactively adjust our business model to the  new industry landscape. At the same time, we want to   play a constructive role in the ongoing regulatory debate,  which is of immense importance for the future shape of   our business and the strength of the financial and economic  system worldwide. A further priority for our company is to  help to resolve challenges such as the cross-border legacy  issues facing the Swiss banking sector (see page9). Our Role in Switzerland Our activities in our Swiss home market demonstrate the  importance of Credit Suisse from both an economic   and social perspective. In 2011, we continued to perform   a range of systemically important functions such as   managing client deposits, operating our credit business   and executing payment transactions. As a lender, we  currently have around CHF170billion of loans outstand-  ing, comprising mortgages and loans to corporate,   public and private clients. Of this sum, CHF32billion com-  prises loans to small and medium-sized enterprises.   We manage CHF590billion of assets deposited by private  and institutional clients in Switzerland.  With 21,200employees based in Switzerland, we are  also one of the countrys largest employers. We play a key  economic and social function by providing attractive career  opportunities across the full spectrum of banking, paying  appropriate compensation and offering development pros-  pects for talented individuals. In 2011, we further increased  the number of apprenticeships we offer young people by   50 to 650 and provided a total of 1,400training positions   in Switzerland. Listening to Young People A s an integral part of society, we consider it impor-  tant to listen to the views and needs of the general  public and to hear their thoughts on a range of current  issues. In Switzerland, one of the ways we gauge public  opinion is through our annual Worry Barometer survey.  Recognizing the important role that young people will  play in our future social, cultural and economic develop-  ment, we are especially interested in hearing their  views. In 2010, we launched an online Youth Barometer  survey to assess the attitudes and concerns of people  aged between 16 and 25 in Switzerland, the US and  Brazil. The findings will enable us to address the needs  of our younger clients and junior employees in a more  targeted manner. The 2011 survey once again showed  that unemployment remains one of the primary concerns  among todays youth  particularly in view of the short-  age of training places and jobs following the financial  and economic crisis. At Credit Suisse, we want to help  tackle youth unemployment and have taken steps   in Switzerland to assist job seekers who wish to find an  apprenticeship and enter the labor market. Working  with partner organizations, Credit Suisse has made  CHF30million available over five years to fund this initia-  tive. In 2011, a total of 1,811individuals received support  from the various programs.

Response: We helped export-based corporate clients in  Switzerland to implement measures to mitigate the impacts  of the strong Swiss franc on their business. Credit Suisse  representatives also participated in high-level discussions  with government bodies and offered their expertise on  various monetary policy options. Challenge: Support the economy by helping businesses that  have difficulties obtaining funding to grow and create jobs. Response: We supply essential capital to businesses to help  finance their expansion and to drive innovation. In 2011,   our subsidiary SVC Ltd. for Risk Capital for SMEs continued  to supply capital to young Swiss firms with sustainable  business models to help them expand.  Challenges and Responses 2011 Working with Swiss Business   to Drive Growth I n the current economic climate, we believe that one   of the most important roles a bank can play is to  supply the capital needed to finance economic growth  and thus secure jobs. Credit Suisse recognizes that  SMEs form the backbone of the Swiss economy and   is committed to helping them access the funding they  need for their expansion and for succession planning.   In this way, it can support the growth of their business  and help to secure jobs and create new employment.   In May 2010, we established the fully owned subsidiary  SVC Ltd. for Risk Capital for SMEs and supplied it   with CHF100million of capital to help new or established  companies in all sectors with a proven client offering   to achieve growth. In 2011, around CHF24million of  capital was committed to 15 innovative Swiss firms with  sustainable business models  bringing the total capital  commitment to around CHF35million at the end of  December 2011. These companies are active in a range  of industries  including cleantech, information and  communication technologies (ICT) and consumer goods.  One example is the firm agrofrucht-Inn AG (pictured  below), which has developed a new process to produce  dried fruit.

As a profitable firm, Credit Suisse has paid  an average of CHF1.0billion in corporate income tax  worldwide over the last five years. In addition, it is subject   to other taxes that are not related to income and that  exceeded CHF400million in 2011 alone. On behalf of em-  ployees, Credit Suisse pays payroll withholding taxes   and social security contributions, as well as other statutory  levies. In 2011, these additional taxes and contributions  amounted to over CHF3billion globally.  www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/society  Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility in Society 26 Our Social Commitments Credit Suisse and its employees have been working with selected partner   organizations around the world for many years to help address social challenges.  We support a variety of humanitarian and charitable projects to improve the  lives of disadvantaged people.  At Credit Suisse, we believe that a sound social environ- ment creates economic stability, which is key to the   long-term success of our business. This is why we work  with selected non-governmental organizations (NGOs)   to address social issues at an international level. We help   to tackle challenges such as youth unemployment and we  support efforts to realize the UN Millennium Development  Goals  including the eradication of poverty and the pro-  vision of universal primary education  through diverse  projects and initiatives. Our company operates in both  industrialized and emerging market economies, and we are  committed to engaging in activities that go beyond our   core business to support the economic and social develop- ment of these regions and to act as a reliable local part-  ner to help improve the living conditions of disadvantaged  people.  We focus on building long-term relationships with   our partner organizations so that we can work together to  develop and extend programs that bring about lasting  change. We regard microfinance and education as effective  tools to promote economic growth and development and  have continued to focus our social commitments on global  initiatives in these areas.  Through our Microfinance Capacity Building Initiative,  Credit Suisse provides financial and human resources to  improve management training and development and to   drive product and process innovation in microfinance institu-  tions to give people at the base of the income pyramid  better access to banking services. We supported 1.8million  microentrepreneurs and their families worldwide in 2011.   In recognition of these efforts, Credit Suisse received the  Opportunity International Award.  Through our Global Education Initiative, Credit Suisse  assists international organizations in giving thousands   of children and young people access to education and in  improving the quality of educational opportunities in devel-  oping countries in particular. This global initiative focuses   on providing scholarships, learning materials and specialized  teacher training and on ensuring the sustainable develop- ment of educational infrastructures. We also run wide- ranging regional educational projects with the aim of giving  children and young people in both industrialized nations   and the emerging markets a direct insight into the world   of business and finance. The financial support we offer to charitable projects  and initiatives worldwide is complemented by the volunteer  work performed by our people. In 2011, we took steps   to increase employee volunteering – including skills-based  assignments – to benefit a variety of worthwhile causes. Thinking Globally – Acting Locally  Our aim is to implement our global strategy as effectively   as possible in all the regions where we operate, ensuring that  our resources are deployed efficiently and that the projects  we support generate long-term benefits. We have therefore  entered into strategic partnerships with leading international  and national non-profit organizations that have an extensive  knowledge of specific local requirements and of the political  situation and cultural conventions in different countries.  The foundations and committees in our four regions  work with over 300partner organizations globally and   are responsible for coordinating grants, donations and the  volunteer efforts of our employees. For example, the   Americas Foundation in New York and the Credit Suisse   EMEA Foundation in London plan and implement charitable  projects in their respective regions, while the regional  management team directs projects in Asia Pacific. Our Cor-  porate Volunteering team and the Credit Suisse Foundation  Jubilee Fund coordinate and implement partnerships and  volunteering initiatives in Switzerland. In addition, the Credit  Suisse Foundation allocates funds to projects that address  our focus themes of education and microfinance and man-  ages the Disaster Relief Fund (see page27). Personal Support for Worthwhile Causes  Companies essentially have the same choices available to  them as private individuals if they wish to address social  issues: they can make financial contributions or invest time  in charitable projects. As an employer, Credit Suisse also  aims to assume its social responsibilities by encouraging its  people to enhance the value of its financial contributions  through their own personal support for worthwhile causes.  We therefore give all employees the opportunity to dedicate  an entire working day on full pay to assist with charitable   27 projects. As part of the Global Citizens Program, suitably  qualified employees are offered the opportunity to spend  several weeks working on projects run by our global initia-  tive partner organizations in emerging and developing  markets (see below). Credit Suisse is convinced that em-  ployee volunteering creates mutual benefits. By participat- ing in the charitable projects run by our partner organi- zations, we can gain a better insight into the needs of the  people in the communities in which we live and work and  build mutual trust. At the same time, these activities further  enhance the interpersonal skills of our people and promote  team spirit – ultimately strengthening our corporate culture. We consult with employees when selecting the organ-  izations that we support. We also encourage them to   take up positions on the Management Boards and Boards   of Trustees of our partner organizations. We closely monitor the development of our various  global and regional partnerships and programs. To ensure  that our social commitments are having a lasting impact,   we systematically record all volunteering activities in a global  database and regularly collect feedback from our partner  organizations and employees. Expanding Our Activities  We are constantly adding to the list of countries where we  participate in social initiatives and increasing the number of  projects we support worldwide. An important milestone   in 2011 was the expansion of our Global Citizens Program  volunteering initiative, which was launched in 2010 and  focuses on promoting the transfer of knowledge and exper-  tise between our employees and our partner organizations  in the areas of education and microfinance. This program  enables employees to make targeted use of their skills to  support the further development of our partners initiatives  by helping to optimize processes or enhance efficiency. The  Global Citizens Program has now been extended to a total  of 17countries, including India, China, Brazil and Mexico. At  the same time, the number of participants has increased  from 18 in 2010 to 31 in 2011. We also launched a success- ful pilot virtual volunteering program in 2011. Virtual  volunteering allows a larger number of suitably qualified  employees to use their expertise to support our microfi- nance partner organizations without having to take extended  leave from work.  In 2011, we renewed our commitment to two existing  global volunteering partnerships: Habitat for Humanity  International, which seeks to combat homelessness and  improve precarious living situations, and Junior Achievement  Worldwide, which focuses on promoting business skills  among children and young people. We also made significant progress in our different  regions. In Switzerland, we increased our existing partner- ships from 11 to 15, bringing the total number of volunteer- Continued on page 28 Disaster Relief Fund  T he earthquake and tsunami that triggered the  accident at the Fukushima nuclear reactor in March  2011 presented huge challenges for international disaster  relief organizations. The Credit Suisse Foundations  Disaster Relief Fund is continuing to provide support to  affected regions through the national and international  Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations. Some of the  financial aid was donated to specific projects in Japan  to benefit children who were particularly impacted by the  disaster. By combining donations from employees,   the matching gift from the Credit Suisse Foundation and  the immediate corporate contribution, Credit Suisse was  able to donate a total of USD5.5million. We also  donated over USD200,000 to various aid organizations  that played a major role in the clean-up operations.   Over 30employees volunteered to assist with this  process. Credit Suisse also responded immediately to  the energy reduction targets issued by the Japanese  government and reduced energy usage at our Tokyo  offices by 15% in 2011 to contribute to the national  effort to cut energy consumption in the wake of the  catastrophe. In addition to the aid efforts in Japan,  contributions from the Disaster Relief Fund were used   to assist people affected by the drought in the Horn   of Africa in 2011.  To read the article on disaster   relief efforts in Japan, scan   the QR code or refer to the   Responsibility Chronicle.   www.credit-suisse.com/ chronicle ing organizations we work with to 80. The number of hours  dedicated to volunteer work by our employees rose by  around 20% in Switzerland in 2011. Our long-standing  collaboration with the Swiss Red Cross was also expanded  in 2011. Volunteering activities included our employees  support for a blood donation campaign as well as the inte-  gration project Mitten unter uns (In Our Midst) for immigrant  children. Volunteers meet with the children on a regular  basis, offering them an opportunity to improve their German-  language skills. Moreover, these encounters encourage the  formation of a new social network and help to overcome   Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility in Society 28 stereotypes. Various educational schemes in 2011 also  enabled employees to share their expertise and experience  with young people (see page31). We received the Swiss  Employee Volunteering Award in 2011 in recognition of   our volunteering activities in Switzerland from the Philias  Foundation. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region,  an external evaluation covering the period from 2008–2011  underlined the achievements of the Credit Suisse EMEA  Foundation. We have provided support for 39,000young  people since 2008 through various education and training  programs focusing on the development of business skills.  The total volunteering hours performed by our employees  rose by 16% in the EMEA region in 2011.  We also intensified our charitable activities in emerging  markets such as Russia, South Africa and the Middle East  and established our first Philanthropy Committee in Poland.  In South Africa, 46% of our local employees invested their  time and expertise in volunteering, including six employees  who provided one-to-one support for young people through  the Clouddog program, which consists of a variety of  community and environmental initiatives. Our cooperation  with the international organization Habitat for Humanity   saw 133employees from our EMEA region undertake  assignments in Armenia, South Africa and Poland.  Employees participated in construction projects aimed at  helping disadvantaged people (see Booklet, pageVI). Programs in the Americas focused on the themes   of employee engagement and education in 2011. The  Americas Foundations Education Program, launched in  2010, makes targeted investments in teacher training and  development through partnerships with selected orga- nizations. In connection with further projects, it supports  schools that provide children from socially disadvantaged  families and economically deprived communities with  alternative development opportunities and chances to  succeed (see page29). At the East Harlem School in New  York, which was supported by Credit Suisse, 98% of the  students went on to graduate with a high school diploma.  In the Americas region, our people continued to com-  plete a large number of volunteering hours and assignments  in 2011. Our activities in the area of employee engagement  were not restricted to New York City, with employees  volunteering in the Bahamas and Cayman Islands for the  first time. In the Bahamas, employees renovated a school   in a 12-day initiative completed in stages over a period   of fiveweeks and equipped it with computers. The City Year  New York partnership, which has successfully supported  City Year Corp members serving in local schools and employ-  ees executing various volunteer initiatives over the past   five years, spread to the EMEA region with the launch of  activities in London.  In Asia Pacific, efforts centered on the provision of  funding for larger-scale partner projects. The aim is to help  drive lasting social change in the Bharatpur district of  Rajasthan in India with the support of Plan India and the  local charitable organization Gram Niyojan Kendra.   The region faces severe social challenges and has high  levels of crime, which impact women and children in  particular. We not only provide educational programs for  school-age children but also support training courses   that show adults ways to generate an income and escape  EMEA Education Project:   Promoting Young Entrepreneurs   Y outh Business Russia (YBR), a Youth Business  International (YBI) project, is a global network that  supports young entrepreneurs. The project was  extended to the Novosibirsk region of Russia thanks to  the support of the Credit Suisse EMEA Foundation.   Its objective is to make low-interest loans available to  young entrepreneurs for start-up companies, while   also providing them with training, mentoring and busi-  ness support programs. The project aims to help young  people to establish a livelihood and to manage their  start-up companies professionally and efficiently.   This, in turn, creates employment opportunities and  helps to revitalize local economies.  Swiss Education Project:   Promoting Young Talent in IT T here will be a shortage of 32,000IT specialists in Switzerland by 2017 unless targeted  measures are taken to encourage young people to pursue a career in IT. As one of Switzerlands   largest IT employers, Credit Suisse is actively committed to supporting training programs for young   talent to produce the IT specialists required. As part of this commitment, we are supporting the   IT Professional Training Switzerland foundation with up to CHF10million over the medium term.  The foundations goals are to ensure the training of sufficient numbers of young people in IT, to  share IT expertise and to strengthen Switzerlands position as a center of IT education. To intensify  our efforts to counter this shortage of specialists, some Credit Suisse IT employees also launched  the Lego Mindstorms project at a Swiss high school in June 2011. They volunteered to provide work-  shops for students on Lego Mindstorms programmable robots, complementing the teaching of IT in  an exciting and hands-on way. The volunteers visits and dynamic approach to technology gave the  students a valuable insight into IT that is intended to inspire them to subsequently pursue a career in  this field.

We also grant microfinance loans to help lay  the foundations for economic independence, thus improving  general living conditions. Our priority is to safeguard the  basic rights of children in Bharatpur by investing in primary  education. This has a positive long-term impact on their  communities, both socially and economically. As well as  providing grants to support charitable projects, Asia Pacific  achieved a 57% increase in employee volunteering hours. Growing Level of Volunteering  Credit Suisse recorded a 15% increase in employee volun-  teering globally in 2011 compared to 2010, resulting in a  volunteering rate of 32% and a total of 189,000volunteer- ing hours. Reflecting the importance we assign to employee  volunteering, we have included this aspect in our annual  performance evaluations since 2010. Volunteering has also  been an integral part of the professional training of Credit  Suisses young talents in Switzerland since 2008. Our aim  in 2012 is to encourage even more of our workforce to act  as volunteers in all business regions and to further improve  cooperation with our partner organizations. www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/society Americas Education Project:   Masters Degree for Teachers A s part of the Americas Education Program, Credit  Suisse provided support in 2010 and 2011 for the  Relay Graduate School of Education in New York, which  runs a practical Masters course for teachers who have  already started their careers. The support from Credit  Suisse has helped the Relay Graduate School to develop  best-in-class courses that focus on practical applica- tions. The largely Web-based courses give teachers the  opportunity to build on their existing knowledge on a  flexible and individual basis and to immediately apply the  insights they acquire in the classroom. Initial results   show that 91% of all teachers trained by the Relay  Graduate School successfully convey mandatory subject  matter to their students. This represents a high standard  for communities where students are often two or three  years behind their peers and where, in the past, less than  50% graduated from high school.  Asia Pacific Education Project:  Schools for Disadvantaged Children I n 2011, Credit Suisse supported the external education  program of the Childrens Fund in Cambodia, enabling  120disadvantaged children to attend school regularly.  The Childrens Fund also offers various supplementary  programs to allow older children who have missed out on  part or all of their schooling to receive targeted support  and complete their education on time. Three satellite  schools for over 300children are being built in connection  with this program. By completing their education, these  children can later go on to learn a profession, establish   a stable income and gain financial independence, thus  securing a better future for them and their families.

Response: We intensified our focus on key long-term  partnerships that center on our three focus themes Employee  Engagement, Education and Microfinance and bring about  lasting change in our regions. Challenge: Support the development of a sound social  environment to help promote economic stability in the  emerging markets in which we operate.  Response: We continued to grow our social commitments   in these regions with new microfinance projects in China and  Brazil, ongoing education projects in Brazil, Mexico, India   and China, and increased regional employee engagement   in Asia Pacific.  Challenge: Motivate employees to volunteer for long-term  assignments despite difficult market conditions and business  pressures. Response: We successfully launched a pilot virtual volun-  teering program in 2011 to allow a greater number of  employees to use their expertise to support our microfinance  partner organizations without having to take extended   leave from work.

Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility in Society 32 Sponsorship is an important marketing tool used by   Credit Suisse. It also enables us to offer our clients and   a broader public the opportunity to enjoy exceptional  cultural, musical or sporting events. When selecting our  international sponsorship commitments, we focus on  cultural and sporting institutions that share the same core  values as Credit Suisse by striving to achieve outstanding  performance and long-term success. This approach allows  us to benefit from the excellent reputation of the organiza- tions we support while, at the same time, making a  contribution so that our partners can continue to focus fully  on their cultural and sporting activities, even in challenging  economic times.  Supporting the Development of Young Talent We assign particular importance to nurturing young talent  and we therefore engage in various programs around the  world that help to develop the skills and abilities of young  artists or junior sportsmen and women. Examples include  the Credit Suisse Today Art Award, which is presented in  collaboration with the Today Art Museum in Beijing, and   Sponsorship Credit Suisse wants to contribute to society through various national and   international sponsorship projects. In addition to our partnership with   Roger Federer and his foundation, we focus our sponsorship activities on   classical music, jazz and the fine arts, as well as golf, equestrian sports   and football. We assign particular importance to the promotion of young   talent and the inter national exchange of cultural experiences. the Credit Suisse Young Artist Award, which we present   in conjunction with the Lucerne Festival and the Vienna  Philharmonic. We have also launched two new cultural  awards in Switzerland to promote activities in the fields of  jazz and video art. As the main sponsor of the Swiss Football Association,  we support all junior national football teams. In 2011,   the Swiss U21 team reached the finals of the European  Championship in Denmark and thus qualified for the   2012 Olympic Games in London.  Our sponsorship commitments in the field of culture  focus on classical music and the fine arts. The promotion of  international cultural exchanges is one of the principal   goals of our sponsorship philosophy. One of the ways we  achieve this is by supporting global tours by our partner  orchestras  primarily the New York Philharmonic Orchestra,  of which Credit Suisse is the exclusive global sponsor, as  well as the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. In addition, we  support renowned classical music festivals such as the  Lucerne Festival. As its resident sponsor, we fund the  Vienna Philharmonics annual residency at the Festival,  which is one of the highlights of the event. In 2011, we  renewed our partnership with the internationally acclaimed  Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, which reopened its doors   after seven years of extensive renovations. In London, Credit Suisse partners with the National  Gallery, which attracted record numbers of visitors to its  recent Leonardo da Vinci exhibition. By supporting leading  museums in Switzerland and abroad, Credit Suisse under-  scores its commitment to the fine arts. One of our main  partners is the Kunstmuseum Zurich, which unveiled the  world premiere of the Nahmad Collection in 2011. We also  work with the Singapore Art Museum and supported its  Biennale 2011 exhibition.  www.credit-suisse.com/sponsorship Supporting Music and the Arts in Asia Pacific Our interest in Asia Pacific is not restricted to business: we are also committed to  supporting classical music and the arts in the region. Credit Suisse has been the first  long-term corporate sponsor of the Singapore Art Museum in its history and has   supported the exhibitions held as part of the collaborative Credit Suisse Innovation in Art  Series. Other sponsorship commitments in the region include our work with the Taipei   Fine Arts Museum, the Shanghai Museum and the Today Art Museum in Beijing. In the  field of classical music, Credit Suisse supports the Hong Kong Arts Festival and the   Beijing Music Festival, which are two of the regions most prominent cultural events.  Additionally, Credit Suisse is continuing to partner with the Bangkok Symphony   Orchestra and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in Australia, including its highly regarded  Associate Conductor and Fellowship educational programs.   33 Working with the Roger Federer  Foundation to Promote Education  I n 2011, Credit Suisse continued its long-term partner-  ship agreement with Roger Federer. As part of this  collaboration, Credit Suisse provides support for the  Roger Federer Foundation, which promotes education  projects for children mainly in southern Africa. Thanks  to this partnership with Credit Suisse, a 10-year  initiative providing support in early childhood was launched  in 2011. Over 50,000children between the ages of   four and six will receive help in preparing for their transition  to primary school education. The Foundations local  partner is the NGO ActionAid Malawi. Credit Suisse  provides regular updates on this new initiative in   Malawi through the documentary series Growing up   in Malawi.

Since 2000, it has been  fostering musical talent through the Credit Suisse Young  Artist Award and the Prix Credit Suisse Jeunes Solistes,  which are presented in alternate years. The awards  include generous prize money and the opportunity for  the winners to perform at the internationally acclaimed  Lucerne Festival. The Jubilee Fund also lends its support  to the Musikkollegium Winterthur and the Swiss Youth  Music Competition Foundation.

In December 2011, Norwegian violinist Vilde Frang   was named the winner of the Credit Suisse Young Artist  Award 2012.  Credit Suisse is convinced that microfinance can play a role in achieving the UN  Millennium Development Goals such as the eradication of poverty and hunger.   We have therefore been active in this area for almost 10 years. Microloans are   a proven means of helping people at the base of the income pyramid to help   themselves, e.g. by enabling them to build up a small business and to thus   establish a basic livelihood. Picture: The owner of one such small business at Lake  Malawi sells kapenta. These small sun-dried fish are one of the staple foods in Malawi,  Southeast Africa.

Focus Themes  2011 Focus Themes – Social Commitments At Credit Suisse, we believe that a sound social and economic environment is essential to the long-term  success of our business. Together with our employees  and working in close cooperation with selected  partner organizations  we have therefore been committed to helping strengthen society by addressing  social issues for many years. In addition to providing direct financial support, we encourage our people to  engage in volunteering activities and to share their skills and expertise with our partners. We regard micro-  finance and education as particularly effective tools to promote economic growth and social development  and therefore continued to focus our global initiatives on these areas in 2011. We also support various  regional projects and initiatives. Together with our employees and partner organizations, we strive to  improve the living standards of disadvantaged people worldwide.  II Credit Suisse Focus Themes 2011  Education It All Begins with A, B, C The organization Room to Read is dedicated to supplying books   to children in the most remote corners of the world and to creating   spaces in which they can learn to read. In Zambia, where the   organization also supports national education programs, progress   has been achieved astonishingly quickly as a result of joint initiatives.  Our organizations original mission was to build child-friendly  libraries in countries such as this, explains Samantha Chuula,  Room to Reads Country Director in Zambia. But then we  realized that many children simply couldnt read at all. Room to  Read therefore developed a variety of programs to address  this problem. This was a huge challenge in Zambia because  many children live in remote areas that may be several days  walk from the nearest town. School buses are scarce and  only better-off families can afford a bicycle. Although primary  education is compulsory in Zambia, there is often a shortage  of funding to build classrooms or provide teaching materials.   In many cases, up to seven children have to share a single  schoolbook. This makes it impossible to assign homework,   as only one child can take the book home with them. Despite  all our efforts, we are unable to meet the needs of the  population in more rural areas. This is why the projects and  initiatives run by Room to Read are really important to us,   says Bradford Machila, a member of parliament representing  the Kafue district. Literacy – a Key Pillar of Education The various programs supported by Room to Read include the  construction of libraries, which are then equipped with books,  and the provision of teacher training. In Zambia, Room to Read  also works closely with the government to achieve long-term  improvements in teaching practices. Mumba Nkoloma, educa-  tion officer for the Kafue district, recalls: In the past, children  learned entire words and sentences by heart. This meant that  they never learned to spell properly and, as a result, could not  read or write well. Together with the government, Room to Read   developed a new curriculum and a new textbook for primary  school children. The students in the first grade at the Kacheta  Basic School in the Kafue district were among the first to try  them. For Mary Situmbeko, who manages the new school library   built by Room to Read, the progress was soon visible. She  explains: The first-graders can now read better than older  students in the school because they can also learn at home. Room for Development In most developing countries, the school buildings arent  particularly child-friendly, comments Samantha Chuula.  However, things are very different today at the Kacheta Basic  School: Once lessons are over, many of the children choose   to stay for a while because the school now has a room with a  wide variety of books where they can sit and read. In fact,  there is so much interest in reading that the children even come  to school on weekends, often accompanied by their parents.  Levy Chilekwa is in the ninth grade and helps out as a library  assistant: I come here every day and open up the library for  the children and their parents – on Saturdays, too. A School for All Ages If these programs are to be sustainable, it is essential for   them to have the backing of the children, their parents and,  above all, the community. Room to Read supports schools   for a period of three years, so we need to ensure that the  community will keep up the good work afterwards, explains  Samantha Chuula. Time after time, she is impressed by   the determination and support shown by the local community.   One of the most remarkable stories she has experienced   in her time in Zambia has had an impact on the organization  itself: One of the students always went home and told his  grandmother what hed learned at school that day. She started  to study with him and enjoyed it so much that, without  hesitation, she decided to join in the lessons herself. During  the breaks, she helped to keep an eye on the children and  gave the teachers a hand. During lessons, she sat in class like  any other student. Word soon spread and suddenly large  numbers of adults wanted to join in and learn too. There are  now evening classes for parents, says Samantha Chuula.  The reading program has been a resounding success, and   we are delighted that Credit Suisse is helping us to roll it out   in more schools in Zambia.

III Room to Read is convinced that change   begins with education. To watch a video report on  Room to Read in Zambia,   scan the QR code or refer to   the Responsibility Chronicle  www.credit-suisse.com/ chronicle Credit Suisse Is Committed to Education The Credit Suisse Global Education Initiative  supports selected international non-profit  organizations with the aim of improving access  to education and the quality of educational  opportunities for thousands of children and  young people. The programs supported by the  initiative focus on interventions that are   proven to have a direct impact on quality and  access, such as financial support for students,  teacher training, specialist facilities and learn-  ing resources. Credit Suisse is committed to  long-term partnerships to enable sustainability  of outcomes. To pursue this goal more effec-  tively, our partners engage with the local com-  munity and educational authorities at local,  national and regional levels to raise awareness  of the issues in education. In 2011, we continued working with our long-  term partners Camfed, CARE, Plan Inter- national, Room to Read, Teach for All and  Worldfund. In addition, we continued   to support Catholic Relief Services, Children   in Crisis, Leonard Cheshire Disability and  Pestalozzi World through 2011.

IV Credit Suisse Focus Themes 2011  Microfinance Microfinance: Building a Better Future Credit Suisses microfinance partner FINCA International has been  active in Malawi since 1994. Today, around 22,000 people in this   country in Southeast Africa use banking services and insurance   products supplied by the microfinance institution. Regular training  sessions help its employees to adapt in this constantly evolving field. Tiyamike is a small village in the south of Malawi, where houses  line a dusty road that runs in the direction of Mozambique.   The small marketplace contains an old corn mill – the largest  building in the village. At a food stall at the entrance to  Tiyamike, a large cooking pot stands ready on a scorching  wood stove. Next to it, Patricia Bakari can be seen neatly  chopping vegetables, while her husband helps out in the back-  ground. Villagers and travelers stop to enjoy the food freshly  prepared by Patricia.  Gaining Trust Patricia Bakari is a member of the FINCA Womens Group in  Tiyamike. Once a fortnight, its members gather for a meeting  led by Chairwoman Catherine Comacoma, who runs a small  grocery store from her home. She has been chairing the group  of around two dozen women for over 10 years, or 40loan  cycles. All of the members run small businesses that they were  able to establish thanks to a microloan of USD50–100 from  FINCA. Since each loan is guaranteed by the entire group,  only those women within the village who have gained the trust  of Catherine Comacoma and the community are able to join. In-Depth Advice before Obtaining a Loan The meetings are also attended by the FINCA credit officer  Chisomo Mphande from Blantyre. She discusses the exact  terms that apply to new loan requests or outstanding payments  with the women and advises them on problems and new  challenges that have arisen in their different businesses. She  calculates and explains exactly how much interest we will   have to pay each week and what the repayment installments  are, says Catherine Comacoma. During her time as Chair- woman, Catherine has seen many women who have been able  to really improve their lives with the help of these loans and  who routinely conduct banking transactions today. These are  women who, in the past, would not even have been allowed   to enter a bank in many cases. Larger Loans for Established Businesses The range of products and services offered by FINCA in  Malawi is not limited to microloans. One of its clients is Maggi  Bhakali, who has been running the TK Maxx Clothing Shop   in a suburb of Blantyre together with her husband for several  years. To purchase clothing stock from South Africa, she   has taken out larger FINCA loans amounting to hundreds of  dollars and has always repaid them promptly. Their business   is thriving: Maggi and her husband are already considering the  possibility of opening further stores, for which they would  require a loan of at least one million Malawi kwachas (around  USD6,000). They are optimistic about what the future holds:  We are not only trying to develop our business but to also help  the entire country to move forwards. We might eventually   be able to build a house, buy a car and send our children to a  better school. Continuous Employee Training Makes a Difference To ensure that FINCAs clients in Malawi – who now number  over 22,000 – benefit from high-quality service and advice  that is always improving, FINCA holds regular training sessions  for mid-level managers. The training is conducted in the  FINCA Development Academy, which was established in 2011  and is supported by Credit Suisse. The feedback from the  participants is very positive: These types of courses make all  the difference and have helped our organization to advance.  Our managers now have a better understanding of how they  should lead their staff – and that means we can achieve   better results, states loan analyst Alexon Mwakhula. He explains  that better training leads to increased motivation. At the same  time, regional manager Peter Gama believes that FINCA has  enormous growth potential in Malawi – a country that is home  to over 14million inhabitants. But not everyone can obtain a  loan: responsible growth is important, according to Gama.   A high level of optimism is evident among much of the group.  When asked about their personal career prospects, branch  manager Rose Chanza laughs and declares that anything is  possible. Maybe that could include taking on a management  position at FINCA International in another country?

It enables individuals to make the most of   their potential and is a catalyst for establishing  entrepreneurial activities and an effective  means of helping people in developing coun-  tries to help themselves. Ensuring the growth  of a strong and responsible microfinance  industry and institutions is vital, which is why  we launched our Microfinance Capacity Building  Initiative in 2008. Following the success of the  first three-year cycle, a second cycle was  launched in 2011 that will continue to focus on  developing the people and processes involved  in microfinance institutions, as well as their  product offering, so that these organizations  can strike an effective balance between their  social and financial objectives and their clients  needs. Credit Suisse now works with six partner  organizations that have been selected for their  expertise and positive impact on the industry  and their ability to replicate their achievements  in different markets and regions. In addition,  Credit Suisse also participates in several colla-  borative industry-wide initiatives such as the  Swiss Capacity Building Facility and the Micro-  finance Communications Council.

Their volunteer efforts were organized in conjunction with our global  partner Habitat for Humanity. Mixing concrete, laying bricks and painting walls – beads of  sweat run down the faces of the volunteer builders but all are  focused intensively on the task in hand and are in good spirits.  Most of the helpers are Credit Suisse employees from Russia  but they are also joined by colleagues from Switzerland,   the UK and Kazakhstan to construct homes for two families   in Yerevan (Armenia). In two days, the team did 15 times   as much work as we could have afforded to pay for, says  Nahapet Davtyan, one of the two homeowners, as he points   to the newly insulated loft of his house that can now be used   as living space. Together with his wife Gayaneh and their  children Khachik and Tatevik, aged 14 and 10, as well as   his brothers large family, they had previously lived in a single  room in the house – the only one fit for habitation. Making Houses Habitable In Armenia, there is a very large number of unfinished or old  houses that need to be renovated, states Paul Butler, Country  Coordinator of Habitat UK. In view of the difficult economic  climate, many people simply cannot afford to pay for professional  builders or building materials. His colleague Seda Arzumanyan  explains: During the Soviet era, a lot of house-building programs  were started. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the houses  were never completed. Habitat for Humanity is now helping to  make these structures – some of which are just shells – fit   for habitation to help numerous families faced with hardship. Repairing Damaged Homes In addition to the volunteers work in Armenia in June 2011,  Habitat organized further projects in Credit Suisses other  regions: In Asia Pacific, volunteers traveled to Batam in Indo-  nesia to assist the reconstruction efforts following the  devastating earthquake, and a team from Hong Kong restored  the traditional wood homes of five families in Tai O on   Lantau Island near Hong Kong. With its houses built on stilts  in the water, Tai O is known as the Venice of the East,   states Julia Chan, a Credit Suisse employee from Hong Kong.   It also has the last houses to have been built according   to the traditional Chinese style of architecture. The problem   is that these buildings on stilts are unable to withstand the  storms and landslides that often affect the area. And since   the families dont have much money, they cannot usually   repair their damaged homes. This is why we are helping with  the rebuilding process in Tai O. In South Africa, 26employees joined forces with young  people from the local community in June 2011 and spent five  days building a house in a township 45kilometers outside Jo-  hannesburg for a family of three generations that previously lived  in a shack with a roof that provided limited shelter from the rain. Building Team Spirit Romania is another country in which a team from Switzerland  lent a helping hand: In mid-September 2011, 17volunteers  worked on the interiors of four houses, states Martin Koblet,  the Project Coordinator for Corporate Volunteering in Eastern  Europe at Credit Suisse. Several of the volunteers visited one  of the families in their home before starting work. Once again,  several generations could be found living under the same roof  in a tiny apartment. After seeing the hardship they faced,   the volunteers were eager to improve conditions for the family  as quickly as possible. I was especially impressed by the   team spirit that developed among everyone who was helping  out, recalled Lars Hfner, one of the volunteers from  Switzerland. He added: Everyone showed a lot of initiative  and we quickly got to grips with the work that needed doing.   By working together to benefit others, we soon formed a highly  efficient team. Credit Suisse and Habitat for Humanity Credit Suisse and Habitat for Humanity entered into an international  partnership in 2009. Our employees have since been participating in  projects around the world to construct homes for low-income families.  As part of our cooperation, Credit Suisse also provides funding to  meet the costs of building materials. In 2011, 1,122volunteers spent   a total of 13,985hours building new homes or renovating houses that  are unfinished or in need of repair at 23 locations around the world.  Further information on this topic is available in the   Corporate Responsibility Report (page26–31) and at:  www.credit-suisse/responsibility/focusthemes  VII Many of our employees volunteer their time  and expertise to help good causes – not only  adding value to our financial contributions   but also helping our employees to develop  their interpersonal skills and team spirit in the  process. We also offer each employee the  opportunity to dedicate an entire working day  on full pay to charity work as part of our  support for social initiatives. In addition to our two global volunteering pro-  grams, which we continued in 2011 in con-  junction with our partners Junior Achievement  Worldwide and Habitat for Humanity Inter-  national, we work with selected organizations  in all our regions to coordinate employee  volunteering. In 2011, we continued to concentrate on volun-  teering programs that promote the transfer of  skills and knowledge between our people and  non-profit organizations. An important mile-  stone was the expansion of the Global Citizens  Program (GCP), which was launched in 2010.  The GCP provides opportunities for qualified  employees to go on assignment in-country and  use their professional skills to build the capacity  of our partner organizations working in the  areas of education and microfinance. In 2011, the number of participants increased  from 18 to 31. Last year, 26Credit Suisse vol-  unteers were sent to 14countries to complete   assignments with our sixeducation partners.  The volunteers performed a broad range of  tasks from developing a marketing strategy  and materials to strengthening HR or financial  management systems. Five of our employees  were deployed with four of our microfinance  partner organizations in four countries for   a period of up to three months. Assignments  focused on implementing best practices   in areas such as cash and risk management,  credit scoring and client research to sup-  port our partners in achieving their social and  financial goals. We intend to expand the   Global Citizens Program in 2012 to enable  more of our employees to volunteer their   skills and expertise to help ensure that the  projects run by our partners deliver lasting  benefits.

Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility as an Employer 36 Responsibility   as an Employer Alice Ng, an employee in the Central Compliance  Group, and Michael Lung, a trainee at the   Compliance Academy, during a workshop in Singapore.  To read the article on the Compliance  Academy, scan the QR code or   refer to the Responsibility Chronicle.     www.credit-suisse.com/ chronicle  37 Responsibility as an Employer Our investment in our people is important to secure the long-term competitive- ness of our bank. We are committed to attracting and retaining talented   professionals with the expertise, creativity and dedication needed to offer our  clients high-quality products and services and to manage our global operations  for the benefit of our shareholders. To position Credit Suisse as an employer  of choice, we provide progressive working conditions, wide-ranging devel- opment opportunities and excellent career prospects.  The performance and long-term success of our company  are ultimately determined by the skills and expertise of our  people. Credit Suisse is committed to being an employer   of choice in order to attract and retain highly-qualified,  dedicated professionals who can deliver the best possible  service and advice to our clients.  Recognizing the importance of job satisfaction in  driving employee motivation and performance, we provide   a stimulating working environment, attractive employment  conditions and wide-ranging training and development  opportunities. To gain an understanding of the views of our  people on a range of work-related topics, Credit Suisse  conducts regular employee engagement surveys in conjunc- tion with an independent consulting firm. Based on our  findings, we strive to make improvements in the areas high-  lighted by employees. Our bank-wide engagement survey,  which we launched in a new format in 2011, had a 73%  engagement score based on an overall response rate of  78%. This indicates that the level of satisfaction among our  employees is higher than the industry average of 66%.  Measuring and Managing Performance As a global bank with a workforce of almost 50,000employ- ees in around 50countries, it is imperative that we manage  the performance of our people effectively and consistently to  ensure that they are delivering results and contributing to the  realization of our business objectives. In 2011, we introduced  an enhanced performance management system that enables  us to systematically assess how well our people are perform- ing. Supporting the professional and personal development of  all employees at every level of the company is an important  element of our human capital strategy. Based on an open  dialogue between employees and line managers, we strive   to identify each individuals talents, to understand what  motivates them, and to provide the challenges and support  they require to realize their full potential. Performance  measurement is also an important element in determining   our compensation. We consider it important to offer fair  compensation that recognizes the individual performance   and commitment of our employees (see page10). Career Opportunities, Learning and Development Employee learning and development is of strategic  importance in allowing Credit Suisse to constantly improve  the quality of service and advice we offer to clients and   to remain at the forefront of developments in todays rapidly  changing industry. To address these different needs,   Credit Suisse offers a broad range of training programs in  the form of traditional classroom instruction, e-learning and  Cost Reduction Measures Impact on Employees  Credit Suisse was confronted with a challenging  operating environment in 2011, reflecting economic  uncertainties and the European and US sovereign  debt crises, as well as factors such as the strong  Swiss franc and rising costs due to regulatory  changes. To adapt our business to these adverse  conditions, we announced significant expense  reduction measures, including a decrease in the size  of our global workforce of around 7%. This was   a very difficult decision that affected employees   at all levels of our company. We are committed to  ensuring that this process is implemented as  carefully and responsibly as possible. This includes  working closely with employee representatives   and internal and external partners. Wherever possible,  we will absorb the impact of the reduction in  employee numbers through internal transfers and  natural turnover. In Switzerland and in the UK,   we are assisting affected employees in their search  for a new position within Credit Suisse or outside the  company. As part of their professional reorientation,  these individuals receive personal counseling from   a team of specially trained advisors and support in  the areas of retraining, professional education and  continued development. Our social partners agree  that our plan of action goes well beyond our legal  obligations.

For example, in 2011 our  Private Banking division integrated the latest regulatory  insights and developments into its ongoing Advisory Process  training program. Investment suitability was a core theme   of the training courses we held in Private Banking in  Switzerland, with all employees receiving special training   to ensure that the investment advice, products and   services we offer are suitable and appropriate for each client  (see page7). We also launched our own Compliance  Academy (see Responsibility Chronicle) to attract and  develop more talent for compliance functions. In   2011, 20employees in Singapore embarked on a two-year  program, at the end of which they will receive a certification  from the International Compliance Association. Gaining international or cross-divisional experience is  also an important aspect of the professional and personal  development of our people. Our Internal Mobility program  gives employees the chance to explore new challenges within  the company  whether it is in a different function, business  area or geography. Individuals who take the opportunity to  move within the company benefit by acquiring new skills   and by gaining a better understanding of different businesses  and cultures, as well as by broadening their network of  contacts (see box on page39). Investing in Junior Talent Our strategy of investing in the skills and education of young  people not only helps us to lay the foundations for our  long-term success but also generates benefits for society  as a whole. We offer a wide variety of career options with   a particular focus on attracting individuals with development  potential to our company. We expect line managers at  Credit Suisse to view the development of young talent as   an integral part of their role and we take account of their  ability to cultivate the skills and abilities of their people when  evaluating their leadership performance. In Switzerland, many of our junior employees join Credit  Suisse through our apprenticeship program. Since 2009,  we have increased our number of apprenticeships by 25%  to develop talent for the financial sector. In 2011, 83%   of our apprentices continued their career at the bank after  completing their training. We also offered training positions  of between 12 and 18months for 260university graduates  and increased the number of internships for students from  180 to 250. A further 120high school graduates were given  the opportunity to work at Credit Suisse as part of our  Junior Banking Program. The success of our efforts to  position the bank as an attractive employer for people  starting a career is illustrated by the fact that we were named  the second most popular employer overall and the most  attractive employer among banks by economics graduates  in Switzerland in 2011 (Universum Award). Additionally, we host a variety of events at leading  universities worldwide to establish and maintain contact  with students who are close to completing their degree and  are interested in a career in the finance industry. In 2011,  we held a range of distinctive campus events and launched  a new marketing campaign to heighten awareness of Credit  Suisse among graduates. We also intensified our recruiting  efforts in strategically important emerging markets.  We consider it important to ensure that all new  employees feel welcome within our company and can  integrate easily into their new teams. We have therefore  developed a global onboarding program to help them rapidly  familiarize themselves with our approach to business,   39 Examples of Internal Mobility  I began my career as an analyst in Investment Banking in London  in 1998. My first internal mobility opportunity arose in 2000,  when I moved to Palo Alto, California, to join Credit Suisses  Technology M&A team. Ive since completed international  assignments in London, New York and now Hong Kong, where   I cover energy clients in Asia Pacific. All of these internal moves  have had a profound impact on the development of my career and  have enabled me to build a strong internal network that helps   me to serve our clients, who are truly global. Christian Deiss, Investment Banking, Hong Kong   I think internal mobility has given me a valuable chance to  develop and to gain a better understanding of how things work   at Credit Suisse. Ive performed five different roles across two  different continents since joining the company in 1998. I now lead  a Risk Management team in Singapore. Ive always been open   to new opportunities that can help me to grow professionally.   By leveraging knowledge and relationships from previous roles,   I can do my current job even more effectively. I keep in touch with  former managers and colleagues and find that I can benefit from  their advice and support in my new function. Carole Ng, Risk Management, Singapore Challenge: Cost pressures due to subdued markets, lower  revenues and factors such as regulatory changes, increas- ing infrastructure requirements and controls forced us to  announce significant measures to enhance efficiency and  reduce costs in the second half of 2011, including a 7%  reduction in the size of the global workforce.   Response: We are committed to implementing the head- count reduction as responsibly as possible and have worked  with employee representatives and social partners. In Switzer-  land and in the UK, employees are receiving support in their  professional reorientation, such as professional advice and  counseling from a specially trained team. Our social partners  agree that the action plan goes well beyond our statutory  obligations and is in line with our social responsibilities. Challenge: Better leverage our talent around the world and  optimize the deployment of the banks resources to support  our global business while driving cost efficiencies.  Response: We continued to grow our teams of talented  employees in our five Centers of Excellence (CoE) world- wide, which now account for almost 20% of our global  workforce. The CoEs help to maximize the full potential   of the bank across all relevant time zones, supporting  revenue growth and sustaining efficiency. Challenges and Responses 2011 immerse themselves in our culture and understand our  values and our responsibilities as a company.  Leadership and Management  We recognize the need to have experienced professionals  with proven management qualities to drive our business  forward and to help strengthen our competitive position.  Each year, Credit Suisse runs targeted training courses   to strengthen our managers leadership skills at each stage  of their career. In 2011, we further refined our management  development curriculum and now provide tailored training  approaches that take account of specific requirements in  our individual regions or countries. As part of our inclusive  and consistent approach to succession management and our  commitment to ensuring that key positions are filled with   the right people, Credit Suisse conducts regular talent  reviews. In 2011, around 63% of our entire workforce was  included in this review process.  Reflecting the importance that we assign to the  cultivation of a partnership culture within our integrated bank  and the role that managers can play in promoting the   active transfer of knowledge between employees in different  businesses and geographies, we established a Global  Leadership Council in 2011 to bring together 200 of the  banks most senior leaders and encourage them to  collabo rate beyond their own business divisions and across  countries to deliver on our commitment to clients. Employee Satisfaction We know that when employees are motivated and satisfied  with their work, this has a decisive impact on their perfor- mance. We therefore offer attractive employment conditions  and recognize exceptional performance and committed  service to the company  including through the presentation  of our annual CEO Leadership Awards. Employees can also  access a variety of other benefits ranging from pension  provision and maternity and paternity leave to childcare  programs, employee assistance and study grants.  In our role as an employer, we want to actively promote  the health and wellbeing of our people. We therefore run   a variety of courses that provide advice on health issues,  nutrition and stress management, as well as offering sports  and exercise programs. In Switzerland, we launched a new  health initiative in 2011 to provide free medical check-ups  for employees in a mobile prevention and diagnostic center.  In addition, 2,231employees accepted our offer of in-house  flu vaccinations during the year. We also seek to help employees achieve a healthy work/  life balance and to combine their family and professional  commitments. Measures include the provision of flexible   or part-time working arrangements (see page41). In  addition, long-serving Credit Suisse employees are offered  the opportunity to take a sabbatical of up to three months.  Underscoring our commitment to taking employee needs  properly into account, Credit Suisse has, for many years,  cooperated closely with organizations that represent their  interests. They include the Credit Suisse Staff Council in  Switzerland and the European Works Council.  www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/employer  Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility as an Employer 40 Global Diversity and Inclusion To deliver the best possible service to our clients and to work together   effectively across our regions, we require people with different mindsets   and wide-ranging experience. Diversity provides us with richer insights   and a better understanding of evolving client needs. We believe it also opens   up a broader range of business opportunities and breeds creativity   and innovation  contributing to the success of our company. The diverse   backgrounds of our employees therefore represent a key competitive   advantage for Credit Suisse in todays global business environment. As an integrated global bank, we serve clients across   many different geographies and cultures. To understand  their diverse needs and aspirations and to provide them   with individual financial solutions and advice, our em ployees  require detailed knowledge of regional markets and  different cultural aspects. These insights not only help us   to strengthen existing client relationships but also to  connect more effectively with prospective clients. In view   of the international nature of our business, it is also im-  portant for our employees to be able to work together closely  across divisions, regions and cultures to manage our bank   in the most effective way possible. We value the diverse  back grounds of our people and believe that the varied  experiences and perspectives they bring represent a success  factor for our bank. We therefore strive to attract and   retain diverse talent and to offer career opportunities in an  inclusive, multicultural environment. An Integral Part of Our Corporate Strategy We are committed to providing equal opportunities for all  our employees, irrespective of factors such as ethnicity,  nationality, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion,  age, marital or family status, disability or any other status  protected by local law. The promotion of diversity and inclusion  is therefore an integral part of our corporate strategy. Our  global Diversity & Inclusion team partners with our business  leaders to ensure that we have the necessary competen- cies, structures and resources in place to build a diverse and  inclusive environment that underpins our client focus and  business strategy. We have established a Diversity Council  for each of our four regions in order to embed diversity  further in the business. Each Council is chaired by the  regional CEO and consists of other senior business leaders  in that region, who work together to define specific activities  for their area and act as role models in promoting inclusive  behavior. To ensure that an inclusive culture is firmly es tab- lished throughout our workforce, we run mandatory   online training courses for all employees worldwide to  educate them about equal opportunities and dignity in   the workplace. Support Programs and Mentoring Promoting equal opportunities remains a key issue at Credit  Suisse. Women account for 37% of our total workforce   and 16% of our senior leadership (Directors and Managing  Directors). We want to further increase the proportion of  women in specialist and senior management positions within  the bank and we run programs to attract talented female  professionals to our company. For example, our Banking  on Women initiative in Investment Banking aims to more  than double the number of women in officer positions within  five years. At a regional level, we have implemented a  leadership program for female Vice Presidents and Directors  in Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA)   and the Americas to support their personal development.   In Switzerland, we introduced a personal development  program for women at all levels of the company, which was  attended by 130participants in 2011.  Our efforts to support the advancement of women   are also reflected by our mentoring activities, which are  another element of our diversity and inclusion strategy.   In 2011, Credit Suisse launched a new mentoring program  for 30 of the banks most talented female senior managers  to prepare them to assume senior leadership roles. The  program includes a specially tailored 18-month learning   and development curriculum to accelerate their career  progression within Credit Suisse. We also ran a cross- divisional mentoring program for 100female members of   our middle management in Switzerland to promote internal  mobility and encourage collaboration across businesses. A range of mentoring programs is available for other  groups of employees across our different regions and   41 Recognition for Our Efforts to Promote   an Inclusive Working Environment   One of the 100 best companies for working women with children   (Working Mother Magazine)  One of the top-50 employers for women in the UK (The Times)  One of the 50 best companies for Latinas to work   (Latina Style Magazine)  Recognition for promotion of gender equality   (Australian government)  One of the top-100 employers for LGBT staff   (Stonewall Workplace Equality Index)  Corporate Equality Award 2011 for promoting LGBT issues  (Human Rights Campaign) divisions. As well as making them more aware of their  strengths and of how they can be put to optimal use,   these initiatives are designed to help employees to reach  their potential. Encouraging the Exchange of Ideas Our employee networks provide a platform for the exchange  of knowledge and experience between employees in  different businesses and geographies, thus fostering mutual  understanding and encouraging the flow of ideas. In this  way, the networks strengthen cooperation and help to build  a diverse and inclusive culture. In 2011, Credit Suisse had   a total of 38employee networks that are dedicated to women,  families, lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals  (LGBT), people with disabilities, sports, US veterans and  employees from various ethnic backgrounds, to name but a  few. These networks organized around 250events during  the year that were attended by employees from across the  bank. Additionally, Credit Suisse has a Center of Compe- tence for Cross-Cultural Collaboration that offers a range of  courses to promote cultural sensitivity and raise awareness  of specific issues that can arise when working with people  from different cultures. This is particularly important for  employees wishing to pursue internal mobility opportunities. Sharing Best Practices, Learning from Others Credit Suisse enters into partnerships with a variety of  organizations to help promote a dialogue about diversity and  inclusion. In 2011, we lent our support to organizations  including the civil rights group The National Urban League,  as well as Catalyst, which aims to build inclusive environ- ments and expand opportunities for women. In Switzerland,  we were involved in the launch of the Gender Equality  Project at the World Economic Forum, and we were the key  sponsor of the Women Leaders of New Asia conference   in Singapore hosted by the Asia Society. These partnerships also enable us to benchmark our  performance against others so that we can learn and  improve our approach. Examples include our membership   of the Diversity and Inclusion in Asia Network and our  involvement in the Interbank Diversity Forum, of which we  are a founding member. We are also active in the EMEA  Diversity and Inclusion Forum that promotes best practice  across various industries in Europe. Smart and Flexible Working We are committed to offering our employees different  working environments and arrangements to take account   of their diverse working styles, patterns and preferences –  thus increasing employee motivation, wellbeing and  productivity. In 2010, we introduced a pilot project called  Smart Working, which provides specially designed office  space to enable more flexible and mobile working within  Challenge: Ensure that our commitment to diversity is firmly  implemented at every level of the organization and that   we continue to work according to this principle at all times. Response: We have a Diversity Council in each of our regions  in order to implement our culture of diversity deep in our  business. The members of the Councils define specific activ-  ities for their region and act as role models in promoting  inclusion. Additionally, we conduct mandatory bank-wide  online training on the topic of equal opportunities and  dignity in the workplace.  Challenges and Responses 2011 Credit Suisse. The concept is based on the provision of  different work areas to meet the changing needs of  employees throughout the day, including collaborative,  individual and creative workspaces. Based on the success  of this pilot project in Zurich, Smart Working was rolled   out in other locations worldwide in 2011.  Globally, Credit Suisse offers a variety of employment  options such as part-time working, job sharing, compressed  working weeks and remote working. These models provide  greater flexibility in terms of when and where employees can  work  helping them combine their personal and profes- sional commitments more effectively. We also have designated  services to support individuals with personal, health or  financial problems and we provide special facilities to ac com-  mo date the needs of specific groups of staff, such as  nursing rooms for mothers returning to work or prayer rooms  for employees wishing to practice their faith. www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/employer  Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility for the Environment 42 Responsibility   for the Environment Andrew Aulisi, a specialist in the Public Policy –   Sustainability Affairs unit, talks about the function and  conservation of forests and about Credit Suisses  interest in this topic.

We implement operational   measures to improve our environmental performance, develop products and  services that combine economic, environmental and social requirements,   and consider sustainability criteria when managing risks. As part of our approach  to supporting environmental protection, we also participate in international   discussions to promote climate-friendly business practices. Tropical deforestation, species loss and ocean degradation  are among many of todays pressing environmental issues,  with climate change continuing to feature as a leading  concern. Following weeks of difficult negotiations at the 2011  UN Climate Change Conference in Durban, the state  parties agreed on a compromise in the form of a follow-on  treaty to the Kyoto Protocol, under which a new binding  climate agreement for all countries is to be developed by  2015. Climate change is a challenge for global society   as a whole. At Credit Suisse, we believe it is both in our   own interests as a company and in the interests of our  clients to take steps to prevent these developments from  causing further environmental, social and economic harm.  Products and Risk Management Thanks to our position as market leader in the financing   of renewable energies and our range of sustainable  products and services (see page17), we can offer clients   the opportunity to invest in these areas and can thus   open up sources of finance for the development of future  markets. We are also committed to taking climate issues   into account when performing our core activities as a  financial intermediary. For example, we assess transactions  and other business activities to identify any risks they   could pose to people or the environment using our bank- wide risk review process. This review is aligned with  international industry standards such as the Equator  Principles and Carbon Principles. In addition, we have  drawn up internal sector-specific policies and guidelines   for the areas of forestry, palm oil production, mining, oil   and gas, nuclear energy and hydropower to ensure that   the potential impacts of transactions on the environment,  climate and biodiversity are examined (see page13). Biodiversity and Natural Capital The term biodiversity denotes the variety of life and its  processes. It includes the diversity of living organisms, the  differences between them, and the ecosystems and  communities in which they exist. Both ecosystems and the  biodiversity contained within them provide valuable services  to humankind and business: they supply wild food and  medicine derived from plants, they filter pollution and store  CO2 and they regenerate soils and recycle nutrients.   The methods used to determine the value of this natural  capital, as well as the economic costs of species loss   and a reduc- tion in the capacity of ecosystem services,   are still in their infancy. As a financial services provider,   we believe that such financial valuation methods are vital   to adequately assess the risks and returns of the eco-  nomic activities and investments that are dependent on  those services.  Continued on page 44 Research and Thought Leadership  In 2011, economiesuisse commissioned the   KOF Swiss Economic Institute to conduct a study  with support from Credit Suisse that shows that  cleantech  i.e. the development and application of  energy-saving and resource-saving products and  technologies  is of importance for many industries.  The momentum of the cleantech sector is mirrored,  in particular, by the number of patents that have  been registered in the last few years, which is also   a sign of the potential of the cleantech market.  Also in Switzerland, the bank was involved in two  scientific studies on the topic of sustainable  buildings. The first study was conducted by the Swiss  Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) and the  Zurich Uni versity of Applied Sciences to assess   the quality of sustainable buildings. The second  study by the international research project INSPIRE  — part of the EU Eracobuild program — examined  the best combination of measures to achieve signif -  icant energy savings or greenhouse gas reductions  when renovating buildings.   Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility for the Environment 44 At Credit Suisse, we are taking steps to incorporate the  protection of biodiversity into our sustainability activities.  Together with other banks, we actively participate in the  Biodiversity Working Group of the United Nations Environ- ment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and  contribute to related studies and initiatives. To raise employee  awareness of the biodiversity of forests, we conducted  various activities to support the UN International Year of  Forests in 2011. We organized a seminar with an expert  from a leading conservation organization, took employees  on guided forest tours and issued a publication about   the diverse functions of forests and how Credit Suisse  contributes to their preservation. Furthermore, we lent our  support to local initiatives such as high conservation value  habitat mapping in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, with WWF.  Data generated from surveys of high carbon forest stock  supported by Credit Suisse were a factor in the area being  selected to receive a share of a USD28.5million grant   for conservation efforts under the debt-for-nature swap  agreement run by the Indonesian and US governments.   As part of our commitment to the preservation of biodiversity  and in response to an appeal led by WWF Hong Kong and  the Hong Kong Shark Foundation, Credit Suisse in Asia  Pacific requested that all employees refrain from consuming  shark fin. An estimated 73million sharks are killed through  finning each year. Scientific evidence shows that over  180shark and related species are now listed as being  threatened with extinction on the Inter national Union for  Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Raising Employee Awareness of Climate Protection  At Credit Suisse, we know that we can only improve  our environmental performance if we also encourage  our employees to make careful use of natural  resources and ensure that our commitment to climate  protection is an integral part of our corporate culture.  We therefore conduct various activities to raise  awareness of environmental and climate issues. In  2011 they included:  Earthwatch scientific field research expedition   on climate change: A group of Credit Suisse  employees took part in a one-week expedition  organized by Earthwatch in the Brazilian coastal  forest Mata Atlntica. Earthwatch is the largest citizen  science organization in the world and offers volunteers  a chance to perform field research work. Since their  return, participating employees have helped to raise  awareness of environmental and social issues among  their Credit Suisse colleagues.  WWF Earth Hour 2011: Millions of people in  more than 3,000 cities across 134countries turned  off their lights for one hour to make a statement  about the need to protect our climate and to use  sustainable forms of energy. As part of the Credit  Suisse Cares for Climate initiative, we once again  joined this symbolic WWF campaign at 44 of our  offices worldwide and encouraged employees to set  an example. The highlight was the Singapore Walk  in the Dark event, which attracted a few thousand  participants, including around 250Credit Suisse em-  ployees and their friends and families.   CO2 Monitor: This online platform was made  available by Credit Suisse to enable employees to  calculate their personal CO2 emissions quickly and  easily. In the US, each person produces an average  of 24metric tons of CO2 each year, compared to  11metric tons in Switzerland, 12metric tons in Europe  and 6metric tons in Asia. CO2 Monitor was used   to motivate employees to reduce their CO2 emissions  to 1metric ton of CO2 per person per year.   Volunteer work: Employees in Asia Pacific, to-  gether with their families, dedicated more than  1,000hours to outdoor environmental causes in Hong  Kong, such as cleaning beaches and planting trees.  e-bike pilot project: To gain insights and  experience regarding the suitability of e-bikes for  everyday use, the pilot project we launched in 2010  was extended to include sixlocations, 30e-bikes  and 150participants. The project attracted a great  deal of interest and resulted in a high utilization rate.   bike to work: Since 2008, we have encouraged  our employees in Switzerland to cycle to work in the  month of June to support this national campaign. In  2011, around 300employees took part and covered  a distance of more than 30,000kilometers. Credit Suisse Cares for Climate We have been active in the area of climate protection for  over a decade. The Credit Suisse Cares for Climate (CSCfC)  initiative and our four-pillar strategy to reduce the green- house gas emissions resulting from our business operations  (see page46) provide the framework for our efforts to  achieve greenhouse gas neutrality. We reached an important  milestone in 2006, when Credit Suisse became the first  major company in Switzerland to achieve greenhouse gas  neutrality. We realized this goal for all our operations  worldwide in 2010 and 2011. We further reduced our gross  greenhouse gas emissions, which declined by 1% globally   in 2011 to 382,440metric tons.  Our four-pillar strategy focuses on: optimizing opera- tions, capital expenditure, substitution and compensation.  This means that we continuously optimize energy consump- tion in all our locations and we invest in energy-saving  technology and an energy-efficient IT infrastructure as well  as using highly insulating materials in new or renovated  buildings. We also source renewable electricity from climate-  friendly energy sources such as wind, hydro and solar power  wherever available and financially viable. Our remaining  emissions are offset through the purchase of emissions  reduction certificates.

Our environmental management activities  focus primarily on energy management, since energy  consumption is the area in which our operations have by far  the greatest impact on the environment. Our environmental  management system governs the relevant responsibilities,  processes and operational measures within our company. In  1997, Credit Suisse became the worlds first bank to obtain  ISO14001 certification for its environmental management  system, which we have been developing ever since. For  example, we revised our Sustainability Management Policy  in 2011 and defined sustainability-related responsibilities   in more specific terms, now explicitly covering Information  Technology (IT) and Supply Management (see page49). In  areas such as Facility Management, where environmentally  relevant activities are performed by external service  providers, we also include these operations in our environ- mental management system.  In 2011, we once again passed the annual surveillance  audit conducted by the external certification company SGS  without any need for corrective action.  Improving Our Environmental Footprint As well as adapting the heating, air-conditioning and ventilation  systems within our buildings to lower our energy consump- tion, we took steps in other areas to reduce our impact on  the environment and our level of greenhouse gas emissions:   Business travel: In order to conduct our business  activities and to maintain direct contact with our clients,  business travel is often essential. It continues to represent   a major part of our greenhouse gas emissions, accounting  for approximately 19% of our total output. In an effort   to reduce the number of business flights taken by our  employees as far as possible, we promote train travel for  shorter distances. For example, employees traveling  between Paris, Brussels and London are encouraged to  take the train rather than to travel by air, thus reducing our  carbon footprint. We also encourage the use of telephone  and video conferencing, which save both time and money,  and we are continuously extending the relevant technical  infrastructure. In 2011, Credit Suisse employees further  increased their use of video conferencing by around 15%   to a total of 115,500hours compared to 2010. As part of our strategy to achieve global greenhouse  gas neutrality, all the emissions from our international air  travel have been offset since 2010. To raise employee  awareness of this issue, the level of CO2 emissions incurred  as a result of each flight is specified on every airline ticket.  By purchasing carbon-neutral tickets, we offset approxi- mately 63,340metric tons or 16% of our global green- house gas emissions in 2011.   IT servers: In 2011, we further optimized our IT infra- structure and, through virtualization, switched off the  1 Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) for 2009 and 2010 were updated and recalculated following the  updating of the VfU key performance indicators for 2010. During the collection of data in 2011, minor  errors that occurred in prior years were corrected. In addition, the GHG factors for electricity in the   UK were adapted based on the DEFRA Guidelines and the impacts on the purchase of electricity from  renewable sources in the UK were no longer taken into account.

The greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions as well as energy use per FTE decreased  in the majority of the regions. However, business   air travel, which is often essential to maintain   direct contact with our clients, remains a challenge  in terms of our efforts to reduce our GHG   emissions. EMEA: For the UK, the DEFRA grid rolling   average factor 2009 was used to calculate GHG  emissions for 2010 and 2011. Taking account   of the actual purchased green electricity mixes   for the UK, the EMEA GHG emissions achievements  would have been –31% in 2010 and –41%   in 2011. The explicitly documented renewable  electricity ratio would have been 5% for 2010   and 48% for 2011. All regions: The above figures include the GHG  footprint of wholly-owned Credit Suisse subsidiaries.   47 1. Optimizing Operations Energy consumption represents by far the largest  direct impact that Credit Suisse has on the environ-  ment. The continuous optimization of our operations  to increase energy efficiency is therefore a key element  of our environmental strategy. Increasing the energy efficiency of buildings: We implemented a series of targeted optimization  measures in our real estate portfolio and our IT  infrastructure that enabled us to save energy world-  wide and to realize further substantial improvements  in energy efficiency, which contributed to our CSCfC  results in the period from 2009 to 2011 (see  page46). E-Maximo goes global: E-Maximo enables us to  enumerate efficiency targets for individual buildings  and to analyze the impact of operational enhance- ments and energy-related investments. Following its  successful rollout in 400 business premises across  Switzerland, this specially designed energy and  resource management software program underwent  further development to allow it to be deployed  globally. In 2011, it was beta-tested in the Americas.  The program records and stores information on all  relevant energy and resource consumption. This  greatly simplifies and accelerates the quality control  process. As a result of the improved representation  of information (e.g. building footprints) using the  automatic reporting function, E-Maximo optimizes  both the analysis and communication of data. In  2012, the software will be implemented in all our  regions and we will run training sessions for users. 2. Capital Expenditure When constructing new premises or renovating  existing buildings, we focus on installing energy- saving heating, air-conditioning and ventilation  systems and on complying with strict energy standards   such as the Swiss Minergie standard, or with inter-  national standards such as LEED. We also invest in  energy-saving technology and IT infrastructures   and make use of highly insulating materials.  Uetlihof 2 – completion of the largest building  in Switzerland constructed according to the  Minergie-P-ECO standard: The extension of our  Uetlihof 2 administrative center in Zurich (see image  below) was completed at the beginning of 2012.   The Uetlihof 2, providing over 2,000 workspaces,   is currently the largest building in Switzerland   constructed according to the Minergie-P-ECO  specifications governing environmental and health  aspects. For example, the specification stipulates   that buildings must have a compact design with   a highly insulated facade, an efficient ventilation  system and a very high proportion of natural daylight  at workspaces. It also makes strict demands   regarding the use of non-hazardous building materials  to ensure a healthy working environment. Credit  Suisse employees will be able to gradually move into  their offices in Uetlihof 2 from the first quarter of  2012. The newly created workspaces will replace  older and less energy-efficient premises in the   city of Zurich. Construction of new premises according to  Minergie-ECO requirements in Gmligen near  Berne: At the end of 2011, the construction of   an office complex in Gmligen, near Berne, was  completed according to Minergie-ECO specifica- tions. The new building, which provides 900  workspaces, has been leased by Credit Suisse.  Reinvestment of CO2 tax refund in operational  climate protection measures: In 2011, we   once again reinvested the entire tax refund we  received from the Swiss CO2 incentive tax system   in projects that support the goals of CSCfC.  Examples include investments in the transition   to renewable energies when upgrading heating  systems, the installation of efficient lighting   systems and the use of optimized cooling systems   in data centers. Many of these investments  generate business for specialized Swiss companies,  thus directly benefiting the local economy and   some of our clients. We also contributed to national  research projects with the aim of lowering CO2  emissions in the construction sector.  3. Substitution We encourage the use of climate-friendly energy  sources such as wind, hydro and solar power, and  we specifically replace fossil fuels with renewable  energy.  Increasing the proportion of renewable energy:  We examine whether it is possible to obtain green  electricity whenever we negotiate new electricity  supply contracts. All Credit Suisse locations in  Switzerland, as well as our office in Frankfurt, obtain  their electricity exclusively from renewable sources.  In many locations, electricity from renewable  sources also accounts for part of the energy mix  provided by the local utility. In 2011, a total of 199  million kilowatt-hours of electricity consumed by  Credit Suisse was generated from renewable  sources. This corresponds to 33% of our global  electricity consumption. In 2011, most of the  renewable energy we consumed originated from  hydropower, solar power and biomass.  4. Compensation We can reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions  resulting from our business activities through the  optimization of operations, capital expenditure and  substitution measures. However, it is not possible   to eliminate them entirely. We therefore offset our  remaining emissions by pur- chasing emissions  reduction certificates (ERC) to offset the remaining  348,500 metric tons of net greenhouse gas emis-  sions in 2011. This figure represents the emissions  from our business activities in our four regions,  including global business travel. Total costs in 2011  CHF 2 million Costs per employee (FTE) in 2011  CHF 40 Costs per hour flown  CHF 0.50/hour In 2011, our portfolio of emissions reduction certifi -  cates comprised approximately 83% wind and  biomass/biogas projects, with the remaining 17%  consisting of the recycling of landfill gas as well   as hydropower projects (see chart on page 46). In  terms of project quality, approximately 17% of the  certificates meet the Gold Standard, 19% the Social  Carbon Standard and the remainder relate to  climate protection projects verified by independent  third parties. Measures to Reduce Our Carbon Footprint in 2011  Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Responsibility for the Environment 48 Environmental Management in Our Regions Our regional activities focused on the following  measures in 2011 (see page 47 for information   on our activities in our Swiss locations): Europe, Middle East and Africa  Credit Suisse (UK) ranked third among financial  services institutions and 91st in the 2011 performance  league table of the Carbon Reduction Commitment  Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC). The UK govern-  ment launched the mandatory CRC Scheme in an  effort to drive large public and private sector organiza-  tions to reduce emissions and to improve their  energy efficiency.   In the UK, Credit Suisse achieved the 2011 Carbon  Trust Standard, which is awarded to organizations  that have reduced their carbon footprint in absolute  terms and can demonstrate good carbon management.   By separating refuse materials into plastics, paper,  metals and food waste, we increased the recycling  rate for office waste at our premises in London from  91% to 96% in 2011. In addition, a Credit Suisse   third-party refuse company separates and dries  organic food waste from the kitchens, enabling  methane to be generated, which is then sold on to   a gas company. Asia Pacific  Following the Japanese earthquake and tsunami,  the government issued energy reduction targets   for summer 2011. Credit Suisse took prompt action  to comply with the 15% peak-load energy demand  reduction target at its Tokyo offices without disrupting  its business activities. We achieved this through  measures such as the use of higher temperature set  points, reduced lighting and air- conditioning usage,  shifting select IT operations to off-peak hours   and a swifter transition to the use of more energy-  efficient office equipment. The Japanese financial  regulator expects banks to voluntarily continue with  the 15% reduction in energy consumption, which   we have successfully achieved for both our premises  in Japan. We are currently reviewing a list of selected  measures that could be implemented on a long-term  basis.  In March 2011, our offices in Singapore were  awarded the BCA (Building and Construction  Authority) Green Mark Platinum award for the new  office design implemented in levels 2 and 3 of the  Serangoon building. This follows the successful  completion of improvements to the regional data  center, which received the Platinum award in 2009.  In addition to energy and water efficiency, the   award reflects aspects such as the choice of  location, environmental protection, innovation   and the working environment (e.g. use of 100% LED  lighting). An audit will be conducted every three  years to ensure the building still meets the relevant  criteria.  In 2011, we refurbished our offices in Sydney  according to Australias Environmental Sustainable  Design (ESD) standards and received an award   from the Master Builders Association of New South  Wales for best interior fit. The redesign included   the installation of energy-efficient lighting and  lighting control systems, the targeted monitoring   of electricity consumption (sub-metering), 100%  reuse or recycling of excess materials and con-   struction waste, and a wider range of videocon- ferencing facilities. The refurbishment is projected   to achieve a 10% decrease in annual energy  consumption.   Americas  The relocation of our Houston office in 2011  provided an opportunity to strive for increased  operational efficiency. A lease was negotiated that  includes the sub-metering of chilled water, enabling  the office to realize cost savings. In addition, the   use of air-conditioning outside regular business hours  was reduced by grouping together in the same office  zone employees in business areas that conduct a large   proportion of their work outside these hours. This  project has a two-year return on investment (ROI)  and is projected to deliver USD700,000 in operational  savings over the 10-year lease.  At our data center in Princeton, four cooling  systems were replaced with more energy-efficient  models in 2011. We also implemented further  optimization measures such as the use of ambient  air and water for cooling purposes, the automatic  fine-tuning of installations in line with frequency of  use, and operational adjustments to reduce energy  consumption outside of normal working hours. These  measures are being supported with USD 1,86million  of energy efficiency incentives from local utilities and  public programs and are projected to achieve  2,380,000kilowatt-hours in energy savings annually  and USD4,9million in operational cost savings over  the 20-year equipment lifespan.  Awards and Recognition for Environmental and Climate Protection 2011  Best Global Green Brand: Credit Suisse ranked  second globally among international banks in the   Best Global Green Brands rankings produced by  Interbrand. The awards are based on the public  perception of each companys sustainability efforts  and its actual green performance.

The  Awards for Environmental Excellence are intended   to motivate companies to think and act sustainably.  ProKilowatt: As part of a competitive tender run  by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, Credit Suisse  was awarded a grant for the energy-efficient re-  design of the lighting system in a multi-story   car park in Geneva. ProKilowatt is an initiative that  promotes the identification of, and the provision   of support for, projects that contribute to the sustain-  able, low-cost generation of energy savings in the  manufacturing and service industries, as well as in  domestic households.  equivalent of 5,600servers. The virtualization rate increased  from 34% in 2010 to 42% in 2011. This led to a reduction  in energy usage of 12gigawatt-hours globally.  Paper: We continued our efforts to further improve our  environmental footprint in the area of paper consumption.   In 2011, this included measures such as the use of environ- mentally friendly and recycled paper, the digitalization of  documents and double-sided printing. Compared to 2010,  we reduced paper usage in Switzerland by 2.4% to  3,910metric tons, which corresponds to the consumption  of 180kilograms of paper per employee (FTE). A major  proportion of the paper we use in Switzerland (71%)  comprises FSC-certified paper produced from sustainably  managed forests.  Involvement of External Partners We are committed to maintaining a fair and professional  working relationship with our suppliers. We expect our  partners to observe ethical standards and to conduct their  business in an ethical and socially and environmentally  responsible manner that complies with applicable legislation.

Our global Supplier Code of Conduct introduced in  2010 provides detailed information on these standards and  defines our requirements relating to business ethics and  integrity, employment and social standards, environmental  protection and general business principles, as well as the  corresponding management systems. To motivate firms to  assume their environmental and social responsibilities, the  code also requires suppliers to deliver services that, in some  cases, exceed local legislative requirements. We encourage  our partners to strive for high standards in this area and to  continuously improve their environmental and social  performance. Sustainable Supply Management Examples  We have negotiated a new executive car services contract  for our London offices which includes a green hybrid  technology car offering as an option for end-users.  In Switzerland, we purchase 100% certified hydropower  for the entire region as part of our current electricity  contract.   The 2,000 workspaces in our new Uetlihof 2 building  have been equipped with innovative LED standard lamps  that provide improvements in terms of lighting quality,  energy efficiency, sustainability and cost-effectiveness.   An extension to the existing waste management contract  for London incorporated a commitment to reduce the  amount of waste sent to landfill, which totaled 3% at the  end of 2011, to 1% by the end of 2012 and 0% by the end  of 2013. www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/environment Challenge: Address the challenges of climate change  through our products, services and research. Response: We developed environment- and climate-related  products and services. We also produced and published   a research report on the role of banks in transitioning to a  low-carbon economy together with WWF. Challenge: Continue to reduce CO2 emissions with  fluctuating headcount and a business-driven increase in air  travel. Response: Our CSCfC achievements for the period 2009– 2011 show that our global four-pillar strategy is proving  effective. The greenhouse gas emissions resulting from   our total energy consumption in 2011 decreased by around  7,000 metric tons globally compared to 2010. The specific  energy use per employee (FTE) decreased or was stable in  all regions. Reducing emissions from business air travel –  primarily to retain direct contact with clients – remains one  of our greatest challenges in this area.

We lay the foundations for this relationship of  trust by providing transparency about our business activities and by engaging  in a regular and open exchange of views and ideas. This dialogue with   our clients, shareholders, regulators and other groups of stakeholders within   society enables us to promptly identify their needs and expectations and   to find constructive solutions to current challenges. To promote mutual understanding and to build the trust   that is essential for our business, we strive to provide   the greatest possible level of transparency about our  activities and we cultivate an open dialogue with all our   stakeholders. Our exchange of views with our clients,   shareholders, employees, regulatory bodies, politicians   and other representatives of society enables us to   recognize key issues, opportunities and even potential   risks and to respond to them appropriately.  As an integral part of society and as a global bank,  Credit Suisse actively participates in political discussions  about current issues such as the international debt crisis  and works with the authorities to develop sustainable  solutions to preserve and strengthen the stability of the  financial system. International Coordination of Regulatory Measures To maintain financial market stability while ensuring a level  playing field for international financial centers, it is essential  for regulatory measures to be coordinated globally. This   is especially critical in view of the cumulative effects that  stricter bank regulations can have on the economy. For  example, the restriction of banking activities as a result of  higher regulatory requirements can stifle economic growth,  with negative consequences for the labor market. Credit  Suisse strives to balance the interests of its shareholders  and the concerns of the regulatory authorities, legislators  and other stakeholders within society, while focusing on   the needs of clients. As a member of various global, national  and regional industry organizations, we therefore once  again actively participated in discussions about the archi-  tecture of the international financial system with bodies  such as the G-20, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the  OECD and the EU in 2011. Too Big to Fail The fact that Credit Suisse has never had to turn to the  government for support at any point in our history of more  than 150 years demonstrates that we are able to conduct  our business activities by maintaining a solid capital base  and sound risk appetite and proactively meeting the  demands of investors and regulators. In 2011, we were once again involved in the intensive  dialogue conducted both in Switzerland and internationally  about the Too Big to Fail issue, drawing on our experience  in order to support efforts to find a solution under which  systemically important banks could be allowed to fail with-  out the entire economy being jeopardized.  We basically share the public view that it should be  possible for even systemically relevant financial institutions  to fail without having to resort to bailouts that are funded  using taxpayers money. For example, we worked construc- tively with the Expert Commission appointed by the Swiss  Current International Regulatory Developments  The international reforms in the area of industry regulation are aimed at increasing the  stability and integrity of the global financial system. The initiatives that are most relevant   for Credit Suisse concern the following issues:  Prudent capital and liquidity standards for systemically relevant banks (especially Basel III)  Improvement of consumer protection and increased market transparency   (Dodd-Frank Act in the US; MiFID [Markets in Financial Instruments Directive], UCITS IV  [Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities], AIFMD [Alternative  Investment Fund Managers Directive] and EMIR [European Market Infrastructure  Regulation] directives in Europe)  Compensation systems (G-20, FSB [Financial Stability Board], FINMA [Swiss Financial  Market Supervisory Authority])  Taxation (OECD model agreement, OECD Art. 26 standard [Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development]; capital gains withholding tax with Germany and the UK;  US FATCA legislation [Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act], tax negotiations with the US) Further reforms relate to areas such as macroprudential regulation or the shadow banking  system and are being driven by the FSB. The implementation of international standards in  various countries also has significant implications for Credit Suisse. Continued on page 52  Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Dialogue and Transparency 52 Our Stakeholders As a globally active bank, Credit Suisse cultivates a dialogue with its stakeholders on a range of topics through various channels:  Marketplace     Society Clients    Media Shareholders    Local communities Financial analysts    General public   Credit Suisse  NGOs   Code of Conduct     Products and services   Environmental management   system   Operating environment  Responsibility in society  Employer/workplace   Legal & Compliance   Governments and regulators  Supplier guidelines  Suppliers Legislators  HR policies  Employees     Unions E c o n o m ic  i s s u e s E n vi r o n m e n ta l  i s s u e s S o c i al  i s s u e s Federal Council to develop recommendations to address  the Too Big to Fail issue in Switzerland and supported the  formulation of a balanced package of measures in 2011. Under the new legislation approved in September 2011,  Switzerland imposes significantly higher capital require- ments on its big banks than those prescribed by the inter-  national standard driven by the Basel Committee on  Banking Supervision. Credit Suisse essentially supports  these measures because we recognize the responsibility  that we have toward society in our role as a major bank.   To preserve the international competitiveness of the Swiss  financial center, it is, however, also necessary to take  account of international developments in the area of bank  capital requirements.  Credit Suisse has been preparing for the stricter  regulatory environment for a long time and is thus well  positioned to meet the new requirements in Switzerland   and abroad within the relevant timeframes. In February  2011, we already took an important step toward meeting   the stricter capital rules with the successful placement   of Buffer Capital Notes and thus demonstrated our  constructive approach to finding a solution to the Too Big  to Fail issue. Credit Suisse has worked closely with the  Swiss regulatory authorities to develop this competitive  solution.  Credit Suisse has actively participated in the Too Big   to Fail debate at European level in view of the importance   of our operations in the EU. Similar to Switzerland, the   EU approach to the Too Big to Fail issue revolves around  three axes: additional capital, recovery planning and reso-  lution tools aimed at ensuring the orderly wind-down of  failed banks to avoid bailouts at the cost of taxpayers.   In terms of additional capital requirements and resolution  tools, the EU discussions lag behind the debate in Switzer- land but legislation for both of these aspects will be put  before EU institutions in 2012. Credit Suisse has responded  to consultations on all three major topics and has partici- pated in industry bodies to provide thought leadership on this  critical aspect of the financial regulatory reform agenda.   We are also closely monitoring global regulatory develop- ments and contributing our expertise to the worldwide  debate to help build a more robust finance industry. Our Stakeholders Through our role as a global financial services provider, we  play an important part in the economy and society. As a  result, we are sometimes confronted with very different  demands and expectations. We cultivate a constructive  dialogue with all our stakeholders by attending or hosting  events and engaging in discussions in order to identify   their needs and interests and to jointly develop solutions to  current challenges wherever possible.  Clients The achievement of client satisfaction is a key  factor determining the success of our business. One of   the ways we ensure that our products and services meet  the needs and expectations of our clients as effectively   as possible is by conducting an annual study of over   20,000 Private Banking clients and service users world- wide (see page 8). As well as advising our clients on  Continued on page 54  53 Politicians and Regulators Credit Suisse maintains close contact with represen-  tatives of regional, national and international political  and regulatory bodies. We hold regular meetings at  which we cultivate a constructive dialogue with legis- lators and the regulatory authorities and exchange  knowledge and information. We regard our support for the Swiss political system  – known as the militia system – and for the functions  of state performed by the political parties as part of  our responsibility toward society (see below). In view  of the unique nature of the political system in our  home market, the support we provide in this area is  exclusive to Switzerland. This means that our  company does not offer financial support to political  parties in other countries. In the US, we offer  employees the option of collecting personal donations  within Credit Suisse through a Political Action  Committee (PAC). These are not company funds;  they consist entirely of voluntary private donations  made by senior officer employees in the US. Strengthening of the Swiss Political System  Financial support for parties: A distinctive  feature of the Swiss political system is the fact that  citizens assume roles in political bodies at federal,  cantonal or commune levels in parallel to their regular  professions – an approach known in Switzerland   as the militia system. Consequently, members of  parliament in Switzerland are not professional  politicians and the parties do not receive state  funding. To strengthen this system and promote   political diversity in Switzerland, where Credit Suisse  has its roots and is headquartered, the company  essentially offers support to all political parties as  part of its commitment to society. Financial  contributions are provided in response to requests  for funding and do not give rise to any obligations   on the part of the political parties that receive them;  they are made irrespective of their political agenda  and position. The only factor that influences the  support provided is the number of parliamentary  mandates held by each party at cantonal and   federal level; to receive support, a party must have   at least five seats in the Federal Assembly  (parliament). This transparent approach based on  objective criteria enables Credit Suisse to make   a politically neutral contribution to support the work  of the parties in performing functions of state –   whether at federal, cantonal or commune level.  Credit Suisse has decided to make a maximum   of CHF1million of financial support available each  year, corresponding to an average share of  CHF200,000 for each of the largest parties. This   is a long-term commitment and will be reviewed  regularly.  Meeting for employees who hold an elected  office: To contribute to the functioning of the militia  system in Switzerland, Credit Suisse also supports  employees who voluntarily assume a public role. We  allow all employees who hold an elected office, e.g.   in their local community, to devote up to 20% of their  working hours to this voluntary function while  receiving their full salary from the bank, irrespective  of which political party they may represent. Each  year, our Public Policy department organizes a meet- ing for around 300employees in Switzerland who  hold an office in the cantonal authorities or at commune  level. The event incorporates workshops and  provides a platform so that they can share their  experiences and exchange their views and ideas  with the banks top management. In 2011  an  election year in Switzerland  the use of social media  in politics and the organization of political campaigns  were the main themes of this meeting. Business Organizations A stable economic environment is important to Credit  Suisse in view of our different roles as a global  financial services provider, taxpayer and employer.  We therefore participate in industry associations,  umbrella organizations, regional financial center  bodies and bilateral chambers of commerce to maintain  a dialogue with governments and regulatory  authorities. They include the following organizations:   economiesuisse This umbrella organization represents the interests  of Swiss businesses in the political process and  works to create an optimal operating environment.  We are represented on its Board of Directors   and play a role in expert commissions and com-  mittees  including at an international level in   the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to  the OECD.  European Financial Services Round Table (EFR) The EFR supports the formation of a truly single  European market for financial services and  encourages national and European opinion leaders  to work toward the development of internationally  consistent financial regulations and supervision.  Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) The GFMA was established to join together the  common interests of financial institutions around the  world in response to the increasingly globally  interconnected nature of financial market regulation.  We are active in the regional arms of the GFMA:  AFME (Association for Financial Markets in Europe),  SIFMA (The Securities Industry and Financial Markets  Association) and ASIFMA (The Asia Securities  Industry and Financial Markets Association).  International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) As a member of the ICC, we are committed to  promoting free international trade and participate in  working groups on the topics of banks, economic  policy, energy and climate issues.  Institute of International Finance (IIF) The IIF represents the interests of globally active  financial institutions. We are represented on its  Board of Directors and in various committees and  working groups, including the Special Committee   for Effective Regulation and the Cross-border  Resolution Working Group.  Swiss Association of Employers This overarching employer organization represents   the interests of employers across all industries and  regions vis--vis the public, politicians, the authorities  and administration, and other public bodies. Credit  Suisse is represented on its Board of Directors.  Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) This organization is committed to improving operating  conditions for banks in Switzerland. Credit Suisse   is represented on the SBA Board of Directors and  various specialist committees. Through our role in   the SBA, we also participate in the European Banking  Federation.  World Economic Forum (WEF) We have been a member of the WEF for over   20years and have been a strategic partner since  2006. The forum provides a platform for leading  economics experts, politicians, academics and  journalists from around the globe to come together  to debate the most pressing issues facing the   world. At the annual meeting in Davos in 2011,   we were involved in sessions on topics including  sovereign debt, financial market regulation,  family-run businesses, social entrepreneurship and  philanthropy. Engaging in a Dialogue with Stakeholders  Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Dialogue and Transparency 54 Selected Sustainability Networks, Initiatives and Working Groups Banking Environment Initiative Founded in 2010, this initiative develops strategies on  how capital flows can be redirected from activities that  are harmful to the environment and climate toward  sustainable activities. Credit Suisse and 10other global  banks participate in the initiative.  Equator Principles We conduct our project finance activities in emerging  economies and developing countries in accordance with  the Equator Principles, which are based on environ-  mental and social standards defined by the World Bank  Group. Credit Suisse was one of the first companies to  sign up to the Equator Principles in 2003 and we report  annually on our efforts to implement them. Since 2010,  we have been actively involved in the Equator Principles  Steering Committee. As a member of its working  groups, we also contribute to the further development   of this initiative and help to promote a dialogue with  NGOs (see also page55).  Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Credit Suisse is an Ordinary Member of the RSPO in   the Banks and Investors membership category and is  committed to working with clients and other industry  stakeholders across the palm oil industry supply chain to  promote the RSPOs vision and mission (see page13). Swiss Association for Environmentally Conscious  Management (bu) This national network consists of over 400Swiss firms  that work together to promote the sustainable develop-  ment of the economy. It fosters the exchange of know-  ledge and campaigns for the development of a political  framework to enable the business community to work  both sustainably and profitably. In 2011, Credit Suisse  attended the annual conference Forum  held by the  Swiss Association for Environmentally Conscious  Management and delivered a keynote speech on the   role of the state in building a sustainable economy.  UN Global Compact In 2000, Credit Suisse was one of the first companies   to sign up to this leading international agreement, which  promotes a sustainable approach to business. We have  pledged to uphold the UN Global Compacts  10principles relating to human rights, labor standards,  environmental protection and anti-corruption efforts. As  an active member, we report annually on our progress,  regularly attend UN Global Compact events and  participate in its national networks in Switzerland and  Singapore (see also pages58). United Nations Environment Programme Finance  Initiative (UNEP FI)  Credit Suisse became one of the first signatories of  UNEPFI in 1992. More than 190participating banks,  insurers and asset managers have made a voluntary  commitment to promote a sustainable approach to  business within the financial sector. In 2011, we once  again participated in UNEPFI meetings and played an  active role in working groups on biodiversity and human  rights.  ASrIA – Association for Sustainable and Respon- sible Investment in Asia  As a member of this initiative, Credit Suisse has pledged  to promote sustainable investments in Asia and to  contribute to the exchange of information and experience  about this topic. In 2011, Credit Suisse sponsored the  evening event at the ASrIA Conference held to mark the  10th anniversary of the organization in Hong Kong.   The event was attended by over 250participants, who  discussed the further expansion of sustainable invest-  ments in Asia. The ASrIA Sustainable Finance in Asia  Awards 2011 were presented by Credit Suisse Asset  Management, and Credit Suisse was also among the  panelists discussing the topic Scaling up Sustainable  Finance in Asia. financial matters, we regularly organize conferences and  discussion-based events to promote an exchange of views  and ideas. One example is the Credit Suisse Salon, which  was launched in 2008 and provides a platform for selected  clients to meet with opinion leaders and experts from a   wide range of industries, as well as Credit Suisse managers,  to discuss key social, economic or political topics. In  mid-2011, Mohammed El-Baradei, the Egyptian politician  and former Director General of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) was a guest speaker at the eighth  Credit Suisse Salon entitled The Middle East – Quo Vadis?.   Investors We maintain an intensive dialogue with  investors, analysts and the financial media. Our Investor  Relations department has gained a high level of recognition  for its work in industry circles. In 2011, it once again achieved  top rankings in the surveys conducted by Thomson Extel  and Institutional Investor, confirming the quality of its  services.  Employees Credit Suisse has, for years, been working  closely with bodies that represent employee interests such  as the Credit Suisse Staff Council (PKOM) in Switzerland,  national employee associations and the European Works  Council to ensure that the needs of our people are taken  properly into account. In conjunction with an independent  consulting firm, we also regularly conduct internal surveys   to assess our employees level of satisfaction with their  working environment, their opportunities for professional  development and our corporate culture. Their feedback  provides us with a valuable indication of the aspects that   we need to address to bring about improvements. The bank-   55 wide engagement survey conducted in 2011 indicated that  the level of satisfaction among Credit Suisse employees  was higher than the industry average (see page37).  Society Credit Suisse is an active member of society and  engages in a direct dialogue with many politicians, legislators,  members of the business community, academics and non-  governmental organizations (NGOs). We also participate in  discussions about economic, political, environmental and  social issues with associations and think-tanks. As part of  this social dialogue, we contribute our viewpoint and  experience as a global bank and offer our expertise on a  range of topics.  Dialogue about the Environment Credit Suisse also actively participates in the debate about  environmental themes and in discussions on how to  promote a more sustainable, climate-friendly approach to  business. In addition, we exchange knowledge with various  organizations and groups of experts (see also page 53).   For example, Credit Suisse participates in a working group  of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) that  Events on Environmental and Social Themes in 2011  Asian Investment Conference (AIC) The AIC, which is organized by Credit Suisse in Hong Kong, is now regarded as one of the  most important investor conferences in Asia Pacific, attracting around 2,000business  leaders, academics, politicians and regulators, as well as institutional and high-net-worth  investors. In 2011, the conference enabled the participants to meet with experts to discuss  global economic developments, to increase their knowledge about investment opportuni- ties in Asia Pacific and to attend presentations by leading listed companies.   Lifefair Forum Credit Suisse hosted four Lifefair Forums in Switzerland on the topics Green Economy –  Opportunities and Risks, Smart Grids, Energy Transition and Carbon Compensation  and Rio +20. The Lifefair Forum is a thought leadership platform supported by the confer-  ence organizer Lifefair in collaboration with Credit Suisse and economiesuisse, the Swiss  business association. A common feature of all these events is that they provide a platform  for keynote speakers to explore the prerequisites for an economically and ecologically  successful approach to sustainability and the resulting opportunities.   China Sustainable Banking Strategy Forum Credit Suisse gave two presentations about our sustainability commitments at this forum in  Beijing. Participants in the event underscored the importance of considering environmental  and social criteria to support the future development of the Chinese financial sector. On the  second day of the Forum, Credit Suisse took part in an event organized by the environmental  groups Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and International Rivers at which we discussed  sustainability issues in banking with various NGOs.   Crops, Capital and the Environment As part of a collaboration between Credit Suisse and WWF to promote sustainable  agriculture, we organized an event for employees in New York to focus on the agricultural  sector, its significant impacts on the environment, and the implications of sustainability   on competitiveness within the sector.   Carbon Thought Leadership We organized an event in New York with presentations about energy generation in the US  using emerging extraction technologies with a focus on shale gas. The US has seen   a boom in the use of this type of gas, although it poses certain environmental risks –   especially for groundwater.   Climate Change Conference COP-17 Together with other representatives of Swiss businesses, Credit Suisse gave video  presentations at the COP-17 in Durban on its commitment to addressing environmental   and climate issues and showcased its expertise in financing renewable energy.   2,000 Watt Society Credit Suisse participated in an exhibition of the 2,000Watt Society project in the city of  Basel. According to an energy use model developed by the Swiss Federal Institute of  Technology (ETH), it should be possible to reduce per capita energy consumption to a  maximum of 2,000 watts without experiencing any real inconvenience in our daily life. Dialogue with NGOs In 2011, a wide range of topics was discussed with national   and international NGOs covering the environmental and/or social  dimensions of sustainability. Issue  Organization Agriculture and  WWF soft commodities  Friends of the Earth Climate change  WWF   BankTrack Coal financing  Friends of the Earth   Greenpeace   Urgewald Forestry, palm oil and   Bruno Manser Fund biodiversity  Greenpeace   The Nature Conservancy    World Resources Institute    WWF Mountain top removal   Natural Resources Defense Council coal mining  Rainforest Action Network   Sierra Club Nuclear power  Greenpeace   Urgewald   Friends of the Earth Unconventional oil and gas Natural Resources Defense Council Human rights  Amnesty International   Berne Declaration Controversial arms  Netwerk Vlaanderen   IKV Pax Christi addresses energy and climate issues, as well as in a  working group established by the United Nations Environ- ment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) that focuses  on biodiversity. In both cases, we seek to provide a finance  industry perspective on the topics in question and contrib- ute our expertise to the debate.  Listening to Public Concerns 2011 saw the emergence of the Occupy Movement, which  articulated fundamental concerns about free market  societies and the stability of the financial system and of   the banking industry.

Response: We continued to foster a dialogue with different  groups of stakeholders to the greatest extent possible while respecting confidentiality requirements. Challenge: Maintain a constructive dialogue with   government and regulatory bodies on regulatory topics. Response: We participated constructively in the Too Big to  Fail debate both in Switzerland and internationally, drawing  on our experience and expertise to help develop appropriate  solutions that will strengthen the financial system while  safeguarding the competitiveness of the banking industry. Challenge: Promote political diversity in Switzerland and   help to strengthen the militia system of politics through  measures including the provision of transparent and neutral  financial support for political parties that focuses exclusively  on their role in supporting the state.  Response: We have developed a transparent and comprehen- sible system to provide financial support to political parties.  Our approach is politically neutral, is based on objective  criteria and is open to all parties that perform functions of  state.  Challenges and Responses 2011 Reports and Publications  Contributing to the Public Debate In 2011, we once again contributed our expertise to the public debate and  supported the formation of public opinion, as well as helping to find solutions to  current problems. We regularly publish studies, analyses and specialist articles   on important economic, political and social issues. This information not only assists   clients and investors when making decisions but also attracts the interest of   politicians, business representatives and the media. Credit Suisse Barometers For more than 30 years, Credit Suisse has conducted an  annual representative survey to evaluate the issues that  are of most concern to the Swiss public and to examine  aspects of the Swiss national identity. The findings provide  an insight into the current mood in the country and are   a source of information for politicians, the business  community and the media. Credit Suisse also conducts   a Youth Barometer  a comprehensive representative  survey to provide an insight into the lifestyles, problems  and attitudes of young people in Switzerland, the US  and Brazil (see page24). Credit Suisse Research Institute The Credit Suisse Research Institute produces in-depth  analyses of fundamental social, economic, environmen-  tal and demographic trends that are expected to impact  global markets. This thought leadership initiative brings  together our own global network of analysts and some   of the worlds most distinguished experts, the Senior  Advisors to the Research Institute and independent aca-  demics. The publications issued by the Research Institute  are made available not only to clients but also to the  public. The Research Institute also organizes workshops  and audio conferences on current events. Investment Research Credit Suisse economists, strategists and investment  specialists in our various Research units in Switzerland  and international locations produce a global economic  assessment and market outlook on a monthly basis. While   these publications are primarily geared toward our clients,  members of the public with an interest in these subjects  also make extensive use of our research. In addition, we  provide regular information on how investors can apply our  research findings. As part of our Global Investor series,  we publish regular background analyses on current topics  and longer-term trends, as well as their potential impacts  on the financial markets and investments. bulletin and online articles In addition to economic analyses, Credit Suisse produces  further publications that are geared toward a broad reader-  ship. Our international award-winning client magazine  bulletin contains articles on feature topics as well as  background reports on socio-political issues, economic  trends and our environmental and social commitments.  In 2011, the different issues of the publication were   dedicated to the themes Roots, West, Youth, Wood   and Time. Our weekly online articles provide readers with  up-to-date information on a range of current topics. stable financial system and for banking resolution regimes  that do not require direct financial support from govern- ments and taxpayers. However, we believe that we can  achieve more tangible progress overall by interacting with  NGOs that can commit to concrete measures rather   than a movement. Credit Suisse therefore engages in a  dialogue with a broad range of NGOs to remain informed  about environmental and social developments and issues  that may be relevant for our clients or the bank. These  organizations may specialize in certain topics or have more  general knowledge about themes of mutual interest.   Such exchanges of opinions occur at conferences or  bilateral meetings. In some instances, NGOs contact us   to discuss their concerns about a specific transaction   or to elicit our opinion on a topic or trend that they view with  concern. Despite the fundamental differences between   the mission of an NGO and the mandate of a corporation,  these exchanges are not only characterized by divergent  opinions but can often also lead to agreement on a number   of points.  www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/dialogue  57 Sustainability Reporting and Ratings Our Corporate Responsibility Report is designed to inform our stakeholders  about the principles that guide us in our daily work and to illustrate the ways   in which we address current economic, environmental and social challenges   in our business activities. We want to create long-term value for our clients, share- holders, employees and other stakeholders within society  and believe that the only means of achieving this is by  adopting a sustainable approach to business. We not only  strive to uphold the professional standards and ethical  values defined in our Code of Conduct but also regard   the assumption of our corporate responsibilities as the   basis for all aspects of our activities. Consequently, we   take account of economic, environmental and social  aspects when performing our core business operations. The Corporate Responsibility Report forms part of  Credit Suisses annual reporting suite (see inside cover for  further details) and presents the principles, goals and chal-  lenges that we face in the area of corporate responsibility.   It offers an overview of our main activities in this area and   of the progress we achieved in 2011. It also documents our  progress in implementing the 10 principles prescribed by  the UN Global Compact in our capacity as a signatory to the  agreement (see page 58). Unless stated otherwise, the  information contained in this report relates to the year 2011. It is only possible for us to portray a selection of our   activities in the printed publication due to the limited   amount of space available. The Responsibility Chronicle,  which is available for the iPad or as an interactive PDF,  therefore offers interested readers a vibrant multimedia  insight into our global projects and initiatives through   a series of more in-depth reports, videos, podcasts and  image galleries.  To ensure that we can supply the full breadth of infor-  mation required by our stakeholders, the contents of this  report, as well as additional information and data on all the  themes discussed within it, can be found on the Internet at: www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility We regard transparent reporting as an important basis for  the cultivation of a dialogue with our stakeholders and   welcome input on our activities. Feedback can be sent to:  responsibility.corporate@credit-suisse.com Global Reporting Initiative and External Assurance Our Corporate Responsibility Report reflects the require- ments set out in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).   This internationally recognized voluntary standard de-  fines principles and indicators that companies can use to  measure and report on their economic, environmental   and social performance. The GRI guidelines are currently  observed by over 3,000 organizations in 60 countries,  helping to increase the transparency, uniformity and com-  parability of corporate responsibility reports. Detailed  information about Credit Suisses GRI indicators can be  found at:  www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/gri Credit Suisse had its GRI Content Index reviewed and  assessed for the first time in 2010. For 2011, GRI has  verified Credit Suisses compliance with the GRI G3  Guidelines and has given Credit Suisse the disclosure   level of A+. In addition, Credit Suisses corporate re-  sponsibility reporting was externally assessed and inde-  pendently assured for the first time for the Corporate  Responsibility Report 2011. The assurance was conducted  by SGS, which confirmed that Credit Suisses corporate  responsibility disclosure meets the requirements of GRI  level A+. The results of SGS assessment are docu-  mented in the appendix of this report and at:  www.credit-suisse.com/responsibility/gri  In a separate engagement, SGS has certified Credit  Suisses environmental management system globally in  accordance with ISO 14001:2004 (see page45). Continued on page 59 Carbon Disclosure Project In 2011, Credit Suisse took part in the Carbon Disclosure Project for the 10th con-  secutive year. This organization, which represents more than 550institutional   investors with invested assets of around USD71trillion, aims to provide guidance to  investors on climate-related opportunities and risks for companies. In 2011, around  3,700 firms worldwide disclosed information on their climate strategies and greenhouse  gas emissions. Credit Suisse scored 81 out of a possible 100points – an increase of   13points compared to 2010. The improved 2011 disclosure score not only reflects an  increased level of disclosure but also an improvement in internal data management  practices to understand global greenhouse gas emissions and a greater insight into the  risks and opportunities that climate change presents to Credit Suisses business.

External Assessments of Our Reporting Credit Suisse was assigned first place in Switzerland and  second place globally among banks in the Best Global  Green Brand rankings published by the consulting firm  Interbrand for 2011. The rankings are based on the quality  of the companies communications as well as the public  perception of their sustainability efforts and their actual  green performance. Our online corporate responsibility   reporting achieved second place in Switzerland and   22nd place in Europe in the 2011 CSR Online Awards  presented by the communications agency Lundquist  Communication. Sustainability Ratings and Indices  Investors are increasingly interested in environmentally and  socially responsible investments and therefore not only  consider financial data but also sustainability criteria when  reaching investment decisions. The analyses and ratings  produced by specialized sustainability rating agencies and  index providers serve as a guide in this context. Credit  Suisse has been included in leading sustainability indices  such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices and the  FTSE4Good Index Series for a number of years. The   Credit Suisse Group share is therefore included in various  sustainability funds.  Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  Achievements 2011 and Objectives 2012 60 Achievements 2011 and Objectives 2012 Objectives 2011 Achievements Objectives 2012 Banking   Continue to refine the tools used to examine   sustainability-related risks in our business   transactions and work on their implementation.  Foster cross-divisional collaboration through the  Green Business Initiative (GBI), the pur pose of  which is to help coordinate efforts in the areas of  clean energy, water and sustain able commodities.  Develop innovative solutions and services to link  the top and the base of the wealth pyramid and  continue to actively support the responsible devel-  opment of the microfinance industry.  We completed a technical upgrade of our intranet-  based risk review system and finalized our sustain-  ability risk checklist. Employees with direct client  contact and employees in control functions received  training about the risks in various sectors. We up-  dated certain sector policies (e.g. our Mining Policy).  Energy efficiency and carbon intensity are now also  taken into account in the case of certain oil and   gas extraction and power generation transactions.  We intensified collaboration and the exchange of  information through measures including our monthly  internal GBI publication that informs our different  businesses and regions about relevant activities  elsewhere in the bank. We have a number of trans-  actions in the pipeline as a result of increased  collaboration driven by the GBI.  We developed our Local Currency Microfinance   Note to address the strong demand for local cur-  rency financing in the microfinance sector. We also  published a white paper on microfinance and sev-  eral research reports on this topic.  Continue to adjust the banks business model   to the new regulatory environment.  Contribute constructively to regulatory reforms  and efforts to build a more robust financial system.  Further refine bank-wide risk review processes,  tools and training to promptly identify environmen- tal and social risks relating to potential business  transactions.   Continue to foster cross-divisional collaboration  through the Green Business Initiative (GBI) to   share business insights and promote our offering   of investment products and services that focus   on sustainability themes.  Further integrate climate change considerations  into risk assessments.  Continue to develop solutions in the area of  microfinance to promote the responsible develop- ment of the sector, e.g. with our products and   our microfinance initiative. Society   Sharpen the strategic direction of the three   focus themes Employee Engagement, Education  and Microfinance Capacity Building.       Expand the support of activities and partnerships   in emerging markets.         Work more closely and systematically with   departments and raise awareness of volunteering  opportunities that enable employees to use   their competencies to add value to our partners   and our communities.    Further improve the Access to Quality Education  programs through measures which – depending   on the regions – focus on building infrastructures,  providing scholarships and advancing excellent  teaching in order to prepare young people for sub-  sequent education attainment or employment.   As part of our Global Education Initiative, we  began a three-year program to improve the quality/ relevance of education. In the school year 2011–2012,   an estimated 72,000 students will benefit from  improved access to and/or a better education and  12,700 teachers will be trained. With the Microfi- nance Capacity Building Initiative, we served 1.8 mil-  lion entrepreneurs and their families in 2011 and  launched a second three-year partnership cycle.  Employee engagement increased in Brazil, China,  India, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, as well   as in Eastern Europe and Russia. We entered into a  new partnership in Mexico and launched our first  Philanthropy Committee in Poland.  We increased employee engagement by 15% in  terms of the number of volunteers and level of  volunteering as a result of closer collaboration with  internal departments. The number of volunteers  involved in our skills-based Global Citizens Program  nearly doubled and we increased the number of  countries where employees can go on assignment.  We engaged in projects that focus on providing  access to education for underprivileged children   in developing countries by supporting charities in  India, Laos and Cambodia in building schools,  improving school facilities and providing learning  materials. In the US, we launched our Teach for  America volunteering project.   Further sharpen the strategic direction of our  social commitments with a focus on education and  microfinance by strengthening local organizations  and improving the skills of their employees to  enable them to serve more end-beneficiaries.  Further strengthen employee engagement, in  particular skills-based volunteering. Increase virtual  volunteering and enhance volunteering activities  and partnerships in the emerging markets.  Further develop more effective synergies between  our clients, NGO partners, banking units and   the units coordinating employee engagement to  multiply the positive impacts of our activities on  society.  61 Objectives 2011 Achievements Objectives 2012 Employer   Translate Credit Suisses refined global HR strategy  into tangible actions and behavior, fostering diversity  and inclusion. Enable further development of em-  ployees through a new forward-looking approach to  reviewing and managing performance. Continue to  be an innovative leader in learning and development.  Reinforce the understanding that every employee  is an important driver of the banks long-term   performance and that managers are accountable  for proactively developing their people. Deepen   our committed partnership culture by empowering  leadership and collaboration at all levels and across  divisions to serve our clients needs.         Simultaneously improve the assessment of talent  and systematically develop into managerial and  expert roles. Strengthen our presence on university  campuses globally to increase the number of  people we hire at entry level from schools and   universities – with the mid-term goal of such talent  accounting for half of the annual intake.     Embed client skills deep in the organization.  We introduced a new performance management  approach to systematically assess employee   performance based on a personal plan defined in  conjunction with each employees line manager.  The process places a strong focus on learning and  development, including internal mobility.   Using our enhanced performance management  approach, we assessed the extent to which em-  ployees and managers live our core values, focus  on development and drive overall performance.   We also established a Global Leadership Council   to further strengthen internal collaboration and   our partnership culture in order to set an example  for employees and to help them to deliver on our  commitment to clients.   We continued to refine our talent development  process to ensure a consistent approach to suc-  cession management. Measures include talent  reviews, which encompassed 63% of our workforce  in 2011. We held a range of campus events and  launched a new marketing campaign to raise   our profile among graduates. We also intensified   recruiting efforts in key strategic markets.  We executed various measures to further embed  client skills in areas of the business with direct  client contact as well as in support areas. Measures  include running a mandatory certification process  for relationship managers in Private Banking.  Continue to implement compensation models   that focus on long-term performance and align  employee and shareholder interests, e.g. by   deferring a significant proportion of discretionary  variable incentive awards and using instruments  that are subject to claw-back provisions based   on certain performance criteria.  Further refine our performance management  process based on initial experience with a strong  focus on employee development. Environment   Continue to engage in the climate change debate  and to explore the potential impacts of climate  change on our business while also building aware-  ness for climate issues.  Raise awareness for biodiversity risks and  opportunities, also in connection with the Inter-  national Year of Forests (2011).     Implement further improvement measures based  on our ISO 14001-certified environmental  management system – with a special focus on  reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  We participated in the economiesuisse climate  campaign and cleantech study.       We extended our Forestry Policy to include   agribusiness issues. We also organized events to  educate our employees about the importance   of forests and biodiversity.  Our E-Maximo energy and resource management  tool, which facilitates the definition of efficiency  targets for individual buildings and illustrates the  potential of specific operational enhancements   and energy-related investments, was further devel-  oped and tested.  Strengthen engagement on climate policy and  continue to encourage employees to take active  climate-related measures.   Implement further steps to improve our   environmental performance based on our   ISO 14001-certified environmental manage-  ment system and take measures to meet   our environmental goals, focusing on the main  greenhouse gas drivers. Dialogue   Continue dialogue and engagement with impor-  tant stakeholders to recognize global trends   as early as possible and to jointly work on solutions  through our involvement in networks and initiatives  as well as through selected publications.     Further increase dialogue with NGOs and IGOs  and continue implementation of partnerships with  selected organizations.  We are positioned as a knowledgeable and re -  spected partner in discussions on finance industry  reforms. Through the successful placement of  Buffer Capital Notes, we took an important step  toward meeting the stricter capital rules resulting  from the Too Big to Fail issue.  We strengthened our cooperation with various  organizations worldwide, e.g. Earthwatch. We also  engaged in an ongoing dialogue with NGOs and  IGOs in all our regions, e.g. Berne Declaration,  Greenpeace, the UN Global Compact and UNEP FI.   We contributed constructively to efforts to find a  solution to regularize foreign assets in Switzerland.  Communicate with maximum transparency   while observing duties of confidentiality.  Engage in a dialogue to support regulatory   reforms and efforts to build a more robust financial  system.    GP5008 Issue 1          SGS STATEMENT ON ASSURANCE  of Credit Suisse Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  SCOPE   SGS was commissioned by Credit Suisse to conduct an independent assurance of the GRI-based disclosure on sustainability in 2011.  Our assurance scope included the GRI disclosure obligations and figures in accordance with the GRI Index published at www.credit- suisse.com/responsibility. The scope of the assurance, based on the SGS Sustainability Report Assurance methodology, included all texts  and 2011 data in accompanying tables contained in the printed Corporate Responsibility Report 2011 and referenced information on the  webpage of Credit Suisse as quoted in the GRI Index. The assurance process did not consider any data from previous years.     CONTENT  The Board of Directors or the Executive Board and the Management of the organisation are responsible for the details provided in the  annual report and on the website and in the presentation. SGS was not involved in the preparation of any of the material included in the  GRI Index and acted as an independent assuror of the data and text using the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting  Guidelines (2006) as a standard. The content of this Assurors Statement and the opinion(s) it gives is the responsibility of SGS.    CERTIFIER INDEPENDENCE AND COMPETENCIES  The SGS Group is active as a globally leading company in the areas of assurance, testing, verifying and certifying in more than 140  countries and provides services, including the certification of management systems and services. SGS confirms that it is independent from  Credit Suisse. It is unbiased and no conflicts of interest exist with the organisation, its subsidiaries and beneficiaries. The assurance team  was assembled based on knowledge, experience and qualifications for this assignment.    METHODOLOGY  The SGS Group has developed a set of protocols for the assurance of Sustainability Reports based on current best practice guidance  provided in the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (2006). SGS also certified the environmental management  systems of Credit Suisse (housekeeping only) in accordance with ISO 14001:2004. The assurance comprised the evaluation of external  sources, meetings with relevant employees, a verification of the documentation and recordings as well as the validation of these with  external institutions and/or beneficiaries, where required. Financial data drawn directly from independently audited financial accounts was  not checked back to its source as part of this assurance process.    OPINION  On the basis of the above methodology, we did not detect any instances from which we would have to conclude that the information and  data disclosed by Credit Suisse in accordance with the GRI Index 2011 may be incorrect. The information and data disclosed represent,  to our mind, a fair and balanced picture of the sustainability efforts made by Credit Suisse in 2011.   There are optimisation potentials concerning   - Materiality/stakeholder inclusiveness: stakeholders expectations shall be more systematically evaluated and reflected in the report      - Accuracy: GRI indicators which require a specific answer (e.g. figures, percentages, etc.) shall be more accurately disclosed  - Continual improvement: quantitative objective shall be set based on KPIs including all relevant GRI indicators  - Systematic implementation of policies and procedures in all parts of the bank  - Better disclosure practice: GRI indicators shall be disclosed in the actual text of the report and only exceptionally in the GRI Content   Index  - Sustainability risk management: shall cover the full range of sustainability risks, not only focus on transaction risks (which are managed   in a highly-professional manner)  We believe that the existing gaps are well under control due to corrective actions taken and the Corporate Responsibility Report 2011  meets the requirements of level A+ of the GRI (2006) in accordance with the GRI Index.
