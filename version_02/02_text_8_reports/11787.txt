Page 1/8          United Nations Global Compact      Communication on Progress    Year: 2010        STATEMENT  Exxaro Resources became a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact in 2007. This was a logical  progression in our ongoing commitment to sustainability, given our shared goals and focus on universal  values.    In preparing this report, we drew on stakeholder feedback, a review of current standards and  conventions (including Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), UN Global Compact principles, Organisation  for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines on multinational enterprises,  International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions 69 and 176, as well as UN declaration of human  rights) in developing material themes that will guide this and future reports. These themes include:      Implementation and maintenance of ethical business practices and sound systems of corporate  governance     Integration of sustainable development considerations in corporate decision making processes     Implementation of risk management strategies based on credible data sets    Adherence to fundamental human rights and respect of cultures, customs and values in dealings  with stakeholders    Contributing to the social, economic and institutional development of home societies    Implementing effective, sustained and transparent engagement strategies with all stakeholders  groups, as well as explicit responsiveness to stakeholder concerns    Demonstrating understanding of and implementing responses to the business case for  sustainability.    In the message from the Chief Executive Officer in the integrated annual report, Mr Sipho Nkosi says  I believe 2009 was a year that truly tested the depth of mining companies commitments to  sustainable development — and at every level. Faced with myriad challenges in protecting the  economic bottom line, we developed innovative solutions to honour our commitments to the social and  environmental bottom lines by making available funds work harder and by ensuring that every initiative  benefited the maximum number of people. In this respect, Exxaro proved its mettle. The benefit of  integrating our safety, health and environment division with our sustainable development initiatives  emerged in the form of synergies across commodity businesses, disciplines and divisions. Perhaps  the best example of this is our carbon foot printing project which prompted the vegetative study, which  in turn informed our water management study and each sites biodiversity action plan. We have also  made solid progress in our ability to report meaningful data off a common information technology       Page 2/8  platform. This has been most evident in the areas of energy, air quality monitoring and socioeconomic  development    The groups progress in implementing Global Compact principles is summarised overleaf, and cross- referenced to supporting or additional documentation. This is an incremental process, with the ultimate aim  of measurable annual progress in those principles where we are not already fully supportive.        09 May 2011  SAFETY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT    Contact: Ramesh Chhagan    Email: Ramesh.Chhagan@exxaro.com       Phone: +27 12 307 3160       Fax: +27 12 307 5923       Page 3/8  Global Compact Principle  Summary of Actions taken and Impact  Achieved  Measurement of results  Human Rights  1: Businesses should support  and respect the protection of  internationally  proclaimed  human rights;  Induction  programmes  educate  employees about human rights. Policies  on discrimination, harassment and racism  are in place, as area structures to protect  employees human rights in the workplace          All employees including security personnel are fully  trained after appointment on Human rights aspects  relevant to each operation. Refresher courses also cover  human rights issues.    Exxaro  through  Human  Resources  Development  Policies aims to:      Develop and sustain core competencies and  maximise human resources to meet the groups  strategic  objectives  and  improve  operational  performance;    Create a learning culture by assisting and facilitate  the  process  in  which  employees  and  their  dependants take responsibility for improving their  own educational and competency levels, to the  mutual benefit of the individual and the organisation;  and     Establish life-long learning as the major thrust of  learning and development.    Full time employees receive a range of benefits, many of  which exceed legislative stipulations for South Africas  basic conditions of employment.    The group continues to focus on home ownership to  comply with the mining charter and a new life-long  housing strategy was developed two years ago.  2: and make sure that they are  not complicit in human rights  abuses.   Exxaro subscribes to the Bill of Rights  enshrined in the South African  Constitution which, among other things,  prohibits human rights abuse.  To date Exxaro has not been complicit in the violation of  any human rights.

Exxaro has a displinary code, which is  based on the principle of fairness as  required by labour law.     As a signatory to the UN Global Compact,  Exxaro  encourages  freedom  of  association and collective bargaining.  Almost 70% of Exxaro employees are represented by  affiliated trade unions, predominantly National Union of  Mine Workers (NUM) with 54.5%; and solidarity with  10.7%. Other recognized unions are Mineworkers Union  of Namibia (MUN); National Union of Metalworkers in  South Africa (NUMSA); and United Association of South  Africa (UASA).     Negotiations for improved wages and conditions are  conducted in various in-house forums and through the  Chamber of Mines.   In September 2010, members of NUM employed at the  Exxaro Sands operation in KwaZulu-Natal went on strike  over a wage dispute. Amicable and mutually beneficial  resolution was reached within three weeks. This case  illustrates  Exxaros  commitment  to  freedom  of  association and the effective recognition of the right to  collective bargaining.    4: the elimination of all forms  of  forced  and  compulsory  labour;  Exxaro  Labour  and  Human  Rights  Policy.Subject to the provisions of the  Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,  the Company will not cause, demand or  impose forced labour on any other person    Exxaro ensures child labour is not  tolerated and forced or compulsory labour  is not practised  At the heart of the groups employment equity strategy  there are detailed plans developed by each business  operation in consultation with employees and trade  unions. These plans are updated and progress reported  to the board of directors quarterly and to the government  authorities annually.     By following these plans, each business operation  ensures that all vacancies are advertised and that  recruitment and skills development are conducted  responsibly. No employee is forced to provide services  against his/her will.

Attracting  women to work in the groups core  business of mining remains a focus area  for Exxaro.  Exxaro already exceeds SA mining charter targets on  Women in Mining.     In 2010 five women aiming to become miners began  their training programme at Tshikondeni coal operation.  By the end of November, they had completed the first  phase of their studies at the colliery training college and  will train for another 12 months on-site before qualifying  as miners.   Environment  7: Businesses should support  a precautionary approach to  environmental challenges;  The SHE committee of the Board of  Directors  oversees  the  group-wide  development of policies and guidelines for  Health,  Environmental  and  Safety  management.          Exxaro adopts a precautionary approach  recommended by National Environmental  Management Act (NEMA) in evaluating  the Environmental Impacts of business  All Exxaro operations have Environmental Management  Plans (EMP) as required by legislation and are  constantly updated. The group also has a record number  of integrated water use licences (IWUL) which were  approved by the relevant regulatory department in 2010.  Both the EMPs and IWULs are key indicators in ensuring  that Exxaro becomes a sustainable business.    Exxaro believes conservation of the natural resources is  becoming increasingly important and the group intends  to be a mining company that leads by example in  protecting the environment and demonstrating that  mining  activities  can  co-exist  with  world  class     Page 6/8  Global Compact Principle  Summary of Actions taken and Impact  Achieved  Measurement of results  opportunities (pg 91)    Revised  Exxaro  Safety  and  Sustainable  Development  (SSD)  Policy  commits to Complying with all applicable  SSD  legislation  and  international  obligations as a minimum requirement  and implementing  effective company  standards, programmes and processes to  manage risks;      Consultation  with  employees,  representatives and other stakeholders in  appropriate  forums  to  develop,  communicate and review responsible  and innovative policies, programmes  and guidelines that provide safeguards  for  the  community,  employees,  contractors and the environment, while  providing flexibility to meet the needs of  our businesses.  environmental conservation initiatives, thereby ensuring  the right of future generations to a healthy, complete and  rich environment.     To enhance implementation of precautionary approach  and sustainable use of natural resources group  standards  for  Air  Quality  Management,  Water  Management, Biodiversity Management, Rehabilitation,  Mine Closure Management and Environmental Incident  Management were implemented in 2010. In 2010,  additional  operations  obtained  both  ISO  14001  environmental accreditation and ISO 18001 safety  accreditation. This increased the total to 16 of 17  operations accredited to date, as compared to 13 out of  17 operations in 2009.     In 2011 the group will continue to develop cleaner  energy initiatives encompassing a combination of co- generation, carbon credit trading, renewable energy,  coal-bed methane development and coal-based load  projects.   8:  undertake  initiatives  to  promote greater environmental  responsibility;  Exxaros core focus is on conserving  natural resources and reducing the  burden of pollutants on the environment  by:   Complying  with  all  applicable  environmental legislation –       as a  starting point. The aim is to exceed  compliance.   And developing innovative policies and  programmes  for  addressing  environmental impacts.  In 2011, Exxaro embarked on a number of initiatives:    Exxaro participates in the CDP project since 2006;    Participated in the inaugural CDP water project in  2010;    A major water management programme aimed at  setting clean water utilisation and efficiency targets  throughout the group has been introduced;    Conducting annual safety, health and environment  audits at all business operations to ensure  compliance  with  legislation  as  well  as  with  international protocols       Page 7/8  Global Compact Principle  Summary of Actions taken and Impact  Achieved  Measurement of results  9:  and  encourage  the  development and diffusion of  environmentally  friendly  technologies.  Exxaro  encourages  innovative  technologies to reduce environmental  impacts, reuse and recycling of waste.       The energy-efficient goals set by the  authorities  (Department  of  Mineral  Resources)  were  analysed  and  incorporated into the eco-friendly housing  project in Lephalale. The houses were  carefully planned and have, among  others, the following features:   Grey-water recycling – recycled water  used for toilets, garden and washing  cars, etc;   Overhanging  roofs  to  capture  rainwater that can be used for  cooking, washing and gardening; and   Solar systems to heat water; save  electricity and reduce greenhouse  emissions.    Exxaro has made progress with the implementation of a  number of green projects:      Sophisticated fume-extraction system installed at  Namakwa Sands, with noticeable reduction of visible  fumes;    Development of renewable energy projects, namely  wind farm projects in Tsitsikamma (Eastern Cape)  and Brand se Baai in Western Cape and solar and  gas project in Limpopo; and    Feasibility studies on using furnace offgas to co- generate electricity are in the final stages.       Page 8/8  Global Compact Principle  Summary of Actions taken and Impact  Achieved  Measurement of results  Anti Corruption  10: Businesses should work  against all forms of corruption,  including extortion and bribery.    A committee of the Board of Exxaro is  intimately  involved  in  ensuring  that  Exxaros policy against corruption is  effectively implemented    In terms of the corporate value: honest  responsibility – we speak the truth and  accept accountability for our actions. In  line with this, compliance with our code of  ethics is monitored by an executive  general manager, group risk manager,  company secretary and audit committee.  Ethical  behavior  is  encouraged  throughout the group by communicating  regularly with employees, using a number  of different communication channels.    In addition to other compliance and  enforcement activities, formal disciplinary  measures are in place to deal with any  identified incidents of corruption and  fraud.  In 2010, the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee in  consultation with the chief audit executive adopted a  holistic approach to managing uncertainty, representing  both risk and opportunity. The top business risks,  appropriately categorised and based on impact and  likelihood of occurrence, together with mitigating control  measures were disclosed, with risk of fraud ranked at  number 14. The group has sound and entrenched  internal controls, which include, disciplinary codes of  practice, strong and experienced forensic investigation  capability and continuous internal audit of controls and  assurance of effective functioning.    A reporting hotline (whistle-blowing) is in place through  which all stakeholders can report suspected corruption  or fraud, conflicts of interest, contraventions of group  values or other reportable irregularities, with guaranteed  anonymity.
