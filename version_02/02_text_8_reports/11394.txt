Initially, in 1992, DPL Plantations (Pvt) Ltd.,  took up the management of the plantation company and, in  December 1995, acquired a controlling interest in it. This Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dipped Products  PLC (DPL), the Group and its other subsidiaries being among  the leading manufacturers of hand protection wear worldwide.  Kelani Valley Plantations comprises 27 estates, approximately  13,000 hectares in total, with almost equal extents of tea and  rubber. The plantations are located in Nuwara Eliya, Dickoya  and Yatiyantota-Bulathkohupitya, thus spanning three distinct  agro-climatic regions. The tea plantations of Nuwara Eliya are located at elevations  of 1,500 to 1,900 metres above sea level and the product is  renowned for delicacy of flavour and quality. The plantations of  Dickoya are slightly lower in elevation and the products cater to  those seeking thick and coloury liquors. The tea properties of the  Yatiyantota-Bulathkohupitiya belt, at much lower and warmer  elevations, produce a low-grown type of tea much sought after  for their strong and heavy bodied liquors. The differentiated  plantation locations enable the Company to offer a wide product  spectrum, each carrying individual features of attractiveness.  All 13 of the Companys black tea factories have received the  internationally recognised, HACCP (Sri Lanka), ISO 22000:2005  (Switzerland) accreditations. In 2008, the Company obtained  the GLOBAL G.A.P. (New Zealand) accreditation for all 19 of its  tea estates, a voluntary conformance, certifying the Companys  commitment to Good Agricultural Practices which minimise  detrimental impacts on the environment, whilst signifying  a responsible approach to worker safety and health and the  preservation of the bio-diversity within the plantations. The rubber plantations are also confined to the Yatiyantota- Bulathkohupitiya region and the manufacturing facilities produce  several varieties of Crepe Rubber, as well as Centrifuged Latex  at its plant in Kiriporuwa Estate. Sole Crepe from Dewalakande,  Panawatte and Kiriporuwa Estates are internationally  synonymous with supreme quality. The product range and  the process flexibility enable the Company to adjust product  mix to meet changing market demands. All of the Companys  rubber plantations have been certified by the Forest Stewardship  Council International (FSCI), as being environmentally and  socially sensitive entities. whilst this accreditation has also been  extended to the dry rubber and latex from the Dewalakande  and Panawatte factories. With the consolidation of the management of its core products,  KVPL has diversified its product portfolio and business activity.  In 2003, the Oliphant Estate Black Tea Factory in Nuwara Eliya  was converted to the production of Green Tea, which has since  become a preferred brand with both local and international  buyers. In 2007, a new facility was set up at Nuwara Eliya Estate  to manufacture Instant Tea. In response to the increased demand  for Green Tea, the Glassaugh Black Tea Factory in Nanu Oya was  also equipped to manufacture the product. In 2003, as a preliminary to its business diversification policy,  KVPL formed a strategic alliance with Mabroc Teas (Pvt) Ltd.,  a leading Sri Lankan tea marketing company engaged in the  export of bulk and branded tea to nearly 50 countries. In 2006,  in association with Mabroc, KVPL became a signatory to the UN  Global Compact, a member of the UNGC Charter and has since  used this platform to launch a range of unique tea products.  These include Single Origin Tea from selected tea gardens and  positioned as, The Ethical Tea Brand of the World. In the year  under review, KVPL secured total control of Mabroc in order to  pursue direct marketing initiatives more aggressively. In 2003, in association with ECO Power (Pvt) Ltd., a dedicated  hydro power development company, KVPL established  Kalupahana Power Company (Pvt) Ltd., initially setting up a  01 MW mini-hydro power plant linked to the national grid at  Kalupahana Estate. Where feasible, estate mini - hydros have  been rehabilitated and, or, upgraded producing cleaner energy  at lower cost. Our policy of plantation community development is a key  component of our management strategy and has been further  reinforced by an unique, multi-dimensional initiative branded  as A Home for Every Plantation worker, launched in 2006.  Designed to uplift the quality of life of our people in all aspects,  it has been featured as a benchmark in the booklet, Globally  Positioning Sri Lankas Best, released by the Global Compact   Sri Lanka Network, at the UNGC International Network  Conference in Mexico in 2007. The Companys continuous search for excellence is reflected  in its operational practices, its many internationally recognised  accreditations and the voluntary subscription to non-regulatory  concepts of ethical business management. In furtherance of  this policy, the Company has also engaged with several other  organisations in environment and bio-diversity protection  initiatives within its plantation boundaries. Its present position  in the industry is a testimony to the commitment and the spirit  of innovation demonstrated by its 14,000 employees, led by a  closely knit management team.

Directorate Mr. B.P.W. Jayasekera resigned from his position as Director  on 16th December 2010. I take this opportunity to thank  him for his valuable contribution during his tenure on  the Board. Mr. S.T. Gunatilleke, who hitherto served as an  Alternate Director, was appointed to the Board with effect  from 15th January 2011. Performance International tea markets that gathered momentum  in the last quarter of 2009 continued to remain strong  into 2010 with prices being sustained due to a global  shortfall of around 70 m kg at the beginning of the year.  Notwithstanding an increase in production during the  year, primarily in the low-grown sector, prices continued  to be firm apart from intermittent seasonal fluctuations.   Sri Lankan production of 329 m kg during the period under  review exceeded the previous best crop of 318 m kg in 2008,  with the Low-grown sector accounting for approximately  60% of the national output and the balance being made  up by High-growns and Mediums.  In sharp contrast to the low-grown and medium sectors  which demonstrated significant production increases against  previous years, the high-grown sector whilst improving on  the 2009 performance failed to exceed notable outputs of the  past. With the bulk of the Companys output centred in the  high-grown sector, both price and production improvements  were insufficient to adequately cushion the increase in  input costs. The 2010 national high-grown sale average  increased over the recession hit 2009 to Rs. 337/- per kg.   The low-grown average which suffered less in 2009, increased  moderately to Rs. 393/- per kg.  The Colombo Auction Average of Rs. 370/- per kg for the  year under review represents a marginal gain of 2.82% over  2009. Total national revenue generated from tea exports  touched USD 1.5 Billion mark for the first time, with increased  production compensating for the very moderate price  increases.  In the year under review, the Companys tea production  exceeded the 2009 output by 23%.  Rubber production declined in the face of unprecedented  adverse weather conditions in major producing countries in  South-East Asia. Consequently, rubber prices commencing  at around USD 3 per kg in January continued to improve  through the period under review to close above USD 5 per  kg by year end.  In Sri Lanka, Latex Crepe and RSS No. 1 moved from Rs. 321/-  per kg and Rs. 339/- per kg in January, to an all time high  of Rs. 569/- per kg and Rs. 511/- per kg respectively by  December 2010. However, the extreme weather conditions  experienced during the year prevented producers from  taking full advantage of an upbeat market.  Kelani Valley Green Tea adversely affected by very poor  demand in 2009 benefited from a resurgent tea market  in 2010 and recorded a profit of Rs. 3.2 m. The overall  improvement in black tea prices during the year and  the prudent management of the Companys up-country  manufacturing flexibility assisted in the recovery from   the previous years slump. On the other hand, the  irregular demand for high quality green tea from Sri Lanka  inhibited our ability to exploit the full potential of the  production capacity.  The Nuwara-Eliya Instant Tea plant initially started more as  a research and development project, recorded a profit of   Rs. 4.8 m. Whilst this result augurs well for its future potential,  our marketing initiatives continue to be hampered by the  limited demand for a high quality product in what is normally  perceived as a beverage of convenience.  We have seen the emergence of state initiatives in the formulation of a national  policy for this vitally important sector. However, it is imperative that strategies  are clearly articulated and implemented early, to ensure the sustainability of the  growth potential of this industry. It is equally important that state-driven plantation  policy initiatives address the multi-faceted challenges faced by this sector in their  totality, rather than searching for piecemeal solutions.  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 7 Chairmans Review  | Kalupahana Power Company recorded a post-tax profit of  Rs. 9 m, having benefited singularly from the extreme wet  weather conditions which otherwise impacted adversely on  the Companys core crops.  The Group ended the year with a profit of Rs. 356 m,   with substantial portion of this performance arising from  the rubber sector. With only moderate improvements in tea  prices, this highly labour and material intensive operation  continued to be hampered by cost escalations in all inputs.  Capital Expenditure The major proportion of capital expenditure was allocated to   re-planting of core crops, in pursuance of the Companys  policy of continued renewal of its crop asset base. At the  same time, investments were made to improve the water  supply and road networks along with replacement of  machinery and vehicles.  Dividend Your Directors having considered the Companys  performance in the year under review, propose a first and  final dividend of Rs. 4/- per share.  Environment, Infrastructure and Community  The Companys environmental initiatives continued to move  forward. Waste management and control, ensuring the purity  of water sources, conservation of the natural vegetation and  cleanliness of human habitats within plantations were areas  of main focus during the year.  Access roads within plantations too received priority attention,  improving the travel and supply logistics of plantation residents.  Re-roofing and electrification of worker housing further  upgraded the living conditions of our people.  Vocational  training was facilitated through sewing classes for young  adults, in addition to English language and computer classes. New Directions With the Hayleys acquisition of a controlling interest in  Talawakelle Tea Estates PLC (TTEL), the Group confirmed its  commitment to a sustained interest and involvement in the  plantation sector. In furtherance of this policy, KVPL acquired  the balance 60% of its former associate, Mabroc Teas (Pvt)  Ltd., during the year under review adding a fully-controlled  tea marketing arm to its portfolio.  Prospects  The market prognosis, particularly for rubber, is encouraging  and the outlook for 2011 would seem positive. The  rubber market has been pushed to its present levels by  production shortfalls in major producer countries and  an increased demand driven largely by the automobile  industry particularly in India and China. This is a rare and  unprecedented convergence of unlikely circumstances and  any expectation of this position being sustained at these  levels, for any length of time would be unduly optimistic.  Historically with time, all commodity markets adjust to  supply, demand and pricing dynamics. In this context, it is  important to consider the likely impact of the impending  worker wage increase on future production expenses, whilst  the recently imposed enhancement in the energy tariff adds  a further burden to an industry already weighed down by  rising input costs. The combined impact of these factors is  likely to erode to a large extent the benefits that may be  derived from improved commodity prices.  In my previous review I expressed the optimistic sentiment  that the successful conclusion of ethnic conflict would  enable the state to focus time, attention and resources on  the development of its major engines of economic growth.  The plantation industry clearly would be an obvious area to  address and already we have seen the emergence of state  initiatives in the formulation of a national policy for this vitally  important sector. However, it is imperative that strategies  are clearly articulated and implemented early to ensure the  sustainable growth of this industry. It is equally important  that state-driven plantation policy initiatives address the  multi-faceted challenges faced by this sector in their totality,  rather than searching for piecemeal solutions.  I thank employees at all levels for their contribution during the  year. I am grateful to our buyers for their valued patronage,  our brokers for their unstinted support, our suppliers for their  services and my colleagues on the Board for their able guidance. A M Pandithage Chairman 9th February, 2011  The robust rubber performance has been a key ingredient in the Companys  resurgence.

Our commitment to excellence  commences with the selective harvesting of the raw material.  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 16 Management Discussion & Analysis COMPANY PERFORMANCE The Company recorded a post-tax profit of Rs. 339.6 m, as  against the 45.2 m loss reported in 2009. The turnover of Rs.  3,810.6 m reflects an improvement of 35% over last year.  A resurgent rubber market, driven by production shortfalls  resulting from adverse weather conditions in major producing  countries and further enhanced by increased demand from  the rapidly expanding motor vehicle industries of India and  China in particular, contributed significantly to the 2010  result. However, erratic weather patterns which disrupted  regular harvesting programmes impacted negatively on  crop outputs, preventing producers from deriving maximum  benefit from a robust market.  The Kalupahana Power Company, assisted by regular and  heavy rainfall which permitted the more or less uninterrupted  generation of power through the year, recorded a post-tax  profit of Rs. 9 m as compared to Rs. 3.8 m the previous year.  Kelani Valley Green Tea (Pvt) Ltd., ended the year with a  post-tax profit of Rs 2.03 m, as against Rs. 0.77 m in 2009.  The price revival in this segment was slow as, under adverse  market conditions, niche products do not demonstrate the  same resilience as mainstream consumer preferences. The  higher quality grades showed satisfactory gains whilst, at  the lower end, prices were stagnant due to the availability  of similar varieties at lower prices from other origins. In  2011, the fortunes of Sri Lankan Green Tea will be largely  determined by the import volumes of cheaper varieties  from other countries for blending operations in Sri Lanka.  The national production increase of 42% against 2009, is a  reflection of the renewed interest in green tea, on the heels  of the improvement in black tea prices.  Acquisitions In a move reinforcing the Companys commitment to broad  basing its tea operations, KVPL purchased the balance 60%  share of its former associate, Mabroc Teas (Pvt) Ltd., at a cost  of Rs. 212 m. The sole control of a marketing platform will  enable Kelani Valley to aggressively pursue the advantageous  positioning of its niche products whilst, also, opening the  door for a more synergetic product marketing thrust in  association with the sister plantation company, Talawakelle  Tea Estates PLC. Rubber With 70% of world production being consumed by the  motor vehicle industry, rubber suffered acutely from the  2009 recession. Major growers responded with planned  suppression of production and withheld inputs whilst leading  international speculators depleted stockpiles to minimise stock  holding losses. These factors, combined with adverse weather  conditions in major growing countries which resulted in lower  harvests in 2010, supported by an unexpected resurgence in  the motor industries in India and China in particular, created a  supply-demand disparity of significance. The market reacted  with a price escalation commencing at around USD 3 per  kg in January and closing at around USD 5 per kg at major  trading centres, in December 2010.  In Sri Lanka, Latex Crepe-IX and RSS No. 1, commencing at  Rs. 323/- per kg and Rs. 339/- per kg respectively, in January,  closed the year at Rs. 569/- and Rs. 511/- per kg respectively,  in December, representing price improvements of 76% and  50%. Whilst yet unconfirmed reports indicate a slight increase  in national output in 2010, as against 2009, it could be largely  attributable to minor land holders who, collectively, represent  the major proportion of growers, recommencing intensified  harvesting in order to capitalise on the market recovery.  Local consumption of national rubber output reached 70%  in 2010, the highest on record.  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 17 The International Rubber Study Group (IRSG) forecasts an overall  8% growth in the tyre industry in 2011, as against a decline  of similar proportions seen in late 2009. This consumption  increase, combined with a likely escalation of oil prices currently  at USD 91 per barrel, is expected to maintain rubber market  buoyancy into 2011. However, invariably, manufacturers  respond to surging raw material costs with moderating counter  strategies of their own whilst natural market dynamics also  exert countervailing pressures in adjustment. In this context,  moving forward, it would be prudent to anticipate a market  stabilisation at more realistic levels.  Tea The 70 m kg shortfall in world tea production in 2009 assisted  in a market recovery and, consequently, trading was more  positive in all major auction centres in 2010. Sri Lankan  production reached 329 m kg for the year, which is an all time  high whilst the export revenue of USD 1.5 b is also the highest  on record. The Companys tea production, approximately  75% represented by its high grown segment, increased by  23% to 6.74 kg whilst the national high grown production  moved up by 7.02%.  The national NSA increased by a marginal 2.82% over 2009  whilst the low grown average, the least affected by global  recession, moved up by a minimal 1.35%. Notwithstanding  a 5.67% increase in high-grown averages in 2009, the   Nuwara Eliya speciality varieties declined owing to limited  demand. Overall, despite production improvements, the  average price increases were insufficient to significantly  offset escalating input costs. Moving into 2011, anticipated  increases in internal consumption by major producers such  as India and China and more aggressive purchasing by the  Middle Eastern and the ex-Soviet blocs, are expected to  sustain prices at attractive levels. However, expectations  of additional gains from market improvements into 2011  must, necessarily, be viewed against the inevitable input  cost escalation arising from the impending worker wage  increase and other impacts, such as the enhanced energy  tariffs already in place.  Capital Investment The Company invested Rs. 146 m in replanting 198 ha of  rubber and in the maintenance of immature areas, whilst  Rs. 65 m was allocated to tea replanting and immature  area management. Combined with the expenditure on the  rehabilitation of access roads within plantations, purchase  of new equipment for factory and office, the replacement of  obsolete vehicles and improvements to estate water supply  and other community infrastructure, the total incurred for  the year was Rs. 292 m.  Rs. 55 m was received as grants from  various donor agencies including the state.  Management Discussion & Analysis  |  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 18 Certifications The Company maintained its product and process purity  and hygiene standards already in place, by carrying out  surveillance audits in all processing centres, whilst the HACCP,  ISO 22000:2005 and GLOBALG.A.P. accreditations of its black  tea processing facilities were also revalidated.  Preliminary work for compliance with Rain Forest Alliance  certification, which commenced in 2009 has been completed  during the year, along with the relevant training of responsible  plantation personnel. The accreditation process is expected to  be finalised during the current year. This certification, which  encompasses sustainable agricultural standards covering  environmental conservation and community management  dimensions, will help to consolidate the Companys already  established ethical positioning. It is also a prized producer  conformance, soon to be mandated by the giant Unilever, as a  primary requirement in their product purchase portfolio, whilst  other major tea buyers have also declared their intentions  of following suit.  The Panawatte and Dewalakande factories have received the  Forest Stewardship Council chain of custody certification for the  Sole Crepe and Latex Crepe manufactured at these factories.  All these quality, product and process certifications will add  value to the Companys major product lines, particularly  within markets and amongst consumers, with declared  preferences for goods manufactured in accordance with  ethical and hygiene parameters.  Energy Management Consequent to the installation of firewood boilers at seven of  its major tea factories and the conversion of most of its liquid  fuel driers to firewood, the Company has reduced its liquid  fuel consumption in 2010 by approximately 656,000 ltrs.  These measures have reduced the expenditure in this area  by Rs. 12 m in the year under review.  The electrical installations in black tea factories have been  upgraded to meet the latest industry standards, improving  both safety and functional efficiency. Energy audits have  been undertaken in all 13 black tea factories in collaboration  with the SWITCH ASIA programme sponsored by the Ceylon  Chamber of Commerce.  A new standby generator was installed at the Ederapola tea  factory with the existing generator being reinstalled at the  Edinburgh factory, improving the energy supply situation in  both manufacturing units.  The Companys drive for maximising internal potential for  cleaner and cheaper energy continued to move forward.  All other statutory certifications have been obtained for the  commencement of two mini hydro plants at We Oya and  Edinburgh respectively, with a combined capacity of 1.4  Mw, whilst final approval from the Central Environmental  Authority is awaited. The output will be fed directly to the  national grid.  Environment With several new initiatives, the Company reaffirmed its  commitment to environmental protection, earlier signified by  its embracing of the CEO Water Mandate and other relevant  recognised concepts of conservation. 8 ha of marginal tea  on Annfield Estate has been planted with fuel and timber  species, whilst the compliance activities of the Rain Forest  Alliance certification, such as the provision for the segregated  collection and disposal of waste on all tea estates, contributed  significantly to improvements in internal environmental  management. All rubber washing bays in the tea cum rubber  estates were equipped with soakage pits to ensure the  filtration of harmful sediment from water, before reaching  natural waterways.  Corporate Social Responsibility The Companys signature CSR initiative, the A Home for Every  Worker programme, which addresses living environment,  health and nutrition, community capacity building and youth  empowerment for the resident population, continued its  progress during the year. Comprehensive details are presented  in the Sustainability Report. |  Management Discussion & Analysis  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 19 A welcome return to normal crop volumes in Tea and better  commodity prices helped Kelani Valley Plantations PLC to  post a healthy profit and improve turnover growth during  the year 2010. The buoyancy of the rubber market and stable prices for tea  enabled the Company to consolidate its turnaround from  a loss making 2009. This section provides an overview of its  financial performance for the year under review. Group Turnover The Group recorded a consolidated turnover of Rs. 3,880 m   for the year under review, an increase of 36% over the  previous year. The increment was reflected mainly in rubber prices, which  contributed an increase of 72% in turnover compared to the  previous year despite a reduced rubber crop, due to highly  erratic weather patterns during the year. The turnover from  tea increased by 23%, on account of increased crop.    The Tea and Rubber sectors contributed Rs. 2,496 m and  1,345 m respectively, to the turnover accounting for 64%  and 35% of the total group turnover. Financial Review Gross Profit The Group reported a gross profit of Rs. 568 m for the year,  an increase of 321% from the previous year, mainly due to  better performance in rubber prices and tea crop.    Segmental Gross Profit  Segmental gross profits significantly increased in both Tea  and Rubber during the year. Contribution from Tea was   Rs. 96 m and Rubber was Rs. 445 m, whilst the Hydro Power  sector performed extremely well during the year with a  contribution of Rs. 29 m.  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 20 Interest on term loans and overdrafts decreased by 40% to   Rs. 44 m from Rs. 73 m previously and finance income also  declined by almost 50% to Rs. 24 m from Rs. 47 m in 2009,  mainly due to a reduction in interest rates on deposits, as well  as a depletion of savings which were used for the purchase  of Mabroc Teas (Pvt) Ltd. Interest Paid to Government on Finance Lease Interest paid to Government on finance lease has increased  217% to Rs. 67 m compared to Rs. 21 m previously, as a result  of the governments decision not to extend the agreement to  freeze lease rentals beyond June 2008. Whilst this decision was  made in 2010, arrears were charged with retrospective effect.   The Groups average cost of funds decreased from 12.97% to  10.52% during the year due to the reduction of interest rates.  The Company was able to redeem loans with high interest  rates and negotiated with the banks to reduce the interest  rates on outstanding loans during the year under review.  Share of Associates Results KVPL acquired the balance 60% shares of its Associate Mabroc  Teas (Pvt) Ltd. in December, 2010. Thus the latter becomes a  fully-owned subsidiary of the Company. Mabroc Teas (Pvt) Ltd. impacted on the Groups bottom  line with a loss of Rs. 28 m during the year under review, as  compared to a Rs. 0.5 m loss in the previous year. The loss is  mainly due to a provision of Rs. 83 m made during the year  for bad debts. Mabroc is yet recovering from the recessionary  impact on the tea export market. Taxation  The Groups total tax charge for the year was Rs. 30 m, an  increment of 131% compared to the previous year due to the  better performance of the Company. Tax exempt companies  of the Group, and information on the tax holidays enjoyed  by these companies, are stated on page 75. Net Profit before Tax The Group recorded a net Profit before tax of Rs. 356 m.   The reasons for the high performance have been elaborated  in the Chairmans Review section of this Report.    Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and  Amortisation (EBITDA) The Groups earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and  amortisation increased by 265%, from Rs. 162 m to Rs. 592 m,   in the year under review. This resulted in an improvement  in the operational cash flow position of the Group which is  reflected in the cash flow statement.   Net Finance Cost Net finance cost reflects the interest cost on borrowings and  the interest income from short-term deposits and related  party loans. Net finance cost decreased by 21% to Rs. 20 m,  as compared to Rs. 26 m in the previous year.    |  Financial Review  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 21 Dividends A dividend of Rs. 4/- per share corresponding to 24% of the  retained profit of the Company is proposed as against the  previous years Rs. 1/- per share.

The long-term borrowings  declined by Rs. 159 m whilst short-term borrowings increased  by Rs. 295 m as a result of the borrowings of the newly- acquired subsidiary, Mabroc Teas (Pvt) Ltd. Financial Review  |   The Group has both local and foreign currency borrowings  and the gearing level has remained constant at 35%.   Return on Capital Employed & Return on Equity Due to higher overall profit and reduction in long-term  borrowings, the return on capital employed and return on  equity increased to 16% and 24% respectively, in the year  under review. Both stood at 1% in 2009.     Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 22 Cash Flow Due to improved profitability cash generated from  operating activities increased by Rs. 151 m to Rs. 530 m from   Rs. 379 m in the previous year.

Capital Expenditure by Segment Capital expenditure on Tea decreased to Rs. 110 m from  Rs. 158 m in 2009. However, capital expenditure on rubber  increased to Rs. 161 m as compared to Rs. 116 m in 2009.    The above capital expenditure includes Rs. 65 m and  Rs. 146 m on replanting of tea and rubber respectively, in  the year 2010. 30 hectares of tea and 198 hectares of rubber  were replanted during the year under review.

Current Ratio The ratio between current assets and current liabilities  decreased as at end 2010 compared to 2009 as a result of  the increase in short-term interest bearing borrowings of  Mabroc Teas (Pvt) Ltd.  |  Financial Review  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 23 Performance Measurement Net Assets per Share Net assets per share grew to Rs. 54.57 from Rs. 46.44   previous year.    Performance of the share The Companys share price closed at Rs. 159.90 compared  to Rs. 53.00 at end 2009. Overall market performance in the  year under review was highly encouraging.   During the year, the share price reached an all time high  price of Rs. 210 /- and the lowest reported was Rs. 40/- .  The total number of shares traded during the year was 4.2 m.  Market capitalisation The total market capitalisation of the Company was   Rs. 5,437 m at the end of the financial year.

Sustainability Report  |   Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 28 Economic Performance KVPL Group turnover grew 36% compared to 2009 whilst   net profit was Rs. 326 m after providing for tax of Rs. 30 m.   Tight control of working capital, closer management of  operational functions and control of costs contributed to  the turnaround. These strategies were catalysed by better  market conditions for rubber and tea.  In the year under review, the share price moved from Rs. 53.00 to   Rs. 159.90 as at 31st December 2010, a 201% increase  reflecting investor confidence brought about by improved  performance.  More details of the economic performance are reported in  the section Financial Review- 2010. Impact of Climate Change Since it is an agriculture-based industry, weather and climate  play a decisive role in the Groups performance. The variations  in atmospheric temperatures, concomitant changes likely  to occur in precipitation patterns and the physiological  response of crops to the disparity of carbon dioxide levels in  the atmosphere, along with other relevant factors contribute  to the determination of Group crop outputs. Despite the  relative unpredictability of these variables, the management  has been able to devise strategies to sustain business viability.  Risks and Opportunities due to Climate Change Risks   z Changes in rainfall pattern will determine both the water  supply to and evaporative demand on crops, which finally  impact on yields.    z Disruption of normal weather patterns interrupt  cultivation programmes.    z Timing and frequency of rainfall impacts on crop  collection, particularly in rubber and often leads to wash  out of raw latex.    z Adverse weather factors, whether wet or dry, create  conditions favourable to the emergence of pests and  diseases, harmful to crop and quality of product.  Opportunities    z Increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide level may improve  the yield in some clones.   z Reduction of fossil fuel usage and the promotion of  alternative energy sources such as hydro power.   z Providing opportunities to trade in Carbon Credits.  Indirect Economic Impact Society KVPL has invested considerable resources in its social  responsibility initiative, A HOME FOR EVERY PLANTATION  WORKER PROGRAMME. Its a broad concept with wide ranging life-style benefits  for the plantation community and extending far beyond  the simple provision of shelter. This initiative, encompassing  four broad areas - Living Environment, Health & Nutrition,  Community Capacity Building and Youth Empowerment -  was launched in 2006 and its impact has extended outside  the organisation as well.

All Company plantations practice agricultural operations in  an environmentally responsible manner, consistent with the  Companys environment policy. Materials KVPL consumes a wide range of material in its daily  operations. Tracking material consumption facilitates the  efficiency improvement of material usage and reduces the  cost of material flow. For 2010, KVPL material consumption  was as follows:  Fertiliser - 4,529.18 MT Dolomite - 1,609.80 MT Agrochemicals - 27,659.50 litres and - 152, 431.60 kg Packing materials  - 172,085 (Nos.)

The total indirect energy used in terms  of intermediate energy was 29,051 GJ. Estimated total energy  savings obtained for 2010 from fuel switching and efficiency  improvements was 19,853 GJ. KVPL Group has obtained statutory approvals for two mini-  hydro power plants at We Oya and Edinburgh, with a total  capacity of 1.4 MW. Expected annual energy generation is  18,216 GJ. Approval of the Central Environment Authority  is awaited. (All the calculations/conversions have been prepared  according to the GRI indicator 2.4 of EN3). In order to assess the energy saving potential in the direct  and intermediate energy sources, we have undertaken  energy studies in all our 13 black tea factories in collaboration  with the SWITCH Asia programme of the Ceylon Chamber of  Commerce. The outcome of the study will be implemented  during the year 2011.   Water With most of our plantations being located within catchment  areas, KVPL is very sensitive to water usage. Both extraction  and discharge of water necessarily have an impact on  watersheds, mainly due to the contamination and lowering  of the water table. Our Group manages over 13,500 hectares  of land consisting of Tea, Rubber and forest which, whilst  acting as a carbon sink, also prevents the erosion of top  soil and conserves ground water by minimising run off. Our  Rubber plantations are certified as well-managed forests by  the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) of the UK. All of our tea  plantations have obtained Global GAP certification whilst  both tea and rubber plantations meet local environmental  standards in the use and discharge of water. The plantations  also grow fuelwood in a sustainable manner, which is of  direct benefit to the micro-environment.  |  Sustainability Report  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 31 In addition, KVPL is a signatory to the United Nations Global  Compact (UNGC), the CEO Water Mandate and the Caring  for Climate initiatives. Our commitment to the CEO Water  Mandate derives its impetus from our core values and the  Senior Management has endorsed and are fully committed to  the objectives and principles of the Mandate, thus reflecting  KVPLs dedication to the prudent and sustainable use of water  in its daily operations. The total water consumption by KVPL  for direct operations is approximately 1,000 m 3 per day.  During the year under review, the following steps have  been taken to minimise impact on the environment from  agricultural operations:   z Preparation of a water map identifying all water sources  in the estates and the repair of water distribution systems  to avoid waste due to leaks or spillage.    z Adopting bush-to-bush fertilisation and strict manual  weeding in the periphery of streams and waterways, to  prevent contamination of flowing water.    z Planting approximately 10,000 bamboo trees along the  banks of streams to prevent soil erosion. Bio-diversity  Bio-diversity plays an important role in the day-to-day life  of a plantation. Many of our estates are located and operate  within areas of high bio-diversity. Over 1,000 ha of forest reservations are located within the  Companys plantation boundaries, distributed across three  agro-climatic regions, namely, Nuwara Eliya, Hatton-Dickoya  and Yatiyantota-Bulathkohupitiya. These forest reserves have  progressively developed into unique bio-diversity enclaves due  to fauna and flora mutations driven by geographic isolation.    Initially, the Company undertook a comprehensive Bio-diversity  Assessment to inventories flora and fauna within its plantation  boundaries. The newly-identified local nature reserve at Halgolle  Estate was the major outcome of this study. During the year  under review, the Company finalised management plans for  future conservation in collaboration with the International Union  for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The tree planting programme,  commenced on Halgolla in collaboration with the Deutsche  Bank, was continued during the year under review.  Eco System and Bio-diversity The Vision To create the best privately owned Local Nature Reserve  within the estate sector in Sri Lanka: a place where people  and bio-diversity co-exist to each others mutual benefit. The Mission Natural and Semi Natural ecosystems and their   bio diversity in Halgolle Estate managed in a sustainable  manner whilst promoting research, education and  responsible visitor services. Local Nature Reserve – Halgolle The identification of a distinct extent on Halgolle Estate,  as a research-cum-conservation area and a nature reserve  demonstrates the Companys commitment to protecting  and nurturing bio-diversity within its boundaries.  The reserve demonstrates a unique topography and a  collection of several ecosystems and habitats in a single  location. The estate, starting from 300 ft. amsl climbs  steadily up to 4,000 ft. amsl, the land encompassing lush  tea plantations, unusual rock formations, streams, patna and  grass land and capped at the very top with a panoramic  3600 view.  The Halgolle reserve is very rich in bird life, including 16  endemic species, 3 proposed endemic species and 10  nationally threatened species. Among the endemics, the   Sri Lanka Whistling Thrush (Myophonus blighi), Sri Lanka  Scaly Thrush (Zoothera imbricata), and the Sri Lanka White- faced Starling (Sturnus albofrontatus) are identified as  Nationally Endangered bird species. This is also the first  time the Sri Lanka Whistling Thrush has been recorded  from such a low elevation and outside its known range.  Further, three of the reptile species recorded, Rhino-horn  lizard (Ceratophora stoddartii), Peak-wilderness day gecko  (Cnemaspis samanalensis) and Templetons kukri snake  (Oligodon calamarius) are listed as Nationally Threatened. Emissions, Effluent and Waste None of our estates practice any kind of activity likely to  result in the depletion of the Ozone Layer and the emission  of greenhouse gases. All KVPL estates comply with the  stipulations of the respective Government bodies in regard  to the relevant protection standards.  Sustainability Report  | Water stream at We-oya Estate  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 32 Waste Water Discharge The manufacture of rubber consumes a large amount  of water and is associated with a high concentration of  chemicals. Therefore, stringent measures are in place in  all our rubber factories to ensure that we meet stipulated  control parameters whilst all rubber factories are equipped  with scientifically-designed waste water treatment plants.  KVPL discharges approximately 950 m3 day of treated waste  water from its rubber factories. In tea, water is used in manufacturing facilities for the cleaning  of processing machinery and the floor in the rolling room.  All waste water is channelled through a simple waste water  treatment system consisting of sand filters and sedimentation  tanks. The waste water is tested against Biochemical Oxygen  Demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solids, pH, Grease, Oil and  fecal Coliforms at regular and planned intervals. Waste Disposal by Type, Weight and Method KVPL, directly and indirectly, generates a variety of waste  material. As a policy, the Company will not permit the release  of any organic or inorganic solid or other similar material into  natural water bodies, whilst the burning of waste products is  also prohibited. All waste materials are collected separately,  according to their nature such as bio-degradable glass, plastic  and hazardous waste and hospital waste.  2MT of empty chemical plastic cans were recycled, in  collaboration with Seer Plastic Industries, Kalutara.  During the period under review the Company built 101  permanent waste bins to segregate waste according to  classification, whilst Rs. 1.7 m was incurred for composting  bio-degradable waste. Further, with an investment of   Rs. 600,000/-, Invery stores was renovated to temporarily  accommodate empty chemical containers and other  redundant items.  During the year under review, there were no significant spills  recorded or fines and sanctions imposed on the Company for  non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations.  Products and Services KVPL is committed to the management and monitoring  of its products and services in order to ensure minimum  adverse impact on the environment. Every major agricultural  practice is implemented following an Environment Impact  Assessment (EIA). Refuse Tea, which is an end-product of  the tea manufacturing process, is introduced to tea fields  after denaturing and composting. As a Company policy,  the soil fertility of every field is assessed prior to fertiliser  application, the latter being based on the actual replacement  requirement. This ensures the minimum necessary use of  inorganic fertiliser. The black tea drying machines in all our  major tea factories were converted to hot water generator  systems in 2007, resulting in a significant reduction in fossil  fuel usage and the cost of manufacture.  Social Performance The plantation industry is both complex and unique in that  it employs a large community of people resident on the  plantation. KVPL provides residence facilities to approximately  54,000 persons constituting more than 10,000 family units.  The impact of our business operation on the internal social  system is a prime concern and, in this context, the Company  has adopted several strategies and mechanisms to meet the  social, health and welfare requirements of all its stakeholders. Labour Practices and Decent Work The Company formally pledged its support to the UNGC  10 principles in 2006 and this concept is now a major  component of its drive for business sustainability. KVPL is an equal opportunity employer, respecting the  individual and his/her rights to free and fair employment,  providing both the opportunity and climate for rewarding  and long-lasting careers. Our remuneration and benefits  are fair and competitive whilst wages are above stipulated  minimum levels. The Company provides the employees the right to freedom  of association within the framework of National Labour  Legislation.  Human Resource Our Human Resource configuration reflects an equable  balance of maturity, experience and youth. The retention  and the satisfaction of employees are major focal points of  the Companys Human Resource Policies and the Corporate  Social Responsibility initiatives.  Total work force by type of employment Type of Employment Number of  Employees Executives & above  84 Staff 719 Manual 13,413 Total 14,216 Rate of Employee Turnover In general, staff turnover in KVPL is around 7% and it  reflects overall employee satisfaction with the stability of  the Company and its desirability as an employer of choice.  |  Sustainability Report  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 33 Labour/Management Relations Of the total workforce in the Company, 99% are covered by  Collective Agreements. Periodically, the Company enters  into Collective Agreements with major unions, designed  to regulate wages and other important conditions of  worker employment, both of which are above the statutory  minimum standards. The collective bargaining process  covers the manual, clerical, technical, supervisory, medical,  maintenance and support staff of plantations.  Occupational Health and Safety The facilities that the Company has provided assure that  employee health and safety at the work place is a primary  concern. In addition, all employees are provided with health  and safety instructions, relevant equipment and training, first  aid instruction and medical facilities. Each estate is provided  with medical centres with the services of qualified medical  staff, whilst key estates have in-house hospitals and maternity  homes. Medical camps are conducted periodically for all  segments of workers. Ambulances are strategically located  within easy access of a cluster of estates. The Companys work  place health and safety, as well as product hygiene initiatives  are supported by ISO, HACCP, and Global G.A.P. accreditations,  whilst the Companys signature initiative, A Home for Every  Plantation Worker Programme, raises plantation community  life style improvement to a different level.  Training and Education The development of skills and capabilities in employees is a  fundamental item in the Company sustainability programme.  Most of the training programmes carried out during the  year focused mainly on issues of purity and food safety,  the operation of an ethical business and environment  management and social responsibility.  The following training programmes were carried out in 2010:   z Purity & Food Safety  Training on Good Manufacturing Practices, Hygiene Measures  and Health & Safety issues, was conducted by the Head  Office Sustainability Audit Team for the staff and operational  workers in all tea factories.

At present, nearly 55% of the total  employees are females. There is no discrimination in regard  to remuneration and other conditions, between male and  female employees. Human Rights The Company made its formal commitment to the United  Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Charter in 2006 and this  initiative has become a major driver of our sustainability thrust.  Its principles have been communicated to all employees to  ensure awareness and commitment across the Company.  KVPL, together with Mabroc Teas (Pvt) Ltd., was singularly  acknowledged at the Global Compact Headquarters in the  UN in March 2007, as the worlds first signatory companies  to advocate the Global Compact principles to consumers  through product packaging.  Investment and Procurement Practices KVPL Group is guided by international and local covenants  such as the UNGC and Sri Lankas legal and regulatory  systems, in regard to safeguarding human rights. We also  convey our commitment to the relevant principles across  all supply chains and business relationships.  Employee Training Hours on Human Rights Training programmes, on the awareness of the principles  of the Global Compact and their incorporation in company  strategy, were carried out by members of the Senior  Management of the Company for all Company Executives (84).  The Sustainability Team of the Head Office carried out three  full-day workshops on Ethical Business Management, with the  participation of 150 executives and other members of staff.  |  Sustainability Report  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 35 One senior estate manager participated in a five-day  workshop on Labour Standards, sponsored and moderated by  the International Labour Organisation (ILO), held in Turin, Italy.

Non-Discrimination There were no reported incidents regarding the violation of  the human rights of indigenous people. We do not recruit  or employ under-aged people and all our people-related  initiatives encourage the schooling of youngsters.  The Group firmly endorses and practices policies,  communicated internally to all concerned, proscribing  forced and compulsory labour. It also enables collective  bargaining and, where possible, the separation of working  hours between genders, in consideration of an equitable  balance between working hours and family life.  Community KVPL has invested both management time and effort in  community enrichment and enhancement of stakeholder  value. Details of related activities are elaborated elsewhere  in the Report.  Corruption KVPL has consistently pursued profit-generating strategies  within a strictly ethical operational framework and practices  an entrenched Code of Conduct in regard to anti-corruption.  There are no reports of violation of the Code.  Product responsibility All Company initiatives in the field of purity and food safety,  ethical business, environmental conservation and transparent  interactions with all concerned are, finally, aligned with the  handing over of a responsibly manufactured product to  the end-user. All Company tea plantations are certified for  GLOBAL G.A.P. whilst all its rubber plantations are certified  for Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), both affirming the  operation of the Companys business in an environmentally  friendly manner.  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC is a HACCP and ISO 22000:2005  certified company. Since 2007, we have maintained these  food safety management certificated for all our 13 black  tea factories. In the year under review, surveillance audits  have been carried out to ensure conformity with certification  standards and the certifications themselves, revalidated. The  Companys products are periodically tested by accredited  laboratories for minimum-permitted residual levels of agro- chemicals, heavy metals and microbiological content, to  ensure conformity with relevant International Standards.

corporate  governance framework enables Kelani Valley Plantations  PLC (KVPL) to achieve ethical and stewardship obligations  while supporting the creation of long-term sustainable  stakeholder value. The Company is a subsidiary of DPL Plantations (Pvt) Ltd., which  is a fully-owned subsidiary of Dipped Products PLC (DPL).  Hayleys PLC is the ultimate parent of Dipped Products PLC. Corporate Governance KVPL is mainly in the business of producing and processing  tea and rubber. KVPL Governance Guidelines provide Directors and  the management with a road map of their respective  responsibilities. These guidelines, which will be updated  periodically, detail those matters requiring Board and  Committee approval, advice or review. The KVPL Governance  Framework is depicted in the following diagram: We set out below the corporate governance practices  adopted and practiced by KVPL against the background of  the Code of Best Practice on Corporate Governance issued by  The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka and the  Rules set out in Section 7.10 of the Colombo Stock Exchanges  Listing Rules. Board of Directors The Board of Directors is responsible for setting up the  Governance Framework within the Company. Composition and Attendance at Meetings As at the end of the year under review, the Board consisted  of nine Directors - five Non-Executive Directors and four  Executive Directors including the Chairman. These Directors  are named below and their profiles given on pages 10 and  11 of this Report. Details of Directors shareholdings in KVPL  and the directorates they hold in other companies are given  on pages 12, 13 and 53 .  The Board meets quarterly. Ad hoc meetings are held as and  when required. During the year under review, the Board met  on four occasions. The attendance at these meetings was: Name of Director Executive/  Non-Executive/ Independent   Non-Executive Attendance A M Pandithage -      Chairman Executive 4/4 J A G Anandarajah Executive 4/4 G K Seneviratne Executive 4/4 B P W Jayasekera     (Resigned 16.12.2010) Independent      Non-Executive 2/4 R Seevaratnam Independent      Non-Executive 3/4 Faiz Mohideen Independent      Non-Executive 3/4 N Y Fernando Non-Executive 4/4 S Siriwardana Executive 4/4 S C Ganegoda S T Gunatilleke*      (Alternate Director) Non-Executive 4/4 3/3 L T Samarawickrama Independent      Non-Executive 4/4 * Appointed on 01.05.2010 as an alternate Director to Mr. S C Ganegoda and  subsequently appointed as Director on 15.01.2011.  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 42 Responsibilities of the Board The Board has engaged DPL Plantations (Pvt) Ltd. as Managing  Agent to manage the business and assets of the Company. The Board is responsible to: a. Enhance shareholder value. b. Ensure all stakeholder interests are considered in  corporate decisions. c. Formulate and communicate business policy and  strategy to ensure sustained growth, and monitor its  implementation. d. Approve any change in the Groups business portfolio  and sanction major investments and disinvestments in  accordance with parameters set. e. Ensure Executive Directors have the skills/knowledge to  implement strategy effectively, with proper succession  arrangements in place. f. Ensure effective remuneration, reward and recognition  policies are in place to ensure employee commitment  and motivation. g. Set and communicate values/standards, with adequate  attention being paid to accounting policies/practices. h. Ensure effective information, control, risk management  and audit systems are in place. i. Ensure compliance with laws. j. Ensure that ethical standards are in place. k. Approve annual budgets and monitor performance  against these. l. Adopt annual and interim results before these are  published. m. Consult and consider inputs from experts in relevant  areas. n. Approve key appointments within the Company and  ensure all senior management staff receives appropriate  training. Company Secretary The services and advice of the Company Secretary, are  available to Directors, as necessary. The Company Secretary  keeps the Board informed of new laws, regulations and  requirements coming into effect which are relevant to them  as individual Directors and collectively to the Board. Chairmans Role The Chairman is responsible for the efficient conduct of Board  meetings and ensures, inter alia, that: a. The effective participation of both Executive and Non- Executive Directors is secured; b. All Directors are encouraged to make an effective  contribution for the benefit of the Company; c. A balance of power between Executive and Non-Executive  Directors is maintained d. The views of Directors on issues under consideration are  ascertained; and e. The Board is in complete control of the Companys affairs  and alert to its obligations to all shareholders and other  stakeholders. The Chairman maintains close contact with all Directors  and, where necessary, holds meetings with Non-Executive  Directors without Executive Directors being present. Board Balance The composition of the Executive and Non-Executive  Directors (the latter are over one-third of the total number  of Directors) satisfies the requirements laid down in the  Listing Rules of the Colombo Stock Exchange. The Board  has determined that three Non-Executive Directors satisfy  the criteria for independence set out in the Listing Rules. Non-Executive Directors profiles reflect their calibre and  the weight their views carry in Board deliberations. Each is  independent of management and free from any relationship  that can interfere with independent judgment. The balance  of Executive, Non-Executive and Independent Non-Executive  Directors on the Board ensures that no individual Director  or small group of Directors dominates Board discussion and  decision making. The Chairman of the Company is also the Chairman of DPL  Plantations, DPL and Hayleys. Chief Executive Authority is  vested in the Managing Director of DPL but is substantially  delegated to the Managing Director of the Company. The  separation between the position of the Chairman and officers  with executive powers in the Company ensures a balance  of power and authority. Mr. B P W Jayasekera served as the Executive Chairman of  Mabroc Teas (Pvt) Ltd., which, till December 2010, when KVPL  purchased its balance 60% shareholding, was an associate  company of KVPL. The Board believes that his association  with Mabroc Teas did not affect his objectivity in the role he  played on the Board of KVPL and, therefore, his independence  was not compromised. |  Corporate Governance  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 43 Financial Acumen The Board includes three senior Chartered Accountants, who  possess the necessary knowledge and competence to offer  the Board guidance on matters of finance. Two of them serve  as Finance Directors of Hayleys PLC and KVPL and the other  as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Supply of Information Directors are provided with quarterly reports on performance  and such other reports and documents as are necessary.  The Chairman ensures all Directors are adequately briefed  on issues arising at meetings. Appointments to the Board The Board as a whole decides on the appointment of  Directors. Re-election of Directors The provisions of the Companys Articles require a Director  appointed by the Board to hold office until the next Annual  General Meeting, and seek reappointment by the shareholders  at that meeting. The Articles call for one-third of the Directors in office to  retire at each Annual General Meeting. The Directors who  retire are those who have served for the longest period after  their appointment/reappointment. Retiring Directors are  generally eligible for re-election. The Managing Director does not retire by rotation. Remuneration Procedure The Remuneration Committee of DPL, which is the parent of  KVPL, acts as Remuneration Committee of KVPL. The Remuneration Committee recommends the remuneration  payable to the Managing Director and Executive Director(s)  and sets guidelines for the remuneration of management staff  within the Company. The Board makes the final determination  after considering such recommendations. Disclosure of Remuneration The total of Directors Remuneration is reported in Note 09  to the Financial Statements. Directors are able to attend programmes arranged by the  Hayleys Group Human Resource Development Division  when appropriate, to receive updates on matters relevant  to business management and economic affairs.

Going Concern The Directors, after making necessary inquiries and reviews  including reviews of budgets for the ensuing year, capital  expenditure requirements, future prospects and risks, cash  flows and borrowing facilities, have a reasonable expectation  that the Company has resources to continue in operational  existence for the foreseeable future. Therefore, the going  concern basis has been adopted in the preparation of the  Financial Statements. Internal Control The Board is responsible for the Groups internal control and  its effectiveness. Internal control is established with emphasis  on safeguarding assets, making available accurate and timely  information and imposing greater discipline on decision  making.

It is important to recognise, however, that any system can  provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that  errors and irregularities are prevented or detected within a  reasonable time. |   Corporate Governance  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 45 The procedures in place to discharge this responsibility are  as follows:   z The Managing Agent is responsible for establishing  and monitoring financial controls appropriate for the  operation and for reporting to the Board thereon.   z The Board reviews the strategies of the Company.   z The Managing Agent is responsible for the preparation  of annual budgets for approval by the Board, and  performance is subject to regular review against these.   z The Board has established policies in the areas of  investment and Treasury management and does not  permit complex risk management mechanisms to be  used.   z The Company is subject to internal audits and system  reviews.   z The Audit Committee reviews the plans and activities of  internal audits and the management letters of External  Auditors.   z The Managing Agent selects and trains employees and  provides appropriate channels of communication to  foster a control-conscious environment.

Our risk management  process is intended to ensure that risks are taken knowingly  and with forethought. Our ability to identify, assess, monitor  and manage each type of risk to which the Company is  exposed is an important factor in our stability, performance,  reputation and future success. Our approach to risk management is built on the day-to-day  business process and relies on individual responsibility and  collective oversight, informed by comprehensive reporting.  In regular meetings the Companys results and attendant  opportunities and risks are discussed, and targets and  necessary actions agreed upon. Internal systems reviews monitor the effectiveness of and  compliance with management and control systems. This  provides useful insights as to the effectiveness of the risk  management system. In addition, with the year-end audit the External Auditor  issues a management letter highlighting possible risks,  and briefs the Board and the management team on their  evaluations. These outcomes are used to enhance our risk  management system. The following sections describe our approach to risk  management. The first covers our risk management process  and the second explains the risks and the way in which we  manage them. Risk Management Process  Objective Setting After a comprehensive review of risk and opportunities, the  Board sets annual targets. Targets reflect the Companys risk  appetite. Risk Identification The responsibility for setting up the overall framework for  risk management lies with the Board of Directors. Within that  structure, line managers are responsible for the identification,  measurement and management of risks in their areas of  responsibility. Regular monthly review meetings and internal systems  reviews are key instruments in identifying possible risks. Risk Assessment Risk measures are based on the likelihood of occurrence and  the impact of occurrence on achievement of our targets. Any  significant risk exceeding risk tolerance levels will require  management responses. A higher level of risk requires a more urgent and concerted  management response. Tolerance of Risk and Mitigating Action Depending on the tolerance of risk, decisions are taken to  manage risk by accepting, reducing, sharing or avoiding  it. The Managing Director, with the management team  responsible, initiates risk mitigatory actions. We have purchased insurance coverage, where it is available,  on economically viable terms to minimise the financial losses  arising from uncertainty and risk. These covers are frequently  re-examined and adjusted accordingly. Information and Communication Documentation and communication play a key role in our  risk monitoring process. Quarterly review reports with key  performance indicators and possible risk and mitigatory  actions are presented to the Board. Audit reports on levels  of compliance with risk mitigating actions are tabled at the  Audit Committee and are then reviewed and acted upon. Risk Management  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 49 Monitoring The ultimate responsibility for monitoring risk management  lies with the senior management team and the Audit  Committee.

REPORTING ENTITY Kelani Valley Plantations PLC was incorporated on 18th  June, 1992 under the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 (The  Company was re-registered under the Companies Act   No. 07 of 2007) in terms of the provisions of the Conversion  of Public Corporation and Government-Owned Business  Undertakings into Public Companies under Public  Companies Act No. 23 of 1987. The Registered Office of  the Company and the principal line of business are given  in the inner back cover. All companies in the Group are  limited liability companies incorporated and domiciled in   Sri Lanka. The ordinary shares of the Company are listed on the  Colombo Stock Exchange of Sri Lanka. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Kelani  Valley Plantations PLC, as at and for the year ended  31st December, 2010 comprise the Company and its  Subsidiaries namely, Kelani Valley Green Tea (Pvt) Ltd.,  Kalupahana Power Company (Pvt) Ltd., Kelani Valley  Instant Tea (Pvt) Ltd. and Mabroc Teas (Pvt) Ltd. of which  the controlling interest was acquired in December, 2010.  (together referred to as the Group) Maboc Teas (Pvt) Ltd. has been accounted as an associate  up to December 2010. The Company is a subsidiary of DPL Plantations (Pvt) Ltd.,   which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dipped Products  PLC whose ultimate parent enterprise is Hayleys PLC. The Financial Statements of the Company and the  Group comprise the Balance Sheet and the Statements  of Income, Changes in Equity and Cash Flows together  with the Accounting Policies and Notes to the Financial  Statements. The Financial Statements of all companies in the Group  other than that mentioned in Note 16 to the Financial  Statements are prepared for a common financial year,  which ends on 31st December. 2.  BASIS OF PREPARATION 2.1  Statement of Compliance The Financial Statements have been prepared in  accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLAS)  promulgated by The Institute of Chartered Accountants  of Sri Lanka (ICASL) and with the requirements of the  Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 and Sri Lanka Accounting  and Auditing Standards Act No. 15 of 1995. The Financial Statements were authorised for issue by the  Directors on 9th February, 2011. 2.2  Basis of Measurement These Financial Statements have been prepared in  accordance with the historical cost convention other than  bare land and leased assets of JEDB/SLSPC, which have  been revalued as described in Note 12 to the Financial  Statements. Where appropriate, specific policies are  explained in the succeeding Notes. 2.3  Functional and Presentation Currency The Financial Statements are presented in Sri Lankan  Rupees (Rs.), which is the Groups functional and  presentation currency. All financial information presented  in Sri Lankan Rupees has been given to the nearest  thousand, unless stated otherwise. 2.4  Use of Estimates and Judgments The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity  with SLAS requires management to make judgments,  estimates and assumptions that influence the application  of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities, income and expenses. Judgments and estimates  are based on historical experience and other factors,  including expectations that are believed to be reasonable  under the circumstances. Hence, actual experience and  results may differ from these judgments and estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on  an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are  recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if  the revision affects only that period and any future periods  affected. Information about significant areas of estimation  uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting  policies that have the most significant effect on the  amounts recognised in the Financial Statements is  included in the following notes:   z Note 25 - Measurement of the Defined Benefit  Obligations.   z Note 26 - Net Liability to Lessor.    z Note 24 - Deferred Taxation Liability.  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 67 3.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies set out below are consistent with  those used in the previous year. Accounting policies of  Subsidiaries and Associate have been adjusted, where  necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted  by the Group. Comparative  information  has,  where  necessary,  been reclassified to conform with the current years  presentation. The Directors have made an assessment of the Groups  ability to continue as a going concern in the foreseeable  future, and they do not foresee a need for liquidation or  cessation of trading. 3.1  Basis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements (referred to as  the Group) comprise the Financial Statements of the  Company and its Subsidiaries and the Groups interest in  Associates. Subsidiaries and Associates are disclosed in Notes 15 and  16 to the Financial Statements. 3.1.1  Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.  Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or  indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of  an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities which  is evident when the Group controls the composition of the  Board of Directors of the entity or holds more than 50%  of the issued shares of the entity or 50% of the voting  rights of the entity or entitled to receive more than half  of every dividend from shares carrying unlimited right to  participate in distribution of profits or capital. The Financial Statements of Subsidiaries are included in  the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that  control effectively commences until the date that control  effectively ceases. 3.1.2  Transaction with Minority Interest The profit or loss and net assets of a Subsidiary  attributable to equity interests that are not owned by  the parent, directly or indirectly, through Subsidiaries, is  disclosed separately under the heading Minority Interest. The Group applies a policy of treating transactions with  minority interests as transactions with parties external to  the Group.  3.1.3  Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has  significant influence, but no control, over financial and  operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to  exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 per cent  of the voting power of the entity. Associates are accounted  for using the equity method and are initially recognised  at cost. The Consolidated Financial Statements include  the Groups share of income and expenses and equity  movements of equity accounted investees, from the date  the significant influence commences until the date the  significant influence ceases. When the Groups share  of losses exceeds its investment in an equity accounted  investee, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced  to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued,  except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations  or has made payments on behalf of the investee.  3.1.4  Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation Intra-group balances, transactions and any unrealised  income  and  expenses  arising  from  intra-group  transactions, are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated  Financial Statements. Unrealised gains arising from  transactions  with  equity  accounted  investees  are  eliminated against the investment to the extent of the  Groups interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are  eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only  to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 3.1.5  Profits and Losses The total profits and losses for the period of the Company  and its Subsidiaries included in consolidation are shown in  the Consolidated Income Statement, with the proportion  of the profit or loss after taxation applicable to minority  shareholders of the Subsidiaries being separately mentioned  as Minority Interest/(Loss). 3.1.6  Assets and Liabilities All assets and liabilities of the Company and its   Subsidiaries  are  included  in  the  Consolidated  Balance Sheet. The proportionate interest of minority  shareholders in the net assets employed by the Group, is   disclosed separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet   as Minority Interest.    3.2  Foreign Currency Transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into  the respective functional currencies of Group entities at  exchange rates applicable on the dates of the transactions.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies at the reporting date are translated to the  functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at that  date. Foreign currency differences arising on translation  are recognised in profit and loss. Non-monetary assets  and liabilities which are carried in terms of historical cost  in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate  that prevailed at the date of the transaction. Notes to the Financial Statements |  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 68 3.3  Assets and Bases of their Valuation Assets classified as current assets in the Balance Sheet  are cash and bank balances and those which are expected  to be realised in cash during the normal operating cycle  of the Companys business or within one year from the  reporting date whichever is shorter. Assets other than  current assets are those, which the Company intends to  hold beyond a period of one year from the Balance Sheet  date. 3.3.1  Property, Plant & Equipment 3.3.1.1  Recognition and Measurement Items of Property, Plant & Equipment are measured at   cost (or at fair value in the case of land), less accumulated   depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 3.3.1.2  Owned Assets The cost of Property, Plant & Equipment includes  expenditure that are directly attributable to the acquisition  of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes  the cost of materials and direct labour, any other cost  directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working  condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling  and removing the items and restoring the site on which  they are located.  When parts (major components) of an item of Property,   Plant & Equipment have different useful lives, they are  accounted for as separate items of Property, Plant &  Equipment. Capital work-in-progress is transferred to the respective   asset accounts at the time of first utilisation or at the time  the asset is commissioned. 3.3.1.3   Leased Assets Assets obtained under the finance lease, which effectively  transfer to the Company substantially, all of the risks and  benefits incidental to ownership of the leased assets, are  treated as if they have been purchased outright and are  capitalised at their cash price. Assets acquired by way of  a finance lease are measured at an amount equal to the  lower of their fair value and the present value of minimum  lease payments at the inception, less accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Assets held under finance lease are amortised over the  shorter of the lease period or the useful lives of equivalent- owned assets, unless ownership is not transferred at the  end of the lease period. The principal/capital elements  payable to the lessor are shown as liability/obligation.  The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and  interest elements. The capital element in the rental that is  applied to reduce the outstanding obligation and interest  element is charged against profit, in proportion to the  reducing capital element outstanding.    The cost of improvements to or on leased property is  capitalised, disclosed as improvements to leasehold  property and depreciated over the unexpired period of the  lease, or the estimated useful lives of the improvements,  whichever is shorter. 3.3.1.4  Subsequent Cost The cost of replacing part of an item of Property, Plant &  Equipment  is recognised in the carrying amount of the  item, if it is probable that the future economic benefits  embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost  can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of those  parts that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with  the derecognition policy given below. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of Property, Plant &  Equipment  are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. 3.3.1.5  Derecognition The carrying amount of an item of Property, Plant &  Equipment is derecognised on disposal; or when no future  economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.  Gains or losses on derecognition are recognised in profit  or loss and gains are not classified as revenue. 3.3.1.6  Permanent Land Development Cost Permanent land development costs are those costs  incurred in making major infrastructure development and  building new access roads on leasehold lands.  These costs have been capitalised and amortised over the  remaining lease period. Permanent impairments to land development costs are  charged to the Income Statement in full or reduced to  the net carrying amounts of such assets in the year of  occurrence after ascertaining the loss. 3.3.1.7   Limited Life Land Development Cost (Immature and Mature Plantations) The cost of land preparation, rehabilitation, new planting,  replanting,  crop  diversification,  inter-planting  and  fertilising, etc., incurred between the time of planting  and harvesting (when the planted area attains maturity),  are classified as immature plantations. These immature  plantations are shown as direct costs plus attributable  overheads, including interest attributable to long-term  loans used for financing immature plantations.  Permanent impairments to land development costs  are charged to the Income Statement in full or reduced  to the net carrying amounts of such asset in the year of  occurrence after ascertaining the loss. The expenditure incurred on perennial crop (Tea/Rubber)  fields, which comes into bearing during the year, has been  transferred to mature plantations. 3.3.1.8  Infilling Cost The land development costs incurred in the form of infilling  have been capitalised to the relevant mature field, only  where the number of plants per hectare exceeded 3,000  plants and, also if it increases the expected future benefits  from that field, beyond its pre-infilling performance  assessment. Infilling costs so capitalised are depreciated  over the newly assessed remaining useful economic life  of the relevant mature plantation, or the unexpired lease  period, whichever is lower. | Notes to the Financial Statements  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 69 Infilling costs that are not capitalised have been charged  to the Income Statement in the year in which they are  incurred.   3.3.1.9  Borrowing Cost Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to acquisition,  construction or production of a qualifying asset, which  takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its  intended use or sale, are capitalised as a part of the asset. Borrowing costs that are not capitalised are recognised  as expenses in the period in which they are incurred and  charged to the Income Statement. The amounts of the borrowing costs which are eligible  for capitalisation are determined in accordance with   the Allowed Alternative Treatment in SLAS 20 -  Borrowing  Costs. Borrowing costs incurred in respect of specific loans that  are utilised for field development activities have been  capitalised as a part of the cost of the relevant immature  plantation. The capitalisation will cease when the crops  are ready for commercial harvest. The amount so capitalised and the capitalisation rates are  disclosed in the Notes to the Financial Statements. 3.3.1.10  Depreciation and Amortisation (a)  Depreciation Depreciation is recognised in profit and loss on a straight- line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of each  part of an item of Property, Plant & Equipment. Assets  held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter  of the lease term and the useful lives of equivalent owned  assets unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will  have ownership by the end of the lease term. Lease period  of land acquired from JEDB/SLSPC will be expired in  year 2045. The estimated useful lives for the current and  comparative periods are as follows: No. of Years    Rate (%) Buildings & Roads  40 2.50 Plant & Machinery  13  1/3 7.50 Hydro Power Plant  30  3.33 Motor Vehicles  5  20.00 Equipment  8 12.50 Furniture & Fittings  10  10.00 Sanitation, Water &      Electricity Supply  20 5.00 Computer Accessories  4  25.00 Tea Bagging Machines 15 6.67 Mature Plantations (Replanting and New Planting) No. of Years    Rate (%) Mature Plantations - Tea 33 1/3  3.00   - Rubber 20  5.00 Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use  and ceases at the earlier of the date on which the asset is  classified as held for sale or is derecognised. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values  are reassessed at the reporting date. Mature plantations  are depreciated over their useful lives or unexpired lease  period, whichever is less. No depreciation is provided for immature plantations. (b)  Amortisation The leasehold rights of assets taken over from JEDB/ SLSPC are amortised in equal amounts over the shorter  of the remaining lease periods and the useful lives as  follows: No. of Years  Rate (%) Bare land   53  1.89 Improvements to land  30  3.33 Mature plantations (Tea & Rubber) 30 3.33 Buildings  25  4.00 Machinery  15  6.67 3.3.2.  Intangible Assets Intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset  without physical substance held for use in the production or  supply of goods or services, for rental or for administrative  purpose.    An intangible asset is recognised if it is probable that  future economic benefits that are attributable to the  asset will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the asset  can be measured reliably in accordance with SLAS 37 on  Intangible Assets. Accordingly, these assets are stated in  the Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated amortisation  and accumulated impairment losses.  3.3.2.1  Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition represents the excess  of the cost of the identifiable assets and liabilities of  the acquired entity at the date of acquisition. Negative  goodwill arising on an acquisition represents the excess  of the Groups interest in the fair value of the assets and  liabilities acquired over the cost of acquisition. Negative  goodwill is recognised immediately in profit and loss. After the control of an entity is obtained, changes in  ownership interest that do not result in a loss of control  are accounted as equity transactions and gain or loss from  these changes are not recognised in profit and loss. Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a non-controlling  interest in a Subsidiary, represents the excess of the cost of  the additional investment over the carrying amount of the  interest in the net assets, acquired at the date of exchange.  Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is  measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses.  In respect of Associates, the carrying amount of goodwill  is included in the carrying amount of the investment. (c)  Research and Development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the  prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge  and understanding, is recognised in profit or loss when  incurred. Notes to the Financial Statements |  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 70 Development activities involve a plan or design for the  production of new or substantially improved products and  processes. Development expenditure is capitalised only if  development costs can be measured reliably, the product  or process is technically and commercially feasible, future  economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends  to and has sufficient resources to complete development  and to use or sell the asset. The expenditure capitalised  includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overhead  costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset  for its intended use. Other development expenditure is  recognised in profit or loss when incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is measured at  cost, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated  impairment losses.  3.3.3  Investments 3.3.3.1  Short-Term Investments Short-term investments are measured at the lower of cost  and market value on an aggregate portfolio basis, with any  resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. 3.3.3.2  Long-Term Investments Quoted and unquoted investments in shares held on long- term basis are measured at cost, less impairment losses. In  the  Parent  Companys  Financial  Statements,   investments in Subsidiaries and Associates are carried   at cost, less impairment losses under the Parent  Companys Accounting Policy for long-term investments. Provision for impairment is made when, in the opinion  of the Directors, there has been a decline other than  temporary in the value of the investment. 3.3.4  Inventories Inventories other than produce stocks are valued at the  lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after  making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items.  Net realisable value is the estimated selling price at which  stocks can be sold in the ordinary course of business after  allowing for cost of realisation and/or cost of conversion  from their existing state to saleable condition. The cost incurred in bringing inventories to its present  location and condition is accounted using the following  cost formula. Input Material, Spares and Consumables At actual cost on weighted average basis. Nurseries At the cost of direct materials, direct labour and an  appropriate proportion of directly attributable overheads,  less provision for overgrown plants. Produce Stocks Produce stocks manufactured up to the Balance Sheet  date and sold since then, until the time of preparation  of the Financial Statements are valued at since realised  price. The balance stocks are valued at estimated selling  price. The prices are net of all attributable expenses  relating to the public auction. 3.3.5  Trade and Other Receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their estimated  realisable amounts inclusive of provisions for bad and  doubtful debts. 3.3.6  Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and  short-term deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable  on demand form an integral part of the Groups cash  management and are included as a component of cash  and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of  Cash Flows. 3.3.7  Impairment of Assets The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed  at each reporting date to determine whether there is any  indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then  the assets recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill  and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not  yet available for use, recoverable amounts are estimated at  each reporting date or more frequently, if events or changes  in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. 3.3.7.1 Calculation of Recoverable Amount The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating  unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value,  less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, estimated  future cash flows are discounted to their present value  using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market  assessments of the time value of money and the risks  specific to the asset. A cash-generating unit is the smallest  identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that  largely are independent from other assets and groups. 3.3.7.2. Impairment/Reversal of Impairment An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount  of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its  recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised  in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect  of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the  carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and  then to reduce the carrying amount of the Group of other  assets in the unit on pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.  In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised  in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for  any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer  exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a  change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable  amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent  that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the  carrying amount that would have been determined, net of  depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had  been recognised. 3.4  Liabilities and Provisions Liabilities classified as current liabilities on the Balance  Sheet are those which fall due for payment on demand or  within one year from the Balance Sheet date. Non-current  liabilities are those balances that fall due for payment after  one year from the Balance Sheet date. All known liabilities  have been accounted for in preparing these Financial  Statements. Provisions and liabilities are recognised when  | Notes to the Financial Statements  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 71 the Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a  result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of  economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 3.4.1 Employees Benefits (a)  Defined Contribution Plans - Provident Funds and   Trust Fund A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit  plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into  a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive  obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for  contributions to Provident and Trust Funds covering all  employees are recognised as an expense in profit and  loss in the periods during which services are rendered by  employees. The Company contributes 12% on consolidated salary  of the employees to Ceylon Planters Provident Society  (CPPS)/Estate Staff Provident Society (ESPS)/Employees  Provident Fund (EPF). All the employees of the Company are members of the  Employees Trust Fund, to which the Company contributes  3% on the consolidated salary of such employees. (b)  Defined Benefit Plan A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit  plan other than a defined contribution plan. The liability  recognised in the Financial Statements in respect of  defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined  benefit obligation at the reporting date. The defined benefit  obligation is calculated annually using the projected unit  credit method. The present value of the defined benefit  obligation is determined by discounting the estimated  future cash flows using the interest rates that are  denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be  paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the  terms of the related liability. Actuarial gains and losses  arising from experience adjustments and changes in  actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in  statement of recognised income and expense in the period  in which they arise. Past service costs are recognised  immediately in Income Statement.  Provision has been made for retirement gratuities from  the first year of service for all employees, in conformity  with Sri Lanka Accounting Standard No. 16 (Revised 2006),  Retirement Benefit Costs. However, under the Payment  of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983, the liability to an employee  arises only on completion of 5 years of continued service. The Liability is not externally funded. The key assumptions used in determining the retirement  benefit obligations are given in Note 25.  3.4.2  Trade and Other Payables Trade and other payables are stated at their costs. 3.4.3  Capital Commitments and Contingencies Capital commitments and contingent liabilities of the  Company have been disclosed in the respective Notes to  the Financial Statements. 3.4.4  Events Occurring after the Balance Sheet Date All material post-Balance Sheet events have been considered  where appropriate; either adjustments have been made or  adequately disclosed in the Financial Statements. 3.4.5  Earnings Per Share The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share  (EPS) for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated  by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary  shareholders of the Company by the weighted average  number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss  attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted  average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the  effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. 3.4.6  Deferred Income 3.4.6.1  Grants and Subsidies Grants related to Property, Plant & Equipment other  than grants received for forestry are initially deferred and  allocated to income on a systematic basis over the useful  life of the related Property, Plant & Equipment as follows:  Assets are amortised over their useful lives or unexpired  lease period, whichever is less. Buildings 40 years Sanitation & Water Supply 20 years Plant & Equipment 13 1/3 years Grants related to income are recognised in the Income  Statement in the year in which it is receivable. Grants  received for forestry are initially deferred and credited  to income once when the related blocks of trees are  harvested. 3.5  Income Statements For the purpose of presentation of Income Statements, the  function of expenses method is adopted, as it represents  fairly the elements of the Companys performance. 3.5.1  Turnover (a)  In keeping with the practice in the Plantation Industry,  revenue and profit or loss on sale of perennial crops are  recognised in the financial period of harvesting. Revenue is  recorded at invoice value net of brokerage, sale expenses  and other levies related to revenue. (b)  Gains and losses on disposal of an item of Property, Plant  & Equipment are determined by comparing the net sales  proceeds with the carrying amounts of Property, Plant &   Equipment and  are recognised within other operating  income in the Income Statements.  (c)  Interest income is recognised on accrual basis. (d)  Dividend income is recognised in profit and loss on the  date the entitys right to receive payment is established,  which in the case of quoted securities is the ex-dividend date. Notes to the Financial Statements |  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 72 3.5.2  Expenses All expenditure incurred in the running of the business  and in maintaining the Property, Plant & Equipment in a  state of efficiency is charged to revenue in arriving at the  profit/(loss) for the year.  3.5.2.1  Finance Income and Expenses Finance income comprises interest income on funds  invested, and gains on translation of foreign currency.  Interest income is recognised in profit and loss as   it accrues. Finance expenses comprise interest payable on borrowings  and losses on translation of foreign currency. The interest  expense component of finance lease payments is allocated  to each period during the lease term so as to produce a  constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance  of the liability. 3.5.2.2  Income Tax Expense Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.  Income tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except  to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in  equity, when it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable  income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the  reporting date and any adjustments to tax payable in  respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet method,  providing for temporary differences between the carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting  purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.  Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary  differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities  in a transaction that is not a business combination and  that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and  differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the  extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable  future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable  temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of  goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are  expected to be applied to the temporary differences when  they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted  or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred  tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally  enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets,  and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax  authority on the same taxable entity. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is  probable that future taxable profits will be available against  which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax  assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced  to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax  benefit will be realised. Tax withheld on dividend income from Subsidiaries and  Associates is recognised as an expense in the Consolidated  Income Statement at the same time as the liability to pay  the related dividend is recognised. 3.6  Cash Flow Statement The Cash Flow Statement has been prepared using the  indirect method. Interest paid is classified as operating  cash flows, interest and dividends received are classified as  investing cash flows while dividends paid and Government  grants received are classified as financing cash flows, for  the purpose of presenting the Cash Flow Statement. 3.7  Segment Reporting Segmental information is provided for the different business  segments of the Group. Business segmentation has been  determined based on the nature of goods provided by the  Group after considering the risk and rewards of each type  of product. Since the individual segments are located close to each  other and operate in the same industrial environment,  the need for geographical segmentation has no material  impact. The activities of the segments are described on pages  74 and 91 in the Notes to the Financial Statements. The  Group transfers products from one industry segment for  use in another. Inter-segment transfers are based on fair  market prices. Revenue and expenses directly attributable to each  segment are allocated to the respective segments.  Revenue and expenses not directly attributable to a  segment are allocated on the basis of their resource  utilisation, wherever possible. Assets and liabilities directly attributable to each segment  are allocated to the respective segments. Assets and  liabilities, which are not directly attributable to a segment,  are allocated on a reasonable basis, wherever possible.  Unallocated items comprise mainly interest bearing loans,  borrowings, and expenses. Segment  capital  expenditure  is  the  total  cost   incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that  are expected to be used for more than one accounting  period. 4.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND  JUDGMENTS Information about significant areas of estimation  uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting  policies that have the most significant effect on the  amounts recognised in the Financial Statements is  included in the following notes: 4.1  Income Taxes The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax based  on estimates of taxable income. Where the final tax  outcome of these matters is different from the amounts  that were initially recorded, such differences will impact  the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  in the period in which such determination is made. | Notes to the Financial Statements  Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2010 73 4.2  Retirement Benefit Obligations The present value of the retirement benefit obligations  depends on a number of factors that are determined  on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions.  Key assumptions used in determining the retirement  benefit obligations are given in Note 25. Any changes in  these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of  retirement benefit obligations. 5.  EFFECTS OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED  BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka has  issued a new volume of Sri Lanka Accounting Standards  which will become applicable for financial periods  beginning on or after 1st January, 2012. Accordingly,  these standards have not been applied in preparing these  Financial Statements as the effective dates of these  standards are after the Balance Sheet date. These Sri Lanka Accounting Standards comprise  Accounting Standards prefixed both SLFRS (corresponding  to IFRS) and LKAS (corresponding to IAS). Application of  Sri Lanka Accounting Standards prefixed SLFRS and LKAS  for first time shall be deemed to be an adoption of SLFRSs.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating  the potential effect of these standards on its Financial  Statements and the impacts of the adoption of these  standards have not been qualified as at Balance Sheet date.

This lease agreement was further amended on 1st August, 2002, freezing annual lease rental at Rs. 25,839,041/- from  18th June, 2002.

Future liability on annual lease payment of Rs. 19,598,000/- would continue until year 2045.
