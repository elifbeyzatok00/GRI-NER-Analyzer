Corporate Social Responsibility  AnnuAl RepoRt 2011 CSR at Rynkeby Foods  THEME: HEALTH In 2010 Rynkeby Foods asked the question: Can  Rynkeby make Denmark healthier? We believed so, and  we still do. Among other things we inform the consumers  that juice is 100% fruit – with no sugar added. THEME: PLANET In 2011 Rynkeby Foods reduced energy consumption,  emission of waste water, packaging waste and waste of  raw materials additionally. Thus we harvested the fruits  of a number of investments made in the factory the year  before. THEME: PEOPLE Rynkeby Foods has happy and motivated employees  who, in our latest employee satisfaction survey, score 4.2  points out of 5.0 possible. For the first time we obtain  such a splendid result, and we are very proud of it. THEME:  PROFIT Rynkeby Foods very much wants to focuse on viable  manufacturing and contribute to the continued existence  of the growers, thus enabling them to deliver healthy raw  materials, produced according to the principles in the  Code of Conduct/Global Compact.

The report resulted in our  many CSR activities being collected and  systematized – from quality control of  our many raw material suppliers in The  Third World over the seriousness in our  way to inform about our products to our  many different health offers to our  employees, including a well equipped  fitness centre. We have chosen to have  plain targets for our CSR activities in  order so secure transparency of our  results and our efforts. I can establish as a fact that also in  this CSR report 2011 we have obtained  improvements benefitting both the  environment and the society. I am proud  when I see the results of 2011 – the  year when Team Rynkeby was cycling  to Paris for the tenth time and together  with hundreds of volunteers collected  9.77 mio. DKK to children with cancer in  Denmark and in Sweden. Our massive focus on health has im- proved the body age of the employees  by 1.5 years on average and changed  the lifestyle of some employees forever.  This strengthens my belief in the fact  that health is and will continue to be an  important element of a viable Rynkeby. We have created a culture in which  it feels natural to work with viability,  whether it is about environmental,  supplier or human matters and I  experience that being part of a com- pany working with social responsibility  is creating a certain pride amongst the  employees. For one year Rynkeby has been attend- ing the UN Global Compact and of  course we will continue developing our  business according to the principles of  this UN initiative.  We must achieve  much more and in the nearest future  focus will among other things be on  improvement of the processes for  evaluation and follow-up on suppliers in  The Third World and on further develop- ment of our environmental/climate  targets in order to involve bigger parts of  the value chain. In this report and on our website you can  read about our initiatives towards an  even more viable company.

The decline in turnover in 2009  and 2010 is due to the phasing out of this Swedish contract manufacturing agreement. Rynkeby Foods financial development Rynkeby Foods is well under way with activities aiming to  secure the future position of our company as the strongest nordic  juice player with a very central location In Northern Europe. The  expansion must be made with a focus on the Rynkeby brand and  on the brands we have under the Rynkeby umbrella, but also by  focusing even more on health and charity – CSR values which are  already playing a major role in our company today. As a big Nordic player with growth ambition Rynkeby finds it  essential to take the lead as the one protecting and running the  juice segment so that the consumers will drink more juice and  have confidence in the product category as well.  As part of this strategy some of the parameters in the CSR report  will be central and form the natural basis of many of the new  products and activities we plan to launch.   5 Our values We develop We respect each other We protect quality We involve ourselves Se are winners The Rynkeby values have become firmly anchored. This poster daily reminds the employees  of the values on their way between the administration building and the factory.  5 Therefore we decided to initiate the  value discussion from the bottom of our  organization. Thus we took a day off and  gathered all employees for a value discus- sion, resulting in five values. It is gratifying  that since then our values have become a  natural part of our working day and essen- tial carriers of Rynkebys company culture. It started in 2005 Our value kick-off day was on 28 October  2005 and was followed up on 17 Novem- ber 2010 when all of our employees got  together again, with a focus on our values.  Besides, part of this event was funded by  the award as the healthiest place to work  in Funen, a competition which Rynkeby  had won among 20 nominated compa- nies. In the following we state our descriptions  of the individual values in 2005 (se the  icons in the right colomn). We pRoteCt QuAlItY Rynkeby is a trustworthy and professional  company with ambitious quality norms in  all parts and functions. We ReSpeCt eACH otHeR Rynkeby is an attractive and inviting  company, where personal and professional  differences are respected and appreciat- ed and where all employees are equally  valued. In our company common goals  and decisions are respected and obeyed in  all parts. We InVolVe ouRSelVeS Rynkeby has an open company culture  providing an incentive to seek and take  responsibility, to share knowledge, and to  co-operate.   We DeVelop Rynkeby attracts, maintains and develops  qualified employees. Our company is ready  for change and innovative in its production  and product development and currently  chases improvement opportunities. We ARe WInneRS Rynkeby is a competitive market leader  with products worth paying extra for. Our  company has ambitious and realistic tar- gets and has competent employees taking  a common responsibility for the targets. To Rynkeby Foods it was not just a  question of choosing and writing  down some values when we put  the topic on the agenda in 2005.  It was also – and not the least –  a question of securing that our  values were relevant and could be  firmly anchored among our em- ployees.  6 Topic: Profit Fruit is the main ingredient in our  products, and most products consist  of 100% fruit. At Rynkeby we are very  keen on focusing on viable manu- facturing and to us this is more than  just ecology. We think it is possible to  have viable thoughts within tradi- tional farming and we want to par- ticipate in securing that the growers  continue to exist so that also in the  future we can offer products to the  consumers which are made of good,  healthy raw materials, manufactured  according to the principles in the  Code of conduct/Global Compact. The challenge to Rynkeby is that  we are often the smallest player in  the global market meaning that we  cannot influence the development of  viability within the fruit trade consid- erably - but nevertheless we can make  a difference. One of the ways is stra- tegic partnerships and in 2011 the fo- cus was on our biggest raw material,  oranges. Thus Rynkeby is focusing on  the long-term supplier cooperation,  being about finding strategic coope- ration partners to improve security of  supply. Among the demands are that  the partners must match Rynkebys  Code of Conduct/Ethic Codex and  support our focus on health, quality  and growth.  In the future, strategic partnerships  may also include cooperation with  business/consumer organizations  (NGOs) or the like.      SGF supplier of fruit, berries and vegetables Suppliers supporting Code of Conduct 2014 2010 80.5% 100.0% 90.0%  100.0%  83.8% 100.0% 2011 TARGETS AND RESULTS target Rynkeby continues having big focus  on securing that our suppliers are  observing the human rights, em- ployee rights and anti-corruption. We  continue securing that our suppliers  comply with our demand for their  SGF/IRMA-membership (Sure Good  Fair) and we demand the signing of  our Code of Conduct. In cooperation with Arla Foods we  have initiated a process concerning  responsible supplier control, in which  we risk evaluate countries as to en- vironment, human rights etc. and  make particular demands on the high- risk-countries. In 2011 we visited four orange  suppliers in Brazil, being a so-called  high-risk-country. Our experience is  that our suppliers launch many initia- tives in order to secure that the Global  Compact principles and violations  are not associated with the orange  orchards. Among other things we  could establish that the orange pick- ers are wearing protective clothing  like of headgear, glasses, gloves and  safety boots in order to avoid insects.  Likewise, it makes a deep impression  to see the suppliers take initiatives to  support the young people in the areas  round the orchards and the factories.  For instance, in 2001 our biggest  supplier of oranges started a project  called: Bom de Bola, Bom na Escola.  The purpose of the project is schools  and sports for young people at the  age of 7 to 15 years in order to secure  education and to keep the children  off the streets. The demand on fresh fruit and juice drinks is increasing  globally because of the increase in population and the in- creased standard of living throughout the world, not the least  in China, India and Russia, which to an increasing degree is a  threat to the supplying guarantee of raw materials. In short,  we become more people to share the raw materials. Further- more, already now we are experiencing that the varying  prices and illness of crops make the growers change pro- duction into alternative crops with better profits and less risk.  FocuS areaS:  VIAbIlItY CoDe oF ConDuCt  7 Topic: Profit     Corporate Social Responsibility Rynkeby Foods employees  should know and observe our  CSR policies.   Result 2011:  Awareness degree will not be  measured until 2012. Target in 2012: All employees  acquire awareness of Rynkebys  CSR work, targets and policies. The CSR report has been sent to  the homes of all employees and  forms part of the informative  material for all new employees. FocuS areaS:  FAIR SpeAk At Rynkeby we believe in responsible  marketing, colloquially called fair  speak. In spite of our many efforts  we regrettably cannot always avoid  cases in which a consumer or an  organization feels offended at our  marketing. Among other things this  is due to the legislation being very  complex but also open in its inter- pretation of what e.g. misleading  is - and misleading in Denmark is not  necessarily misleading in other coun- tries and vice versa. It is important  to us that our products are presented  nicely and are saleable but the mes- sages must always be true and not  misleading to the consumers. In 2011 we received a note from the  food authorities - because some of  our mixed sweet fruit juices did not  have the designations Sweet/sweet- ened and from concentrate. This is  against the regulations for fruit juices  and of course it was immediately cor- rected. For many years our products  have been sold under the designation  Mixed fruit juice and we have never  had any complaints from consumers  who felt mislead. A journalist from the newspaper 24  timer has also found a similar error  on a ready to drink blackcurrant/apple  juice, and of course we have also  changed the product name of this  product to be in accordance with the  regulations.  We are sorry for the two errors which  evidently were on our packagings.  Therefore we carried out a quality  check of all our packagings. We have  not found more errors but we will  maintain big focus that we incor- porate the responsible line of market- ing and observe the fundamental rule  of presenting the fruits in the propor- tions to be found in the product.  CSR Policies One of the goals for 2010 was that all  employees should acquire an aware- ness of Rynkebys CSR work, targets  and politics. The degree of aware- ness should among other things be  measured by means of the employee  satisfaction survey. All employees  received a copy of Rynkebys CSR  report 2010 (see picture below) and  all new employees get a copy as  well. In 2011 we did not measure the  awareness degree but we expect to  do so in 2012. You are mislead into buying goods  advertising for less fat and sugar it  says in one of the critical consumer  articles by Ekstrabladet, focus- ing on the generous use of health  superlatives by food companies in  their packaging communication. However, the journalist is pointing  out one single product in his article  as guiding rather than misleading  – and that is Rynkebys mixed juice  with apple and blackcurrant with  0 percent sugar added. Instead  you can read on the front what the  juice contains. It namely contains  a natural content of sugar from the  fruit, Ekstrabladet states. We still maintain our open contact  with the consumers through the  social networks and present both  positive and negative comments/ questions from the public. Rynkeby is still embraced by the  Childrens Code for Advertising  Food – a voluntary initiative aiming  at reducing the use of advertising  for foodstuffs with a consider- able content of sugar, fat and  salt in media approaching child- ren. Rynkeby does not promote  products which are not nutritious  for children, i.e. products with a  content of carbonhydrate/sugar  over 12 g/100 ml. an example of good and responsible marketing CSR polICIeS As a positive aspect in 2011  our 0% blackcurrant/apple  juice was selected by Ek- strabladet as a good ex- ample of good and respon- sible marketing.  8 Topic: Profit CeRtIFICAtIonS AnD FooDStuFF SeCuRItY Foodstuff security continues to have a big priority at Rynkeby. As one of the  first companies in the world we were certified according to the ISO22000  standard and we are very pleased to work according to these. The regular  verifications by the Lloyds Register always result in improvements and of  course we do not want serious deviation in our Food safety system. In 2011 Rynkeby was re-certified and all procedures were checked. No  serious deviations were found in our Food safety system. Also in 2011 Rynkeby started a new ad-hoc work group within the European  juice association (AIJN). Its purpose is to gather good experience and risk as- sessments from the industrial companies into a joint juice guide which may  be useful to the rest of the trade and thereby to a bigger extent secure food  safety in relation to the consumers.  The juice guide is expected to be completed in 2012. RESULTS 2010: No severe deviations 2011: No severe deviations TARgET IN 2014 No severe deviations Lloyds audit ISO 22000 In 2011 all Rynkeby employees with a leading  responsibility attended the Lean Leadership  with three joint meetings and six best prac- tice team meetings.  The topics were oriented towards HR (em- ployee development dialogues, employee  satisfaction survey etc.). Also in 2011 the big focus on leadership had  an effect on the employee satisfaction survey,  as in 2011 we kept the outstanding score in  leadership questions from 2010 of 4.2 on a  scale of 5. The leadership focus  for 2012 will be  the introduction of  leadership based on  performance, based  on the Good to  Great idea.   ACTIONS IN 2011 2014 TARGET VAlueS Our employees are observing  the five Rynkeby values. In our  employee satisfaction survey  the statement You and your  colleagues are observing our  values in your working life?  has a score of 4.2 on the scale  of 1 to 5. Everybody at Rynkeby Foods  should know and observe our  five values. 2014 TARGET FocuS area:  leADeRSHIp Visitors and employees at Rynkeby are  welcomed by an entrance decorated  with photos of fresh fruit. The buildings  of the factory are also decorated with  fruit motives like the above on the outer  wall.  9 Topic: People FocuS area:  eMploYeeS Diversity We want diversity so that our organi- zation reflects our surrounding society  as to age, race, sex, religion and na- tionality. We also want to make room  for people who, despite their injuries,  attrition or handicaps, are still able to  make an effort for Rynkeby. Therefore  we engage employees in light jobs or  with flexible contracts if we can offer  adequate tasks.  We do not want exact targets for  how many employees with special  contracts we want to employ – we  want to reflect society and in general  to have employment agreements  advantageous to both parties. Senior policy Rynkeby also has a senior policy.  Today employees attaining the age  of 55 are offered a senior dialogue  with a view to matching expectations  concerning working hours, retirement  etc. and to planning and – if possible  – meeting the wishes.  Development Dialogues To make sure that our employees  continue to do fine, develop and  remain competent, they are invited to  a development dialogue at least once  a year, focusing on job satisfaction,  education and development. Action  plans are elaborated and currently  followed up upon. Social events Rynkeby also supports social events  and clubs run by our employees.  Thus, our employee club, art club and  fitness club are financially supported  by Rynkeby. no mobbing Rynkeby wants to be a non-mob- bing workplace. We have had big  focus on mobbing amongst our  employees and in our Employee  Satisfaction Survey we asked  them, whether they often or  sometimes feel mobbed. The  total result is recorded and forms  the basis of our future efforts. In our Employee Satisfaction  Survey of 2011 we had a good  development to often mobbed  (1 employee against 2 in 2010)  but unfortunately we had a  negative development to the  question sometimes mobbed.  Thus 14 employees in our factory  and warehouse departments  answered that they felt they were  sometimes being mobbed. That  is why we want to focus on a  non-mobbing workplace once  more.   Since 2006 Rynkeby has reduced the number of employees being mobbed from 16 to 6%  today. The reduction is due to a continued focus on the problem. Employee turnover rate Employee satisfaction (total score) Mental health/mobbing (number of employees) Feel generally happy and motivated Number of education  days per year (Factory/ Warehouse) There is a good balance between  your worklife and your private life 2010: 1 week per employee/3 weeks per co-ordinator. 2011: 2 weeks Target 2014: 1 week per employee/3 weeks per co-ordinator TARGETS AND RESULTS 2014 tARGet 12% 4.0 4.0 0,0 2011 10% 4.2 4.2 6% 4.5 4.0 3.9 8% 2009 13% 4.3 4.1 4.1 4% 17% 2010 4.5 4.5 FocuS area:  SuRRounDInGS the consumers Rynkeby feels a big responsibility to- wards the consumers of our products.   Therefore we are extremely thorough  when controlling the quality before  sending the products to the stores.  On the other hand we are fully aware  that we cannot produce 200 mio.  litres of juice without making a single  mistake. Typically our products are pure nature  without any kind of additives and  they are therefore extra vulnerable  if a hole turns up in the packaging.  This will of course bother the con- sumer and therefore quick action and  remedy is important if a defect turns  up. Trends in consumer complaints  are followed very closely in order to  be able to constantly correct and  prevent. Rynkebys Employee Satisfaction Survey shows that the em- ployees are very content with working at the company. We  have happy and motivated employees who on average score  4.2 points out of 5.0 points possible.  This is the first time we  have had such a splendid result and of course we are very  proud!  10 Topic: People Customers The retail customers of Rynkeby are  the key to even being able to sell the  products in the stores. Today the retail  chains make big demands on their  suppliers and we have a responsibility  to live up to them all. Rynkeby wants  to be different in a positive way and  therefore we regularly measure the  satisfaction of our retail customers.  Earlier measurements show that  our position is very fine. In 2011 we  have therefore chosen to allocate our  resources on other purposes. We expect to measure the satisfac- tion of the retail customers again in  2012. Local community Rynkeby is located in the middle of  a residential area in Ringe on Funen.   Therefore we have to be very careful  to avoid nuisances such as noise and  smell. Of course we strive to avoid both  smell and noise. Nevertheless we  regret having been approached  concerning a too high noise level by a  resident in the neighbourhood. During  a visit to the resident we could estab- lish that something definitely needed  improvement! Now we are working  on reducing the noise from tankers  unloading raw materials in order to  make the citizen content again. Rynkeby takes up a lot of space in  First aid 2011 was the year when Rynkeby  acquired a heart starter and sent  12 employees on a heart starter  course. Furthermore 15 have at- tended a first aid course for begin- ners (6 lessons) and 12 a course  for skilled participants (3 lessons). In 2012 we will offer first aid  courses with heart starter  for  both skilled participants and  beginners. Work environment In 2011 Rynkeby experienced a  reduction of working accidents –  from six to five compared to the year  before. A contemporary increase of  close to situations, i.e. situations  in which it could have gone wrong,  attests to an alert and active secu- rity work. The target for 2012 is No  accidents – among other things by  means of a continued focus on close  to situations. year Minor accidents Working accidents Recorded accidents Close to 18 2010 62 2011 19 12 0 0   6 5 Work presence Also in 2011 Rynkeby had a good  development in the work presence  rate which was 96.8% against 96.0%  the year before.

In 2011 we handed out sponsor- ships amounting to approx. 200,000  DKK for various sports events and/or  events for children.  a new activity: Clocking out with  Smileyes. The employee signed with a  happy, a neutral or a grumpy smiley  – depending on how good or bad the  day had been. In 2012 we will follow  up on our efforts to increase the job  satisfaction at Rynkeby. 95.1 96.0 96.8 97.0 2014 Target To be  measured  in 2012 target  11 Topic: Health FocuS area:  ConSuMeRS In 2010 we asked ourselves the question: Can Rynkeby make  Denmark healthier? We believed that, and we still do. We  have had the clear intention to inform the consumers that  juice is 100% fruit with no sugar added. During the first half  of 2011 we showed our Rynkeby advertising film on TV. The  purpose of the film is among other things to inform the con- sumers that juice is 100% fruit – and that no sugar is added.  Furthermore we use signs in the stores with the same message. As appears from the below figures  Rynkeby succeeded in increasing the  knowledge of the Danes that juice is  100% fruit. Because of the heavily  increasing fruit prices we have not  had the financial option of showing  the Rynkeby advertising film during  the second half of 2011, and unfor- tunately the knowledge by the Danes  has dropped again. We plan to show the film again at the  beginning of 2012 and increase the  knowledge of the Danes that juice  is 100% fruit and that no sugar is  added. Prevention of teeth damages As mentioned elsewhere in this report  we have, in cooperation with the  Danish dentist society and  others, presented good information of  how to take care of your teeth when  consuming sour drinks. In August  2011 the chief dentist Ulla Pallesen  gave a number of good advice about  dental care on our website. It is not  possible to avoid aciferous foodstuff  and drinks. But you can avoid drinking  51% of the consumers believe that sugar/additives are added to juice (consumer test) 12% of the consumers believe that Rynkeby juice is 100% fruit (consumer test) 21% of the consumers believe that the Rynkeby 16 series is 100% fruit (consumer test) 22% of the consumers believe that the Rynkeby kologisk Juice (eco juice) is 100% fruit  (consumer test) 2014: 80% of all Danes know that juice is 100% fruit (consumer test) 2014: 80% of all Danes know that no sugar is added to juice (consumer test) 2010 FACTS FUTURE TARGETS 2011: 29% of all Danes know that no sugar is added to juice (consumer test) 2012: 33% of all Danes know that juice is 100% fruit (consumer test) 2011 FACTS from a glass of juice or soda over a  longer period of time, because the  more often the acid gets in contact  with the teeth the worse it is, says  Ulla Pallesen and adds the good piece  of advice: Besides, it is a very good  idea to use a straw because it reduces  the contact with the teeth. Salt We consume much too much salt  in comparison with the recommen- dations and the food industry bears a  big responsibility because 80% of the  salt we consume comes from manu- factured food. Danish men consume  approx. 10 g per day and women 7-8  g. But we should not consume more  than max. 6 g. Of course Rynkebys vegetable juice  is filled with vegetables, but, we are  sorry to say, also with quite some salt.  As the salt content in one glass was 1.9 g we decided to reduce the  amount of salt added as much as  possible. The result was that in cooperation  with a supplier we were able to reduce  the salt content by 70%! Now the  consumers can drink vegetable juice  with an even better conscience and  Rynkeby contributes to an annual  reduction of the Danish salt consump- tion of approx. 2.1 tons.  It is very  difficult to change the contents in  a juice as juice is regulated through  legislation. But we keep continuously  informed on health and new chances  to improve the national health.  Dentist advises: Use a straw. Salt now makes up a smaller part of  Rynkeby vegetable juice. We now save  the Danes for approx. 2 tons a year.  12 Topic: Health In the strategy plan of Rynkeby Foods and in our CSR policy  (social responsibility) our targets are very clearly to support  and inspire the employees into a healthy lifestyle. We do that  because we believe that the healthier we are, the more power  we hold, and the bigger commitment we get in our everyday  lives. Rynkeby will gain from this and the employee will have a  better, healthier and longer life course. Therefore: A younger  Rynkeby. FocuS area:  A YounGeR RYnkebY 2011 was the year when the em- ployees of Rynkeby were cycling,  walking, swimming and exercising in  every possible sport like never before.  Health activities were high on the  agenda and the target was clear: We  should all have a healthy and younger  body. In February 2010 all employees were  offered a health examination includ- ing a so-called BodyAge, a physical  test telling you how old our body is  compared to our actual age. The point competition We called our new health topic A  Younger Rynkeby and made a volun- tary team competition in which you  could gather points each month by  exercising in different kinds of sports.  Each month a winning team was  elected and great enthusiasm and  competition was found in the teams  entered. 75% - or 172 Rynkeby employees  distributed on 16 teams - signed up  for A Younger Rynkeby. The bodyAge competition Another part of A Younger Rynkeby  was the BodyAge competition in  which the signed-in teams were com- peting in the best improvement of his  or her BodyAge in the course of 2011. At the BodyAge measurement in  February 2011 the average age of the  team competitors was 41.9 whereas  their BodyAge was 43.7 years. This  means that we were 1.8 years too  old. At the BodyAge measurement  in February 2012 our actual age was  now 42.9 whereas the BodyAge was  43.0 years. That is a difference of 0.1  years and thus an improvement of  1.7 years. The two best teams had on  an average improved by 3.7 and 3.4  years respectively. Our intense focus on health through  the point and BodyAge competitions  has contributed to the fact that a lot  of Rynkeby employees have started  exercising and changing their food  habits and thereby making their life  style change in the right direction. big weight losses and  new life styles A third initiative of A Younger  Rynkeby was a weight loss course  for the overweight employees. 41  employees signed in for the course.  Not everyone completed the course  but on a total basis the team lost no  less than 358 kg! The weight course resulted in many  successful stories. As described in the  next page of this report, one of our  operators, 31-year-old Fadime lost 31  kg. At the other end of the age scale  our 68-year-old Erik Rasmussen could  enjoy a weigh loss of 19 kg and after  the course several other employees  could display a weight loss of more  than 20 kg. Sren Qvist, operator, lost over 20 kg  and improved his body age by 17 years  by means of attending the weight loss  course and by exercising.  13 DocuMeNTarY Fadime ztoprak, 31 years old  and employed in the factory  of Rynkeby, has lost a lot of  weight over the last year or  so. So much that people find it  difficult to recognize her when  meeting her in the street not  having seen her for a while. - Is it really you? They ask, says  Fadime.  Fadime has lost 31 kg! It has hap- pened since 31st March last year  when she started on a new health  activity together with colleagues. A  weight loss course which forms part  of the health programme A Younger  Rynkeby. The course ended in December last  year. It was held by AG Sundheds- fremme (a health promoting com- pany) and Birgit Kannegaard, clinical  dietitian, who kept the participants  on a short leash by making an ap- pointment with everyone about meet- ing every third week to be weighed.  - I find it very good. No doubt it is  easier to succeed when you have  someone else to answer for – says  another participant on the team,  Betty Andersen, receptionist, 55 years  old. She lost 22 kg. Changed food habits Primarily the course was based on  weight loss through changed food  habits in cooperation with the  clinical dietitian who brought some  good advice with her every time the  participants gathered. For instance  the advice could be to drink plenty  of water or to eat fresh pineapple in  order to stimulate combustion. Smaller portions Fadime explains her fabulous weight  loss by having eaten smaller portions  in general, by eating more vegetables  and meat with a very low fat content  and by refraining from white bread  and instead eating rye bread with a  high content of fibres. Her weight loss is exclusively due  to her new food habits. With three  children at the ages of two, four and  six years there has been no time or  strength left for forcing the weight  loss by exercising besides taking a  walk with the children during the  summer period, when working on day  shifts. On the whole Bettys weight loss  was achieved in the same way as  Fadimes: Something about focusing  on fat percentage and fibre content.  - I have been eating a lot of veg- etables. So much that I have almost  become dependent upon them. I like  vegetables and expect to continue  eating lots of them, she says. However, Betty has also exercised  a little on the side. Well, I am no  big exercising freak, but I have been  visiting the fitness centre once in a  while, and taken a walk or a bike ride  whenever the weather allowed it, she  says. Betty and Fadime both plan to con- tinue their weight losses. - When spring really gets going I will  try to lose another five or six kilos,  Betty says. Fadime: - I would like to lose an- other 5 kilos and will join again if the  company decides to continue offering  weight loss courses. A (even more) younger Rynkeby Fadime and Betty have attended the weight loss course at rynkeby and lost a lot of  weight. Now they want to lose even more. They are joining in on the way towards: Betty (to the left) has, as it appears, a view to the Arch of Triumph in Paris –  even if it is only as a big-sized photo. She herself can triumph with a minus of 22  kg. Fadime also feels much better with herself after her weight loss. Im much  more comfortable with my body now. Very much so. I am also in a much better  mood. The mere ability of fitting smaller clothes makes me happy, she says.

In the magazine we focused on  an ergonomics project which  forms an element of the health  programme for the employees  at Rynkeby. The programme started with a  pilot project in our warehouse  in September 2010 and was  followed in 2011 by a similar  project in our new drawing  plant. The project ended in  February 2012 and will be fol- lowed by a similar one in Pure- pak, our mixing and technical  departments ending in October.  Then the turn will come to the  office staff.  The project is focusing on the  working situation of the indi- vidual employee and will be fol- lowed by instructions, guidance  and training programmes. The ergonomics projects will  last for half a year. By Jens Agerholm, journalist For inscrutable reasons the respon- sibility for HR and health among the  employees is often placed with the  CFO of the company. When this is the  case discipline, as a principal rule,  is often facing hard circumstances  because economy gets a too high  priority. This is not the case at Rynke- by. According to Annette Trampe- dach, owner of AG Sundhedsfremme,  the reason for this is, that the CFO,  Poul Erik Nielsen, gives health an  unusually high priority. Annette is well-known and welcome  among the employees at Rynkeby.  Her company is leading and coor- dinating the external assistance to  some of the various health projects at  Rynkeby. This has been the case since  spring in 2009 when she made the  first health and hearing examinations  among the employees.  Besides the big personal commitment  by the financial manager, Annette  also points out the general support  to and involvement into the health  activities of the company given by the  management at Rynkeby. It definitely makes a difference. A lot  of companies may have many good  intentions but in case the manage- ment says: Just do it. You can spend  a certain amount of money and no  more then things will die slowly.  With the supply of health activities  Rynkeby is even going a step further  than presupposed in the legisla- tion which only demands health  examinations of employees working  for more than 300 hours a year be- tween 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. and hearing  examinations of employees exposed  to noise over 80 decibel, Annette  Trampedach says. Annette Trampedach is the owner of AG  Sundhedsfremme.

As is a tradition 2011 also had a  big attendance of employees to the  two races, which Rynkeby attends,  Sslettelbet and DHL-stafetten.  We have ambitious targets for the  number of participants and we still  have some way to go, but we believe  we can reach the targets. Creating unity You might rightly ask why we have a  target for attendance at these races.  The answer is quite simple: Meeting  outside working hours creates a good  unity among colleagues and at the  same time we invite to even more  exercise. We have chosen arrange- ments to which everybody can attend,  irrespective of exercise level. In 2011 we had another visit by Ole  Stougaard from Multitesta, former  triathlete on the national team,  teaching us the pose running tech- nique which is an particularly gentle  running technique. The arrangement  was free of charge and attracted 24  employees.  We also offer bike rides. During the  summer period Karsten Hansen, IT  administrator, and Arne Jrgensen,  project manager, have voluntarily  been arranging bike rides for begin- ners and advanced bikers. The bike  rides of 30-70 km have had the  consequence that employees who  had never before been bike exercising  were encouraged to try it, and the  employees who were going to attend  the bike race to Paris with Team  Rynkeby had a good guidance and  training.

As from 2011  also Barncancerfonden in Sweden is  supported. Team Rynkeby has been  biking to Paris every summer since  the premiere in 2002 and every year  the team has collected money for  Brnecancerfonden. Concurrently with the enlargement of  Team Rynkeby the amount collected  has also grown. When in 2011 Team  Rynkeby included teams from Sweden  as well, the bicycle team was also  able to favour Barncancerfonden, the  Swedish sister organization of Brne- cancerfonden.  In 2011, 31 Rynkeby employees  participated and on a total basis  584 racing cyclists and 139 service  people, distributed on 11 Danish and  two Swedish teams, collected approx.  8.8 mio. DKK to Brnecancerfonden  and 1.1 mio. SEK to Barncancerfon- den. Thus Team Rynkeby collected a  total of 9.772 mio. DKK for the fight  against cancer in children. In 2012  the collection will be devided so that  the 13 Danish teams of Team Rynke- by will collect money for Brnecan- cerfonden in Denmark whereas the  four Swedish teams will collect money  for Barncancerfonden in Sweden. As  a racing cyclist of Team Rynkeby you  are not only obliged to train suffi- ciently and to take part in the social  life connected with the team but also  to make an effort to provide money  for Brnecancerfonden and Barncan- cerfonden.  The money collected by Team Rynke- by and handed over to Brnecan- cerfonden and Barncancerfonden is  spent very carefully on projects from  which, in the opinion of the two or- ganizations, children with cancer and  their families will benefit the most.   The focus areas comprise research,  information and patient support. The participants of Team Rynkeby are  jogging cyclists of both sexes, of all  ages and with totally different jobs,  educations and backgrounds. The dif- ference between the participants and  their geographical distribution in both  Denmark and Sweden makes it easier  for Team Rynkeby to spread the word  about the collection to the advantage  for children with cancer and their  families.

FocuS area:  SCIenCe Together with other companies and  a number of research institutions  Rynkeby attended the research pro- ject Step by step changes of  childrens preferences towards  healthier foods.  The project is very extensive and pri- marily Rynkeby has cooperated with  Institut for Fdevarer (Institute for  Foodstuff) at the University of Aarhus  on how optimizing of taste and the  presen-tation of healthy food can in- fluence children to eat healthier. One  of the conclusions of the research  project is that changes must be  introduced gradually because too big  changes at the same time will result  in a loss of the childrens preferences.  Furthermore the results show that the  more often children are presented to  a new kind of food the more recogniz- able it will become and the more they  will feel like eating it.  Rynkeby still attends the research  project SENSWELL (Sensory food  satisfaction in promoting healthy  and sustainable eating behaviour)  focusing on how sensory qualities in  food and eating environment can be  utilized to reduce the food consump- tion and at the same time give satiety  and comfort, both during and after a  meal. The project is expected to end  in 2014.  In addition the product developers  at Rynkeby take part in Network for  new sweeteners. The overall idea of  this network is to oblige the consumer  wishes for healthy and natural pro- ducts. This is why new natural  energy neutral sweeteners are exam- ined as a replacement to the added  sugar and the artificially produced  sweeteners traditionally added to  our food. In 2011 the focus has been  centered around the plant Stevia.  17 Topic: Environment and climate FocuS area:  eleCtRICItY ConSuMptIon There are several reasons why elec- tricity consumption at Rynkeby  declined in 2011. Among them are: n We use less electricity for our pro- duction of air/steam for our manu- facturing processes after investing in  less energy demanding compressors  in 2010.  n We have increased the line ef- ficiency – i.e. less non-planned halts  in which the pasteurizing plant and  other equipment is stopped and uses  electricity and steam in vain. The  increase of efficiency is among other  things due to the production having  focused intensively on the possi- bilities of avoiding unintentional  halts through LEAN processes with  involvement by employees, including  operator courses on machine com- prehension and payment according to  LEAN principles, and n that the number of product  changes has declined from 90 to  75-80 due to our simplification of the  product assortment and thus bigger  series in the production. Rynkebys  target is to obtain a 10% reduction  of the electricity consumption before  2014. In their efforts to reach the  goal our production management is  implementing new energy measure- ments – a kind of thermographic  measurements – in our production  lines. The purpose of the measure- ments is to uncover the concrete  location of consumption on the  individual line and thus be able to  define where to start digging deeper  in the efforts for a further reduction  of the electricity consumption.  Among other things estimates have  been made on the possible use of  diode bulbs, i.e. low energy bulbs, but  for the time being this will have to  wait until a thorough analysis of the  total electricity consumption is avail- able – and thus a basis for an assess- ment of where to spend the money  best in the future in order to save on  the electricity bill. tHe WASte WAteR 59,96 Kwh  ENVIRONMENTAL TARgETS Packaging waste, of packaging consumption CO2 consumption* Raw material loss, of raw material consumption Electricity consumption* Waste water* 2009 result 2010 result 2011 result  2014 target  10% per litre produced 60.9 Kwh  0.983 m3  17.46 kg  2.44 % 1.45 % 57.11 Kwh  0.937 m3  17.46 kg  2.07 % 1.25 % 10% per litre produced 14.56 Kg 30% per litre produced 1.05 % 59.96 Kwh  0.941 m3  16.18 kg  2.86 % 2.07 % *per ton product In 2011 Rynkeby Foods reduced electricity consumption, waste  water emission and packaging and raw material loss even  more. This partly because we could harvest the fruits of our  investments in the factory the year before, partly because we  succeeded in increasing the line efficiency – i.e. the time of the  total operating time in which the machines are running – in  close cooperation between the production management and  the employees. The progress in exploiting the raw materials  was so high that already last year we reached the 2014 target  figure for loss of raw materials. Rynkebys decreasing emission of  waste water is primarily due to our  reduction of product assortment by  approx. 25%.  The reduction means  that the number of mixtures in the  production has decreased from 90 to  approx. 75 a week. Smaller number of  mixtures means less processes with  water, including rinsing and cleaning,  and thus less emission of waste water  to the water treatment plant.  Changed behavior The reduction of waste water is also  due to a change of the behavior in  which the factory otherwise uses  water. Among other things the focus  has been on where in the production  juice is being spilt – for instance when  changing products. In this connection  it is important to collect the product  remnants for reuse in order to avoid  that they end up in and strains the  water treatment plant of the factory.  A small thing like using flushing points  on the water hoses is also among  the behavior-wise contributors to the  reduction of waste water. Rinsing with water is enough Forward-looking the production will  contribute to an even cleaner en- vironment by changing the routines  when cleaning the mixing tanks. Till  now the factory has been running a  big cleaning process with cleaning  detergent between each individual  mixture. However, it has turned out  that you can actually run an efficient  rinsing with water and run the long  cleaning process with longer intervals  without getting a negative effect  on the product quality. This initia- tive will, however, affect the water  consumption to a minor degree, but  to a higher degree it will affect the  consumption of cleaning detergents  and thus it will also be an environ- mental gain.   18 Topic: Environment and climate RAW MAteRIAl loSS With the rapidly increasing prices of  raw materials in recent years there  is – besides the overall environmen- tal considerations – a special reason  for Rynkeby to locate and close the  causes for loss of raw materials in our  production. To a big extent we suc- ceeded in this in 2011 when the 2014  target figure was also achieved. The smaller loss of raw materials is  primary due to the production having invested in so-called pipe pigs, i.e.  plastic plugs which are pushed  through the pipe when the draw- ing from the water tank is over. This  Co2 After an increase from 2009 to 2010  Rynkeby succeeded in bringing down  the CO2 from 2010 to 2011. 2014  target is a reduction of CO2 by 10%  per litre produced. The amount  of CO2 comes especially from the  natural gas consumption for produc- ing steam for the pasteurizing plant.   Forward-looking the reduction of  CO2 is to a high degree expected to  be obtained by even more operating  time on the existing production lines  and by investment in machines with  a higher speed and thus smaller con- sumption of steam per litre drawn. Before taking a stand on further ini- tiatives the production management  is awaiting a more exact knowledge  on where and how to reduce the gas  consumption with the biggest effect  in connection with the coming ther- mographic measurements of the  individual production lines. pACkAGInG WASte During 2011 Rynkeby has experien- ced a good development in the con- sumption of packaging – in the form  of less waste. This is also partly due to a smaller  product assortment with less changes  in the production but for instance also  due to the fact, that a lot of focus has  been on which production method is  resulting in the smallest amount of  waste. In principle, the production  has two methods at its disposal. One  is using the so-called roll feeds, which  are made into cartons by the machine  itself. The other one is using so-called  blanks which are ready-carved and  folded cartons and the machines are  only folding the bottom and the top  during filling. As it has turned out that  DRIVInG Rynkeby is also focusing on driving  and wants, among other things, to  examine whether the choice of tyres  for the cars might have an effect on  the driving/fuel consumption and  to discuss whether the selling staff  should have environmentally-friendly  company cars. the roll feed method causes the big- gest waste of packaging the factory is  now to a higher extent producing on  machines using blanks. Furthermore the factory has been  focusing a lot on the reasons for  waste of packaging as a result of  machine problems and on the pos- sibilities of preventing them by means  of a dialogue with the machine sup- pliers. The focus on production methods,  operating disturbances and – not  the least – a big involvement from  the employees, which is also encour- aged by LEAN payment – are the  most important reasons why, in fact,  the factory already in 2011 reached  the 2014 target figure for packaging  waste. solution has the effect that the  production is sure to get most of the  juice out – either during the drawing  process or in some barrels in which  the surplus juice is stored and used in  new mixtures. In a close cooperation between the  laboratory and the production staff a  new system has also been implement- ed which makes it possible to get the  remnants of the barrels out without  conflicting with quality or durability. Forward-looking the plan is to mini- mize the loss of raw materials further  by exploiting a new and more exact  measuring equipment to ensure that  the production can save concentrate  by getting closer to the balance be- tween the water disappearing when  the concentrate is steamed in and  the water spent when adding water  to the concentrate again in order to  turn it into juice. It is a legal demand  that the amount of water must be  the same – therefore there has been a  tendency to add a little more concen- trate in order to be quite sure to ob- serve the legislation. Furthermore Rynkeby plans to rebuild  some of the pots in the pasteurizing  plant and to invest in more pipe pigs. The factory collects and sells packaging for reuse, says production manager Magnus  Stefansson (in picture).  19 Global Compact HuMAn RIGHtS  1.
