Rising fuel and fertilizer  import costs and a worsening energy  crisis continued to batter the macro- economy. Foreign currency reserves  suff ered from weak foreign aid fl ows  and sluggish overseas remittances  –  all of which resulted in uncomfortably  high interest rates  and spiraling  infl ation and, ultimately, serious  depreciation of the Bangladeshi Taka.  With few new viable investment  opportunities in the industrial sector  and cost of funds sky-rocketing, the  Non-Banking Financial Institution  sector faced signifi cant growth  challenges. Even in this backdrop,  IDLCs traditional loans and deposit  business grew satisfactorily.   Over the past 27 years, while growing  into one of Bangladeshs blue-chip  companies, IDLC has, at all times,  remained true to its core values : its  corporate ethics are grounded in  transparency, statutory compliance  and good governance, and it is  committed to all stakeholders –  employees, clients, regulators,  shareholders, and the larger  community. The companys strength  is derived from the partnerships with  its clientele across the country, the  guidance of its Board of Directors and  the eff orts of its most professional  and sincere staff .  In 2011, IDLC reviewed its CSR  (Corporate Social Responsibility)  policies, and decided to shift focus  from traditional philanthropic  activities such as charities and  donations to the implementation  of sustainable business strategies  and initiatives that would create  value for stakeholders in the  long run. The company became  members of the United Nations  Global Compact (UNGC), the United  Nations Environment Programme  Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the  Bangladesh CSR Centre, and also  underwent a number of policy and  structural changes to incorporate  these sustainability strategies into its  core operations.  We began focusing on community  development initiatives while  adopting a number of projects aimed  at environmental management. We  also began off ering our own staff   members opportunities to voluntarily  participate in such initiatives and  make a diff erence. Our experience  over the past couple of years leads us  to believe that there is an acute lack  of awareness in Bangladesh regarding  how sustainable business practices  can and should be integrated into  an organizations core values and  everyday operations. Going forward,  we plan to help create this awareness  among both our own staff  members  and our external stakeholder groups.  Selim R.F. Hussain CEO and Managing Director  IDLC Finance Limited STATEMENT OF CEO AND MANAGING DIRECTOR We take responsibility for our own actions,  and we will ensure that we positively impact all our  stakeholders, the environment and the overall community.  6 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011   REPORTING PARAMETERS  Reporting Period  January 1, 2011 – December 31, 2011  Reporting Cycle  Annual  Most Recent Previous Report Communication on Progress, 2010, dated May 2011 and submitted to UN Global  Compact Contact Person Zurat Haque Manager, CSR Department IDLC Finance Limited Tel: +880-2-8834990, Ext 178 Cell: +880-1713-047-075 Email: zurat@idlc.com Report Boundary   This report covers strategic decisions and activities of IDLC  Group, i.e. IDLC Finance Limited and its two subsidiaries,  IDLC Investments Limited and IDLC Securities Limited in  2011, that support responsible and sustainable business  practices.

PORTFOLIO DISTRIBUTION   IDLC off ers various fi nancial services catering to the  unique requirements of small, medium and large  industries (segregated as per industry defi nition of  Bangladesh Bank). Starting from 2011, Small industries  were further classifi ed into Micro and Small industries. CORPORATE  GOVERNANCE AND STATUTORY  COMPLIANCE Corporate governance is the system by which companies  are directed and controlled by the management in the  best interest of all the stakeholders, thereby ensuring  greater transparency and better and timely fi nancial  reporting. Maintaining an eff ective, dynamic and business-focused  Corporate Governance mechanism, along with a culture  of openness and accountability, is the key priority of  IDLCs Board of Directors. IDLC strives to excel in the  best governance practices through independent and  distinct roles for diff erent committees, and continuously  reviews and improves  Corporate Governance policies  and practices to ensure ongoing transparency of the  companys operations and delivery of quality information  to the stakeholder groups.  IDLC ensures that its Corporate Governance practices  comply with all aspects of Bangladesh Banks DFIM  Circular No. 7 dated September 25, 2007, and the SEC  Notifi cation No. SEC/CMMRRCD/2006-158/Admin/02-08  dated February 20, 2006.  Moreover, we also believe that the basic form of corporate  responsibility for any organization is to abide by the laws,  rules and regulations of the country in which it operates,  and IDLC is a standard bearer in terms of statutory  compliance in the fi nancial sector of Bangladesh. 12.3% 9.4% 7.5% 6.2% 6.1% 5.6% 5.5% 4.7% 4.3% 4.5% 4.3% 3.9% 3.4% 3.3% 2.9% 2.6% 13.4% Chart 3.1 Sectoral Exposure (December 2011) Food and Beverage Apparels & Accessories Transport Housing & Real Estate Pharmaceuticals Household Products Service Financial Services Power & Energy Iron & Steel Building Materials Telecommunications Paper & Paper Products Textiles Local Textiles Export IT Others Chart 3.2: Breakdown of Portfolio (in %) 2009 2010 2011 Micro Small  Medium Large 25 14 61 30 17 53 30 19 17 53  19 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  ANTI-CORRUPTION  POLICIES AND PRACTICES IDLC has a dedicated Internal Control and Compliance  (ICC) Department for maintaining a transparent system,  while preventing/solving incidents of corruption within  the Group. This is ensured through periodic audits of  each division and branch, in addition to regulatory and  statutory audits respectively by Bangladesh Bank and  statutory auditor. Moreover, commitment from the  employees is required to maintain a workplace free from  corruption. ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY IDLC maintains a Zero-Tolerance Policy with regard  to incidences of corruption or malpractice within the  organization. In case of identifi cation of any such incident  through periodic audits or any other means, a thorough  investigation is undertaken against the accused, and  if proven responsible, the person is either charged for  monetary compensation or is terminated with immediate  eff ect. FUTURE PLAN: WHISTLE-BLOWING  GUIDELINE   IDLC is introducing Whistle-Blowing Guideline by the  fi rst quarter of 2012, with the objective of:       Establishing a formal channel for employees to  report malpractices within the organization, which  may not be detected through formal audits, and       Providing protection to the whistle-blowers within  the organization  The approved Policy will be disseminated across the  Group to make employees aware of their rights and  responsibilities in this regard.   RISK-BASED AUDITING In 2011, IDLC introduced Risk-based Auditing (RBA) to its  internal audit system, focusing on key risk areas that may  result in non-compliance with internal policies, procedures  and regulatory requirements.    After identifi cation of the risk areas, risk-based audit  checklists are prepared to develop an action plan and  reduce impact of the risk areas, while major risk indicators  are identifi ed to form a basis for better risk control and  management in future. ICC Department, in collaboration  with respective departments, is responsible for the audit  process.   OBJECTIVES      Identify risk-oriented areas considering the  probability of the occurrence/non-compliance and  its impact   Ensure companys focus on emerging risks that are  not yet well managed    Adopt appropriate risk-mitigation strategies Risk-based auditing is conducted twice a year in case of  high-risk areas, and once a year in case of moderate or  low risk areas. Table 3.1 shows the status of conducting  departmental and branch audits: Table 3.1: Risk-based Auditing Status  Departmental  Audits Branch  Audits Audits completed in 2011 12 9 Audits planned in 2012 24 17 FUTURE PLAN: INTRODUCTION OF GUEST  AUDITORS    Introduction of Guest Auditors has been proposed, who  will provide a third-party view to set up detailed audit  criteria for extraordinary cases and thus add value to  IDLCs existing audit system. However, this is a relatively  new concept in Bangladesh, and will only be adopted if  proven feasible for IDLC.      PREVENTION OF MONEY LAUNDERING AND  TERRORIST FINANCING   IDLC adopts strict measures to discourage involvement  in activities such as money laundering and terrorist  fi nancing, in compliance with Money Laundering  Prevention Act 2009 and Anti Terrorism Act 2009 of  Bangladesh Bank. These are also integrated in our core risk  management system.   Major initiatives taken in this regard are:    As per regulatory directives, IDLC introduced its own  policy to prevent money laundering and terrorist  fi nancing, comprising of KYC (Know Your Customer)  guidelines that form a part of IDLCs Credit Policy.  >  Applicable for all individual and institutional  clients for both asset and liability products.  >  Business units must consider KYC criteria while  establishing business relation with a new  client. Detailed reporting is done at the time of  preparing project appraisals.    20 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011   >  Customers proper identity, profi le of controlling  shareholders and authenticity of source of funds  are the key areas that are looked into.  >  Additional due diligence is conducted in case  of Public Figures and Associates, and Politically  Exposed Persons.    Proper screening and background checking of  candidates is performed during recruitment.    Extensive training is provided to employees for  identifi cation, prevention and avoidance of such  issues.

As such, IDLC continuously adopts latest  and more user-friendly technologies as the key to achieve  excellence.   INTRODUCTION OF CORE BANKING  SOFTWARE In 2011, IDLC introduced Oracle Flexcube UBS, one of  the top Core Banking Softwares (CBS) worldwide, for  conducting its day-to-day operations and transactions in  a more effi  cient and timely manner. IDLC is proud to be  the fi rst-ever NBFI in Bangladesh to have a core banking  platform, along with only a few other top-tier scheduled  banks, while being the fastest-ever CBS implementer in  Bangladesh. FLEXCUBE went live in January 2012  CORPORATE SOCIAL  RESPONSIBILITY  (CSR) AND IDLC                                   CHAPTER 4  22 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011   At IDLC, we believe that the basic diff erence between  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate  Philanthropy is in terms of the nature and scope of their  activities. Philanthropy is only one-time contributions from the  companys after-tax profi ts, with no long-term objective,  whereas CSR is thoroughly integrated in an organizations  core values and activities, requiring responsible practices  from the organization to achieve the desired outcome.   CSR can be more suitably defi ned as a self-regulating  mechanism that helps an organization assume  responsibility for its own actions and decisions,  with limited, if no negative impact on the economy,  environment and surrounding community, i.e., CSR helps  a company become responsible and sustainable in the  long-run. INTRODUCING CSR AT  IDLC  IDLC is well regarded for its contributions to  environmental and community development in the past  years. Starting from 2010, IDLC renewed this commitment  to create shared value for its stakeholder groups,  environment and the broader community as part of its  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). MEMBERSHIPS  IDLC became members of a number of local and global  initiatives in late 2010 to conduct its CSR activities as per  globally acceptable standards:     UNGC (United Nations Global Compact), promoting  sustainable practices in the areas of Human Rights,  Labor, Environment and Anti-corruption (www. unglobalcompact.org)    UNEPFI (United Nations Environment Programme  Finance Initiative), promoting environmentally  responsible practices among fi nancial institutions  worldwide (www.unepfi .org)    CSR Centre, promoting the concept of CSR among  the corporate houses in Bangladesh, while acting as  the local network of UNGC (csrcentre-bd.org)  STRUCTURAL REFORMS    A dedicated CSR Department was formed in 2011 for a  more structured and focused approach to CSR. A CSR  Committee has also been proposed comprising of the CEO  and Managing Director, Chief Financial Offi  cer, Head of  Credit Risk Management, and Head of Human Resource  Department of IDLC.   CSR GUIDELINE  A CSR Guideline was introduced in 2011, defi ning the  scope and mode of IDLCs CSR activities in future, as  detailed below:    ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICE >  Corporate Governance, Statutory Compliance  and Transparency: to maintain the highest level  of corporate governance, statutory compliance,  and transparency at all stages of business  decision, operation and communication – for  which IDLC is highly regarded in the fi nancial  sector of Bangladesh.   >  Non-discrimination: to provide equal  opportunities to all our employees, irrespective  of their age, gender, race, religion, ethnicity,  physical attributes etc.  >  Employee Health and Safety:  to secure a  healthy and safe work environment for our  employees, while off er competitive remuneration  packages and benefi t schemes, and arrange  awareness sessions, training programs etc.  >  Product Responsibility: to be responsible at  all times by avoiding direct or indirect negative  impact caused by our products and services  on our stakeholders, environment and the  community.    COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT  >  Education, Healthcare and Sustainable  Livelihood: to spread the benefi ts of education,  healthcare and sustainable livelihood among the  underprivileged section of our community.  >  Disaster Management: to provide basic  necessities and rehabilitation facilities to the  victims of natural calamities.   >  Social Issues: to advocate for various social  issues benefi ting certain groups of people and/or  the entire nation.   Philanthropy is what we do with our  money, whereas CSR is how we are  making that money. CSR integrates the three Ps of People,  Planet and Profi t to meet the present  needs without compromising the needs  of the future generation.  23 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011    ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP   >  Environmental Risk Management (ERM): to  control and minimize environmental risks in  projects fi nanced by IDLC.    >  Environment-friendly Technologies: to adopt  environment-friendly technologies and promote  companies introducing such technologies in  Bangladesh.  >  Preservation of Resources: to trigger  responsible behavior among our employees, as  well as external stakeholder groups, for effi  cient  and responsible utilization of resources.   >  Waste Management: to contribute to better  waste management, following the three  principles of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.   >  Renewable Energy: to fi nance projects  introducing or commercializing alternative and/ or renewable energy technologies in Bangladesh  as a solution to our growing energy defi ciency.    Activities in the above areas will be undertaken in the  following modes:  *Although IDLC is gradually moving away from philanthropic  activities, the impact of charities and donations in the lives  of underprivileged people cannot be completely denied in  a developing country like Bangladesh. Therefore, a certain  portion of IDLCs budget each year will be dedicated to various  philanthropic deeds. CSR INVESTMENTS  Chart 4.1 summarizes utilization of funds specifi cally  allocated for CSR activities in 2011. The chart shows that  major portion of our CSR Budget in 2011 was utilized in  carrying out various philanthropic activities. Scope of Work in Future   To better utilize our limited resources, IDLC is gradually  moving away from direct charities and donations, and  focusing more on initiatives having potential for long-term  value creation, and requiring more involvement of our  stakeholder groups, especially our employees and clients. EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION   In 2011, IDLCs main commitment was to create awareness  among its employees regarding better and more  responsible practices.  As such, IDLCs CSR Department  conducted an orientation session for employees across  diff erent branches of the Group, focusing on the following  aspects:      Diff erence between Corporate Philanthropy and  Corporate Social Responsibility    Defi nition of a sustainable business    Relevance and benefi ts of environmentally and  socially responsible practices in the context of a  fi nancial institution    Local and global sustainability initiatives   CSR commitment, strategy and focus of IDLC    CSR initiatives undertaken till now, and    Role of each employee in gaining this objective    Table 4.1: CSR Orientation Sessions in 2011 Completed Sessions up to February 2012 12 Trainers  4 Trainer Hours 24 Trainees  252 Trainee Hours  252 Remaining Sessions* 6 * The remaining sessions will be completed by the second quarter of 2012         MODE OF ACTIVITIES  Charies and Donaons * Projects and Campaigns  Employee Volunteering Training and Awareness  Sponsorship  Chart 4.1: CSR Investments in 2011 Donations  43% Environmental Initiatives 25% Community Projects 32% FUTURE PLAN: CSR ORIENTATION FOR NEW RECRUITS  IDLC plans to include CSR as part of the orientation  program for new recruits.

OUR PEOPLE –  OUR RESOURCES CHAPTER 5  25 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  WORK ENVIRONMENT IDLC off ers challenging career options for young and  competent professionals. We nurture young talents from  the leading business schools, who can bring new ideas  and skills on board, and contribute to a dynamic and ever- innovating work environment. IDLC maintains an open workplace culture where  employees are free to share their ideas and opinions.  Employees have easy access to the senior management at  all times for their advice and guidance.

IDLC aims to ensure equal opportunities for all its  employees, irrespective of their age, gender, race, religion,  ethnicity, physical characteristics or any other attributes.  Employees are recruited and assessed solely on the basis  of their merit and performance. Moreover, IDLC also  encourages recruitment of people from diff erent places,  cultures and backgrounds, especially  at branches located  in diff erent areas, to create a more diversifi ed and dynamic  environment across the Group. Non-discrimination at  all levels of human resource management has been  integrated in IDLCs core values and is a part of employee  Code of Conduct. In this regard, IDLCs prime focus has  been to ensure Gender Neutrality across the Group.  IDLC provides a competitive career prospect for female  employees, while off ering them a comfortable work  environment and opportunity to maintain work-life  balance through facilities such as fl exible working hours,  maternity benefi ts, discrimination and harassment-free  environment etc.  Here it should be mentioned that although gender  neutrality is IDLCs prime focus for non-discrimination,  IDLC does not have any specifi c target for male-female  ratio across the Group. This is because IDLCs topmost  priority is to recruit and retain the best performers in  the industry to sustain superior service quality at all  times.  DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TRAINING PROGRAMS IDLC off ers a wide range of training programs and workshops for both personal and professional development of  its employees. Training needs are identifi ed mainly through Performance Appraisal process, while Training Need  Assessments are conducted occasionally through IDLCs local training partner.

Provisions regarding maternity leave  and other benefi ts are covered in IDLCs Human Resource  (HR) Manual, which is complied with throughout the  Group.  Female employees are given maternity leave for four (4)  months, as per industry practice, and are entitled to full  salary and other benefi ts packages throughout the entire  duration of the leave. EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND  SAFETY   WORKPLACE SAFETY    A safe, healthy and hygienic work environment is  maintained at all branches of the IDLC Group. Suffi  cient  lighting and other utilities, air-conditioning and separate  toilet facilities are provided for the comfort of its  employees during work.      Moreover, all the branches are adequately equipped with  fi re-fi ghting equipments and fi re drills are arranged at  regular intervals to prepare employees in the event of any  fi re hazard. EMPLOYEE VACCINATION  A vaccination program was arranged at IDLCs Corporate  Head Offi  ce on December 14, 2011, for the employees and  their family members, for prevention against Hepatitis B  and Cervical Cancer. An awareness session had also been  arranged earlier at IDLC to inform the employees of the  causes, prevention and treatment measures against these  diseases.  Hepatitis B is an infectious disease of the liver, caused  by the Hepatitis B virus, transmitted from exposure to  infectious blood or body fl uids, tears, saliva etc. Acute  Chart 5.12: Employee  Loan Facilities* (in BDT Mln) 117.34 2009 2010 2011 30.37 47.68 *Based on employee Home Loan,  Transport Loan and Personal Loan facilities Chart 5.13: Employee  Support Scheme**(in BDT Mln) 2009 2010 2011 1.03 0.17 1.58 **Based on employee Educational Support  Scheme and Employee Welfare Fund Charts 5.12 and 5.13 show IDLCs year-on-year contribution to major employee benefi t packages:   29 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  illness ultimately leads to death. Worldwide every 1 out of  3 people are infected by this virus, whereas 10-30 million  more people become infected every year. An estimated  1 million people die each year from Hepatitis B and its  complications.    Cervical Cancer is a very common type of cancer of the  uterus, occurring most commonly in women over the  age of 30. As per an estimate of WHO (World Health  Organization), at least 200,000 women worldwide die  of Cervical Cancer each year, whereas many more are  diagnosed with it.       The vaccines were provided by authorized service  providers for GlaxoSmithKline, one of the largest  pharmaceutical companies in the world. Follow-up  sessions are also being arranged accordingly at IDLC  premises. INSURANCE COVERAGE  All permanent employees of IDLC are entitled to receive  both Life Insurance and Hospitalization Insurance  coverage during their stay at IDLC, securing both  the employees and their families in the event of any  unfortunate occurrence.   FUTURE PLAN: ROAD SAFETY  TRAINING   Lack of basic road safety awareness has become  a major concern in Bangladesh in recent times.  As per an offi  cial estimate of Bangladesh Road  Transport Authority (BRTA), around 3,500 people  are killed from nearly 4,100 road accidents every  year. However, the actual number is assumed to be  a lot higher.  Structural and infrastructural fl aws of the roads  and highways, fl awed vehicles, reckless driving  by unskilled and unlicensed drivers, jaywalking  pedestrians, and disregard to traffi  c rules are  mainly responsible for the worsening situation.   As part of its commitment to employee safety, IDLC  is arranging an awareness session in 2012 on Basic  Road Safety for the personal car drivers of IDLC  employees and pool car drivers of IDLC. OTHER ASPECTS OF HR  MANAGEMENT  LEAVE FACILITIES   IDLC employees are entitled to twenty-fi ve (25) working  days of Annual Leave and 5 days of Casual Leave every  year, receiving full salary and other benefi t packages  during the leave. Female employees are off ered maternity  leaves and benefi ts, as mentioned above, in addition to  these leave facilities.  NOTICE PERIOD   Both IDLC and the employees are required to provide a  notice period of at least one (1) month in the event of any  termination, change of responsibility or job switch.    GRIEVANCE MECHANISM  IDLC does not have any dedicated grievance policy or  mechanism in place to address such issues. However,  it follows an open-door policy where employees can  always inform the HR Department regarding any act of  discrimination, harassment and/or other ill treatments  within the organization. EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION  IDLC focuses on a dynamic HR process with the objective  of attracting and retaining the best people in the industry,  and developing a skilled, competitive and motivated  workforce. The signifi cant reduction in employee turnover  rate over the years refl ects employee satisfaction at IDLC.    Chart 5.14: Employee Turnover Rate 2009 2010 2011 14.18% 13.38% 11.25% IDLC plans to introduce a specifi c  Grievance Policy across the Group in  2012  ENVIRONMENTAL  STEWARDSHIP CHAPTER 6  31 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  To become environmentally responsible, every  organization should assume responsibility for their own  actions and decisions, and accordingly minimize or control  negative environmental impacts directly or indirectly  resulting from their operations.    In 2011, IDLC focused on the following areas to improve its  own environmental performance:     Awareness creation among stakeholder groups    Adoption of environment-friendly technologies   Streamlining own operations to become more  environmentally responsible ENVIRONMENTAL RISK  MANAGEMENT To control direct or indirect impacts on the environment  by the projects we fi nance, IDLC has incorporated  Environmental Risk Management (ERM) Guidelines of  Bangladesh Bank. The Guidelines off er one General  and 10 sector-specifi c checklists to identify and assess  environmental risks associated with projects, rating  them as High, Moderate or Low risk projects, based  on Environmental Factors external to the projects and  Environmental Management System of the borrower.  WHAT WE ARE DOING  The Department of Environment (DOE) has classifi ed all  sectors, based on possible impact on the environment  by their activities, into four categories: Green, Orange A,  Orange B and Red, with Red being the most polluting  sector(s). For projects representing Red sectors, business  units at IDLC are required to use sector-specifi c checklists  provided in the ERM Guidelines to assess environmental  implications of that particular project. If the risk-rating  is High, the proposal is then forwarded to the Board of  Directors for taking credit decision.     FUTURE REQUIREMENTS  IDLC believes that extensive training for all business units  and credit-assessment teams can play a crucial part to  get the best benefi t out of this process. At the same time,  mandatory implementation by all fi nancial institutions will  also ensure a level playing fi eld. RESPONSIBLE LENDING To promote environmentally responsible business  practices in the small-business segments, IDLC made  installation of ETP (Effl  uent Treatment Plant) in production  plants a pre-condition for disbursement in a couple of  projects. Moreover, IDLC also provided the required funds  for installation of the ETPs. However, only installation of the ETP is not enough.  Awareness and understanding, coupled with intervention  from respective government bodies, is required to achieve  success. ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY  TECHNOLOGIES  SERVER VIRTUALIZATION IDLC is gradually moving into a virtualized environment  for the servers, with the objective of capacity optimization,  cost reduction, reduced power consumptions by  servers and cooling systems, and reduced CO 2 emission,  ultimately leading to a greener IT infrastructure within the  organization.  Table 6.1 summarizes the results achieved over the years  due to implementation of this technology: At IDLC, we aim to bring in place better  standards, processes and  technologies, and to  work together with the clients to minimize or  mitigate environmental impacts of the projects.    32 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011   Table 6.1: Server Virtualization Particulars 2010 2011 2012  (Targeted) No of Physical Servers 28 27 22 No of Virtual Servers  (after consolidation and  virtualization)  2 11 30 Reduction in power  consumption (in kWh)* 14,000 77,000 210,000 Reduction in CO2  Emission (in tons)*  8 44 120 *Every server virtualized saves 7,000 kWh of electricity and 4 tons of CO2  emission per year VIDEO CONFERENCING To save travel time for the employees, all major branches  of IDLC Group are connected with Corporate Head Offi  ce  via video conferencing facility.

Rapid  population growth, urbanization and industrialization are  creating pressure on natural and national resources like  electricity, water, natural gas etc. In addition to limited  availability, lack of awareness among people regarding  effi  cient and responsible consumption of these resources  is creating an increasing gap between demand and  supply.   To play its part in securing a better environment, IDLC  took the initiative to promote more responsible practices  among its employees for effi  cient utilization of valuable  resources like electricity, water and paper.   The objective was to:    Create awareness among our employees, while  spread the message through them among their  families and friends to have a broader impact    Reduce electricity and paper consumption at IDLC by  at least 20% over a period of three months    Establish IDLC as an environmentally and socially  responsible brand  WHAT WE DID   Stickers and posters with relevant messages and  action items were placed across all branches of the  IDLC Group   These messages are regularly being used as  screensavers and wallpapers in PCs     CSR Department is conducting a CSR Orientation  program for the employees that covers a section on  responsible consumption practices     IDLCs IT Department is continuously adopting latest  and environment-friendly technologies (detailed  below) that is helping reduce both electricity and  paper consumption across the Group         33 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  Table 6.3: Paper Consumption Particulars July-11 Sep-11 Oct-11 Nov-11 Consumption  146,000 113,500 94,500 68,000 Reduction  Target 20% Reduction  achieved* - 22% 35% 53% Table 6.4: Electricity Consumption (in kWh) Particulars July-11 Sep-11 Oct-11 Nov-11 Consumption  83,146 81,447 75,913 64,359 Reduction  Target 20% Reduction  achieved* - 2% 9% 23% *Compared to baseline data of July, 2011 Note: The month of August has not been considered due to  limited working hours in observation of the holy month of  Ramadan Table 6.3 below summarizes the change in consumption pattern over a period of three months after implementation of  this initiative, across fi ve branches of IDLC Group.

Growing  population, along with increasing industrialization  and urbanization is mainly responsible for this rapid  deforestation, which is putting Bangladesh in one of the  most vulnerable positions with respect to climate change.   As part of our commitment to environmental protection,  IDLC sponsored a tree plantation event in the University of  Dhaka in August, 2011. The program formally inaugurated  the country-wide 160 million tree plantation campaign of  Mr. Musa Ibrahim, the fi rst Bangladeshi to conquer Mount  Everest.  Besides sponsoring the whole event, IDLC employees  also took part in planting 1,000 saplings in the University  premises.  FUTURE PLAN: AWARENESS AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN At IDLC, we believe that responsible practices aimed  at environment and community development requires  mass education and awareness, which should start very  early in a persons life. Families and later educational  institutions can play a major role here. To contribute to this process, IDLC is launching an  awareness campaign across diff erent schools. We will  target students between the age group of 12 to 14, who  will later spread the message across their schools.   In 2012, we have realistically targeted a maximum  of eight schools, including both government and  private schools.  In the campaign, we will mainly focus on:     Responsible utilization of resources like  electricity, water, gas, paper etc.    Importance of tree plantation for a  greener environment     Keeping our roads clean   Road safety measures     Community Service  35 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  FUTURE PLAN: CARBON  FOOTPRINT ANALYSIS IDLC is conducting Carbon Footprint Analysis on a  pilot basis in three of its branches, including the Head  Off cie  Carbon footprint is a measure of the Green House  Gases (GHG) emitted through day-to-day human and  organizational activities. Considering IDLCs nature  of operations as a fi nancial institution, seven major  sources have been identifi ed that are responsible for  GHG emission by IDLC:  Electricity  | Diesel (used in generators) | Octane |  CNG | Paper | Organic Waste | Air Travel Based on the emission data, calculated in tons  per year, per capita GHG emission in 2011 will be  determined and compared with the allowable limit/ national average for GHG emission in Bangladesh to  identify IDLCs position, and accordingly environment- friendly products and services, and internal and  external strategies will be developed to minimize  and/or neutralize this impact. The strategies and plans will be developed in  consultation with IDLCs core management personnel,  and training sessions will be arranged to facilitate the  implementation process.   An agreement was signed in this regard on January  22, 2012 with Waste Concern Consultants, a  leading consultancy fi rm in Bangladesh off ering  consultancy services and project assistance for  capacity development in the area of environmental  sustainability through better prevention, control and  management approaches.   The three-month long project is due to be completed  in May 2012.  CHAPTER 7 GIVING BACK TO   COMMUNITIES  37 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  In 2011, IDLC focused on community development through  partnerships by engaging its funds, organizational expertise  and resources. Employee volunteering hours and fund- raising activities were arranged on a number of occasions.  The objective was to create long-term value in the lives of  the people, instead of providing just one-time solutions. PARTNERING WITH LEADS In 2011, IDLC partnered with LEADS (Livelihood  Education and Development Services), an NGO working  for poverty reduction and sustainable social development  by improving livelihood skills of the poor community,  especially women and children.   LEADS provides better educational support to  underprivileged children enrolled in diff erent government  primary schools, while teaching them social and  moral values and responsible practices. Currently the  organization has a total of 39 children.   IDLC initially arranged a session at its Corporate Head  Offi  ce for its employees to interact with the children and  see their development. Some of the employees even  contributed fi nancially to help these children. The children at LEADS come from very low-income  families, and it often becomes very diffi  cult for their  parents to aff ord the basic necessities for their education.  Again, as most of the children live in slum areas, they  are also deprived of basic healthcare facilities, even pure  drinking water. All these combine to poor attendance of  the children in schools, ultimately resulting in dropouts.  As such, IDLC, in consultation with LEADS, donated items  such as books, schools copies, stationeries, school bags,  uniforms, computers etc. for facilitating education for the  children. Water fi lters and fi rst-aid boxes were also given  to their families to ensure basic healthcare facilities. LEADS  also signed agreements with the parents of each child in  return of these items, requiring them to complete at least  primary education of their children. However, continued education of these children entirely  depends on livelihood generating opportunities of their  parents and cost of living in the city. As such, LEADS is  also trying to fi nancially empower the mothers of these  children by teaching them various skills for income  generation.     FUTURE PLAN: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT  FOR LEADS   To undertake its activities on a much broader  scale, LEADS needs to reach both institutional and  individual sponsors/donors both at home and abroad,  and the most convenient means of communication  is through a website.  As such, IDLCs IT Department  and CSR Department are designing and developing  the website for LEADS as part of IDLCs employee  volunteering program. The website is expected to be  launched by the second quarter of 2012.    38 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011   CONTRIBUTION TO SEID  TRUST SEID Trust is a non-government voluntary organization  working for the social inclusion and promotion of the  rights of underprivileged children with intellectual and  multiple disabilities, including autism. It mainly works  with children coming from very poor families in slum  areas, where they are often neglected and considered  a liability to their families. SEID Trust aims to empower  these children through special education, healthcare and  vocational training, enabling them to take responsibility of  their own lives. Currently SEID Trust is managing four centers in diff erent  locations of Dhaka, helping a total of 450 children.  IDLC has been a regular contributor to SEID Trust. In 2011  as well, we contributed fi nancially to help the organization  carry out their activities and meet daily needs of the  children.   More information on SEID Trust is available at www. seidtrustbd.org SUPPORT FOR IBRAHIM  The IDLC Group designed and sourced its Eid Greeting Cards in 2011  in cooperation with CRP (Centre for Rehabilitation of the Paralyzed).  The theme of the card was a mouth-painting by Ibrahim, one of the  patients and vocational trainees at the Savar-based CRP. 26 year old Ibrahim had both his upper limbs amputated after he  suff ered a spinal injury when he fell from a height while at work.  CRP treated him with the required therapy and arranged special  mouth-painting classes for him in cooperation with one of the faculty  members of the Institute of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka. Learning  such a skill is now helping Ibrahim make his own living, instead of  being dependent on his family.    By using Ibrahims mouth-painting, IDLC took his story to a broader  group of people, including IDLCs employees, clients, peers and other  stakeholders, who can come forward and assist CRP in their cause.   CRP was founded in 1979 by a British physiotherapist, Ms. Valerie  Taylor, in response to the desperate need for healthcare and  rehabilitation facilities for people with spinal injuries in Bangladesh.  CRP, the only organization of its kind in Bangladesh, has a holistic  approach to rehabilitation by focusing on physical, psychological and  economic rehabilitation, while ensuring successful reintegration of  discharged patients in the community. More information on CRP is available at  www.crp-bangladesh.org    39 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  HELPING OUT  THALASSAEMIA PATIENTS IDLC arranged blood donation programs at its premises  to help out the patients of Bangladesh Thalassaemia  Hospital. Through this event, IDLC employees voluntarily  donated blood for treatment of the people suff ering from  Thalassaemia.   Thallasaemia is a blood-related genetic disorder. Patients  with this disease require regular blood transfusion to live  and lead a near-normal life. The hospital, an initiative of  Bangladesh Thalassaemia Samity, treats on an average  15-20 patients per day by providing fresh blood at very  low cost. The hospital mainly collects blood by arranging  voluntary blood donation campaigns in diff erent  educational institutions and organizations.  It was very  encouraging to note that some of our clients also came  forward to donate their blood for this noble cause.  More information on Bangladesh Thalassaemia Hospital is  available at www.thalbangla.org  CHARITABLE ASSISTANCE     IDLC regularly donates old IT equipments such as  computers, printers etc. to the Groups support staff ,  as well as to institutions working for the education of  underprivileged children. LEADS is such an organization  that received computers and printers from IDLC in 2011. Moreover, in January 2012, IDLC further donated brand  new computers to three schools in Jessore to facilitate  basic computer education among the school children. IDLC employees distributed blankets to the marginal  people in 22 locations at Bogra, Jessore and nearby areas,  who were aff ected by the extreme weather during winter.  IDLC also made fi nancial contributions to two individuals  suff ering from heart disease and cancer.  40 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011   FINANCIAL INCLUSION At IDLC, we believe that the benefi ts of fi nancial products  and services should be made available at aff ordable costs  to those groups of the society that have limited access  to traditional modes of fi nancing. We also believe it is  our responsibility to share with our stakeholders latest  fi nancial knowledge to help them take informed decisions.    FINANCING SMALL AND MEDIUM  ENTERPRISES   Small and Medium Enterprises are regarded as the growth  drivers of an economy. However, considering the nature  and scale of their operations, more customized and  specialized fi nancing modes are required to serve their  needs.  In recent years, SME fi nancing has become a very  lucrative sector for banks and NBFIs in Bangladesh. IDLC  established its SME department in 2006. With its wide  range of services including Term Loan and Lease for small,  medium and macro enterprises; Commercial Vehicle Loan;  Women Entrepreneur Loan and Supplier Finance facilities,  SME is now one of the major revenue earners of IDLC,  while grabbing the fi fth position in the local fi nancial  market within a short time.   Through our branches  across the country, IDLC  reaches SME clients even  in many remote locations.  We also have dedicated  SME booths in two major  SME hubs of the country:  Gazipur and Imamganj.   WOMEN EMPOWERMENT Besides encouraging increasing female participation  across the Group, IDLC contributes to women  empowerment through its fi nancing operations as well.  Women entrepreneurs with the skills and potential often  do not have access to traditional modes of fi nancing to  help them grow their business. To remove such barriers,  IDLCs SME Department has been off ering a special  Women Entrepreneur Loan facility since 2007. We off er  working capital and lease fi nance facilities without any  collateral for up to a specifi c limit, and with fl exible and  convenient repayment options.   It may be mentioned that IDLC also receives refi nancing  facility from Bangladesh Bank against funds disbursed  under Women Entrepreneur Loan Facility.  FUTURE PLAN: WOMEN  ENTREPRENEURSHIP FINANCE TEAM   IDLCs SME Department is forming a dedicated  Women Entrepreneurship Finance Team in 2012  to better respond to the unique needs of women  entrepreneurs in a short time.  The major activities  of this team are to:   Provide women entrepreneurs easier and faster  access to fi nance    Arrange need-based training on both technical  and business management    Maintain liaison with various chambers and  other relevant bodies to identify potential  women entrepreneurs    Act as a catalyst to form special arrangements  between women entrepreneurs and large  corporate houses, with the objective of  developing forward and backward linkages,  and    Arrange various events, seminars and  promotional campaigns  BRANCH EXPANSION  In the last two years, the IDLC Group has expanded its  operations by opening a number of branches in diff erent  locations of the country to provide the latest fi nancial  services to people.
