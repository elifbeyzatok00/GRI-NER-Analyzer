010/11 Statoil In Brief  This booklet is your guide to Statoil in 2011.   Its purpose is two-fold: its a summarised version of  our Annual Report 2010 — as well as a handbook  on our business, our strategy, and the issues   affecting us as a company for the coming year.  Statoils strong strategic direction is part of a  greater plan to become an internationally leading,  upstream-focused and technology-based company.  I believe that Statoil has never been in better  shape to meet the challenges of the future. - Helge Lund, CEO For the full version of our Annual Report, please visit  our website  www.statoil.com/ar2010  3 TABLE OF CONTENTS  3 PRESENTATION 4  This is who we are 6  Spotlight on key areas 8  Introduction by our CEO 10  What role for natural gas? 12  Christopher Flavin 13  Professor Jonathan Stern 14  Dr. Fatih Birol 14  Now is the time for gas QUICK FACTS 16  Focus on safety 17  Environment 18  Activity in Norway 19  International activity 20  Why invest? 21  Project portfolio 22  Unconventional energy 23  Renewable energy 24  Oil sands 25  Natural gas REFERENCE 26  2010 at a glance 28  Our business in perspective 30  Sustainable performance 32   Key figures – graphs and tables 36  Financial information 38   Colophon Table of  contents  4  PRESENTATION This    is who we are  Statoil is an integrated  technology-based international  energy company primarily  focused on upstream oil and  gas operations. Our mission  is to accommodate the  worlds energy needs in  a responsible manner. Our industry is evolving, and so are we.   To solve the worlds energy challenges, we  must continue to explore, innovate and  change. Our quest for energy takes us to  the harshest environments and the deepest  waters around the world. We are a company built on our Norwegian  heritage and pioneering spirit. For us, the  way we work is as important as the goals we  achieve. Safety is paramount to us, and we  believe that all accidents can be prevented.  Our history  The Norwegian State Oil company, Statoil,  was formed in 1972. In October 2007,   Statoil merged with Hydros oil and gas division,  and in October 2010 we carried out a success- ful listing of Statoil Fuel & Retail ASA (SFR).   Our shareholders  Statoil is listed on the NYSE and Oslo Stock   Exchanges. The Norwegian State holds  67% of our shares through the Ministry of  Petroleum and Energy, US investors hold  9.1%, private Norwegian owners hold 9.4%,  UK investors hold 5.1% and other European  investors 8.1%. Our dividend policy  It is our ambition to grow the annual cash  dividend, measured in NOK per share, in line  with long term underlying earnings. Our business areas  As of January 1, 2011, we have seven    business areas: Development & Production  Norway (DPN); Development & Production   International (DPI); Development & Produc- tion North America (DPNA); Marketing,  Processing and Renewable Energy (MPR);  Technology, Projects & Drilling (TPD); Ex-  ploration (EXP); Global Strategy & Business  Development (GSBD). Our strategy  Our business strategy is to maximise the full  value potential of the Norwegian continental  shelf, to deliver international growth, and  gradually build a platform in renewable energy. Our values are   Courageous   Open  Hands-on,   Caring.   Guidance  We aim to deliver ~ 3% compound annual  growth rate (CAGR) in the period   2010 – 2012.  Production in 2011 is expected  approximately at 2010 level    — or slightly below.  NCS: ambition to maintain    production at todays level    towards 2020.   Sharpening exploration strategy    and plan to drill 40 wells in 2011,    9 high impact wells.  Exploration expenditure in 2011 is    expected to be around USD 3 bn.   CAPEX in 2011 is expected to be    around USD 16 bn.  www.statoil.com/thisisstatoil 5 Exploration portfolio Gas supply sources PDP or sanctioned for development Production as of Dec. 31, 2010 Wind power Gulf of Mexico Eagle Ford Chukchi Sea, Alaska Baffin Bay, Greenland Marcellus Algeria Snhvit LNG Shtokman Iran Cuba Canada Brazil Faroes Ireland Nigeria Egypt West Qurna 2, Iraq Azerbaijan Tanzania Indonesia Libya Norway Angola Russia Venezuela UK  6  PRESENTATION Around the world, we are focusing on strategic areas where we have   particular strengths: deep waters, gas value chains, harsh environments,   and heavy oil, and were drawing on the strong technical and project   execution skills we have acquired through our experience on the   Norwegian continental shelf. These are some of the highlights: Spotlight   on key areas  PRESENTATION  7 ANGOLA Capital - Luanda Official language - Portuguese Area - 1,246,700 km2 Population - 18,498,000 (2009 estimate) NORTH AMERICA Countries - 23 Area - 24,709,000 km2 Planet surface area - 4.8% Population - 528,720,588 (2008) BRAZIL Capital - So Paulo Official language - Portuguese Area - 8,514,877 km2 Population - 190,732,694 (2010) NORWAY Capital - Oslo Official language - Norwegian Area - 385,252 km2 Population - 4,503,436 (2010) North America  Deep waters, bitumen and shale gas We have more than 400 leases in the Gulf of  Mexico and 66 in Alaska. We have a 32.5%  share of the Marcellus shale gas field in an  alliance with Chesapeake Energy, and in 2010  we entered into an agreement to acquire  67,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford shale  formation in Southwest Texas. We brought  a partner into our Canadian oil sands project  by selling a 40% share to PTT Exploration  & Production PCL (PTTEP), and the Leismer  Demonstration bitumen plant in Northern  Alberta in Canada commenced production.   Brazil  Heavy oil Statoil is operator for the Peregrino offshore  oilfield in Brazil and first oil from Peregrino is  expected towards the end of the first quarter  2011. In May 2010 we agreed to sell 40%  of the Peregrino Field to Sinochem Group,  while retaining 60% ownership and operator- ship of the field. The transaction is subject to  government approval in Brazil. By 2012, we  expect to become the largest foreign offshore  operator in Brazil in terms of production. We  have interests in nine exploration licences in  four different basins in waters off the coast of  Brazil, four of which we operate. Norway  Our home base The Norwegian continental shelf is the back- bone of our business and our springboard to  international growth. We have a substantial  portfolio of new projects that will deliver  strong growth on the NCS, off-setting the  natural decline from maturing fields. Thanks  to a well-developed infrastructure and high  regularity, Norwegian gas represents a reliable  source of energy for much of Western Europe,  with a pipeline system totalling over 8000 km. Angola  An international partner The Angolan continental shelf is the largest  contributor to Statoils production outside  Norway and a key building block in our inter- national strategy. Angola yielded 173 mboe  per day in equity production in 2010, 34 %  of our total international oil and gas output. In January 2011 Sonangol announced that  Statoil has been elected for operatorship of  the Angolan pre-salt blocks 38 and 39 and  participation in blocks 22, 25 and 40. We will  have 40% interest in blocks 38 and 39 and  20% interest in the other blocks. All blocks  are in the Kwanza Basin offshore Angola.  Formal granting of licences for all blocks is  pending decisions.  8  PRESENTATION 2010 was a year of important strategic progress and   active portfolio management for Statoil. We carried out   a successful listing of Statoil Fuel & Retail, we forcefully  matured our project portfolio, we positioned ourselves   for long-term growth in the US and in Angola, and  we demonstrated substantial value creation from our   international portfolio through the Peregrino and   oil sands transactions. Safety is — and will remain — our top prior- ity, and we have continued to improve our   over-all safety results in 2010. However  this is an area in which we cannot rest.   We had a serious well incident at the   Gullfaks field last year.  We are committed to using the learnings   from this incident in order to further im-  prove our safety performance.  After delivering a high production level   during the first half of 2010, we experi- enced specific operational issues during the  second half of the year, taking the annual  production below what we expected.   We nevertheless delivered strong cash   flow and financial results. A new Statoil organisation has been in place  since 1 January. It is aimed at positioning us  even better to respond to the changes in our  operating environment. As is our tradition now, our sustainability  reporting is fully integrated in our annual  report — reflecting our commitment to  delivering long-term, sustainable growth.  I hope you will find our annual report for  2010 an interesting read.

However, this is an area in  which we cannot rest. — Helge Lund, CEO  10  PRESENTATION What role for natural gas?  PRESENTATION  11 How can the world meet its energy needs, while addressing  climate change? You cant do one without the other.  It seems like an insurmountable challenge, and there are no easy  answers.  But if there were an effective measure that was immediately  available, cost-effective, and environmentally acceptable, surely  wed want to use it? In Statoil, we believe that natural gas has a key role to play  in the future energy mix. But dont just take our word for it. Listen to the experts.  12  PRESENTATION Natural gas has a critical   role to play in reducing   carbon dioxide emissions,   and accelerating the shift   to renewable energy. CHRISTOPHER FLAVIN President of the Worldwatch Institute  Washington D.C. Christopher Flavin talks about the importance of natural gas in reducing CO2 emissions — and the need to regulate the shale gas industry to reduce local air and water pollution problems.  See the interview at: statoil.com/interviews/flavin  PRESENTATION  13 The most important  advantage of gas is that  it does not need subsidies  in the same way that the  low carbon alternatives do. PROF. JONATHAN STERN Director of Gas Research,  Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, Oxford  Professor Jonathan Stern believes that gas has a role to play in achieving a cost-effective transition to a  low-carbon economy – but that the gas industry must point the way to how it can decarbonise in the future.  See the interview at: statoil.com/interviews/stern  14  PRESENTATION We may be seeing a  golden age for gas starting. DR. FATIH BIROL Chief Economist International Energy Agency, Paris Watch interview:  statoil.com/interviews/Flavin Dr. Faith Birol foresees a golden age for gas and believes that gas replacing coal is good news for the climate. However, he is concerned that gas might displace renewable and other zero carbon  See the interview at: statoil.com/interviews/birol  PRESENTATION  15 The world needs more energy.  But at the same time, CO2- emissions need to be curbed.  It seems like an insurmount- able challenge.  The answer has to come from a combination  of conventional and new technologies. No  single energy source can provide the solution.   In Statoil, we believe that natural gas has an   increasingly important role to play in the  energy mix.  But how can natural gas —   a fossil fuel — be good news  for the climate?  Because it is the cleanest fossil fuel, contains  less carbon and burns cleaner compared to  other fossil sources.  You can reduce CO2  emissions by up to 70% if you replace an old  coal-fired power plant with a new state-of- the-art gas fired power station. And since  coal still generates some 40% of the worlds  electricity, replacing coal with gas in the  power sector will ensure major and immediate  CO2 reductions.  Natural gas, including the volumes Statoil ex- ports from the Norwegian Continental Shelf,  can continue to play a key role in cutting  Europes CO2 emissions.  By switching from coal to natural gas, Europe  could achieve its target of a 20% reduction in  CO2 emissions by 2020 compared with 1990  levels.  And natural gas is an abundant resource.   Globally, estimates point to around 250 years  of recoverable natural gas resources at current  consumption levels.  Gas is also cost-competitive  compared with other alterna- tive fuels including nuclear   and coal.  Renewables will have an important and   growing role to play in the future energy mix.   To that end were actively contributing  through our offshore wind developments —  Sheringham Shoal, Hywind and potentially   the gigantic Dogger Bank.  Furthermore, we believe gas is an optimal fuel  to enable the growth of intermittent renewables.  Natural gas is flexible, its cost effective, and  its based on technology thats here today.  Overall, we believe natural gas need to play a  major and long term role in the energy mix. Of course, gas does have issues in the sense  that it is a fossil fuel and emits CO2. Statoil  is committed to ensuring that we develop  resources in a sustainable and responsible  manner.  So what needs to happen?   For gas to fully play its role in the energy mix,  it needs to be recognised by decision-makers  as a long term and sustainable energy source.  It is a fuel of the future, but for Europe there  is window to act now. Much of Europes power  capacity is ageing and needs to be replaced in  the near future. In our view, gas could play a  significant role in replacing this capacity cost  effectively, while reducing emissions at the  same time.  Now is the time for natural gas. Now is the   time for gas  Total recordable injury frequency Serious incident frequency 2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010 6 5 4 3 2 1    Total recordable injury frequency    Serious incident frequency Responsibility  for safety and security Respect   trust & cooperation Risk understanding & management Stop unsafe  acts & operations 16  QUICK FACTS Focus on Safety We firmly believe that all accidents can be pre- vented, and our goal remains zero harm. We focus  on preventing both personal injuries and major acci- dents, and the goal of zero injuries has become part  of how we think and work, with a strong focus on  continuous improvement. In order to meet our goal of improving safety results, we hold a large number of   training sessions in compliance, leadership and risk management. Our monitoring   of technical safety conditions and our safe behaviour programme have been   widely recognised.  We reached our our key performance indicator for serious incident frequency in  2010, but we will continue to work harder in order to be among the best in relation  to safe work in our industry.  ZER0 HARM to people society and environment SUSTAINABLE   water resource management MAINTAINING BIODIVERSITY 17 www.statoil.com/quickfacts Environment We will ensure safe operations which protect people,  the environment, communities and material assets.  We will use natural resources efficiently, and will pro- vide energy that supports sustainable development. Our ambition is to operate with zero harm to people, society and the environment   in accordance with the principles for sustainable development. Our policies and   requirements apply to all operations we control and to all staff and contractors   involved in those operations. We expect our partners and suppliers to have   standards consistent with our own. 	 We	aim	to	assess	relevant	environmental	and	social	issues	and	minimise	the	   negative impact on the environment.

We	endeavour	to	practise	sustainable	water	resource	management. We know that greenhouse gas emissions must be dramatically reduced in order to   limit changes in global average temperatures. But we also know that greenhouse   gas emissions, energy consumption and economic growth are highly interrelated.  of NCS oil & gas production is operated by Statoil  75% 44 Major gas supplier   to Europe developed fields on the NCS 18  QUICK FACTS Activity in Norway The Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) is the   backbone of our company and our ambition is to  maintain production at present levels until 2020.  Our portfolio of new projects will deliver strong  growth on the NCS, offsetting the natural decline  from maturing fields. The NCS is an attractive petroleum province and we have a large portfolio of   long term low-cost producing assets and a well established infrastructure   that contributes to profitable production. We are prioritising efficient drilling   operations, improved regularity and increased hydrocarbon recovery (IHR).   Access to new, high-quality exploration acreage is essential to maintain a high  production level in the longer term.

Statoil is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange   and New York Stock Exchange under the  tickers STL and STO respectively. To achieve long term sustainable growth, we will continue to mature our strong  project portfolio and resource base.  We believe that the NCS will provide long  term value creation, we are well positioned to create value in a growing gas  market, and we will continue to grow our international operations. Our high  exploration activity and dynamic portfolio management has enabled us to deliver  an improved reserves replacement ratio (RRR). We deliver strong cash flow and have a solid financial position which provides for   an attractive and growing dividend. For 2010, the Board of directors has pro- posed a dividend of NOK 6.25 per share.  13 projects   underway to deliver growth within 2012      with average breakeven of ~40 USD/bbl 400 mboe/d  installed capacity by start-ups in   2011-2012  ~16 BN USD     expected CAPEX for 2011 40 projects  are to be sanctioned in 2011-2012 with     average breakeven of <50 USD/bbl GYGRID VISUND NORTH DOMPAP FOSSEKALL VIGDIS NORTH-EAST KATLA FULLA VILJE SOUTH 21 PLANNED PDOS IN 2011: ALL NUMBERS FOR 2011/2012 ARE GUIDING www.statoil.com/quickfacts Project portfolio Statoils strategy is to continuously access new   exploration acreage with high resource potential  and to maximise the number of high impact wells. We are maintaining a high level of activity and have over 100 projects in our pro- ject pipeline. We expect to sanction a large number of projects in the coming years.  Around 40 projects are to be sanctioned during 2011 and 2012, and unconven- tional oil and gas provide a stable and growing reserve booking. We expect to de- rive significant contributions from existing fields and areas using improved recovery  (IOR). Start-ups in 2011 and 2012 will add 400 mboe/d in new  capacity, contributing to 200 mboe/d production in 2012.   40 Gas fields in production on Norwegian Continental Shelf BILLION  SM3 PROVED GAS RESERVES ON THE NCS: 2500 BILLION  SM3 ESTIMATED UNDISCOVERED  GAS RESOURCES: 1900 KM PIPELINE NETWORK TO EUROPE: 8000 22  QUICK FACTS Natural gas Natural gas is a fuel with many benefits. It is the   greenest, most versatile and flexible of fossil fuels;   resources are plentiful and available today; and it   is used in conjunction with reliable and proven   technology for electricity generation which requires   comparatively low investment, and no subsidies. Norway has exported gas to Europe since 1977, and today Statoil is the second   largest gas exporter of gas to Europe. Currently there are around 40 gas fields   in production on the NCS. Gas is delivered to the UK and the Continent through   a pipeline network totalling over 8000 km.   Statoil has a strong gas asset portfolio, and we are highly competitive on cost,   flexibility, transport, storage. We are geographically close to consumers, have a   firm foothold in European gas markets, and the liberalisation of markets is opening   up new opportunities for us. We also participate in other gas supplies to Europe,   from Azerbaijan and North Africa.   88  80  wind turbines meters high CO2 savings:  500 000 tonnes/year  Sheringham Shoal could power 220,000 British homes 23 www.statoil.com/quickfacts Renewable energy We are building on our extensive experience from the  oil and gas industry that gives us a competitive edge in  offshore wind projects. In partnership with Statkraft, we are building one of the largest offshore wind farms  in the UK, Sheringham Shoal. This wind farm covers more than 35 square kilometres  and will generate an estimated 1.1 TWh annually when it comes on stream in 2011.   Our pioneering floating offshore wind turbine, Hywind, started full-scale trials off the  west coast of Norway in autumn 2009. This next-generation design uses a unique  floating cylinder derived from offshore technology.   In January 2010, as part of the Forewind consortium, we were awarded development  rights for an offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank in the UK sector of the North Sea.  Dogger Bank could be the worlds largest wind power development, covering nearly  9000 square kilometres, with a targeted capacity of 9GW, nearly 10% of the total  electricity needs in the UK.  We planted 62,850  trees  in 2010 25%  less C02 Our ambition is to reduce CO2 emissions  intensity by over 25% by the year 2020  of water will come from underground   aquifers, and 90% will be recycled 90%  of the surface area will  remain undisturbed 92%  24  QUICK FACTS Oil sands One of our projects that has received the most  attention is oil sands in Canada. Oil production  from bitumen is controversial on environmental  grounds — but we are committed to  responsible development. Canadian oil sands are attractive because they are one of the worlds   largest remaining untapped oil resources. With the increasing difficulties   in meeting the worlds energy demand it is inevitable that they will be   produced. Our goal is to become an industry leader in responsible   oil sands development. 	 We	will	work	to	achieve	significant	reductions	in	intensity	from	recovery 	 We	will	not	emit	any	poisonous	waste	to	the	air,	rivers,	fresh	water	or	soil	 	 We	will	reclaim	any	disturbed	areas	before	leaving	 	 Any	forest	cleared	will	be	replanted. Our demonstration facility at Leismer will trial over 20 experimental tech- nologies to achieve improved recovery and lower CO2 intensity. Steam was  first injected in September 2010 with first oil in Q1, 2011. Within two years,  we plan to produce 18,800 barrels per day and will continue to increase  production to create a profitable and sustainable business from this attractive  resource base.     7300KM2 Size of Marcellus shale gas play ESTIMATED GLOBAL  UNCONVENTIONAL GAS RESOURCES: 5700 ESTIMATED  US SHALE GAS RESOURCES: 700 BILLION  BOE BILLION  BOE 25 www.statoil.com/quickfacts Unconventional gas Thanks to recent technology breakthroughs, uncon- ventional or shale gas reserves have been unlocked  from rocks with low permeability and porosity.   Abundant quantities of shale gas are now playing a  significant role in the US energy supply. In 2008, we were an early entrant to the unconventional market when we formed a   strategic alliance with Chesapeake Energy Corporation to jointly explore unconven- tional gas opportunities worldwide. The deal gave us a 32.5% interest in Marcellus  shale gas acreage covering 7,300 square kilometres. In 2010 we entered the Eagle  Ford shale, strengthening where we will acquire 67,000 net acres in the shale forma- tion in Southwest Texas.   Shale gas is transforming the worlds biggest energy market, providing energy inde- pendence for the US, a more viable energy mix and jobs for thousands of Americans.  Statoils aim is to build infra-structure and competence with the goal of becoming  a professional shale gas operator. Unconventional resources give us a position in a  significant long term resource base with a large Yet To Find (YTF) potential.  26  REFERENCE January February March April May June July In January, we signed an agreement with  ConocoPhillips to take over a 25% share in   50 licences in the Chukchi Sea near Alaska. We were awarded shares in eight production  licences on the Norwegian Continental   Shelf (NCS). In the third licence round for offshore wind  parks in the UK, the Forewind consortium  was awarded the rights to develop Dogger  Bank, the largest zone in the round. Lukoil and Statoil signed a contract relating  to the West Qurna 2 field in Iraq. First oil is  scheduled for the end of 2012. In February, the Tyrihans field was awarded  the prestigious Five Star Award at the Deep  Offshore Technology conference in Houston. In March, we signed a contract with Chesa- peake that extended our net share of the   Marcellus formation in the US. Our two Peregrino oil platforms were towed  into position off the coast of Brazil. First oil is  expected in Q1 2011.  We extended our portfolio in the US sector  of the Gulf of Mexico with winning bids on   21 licences. We signed an investment contract worth   USD 6 billion with ACG partners for the  development of the Chirag oil project. We increased our share in the St. Malo dev- elopment in the Gulf of Mexico to 21.5% by  exercising our first option in connection with  the sale of Devons share of the development. In April, we launched a new technology plan  designed to reduce CO2 emissions from oil  sand production, aimed at achieving reduc- tions of more than 40% by 2025. We announced that we had found oil   and gas at the Fossekall prospect north   of the Norne field in the Norwegian Sea. The Macondo accident in the Gulf of Mexico  caused the loss of 11 lives and an extensive  oil spill. US authorities imposed restrictions  following the accident. In May, we signed an agreement to sell a  40% stake in the Peregrino field in Brazil   to the Sinochem Group.  Statoil and EGL announced the transfer of a  combined share of 15% in the Trans Adriatic  Pipeline Project to E.ON Ruhrgas.  We signed an agreement for the transport   of gas through a pipeline from the northern  part of the Marcellus shale gas region in   Pennsylvania to Niagara.  On 19 May a situation arose involving a change  in pressure and the loss of drilling fluid in well   C-06 on the Gullfaks C platform in the North   Sea. We demobilised 89 employees to the   Gullfaks A platform by helicopter. Our invest- igation and the report of the Petroleum Safety  Authority Norway concluded that the planning  of the drilling and completion operations in   the well had been deficient. Following this in-  cident, we implemented a number of measures. In June, we signed a letter of intent with  Sinochem Group of China to promote   collaboration and the long-term share of   experience between the two companies.  The first floating platform to be supplied with  electricity from the mainland, Gja, was towed  to its location on the west coast of Norway.  The plan for the development and operation  of the Gudrun field in the North Sea was   approved by the Norwegian parliament in June.  Work commenced offshore on the   Sheringham Shoal wind farm in the UK,   jointly owned by Statoil and Statkraft. Statoil and Poweo of France signed a   20-year agreement for the supply of natural  gas to Poweos planned 400 MW combined  cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station in  Toul, France.  In July, we signed frame agreements worth  NOK 12 billion for insulation, scaffolding   and surface treatment on platforms, prod- uction ships and land facilities in Norway   and Denmark.  2010 at a glance  www.statoil.com/summary2010 27 August September October November December In August, we published details of our fast- track developments that will make small fields  profitable and help maximise the potential of  the NCS. We announced a new organisational   structure effective from January 1, 2011. Oil production commenced from the subsea  field Morvin, tied back to sgard, in the   North Sea.  In September, we signed an agreement with  Nautical Petroleum, enhancing our offshore  heavy oil portfolio in the UK. In October, our fuel and retail business was  partially spun off to form Statoil Fuel & Retail  ASA (SFR), listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Statoil and state-run Mexican oil company  Petrleos Mexicanos (Pemex) are collaborating  to reduce flaring on the Tres Hermanos oil  field in Mexico, and is registered under the  UNs Clean Development Mechanism. We carried out an extensive oil spill protec- tion exercise on Srya in West Finnmark in  northern Norway.  We submitted our development plan for the  Valemon field to the Ministry of Petroleum  and Energy.  We approved development of the major   Jack/St. Malo fields in the deepwater Gulf   of Mexico together with operator Chevron  and partners.  The seventh oil discovery in block 15/06   off the coast of Angola was announced,   completing our minimum commitment to   this area 18 months ahead of time.  We announced a boost to our land-based  projects in the USA by acquiring a 67,000   net acre share of the Eagle Ford shale   gas formation. In November, we announced that we  agreed to sell a 40% stake in the companys  oil sands project in Alberta, Canada, to PTTEP.  We submitted our application for new   exploration licences in the Barents Sea and  the Norwegian Sea in the 21st licensing  round on the NCS.  Production on the Gja oil and gas field came  on stream on 7 November, opening up for more  activity in the far north of the North Sea. We announced that we would further con- centrate our efforts to develop offshore wind  turbines in the light of the rapid international  developments within the offshore wind sector.  In December, we signed a technology   development agreement with Siemens with  whom we will collaborate on wind power,   subsea technology, electro technology and  energy efficiency. The European Gas Advocacy Forum, a group of  major gas players in Europe of which Statoil is  a member, submitted a report to the EU Com- mission showing how Europe can achieve its  target of 80% reductions in carbon emissions  by 2050 if natural gas is allowed to play a  substantial role in the energy mix. Production started up on the Vega gas and  condensate field south west of the Sogne  coast in Norway.    28  REFERENCE Our business  in perspective Our new organisation has been  in place since January. Its strong  business areas, greater geo- graphical span, and well defined  responsibilities give us a good  platform for further growth.   Helge Lund, CEO  Financial performance  Statoil delivered strong financial results and  cash flows in 2010. Production volumes were  below our expectations in the second part of  the year, mainly due to maintenance, opera- tional issues and production permit restrictions.   Total equity liquids and gas production was  1,888 mboe per day in 2010, and came in  somewhat below the previously guided range  of 1,925 — 1,975 mboe per day. However,  we have had strong cash flow and have a  sound financial position.  Net operating income was up by 13%   compared to 2009, mainly because of higher  prices for oil, and was partly offset by lower  gas prices and reduced volumes sold.   Net operating income amounted to   NOK 137.2 billion in 2010. Around 90% of the expected Hydro merger  synergies have been achieved, and monitoring  of the merger value capture is now closed. In 2010, we demonstrated value creation  through the partial sale of our operated   assets in Brazil and Canada, final investment  decisions were made for nine new projects  (operated by Statoil), and we executed an   IPO of the energy and retail business. We acquired high potential exploration acre- age in 2010 and the reserve replacement  ratio grew to 87%, up from 73% in 2009.  Statoil believes it has a resource base to  improve this ratio going forward, and the   high quality portfolio of yet-to-be-sanctioned  projects, is expected to add value to our   business in the future. The board of directors is proposing a dividend  of NOK 6.25 per share for 2010. Risk  Statoil is exposed to a number of risks that  may affect our operational and financial   performance. Significant operational risks   are related to our ability to discover, develop,  produce and transport oil and natural gas,  while changes in currency exchange rates,  interest rates and not the least the prices of  oil and natural gas impact our financial results. Here are some of the risks that we face:   Access to resources at commercially    acceptable terms.   About 80% of the worlds remaining res-   ources are held by countries with limited acc-   ess for international oil companies, and the    record high oil prices in 2008 encouraged    many countries to tighten the fiscal terms. We are approaching more complex projects    Deeper waters, heavier oils, more    difficult reservoirs, and harsher environ-   ments naturally entail exposure to risk.  Climate regulations remain uncertain   	 We take the view that pressure on our    industry to comply with stricter regulations    will increase.  www.statoil.com/financial 29 Indicative PSA effect  (mmboe/d) 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 *Guiding based on EPA price scenarios for the whole period Effect on 2011 production* Effect on 2012 production* $110 $80 $50 Equity production (mboe/d) 2010 2009 1121 767 1888 1202 760 1962 Oil       Gas Outlook and guiding  Statoil expects equity production in 2011 to  be around the 2010 level, or slightly below.  Equity production for 2012 is expected to  grow by around 3% Compound Average  Growth Rate (CAGR) based on the actual   2010 equity production. Commercial con- siderations related to gas sales activities,   operational regularity, the timing of new  capacity coming on stream and gas off take  represent the most significant risks related   to the production guidance. We expect a natural decline in our total oil  and gas portfolio of around 5% in the period  2010 — 2012. However, we are steadily   improving our reserves replacement ratio  (RRR) and we have resources and projects to  sustain a continued positive RRR development.  We have sharpened our exploration strategy  and plan to drill around 40 exploration wells  in 2011. Exploration expenditure in 2011 is  estimated to around USD 3 bn, while CAPEX  in 2011 is expected to be around USD 16 bn.  We have more than 100 projects in our  pipeline, and in 2011 — 2012 new installed  capacity will be ~ 400 mill boe/d, while in  2013 — 2020 we intend to add more than  1.800 mboe/d of new capacity.  30  REFERENCE We recognise that our continuing business success  depends on our ability to  effectively manage the  varied environmental and   social challenges, risks and   opportunities which our   operations face. Our ambition is to operate with zero harm  to people, society and the environment in  accordance with the principles for sustainable  development. Our policies and requirements  apply to all operations we control and to all staff  and contractors involved in those operations.  We expect our partners and suppliers to   have standards consistent with our own. Safety  Safe and efficient operations are our first  priority. We aim to understand factors that  create risks in order to avoid major accidents  that could harm our people, the environment   or our facilities. We believe that all accidents  can be prevented, and our goal remains zero  harm. We have strong focus on continuous   improvement. We hold a large number of train- ing sessions in compliance and risk management. In 2010, we had a serious well incident at Gull-  faks, which should not have happened. How- ever, it was handled well by our organisation,  preventing it from causing any harm to our  people or the environment. We are committed  to using all the experience from this incident  to further improve our safety performance.   Corporate social responsibility Growing and sustaining our business depends  on our ability to forge enduring and mutually  beneficial relationships with the societies in  which we operate. Wherever we operate, we  make decisions based on how they affect our  interests and those of the societies around us.  Our presence in the societies in which we   operate and seek to grow is usually a long- term one, with the time frame of our projects  typically spanning several decades. Our   business therefore depends on our ability   to understand and respond to the needs and  interests of surrounding stakeholders, to dem- onstrate that the benefits of our presence on  the whole outweigh the potential downsides,  and to generate and sustain support from  people and communities around us. Climate  As hydrocarbon resources become harder to  find, we are entering new energy-intensive  and environmentally challenging areas of pro- duction. Heavy oil production from Venezuela,  oil sands in Canada and the production of  LNG all lead to higher greenhouse gas emiss- ions per unit of output. We have entered into  these activities with the aim of providing   leadership in finding solutions to the   challenges involved. One climate measure currently being under- estimated is the use of natural gas. Gas has  many benefits: it is abundant, cheap and the   cleanest of fossil fuels, and it can play a  major role in the transition to a low-carbon  economy. Renewable energy production will  play an mportant role in the longer term, but  this is still a young industry that will need invest- ment and technology development to become  efficient and competitive. Renewable energy  production is one of our main strategy areas. We are calling for a global climate quota  regime that provides the necessary long-term  framework, encouraging cost-efficient renew-  able and low-carbon energy solutions.

Most of the  revenues stem from the sale of lifted crude  oil, natural gas and refined products produced  and marketed by Statoil. In addition, we also  market and sell the Norwegian states share of  liquids from the NCS. All purchases and sales  of the Norwegian states production of liquids  are recorded as purchases net of inventory  variations and sales, respectively.  The NOK 64.1 billion increase in revenues  from 2009 to 2010 was mainly attributable   to higher prices for liquids and increased   volumes of gas sold, partly offset by lower gas  prices, reduced volumes of liquids sold, and  losses on derivatives. Purchase, net of inventory variation, includes  the cost of the oil and NGL production pur- chased from the Norwegian state pursuant  to the Marketing instruction. The purchase,  net of inventory variation, amounted to NOK  257.4 billion in 2010. The 25% increase from  2009 to 2010 was mainly caused by higher  prices of liquids measured in NOK. Operating expenses include field production  and transport systems costs related to the  companys share of oil and natural gas produc- tion. In 2010, operating expenses amounted  to NOK 57.5 billion. The increase was mainly  attributable to higher operating costs related  to preparation for start up on new fields, partly  offset by lower transportation costs because of  reduced production, and cost saving activities- Selling, general and administrative expenses  include expenses related to the sale and  marketing of our products, such as business  development costs, payroll and employee  benefits. These amounted to NOK 11.1 billion  in 2010. The NOK 0.8 billion increase from  2009 to 2010 stems mainly from a provision   for an onerous contract in 2010 and was only  partly offset by cost reductions from cost   saving activities. Depreciation, amortisation and net   impairment losses include depreciation of pro- duction insta-llations and transport systems,  depletion of fields in production, amortisa- tion of intangible assets and depreciation of  capitalised exploration expenditure. It also  includes impairment of long-lived assets and  reversals of impairments. These expenses  Profit and  loss analysis The Consolidated financial  statements of Statoil ASA and  its subsidiaries (Statoil) have  been prepared in accordance  with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) as  adopted by the European Union  (EU). The accounting policies  applied by Statoil also comply  with IFRS as issued by the Inter- national Accounting Standards  Board (IASB). This section gives a summary of the   Consolidated Financial Statements 2010.   For full version of our Consolidated financial   statements are available at www.statoil.com. amounted to NOK 50.6 billion in 2010. The  6% decrease in 2010 compared to 2009  was mainly due to lower impairment losses in  2010, and lower depreciation due to reduced  production in 2010 compared to 2009. Exploration expenditures are capitalised to  the extent that exploration efforts are consid- ered successful, or pending such assessment.   Otherwise, such expenditures are expensed.  The exploration expense consists of the  expensed portion of our exploration expendi- ture in 2010 and impairment of exploration  expenditure capitalised in previous years.   In 2010, the exploration expenses were   NOK 15.8 billion. The 5% decrease in exploration expenses  from 2009 to 2010 was mainly due to lower  drilling activity and a smaller portion of ex- ploration expenditure capitalised in previous  years being impaired. The decrease was partly  offset by higher oil sand delineation drilling  expenses, higher seismic expenditures and  higher pre-sanctioning costs. Net financial items amounted to a loss of  NOK 0.4 billion in 2010, compared to a loss of  NOK 6.7 billion in 2009. The NOK 6.3 billion   www.statoil.com/keyfigures 37 positive change from 2009 to 2010 was mostly  attributable to fair value changes on interest  rate swap positions, due to decreasing US  dollar interest rates in 2010, compared to  increasing US dollar interest rates in combina- tion with 17% weakening of US dollar versus  the NOK in 2009. Income taxes were NOK 99.2 billion in 2010,   equivalent to an effective tax rate of 72.5%,  compared to NOK 97.2 billion in 2009,  equivalent to an effective tax rate of 84.6%.  The decrease in effective tax rate from 2009  to 2010 was mainly due to high taxes in 2009  caused by higher taxable income than accounting   income in companies that are taxable in other  currencies than the functional currency.   The decrease in the effective tax rate was  also caused by relatively lower income from  the NCS in 2010 compared with 2009 which  is subject to a higher than average tax rate. In 2010, the non-controlling interest (minority  interest) in net profit was NOK 0.4 billion,  compared to NOK 0.6 billion in 2009. The  non-controlling interest in 2010 is primarily  related the 79% owned Mongstad crude oil  refinery and the 54% owned Statoil Fuel &  Retail (from October 2010). Cash flow statement Cash flows from underlying operations, less  tax payments, contributed NOK 97.8 billion.   Cash flows used in investing activities am- ounted to NOK 76.2 billion. Cash flows from operating activities Statoils   primary source of cash flow consists of funds  generated from operations. The cash flows  provided by operations amounted to NOK  80.8 billion in 2010, compared with NOK  73.0 billion in 2009. The increase in cash  flows from operating activities of NOK 7.8  billion was primarily due to NOK 8.2 billion  higher cash flows from underlying activities  and NOK 8.2 billion lower tax payments.  Cash flows used in investing activities  amounted to NOK 76.2 billion in 2010,  an increase of NOK 0.8 billion from 2009.  Proceeds from sales increased by 4.6 billion  mainly related to prepayments from the sale  of interests in the Kai Kos Dehseh oil sand  development and prepayments from the sale  of a share of our Peregrino asset. Net cash flows from financing activities   in 2010 amounted to positive NOK 0.6   billion, compared to positive NOK 11.3 billion  in 2009. The NOK 10.7 billion decrease is  mainly related to a change in long-term   borrowings of NOK 29.1 billion due to fewer  new bonds issued in 2010 compared to 2009.
