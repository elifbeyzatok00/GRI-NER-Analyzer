Johannes Teyssen, CEO of E.ON AG: "Our responsibility to society lies in ensuring a safe, sustainable and affordable energy supply. In light of the terrible natural disaster in Japan and the resulting accidents at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, we once again need to engage in a candid and transparent discussion about the safety of our nuclear power plants and the transformation of our energy system. This discussion is more than just technical- it also involves society. At E.ON, safety and security has always been about much more than just secure energy supply- even before the events in Fukushima. Safe operation of our sites, employee safety, and the safety of our nuclear power plants in particular remain our top priorities. Our business conduct as an international company is based on more than just safety issues: It is governed by our corporate values and our commitment to the principles of the 'United Nations Global Compact'. This includes our commitment to uphold human rights and binding international labor and environmental standards, as well as our commitment to the fight against corruption. As an energy company, we have a special responsibility to help protect the climate. So we have set ourselves particularly ambitious goals in this area. To us, sustainability means working on energy concepts and helping to develop tomorrow's technologies today. Individual projects such as marine energy tests are just as important as new concepts for sustainable electricity generation, increasing the use of efficient technologies in households, and using electric vehicles in cities that will take shape in the decades to come. How are we going to accomplish these tasks? And reach all the goals we've set? As ever, we rely on conversation and partnership with our stakeholders wherever we do business. When it comes to deploying forward-looking solutions for sustainable energy supply, acceptance in communities is just as important to us as political dialog on a national level." In its 2006 Commitment, the E.ON AG Board affirmed the importance of our company's social responsibility: We behave responsibly towards our colleagues, customers, suppliers, the environment, and the communities where we live and work. We seek to improve lives everywhere we operate, aiming for a healthy, safe and sustainable environment. We consider the needs of the present generation and also anticipate the needs of future generations. Corporate 3 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29239.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Responsibility (CR) is a fundamental part of the way we do business. More specifically, at E.ON we: Are responsible for providing our markets with a secure, economic and climate-friendly supply of energy. Uphold the ten principles of the UN Global Compact on human rights, labor standards, environmental protection, and fighting corruption. Are committed to successful long-term development of the communities where we live and work. Report our achievements openly, reliably and self-critically. This includes making an appropriate and balanced presentation of our economic, environmental and social activities and achievements in line with the Global Reporting Initiative's current recommendations for sustainability reporting. Seek to engage in objective dialog about our activities and about the challenges our industry will face in the future. Board of Management of E.ON AG, Dsseldorf, June 2006 4 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29239.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Committed to Ethical Principles In the course of their activities, all employees at every level of the E.ON Group must comply with the clear rules laid down in our Code of Conduct. Derived from our core values, the Code of Conduct defines key principles and rules for legitimate and responsible conduct, especially when dealing with business partners and public officials. High Standards Underpin our Conduct Every single one of our employees, especially those with managerial responsibility, is called upon to fully comply with our Code of Conduct in all processes, decisions and everyday work activities at all times. This also applies to meeting the extended   and the governing  . This obligation Compliance requirements policies and standards applies to E.ON AG in Dsseldorf and to all company units on both a global and regional level. Continually Reviewing and Improving our Code of Conduct The implementation of and adherence to the Code is one of the major responsibilities of the Group's  . In 2009, the Compliance organization thoroughly Compliance organization revised the Code of Conduct to produce an updated version, which has been in force since January 2010. The Code is supplemented by guidelines containing detailed provisions and instructions on how to deal with specific situations. Our employees can refer to these at any time. Our Code of Conduct covers the following areas: 1. Dealing with Business Partners, Third Parties and Government/Public Bodies 2. Avoiding Conflicts of Interest 3. Handling Information 4. Dealing with the Property and Resources of the Company 5. Environment, Occupational Health and Safety Our Code of Conduct as Part of Education and Training Since 2007, our Code of Conduct has been included in introductory events for new employees and in management training modules conducted by the E.ON Academy. In 2010, we developed a special e-learning program for the revised 2009 Code of Conduct. 5 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29237.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  This will be implemented across the Group starting in 2011 to help raise awareness among our employees. In addition to this e-learning tool, we will also provide printed brochures so that employees without Internet access can conduct training in this area. 6 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29237.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Coordinated Initiatives for Sustainable Development Sustainable development can only be achieved through the coordinated efforts of multiple actors in business, government and society. As one of the world's leading power and gas companies, E.ON is engaged in numerous initiatives. We are involved in an intensive, cross-sector dialog on corporate responsibility (CR), which also helps us to improve our own  . In 2010 the Board of Management underscored our sustainability performance commitment by signing the "Code of Responsible Conduct for Business". In this section we outline our involvement in the most important international and German sustainability initiatives. UN Global Compact In 2005 E.ON joined the " ", a voluntary corporate citizenship initiative led Global Compact by the United Nations (UN). Our membership represents a commitment to the UN to comply with ten defined principles in the areas of human rights, labor standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption. With the goal of advancing these standards, we participate in a variety of initiatives and working groups such as the "German Global Compact Network". World Business Council for Sustainable Development The "World Business Council for Sustainable Development" (WBCSD) is a CEO-led international business initiative that focuses on energy and climate protection, ecosystem protection and fostering sustainable development. E.ON joined the WBCSD in 2007 and is involved in working groups such as the "Sector Project on Electricity Utilities". In 2010 the WBCSD published a study entitled "Vision 2050: The new agenda for business," to which E.ON and 28 other global corporations contributed. Enterprise for Health "Enterprise for Health" is a network of international companies that are dedicated to developing a corporate culture based on partnership as well as modern corporate health management policies. The group meets twice a year to share best practices and discuss lessons learned. Econsense- Forum for Sustainable Development of German Business "Econsense - Forum for Sustainable Development of German Business" is an association of leading, globally active corporations and organizations. This network was founded in 2000 as a think tank and dialog platform for sustainable development. Since that time E.ON has been involved in working groups focusing on topics such as transparency along the supply chain and assessing sustainability performance. Within the working groups, members discuss their experiences and develop joint approaches to achieving sustainability. In addition, our dialog makes an active contribution to shaping political and . social decision-making processes 7 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/42832.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Wirtschaft.Initiative.Engagement. In the "Business.Initiative.Engagement." (WIE- "Wirtschaft.Initiative.Engagement.") action group, companies work with state and civil society actors to develop solutions to the urgent challenges facing society. The initiative, which E.ON joined in 2007, aims to make the corporate citizenship of its members more effective, improve cooperation between the various stakeholders and sharpen its strategic impact. Commitment to the "Code of Responsible Conduct for Business" In November 2010, E.ON and 20 other major German corporations signed a voluntary pledge to follow responsible business practices. This is an expression of our commitment to sustainable business conduct which has human welfare at its core. The code's declared aim is to rebuild the trust in the social market economy and business leaders that was lost as a result of the financial crisis. E.ON was involved in drafting these principles and is dedicated to applying the values and standards expressed by the code. E.ON is also involved in national and international energy initiatives such as the World Energy Council and is a member of the World Economic Forum. Our global and regional units take an active role in local projects and networks. 8 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/42832.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Full Support for the UN Global Compact In 2005 E.ON made a commitment to the ten principles of the "United Nations Global Compact". This means we fully uphold the observance of human rights, labor and environmental protection standards and are solidly engaged in the fight against corruption. Stronger Global Structures Now into its tenth year, the Global Compact's vision of helping global business to advance in ways that benefit society and the environment has lost none of its relevance. This was reaffirmed by the "UN Global Compact Leaders Summit" in 2010. Far-reaching international and cross-industry cooperation is the only option if current and future crises are to be overcome. With this in mind, we are active in national and international Global Compact networks, for instance in Germany and Sweden, strengthening the structures that will help to master these challenges. Platform for Dialog and Exchanging Ideas The Global Compact was launched in 2000 by then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to promote corporate social involvement and to help ensure that business makes a contribution to solving the growing challenges of globalization, in particular by meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals. The Global Compact is the largest corporate citizenship and sustainability initiative worldwide, with over 8,000 members, including 5,300 companies from 130 countries. It is also a global network that provides a platform for international dialog and the exchange of ideas. The Basis for Group Policies and Standards We continue to strive to anchor responsible corporate actions permanently in our daily business activities. We are in the process of establishing and regularly updating a series of   based on the principles of the Global Compact. They include policies policies and standards for environmental and climate protection, responsible procurement, occupational safety and community involvement, as well as our commitment to observing human rights. Thus in 2010 we signed off a number of new standards to tighten up our Health and Safety Management Policy. These minimum standards govern specific safety risks and include measures designed to prevent falls and dealing with electrical safety. Our policy for the responsible procurement of biomass, introduced in 2009, helps us prevent the negative impact of biomass production on the environment, land use, groundwater and biodiversity, as well as on local communities 9 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29238.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  and the food market.

It is one of the pillars of our new   and is defined by cleaner & better energy corporate strategy our  - our binding undertaking to behave responsibly towards all Board Commitment stakeholders in our business, including future generations. Our goal is to be leading in CR -in the energy sector and beyond. The E.ON   is the cornerstone of our CR Strategy commitment to CR. It provides the framework for all CR activities throughout the Group. We implement our CR Strategy across the Group and ensure it is integrated on a global . In addition to our   and systems for  and regional level policies, standards Monitoring and , our   also acts as a central tool to manage the Compliance five-stage CR Work Process different aspects of establishing responsible conduct. 15 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29228.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Keeping our CR Strategy Up To Date The E.ON Corporate Responsibility (CR) Strategy forms the basis and framework for responsible corporate action to be coordinated throughout the E.ON Group. It also provides the foundation for our management approach and complements our overall corporate strategy. The introduction of the Strategy has helped to raise awareness of CR and establish it as an important organizational area in all parts of the Group. In fall 2010, we decided to fundamentally rework our existing CR Strategy. The following factors, each of which presents new opportunities and challenges in the area of CR, had an impact on this strategic realignment: Definition of cleaner & better energy as a new strategic focus at E.ON in November 2010. New approach as reflected by the realigned  . corporate structure of the E.ON Group More consistent awareness of our various commitments (such as the UN Global Compact and those that form part of Managing our Responsibilities) and developments (such as ISO 26000). Meeting stakeholders' expectations (such as by providing feedback from SRI roadshows or publishing our Materiality Matrix). Development of a clear picture of our future tasks and goals upon conclusion of the CR Work Program 2008-2010. Our aim is to adopt the new CR strategy by mid-2011. 16 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29234.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  The E.ON CR Strategy until 2010 We developed our "old" CR Strategy - valid throughout the 2010 reporting period - in 2007, in a structured process and based on the objectives we formulated in 2006. We continued to update the Strategy over time. When developing the Strategy, we took into consideration both CR-relevant topics in our business environment and our annual  . This materiality analysis process resulted in our three strategic work areas. Organize: building the framework for an effective CR approach Our CR experts find practical solutions and our employees support them in implementing our CR Strategy. Our   establishes the structures required to make this CR organization possible. Manage: managing opportunities, risks and meeting expectations Tasks in this work area include the identification of CR-relevant risks and opportunities at an early stage and the introduction of mitigating or harnessing measures as appropriate. Our commitment to environmental protection, our employees' rights, our Code of , occupational safety and the struggle against corruption are all key elements in Conduct this area. We continue to place particular value on our employees' awareness and observance of our Code of Conduct. Focus: defining E.ON's CR profile more clearly We aim to be an industry leader and benchmark-setter in our key CR areas. This requires focusing on a selected number of topics where we feel we can - and need to - achieve positive results and benefit all involved parties. Five-stage CR Work Process Furthermore, our five-stage CR Work Process serves as a central tool for implementing the strategy and work program. Assess & Analyze: In the first stage, we identify societal and sector trends, establish benchmarks, and assess risks and opportunities. 17 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/42833.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Plan & Prioritize: We set priorities and develop strategies and work plans. To these, we then assign concrete goals, targets, and key performance indicators (KPIs). Develop & Implement: During this stage, E.ON harmonizes existing policies and standards, and creates new ones. Initiated by the Corporate Center, the rules and guidelines are implemented across our various market and business units. Monitor & Control: On the basis of KPIs, we check the implementation status and quality of our policies and standards. We also conduct regular audits. Review & Report: We continuously report on our activities in CR reporting and on our inclusion in CR indices, both internally and externally. With the help of best-practice examples, we also discuss the current status of our work. Three Core CR Principles Our CR Strategy and CR activities are guided by three core principles: Stakeholder orientation, Integration and Leadership. They are designed to help secure E.ON's long-term business success by balancing our economic interests with societal expectations, environmental constraints and our stakeholder relationships. Stakeholder orientation: the basis for truly effective implementation of our CR Strategy and thus for long-term business prosperity. An open approach towards stakeholder expectations and concerns, twinned with transparency regarding our corporate performance, are essential ingredients of successful stakeholder relations. Integration: establishing responsible behavior as a vital part of all E.ON activities is a prerequisite for our long-term business success. The   accompanies and CR Organization supports this integration. This work depends on efforts made by experts and on the commitment of all employees. Leadership: all of our stakeholders rightly expect this from E.ON. It is our ambition to take a leading role in responsible business conduct in the power and gas industry. With this in mind, we focus particularly on CR activities that set an example for our sector and create additional value for our stakeholders. 18 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/42833.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Building a Robust Organization In order to fully meet the complex social challenges that a global corporation such as E.ON faces, we have established clear responsibilities and structures. The aim of our Corporate Responsibility (CR) organization is to embed responsible conduct in the minds of our employees, making it a part of our everyday business and clearly defining responsibilities within the Group. In order to root this in the Group across all levels and units, we continued to develop our CR organization in 2010. The following diagram gives an overview of this development, followed by additional explanations. 19 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29227.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Integrating the Board of Management and Supervisory Board The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are central decision-making authorities, have overarching responsibility for all CR activities and strategic guidelines, and are kept informed of CR activity at regular intervals. The head of the Corporate Responsibility department and the Board Member responsible for CR activity exchange ideas through regular reports and meetings. At least once a year, all Members of the Board of Management meet to discuss Corporate Responsibility, Climate & Environmental Protection, Health & Safety and Human Resources topics. Figures on safety, environmental protection and diversity are then incorporated into the Quarterly Board Report, which is delivered to the Board of Management. Health, Safety & Environment Governance Council and Human Resources Directors The Health, Safety & Environment (HSE) Governance Council and the Human Resources Directors comprise members of upper management from E.ON AG in Dsseldorf and the market units. They are responsible for strategic decisions and general Group-wide guidance. These bodies make recommendations to the Board of Management and monitor the implementation of targets. CR Organization at E.ON AG in Dsseldorf Within the E.ON AG organizational structure, corporate responsibility falls under the portfolio of Technology at the Board level. The Corporate Responsibility and Health, Safety & Environment departments are in charge of managing CR Strategy across the Group and organizing the implementation of the various programs on an operational level. These departments pool their expertise and, in partnership with the CR managers worldwide, drive forward the implementation of CR measures on all levels of the company. The Human Resources area manages our Group-wide HR activities. CR Managers, Coordinators and Teams In order to implement our   in the communities where we are based, each of our CR Strategy market units employed at least one CR and one HSE Manager in 2010. In addition to this, CR and HSE Coordinators have been nominated at a regional level in specific business units, especially in E.ON Energie. In 2010, our many expert teams continued their successful work with our Market and business units to further integrate CR within the Group. These teams are chosen and headed by a CR or HSE manager, and comprise employees from a variety of divisions. As of the start of 2011, the E.ON Group units have a new organizational structure. Instead of market and business units, there are now five global units which are responsible for the following five business areas: Conventional Generation, Renewables Generation, New Build & Technology, Global Gas, and Trading. There are also twelve regional units in charge of operational business in Europe. We are working on bringing CR responsibilities into line with this reorganization on a global and regional level. 20 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29227.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Finding a Way Forward Together To provide an effective   for a company of our size, we need to ensure it is CR Strategy comprehensively and uniformly implemented throughout the Group. So our goal is to align the actions of our units with the Group-wide CR Strategy by supporting both new and existing units to act in socially responsible ways. In summary, the process seeks to: demonstrate the importance of responsible business behavior to our long-term business success; highlight to our employees Group-wide the importance of E.ON's CR Strategy and their stake in it. It is therefore crucial that the CR Strategy and its relevance is understood, accepted and supported by decision makers at the management level and by the departments entrusted with implementing it; promote a willingness among all employees to implement the Strategy, to live by its principles and to communicate them both inside and outside the workplace;. provide a framework for measurable progress in CR Strategy implementation and performance monitoring; challenge employees to adapt the framework to regional and local conditions in a manner consistent with the CR Strategy. Integration in Three Steps In recent years, E.ON has acquired new companies in different countries and integrated them into the Group. In cases like this, levels of awareness regarding CR-relevant issues vary greatly depending on both the company and the specific issues at hand. Our CR management team places great value on successively involving these new firms in our CR Strategy and its implementation. To this end, E.ON is focusing on three major action steps to make the alignment and implementation of the CR Strategy across different companies in the Group as effective as possible. Facilitating: In the first step, the CR team of E.ON AG in Dsseldorf, Germany, helps support companies on a global or regional level by facilitating the transfer of CR expertise. This is done in close coordination with local CR managers. The goal is 21 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29231.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  to give our employees a greater understanding of the importance of CR for E.ON's business by explaining the overall CR Strategy, its core principles, and its strategic work areas. Supporting: Building on the first step, the CR team supports companies on a global and regional level in achieving the best possible practical implementation of the Group-wide CR Strategy in national and local CR initiatives. Monitoring: In the third and final step, the implementation of CR in the respective companies is reviewed. During this process, discussions with local CR and business management take place. Adjustments are made as necessary. 22 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29231.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Our CR Program: The Framework for Our Actions To successfully integrate corporate responsibility (CR) into our business activities, it is essential for us to have a clear, long-term objective for the whole Group, to address major CR-relevant issues, and to have a   that reflects this approach. CR plays CR Strategy a vital role in the long-term implementation of the new E.ON cleaner & better energy . This also includes promoting awareness of CR-relevant issues and their strategy significance in all units of the Group. To us, being socially responsible is a continuous process characterized by transparency and traceability. Since 2005, we have regularly announced binding, Group-wide CR Work Programs. These give a clear overview of our goals and the measures we intend to use to achieve them. Goals achieved in 2010: Strategic profiling and integration into business processes We completed our CR Program 2008-2010 at the end of 2010, having established the processes and structures that it called for. In consolidating the results, we have displayed these separately for each subject area for 2010. For a summary of our achievements, please see the PDF file "CR Work Program 2008-2010", which can be found in the "Downloads" area in the right-hand margin of this page. New CR Program 2011-2015: Approach based on updated CR Strategy At the start of 2011, we began developing a new CR Work Program for the next five years. There are certain measures from the Program 2008-2010 that we want to continue with. In addition, we will define new goals, issues to focus on, and measures for implementation, and adapt these to the guidelines in the new CR Strategy. 23 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29221.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  2008 – 2010 Measures Review Overall CR Management Continue development of CR  organization at all levels Develop a set of core indicators to  track CR performance and support  business decision-making Develop training and other  measures to stimulate a culture  of responsibility across the Group Develop a strategic CR profile in  line with the CR Strategy and test  with stakeholder groups Implement appropriate  Environmental and Social Impact  Assessments in relevant parts of  the business and integrate results  in business decisions Develop and implement an overall  stakeholder management strategy Annual CR performance reporting Assess business ethics risks and  prepare an action plan The CR and HSE organization is established at Group  level and will be adapted to the new E.ON organizational  structure from 2011 on. A set of indicators for internal control and external  reporting has been developed. A set of dedicated CR training activities has been  developed and implemented. Examples include the  Safety Academy, the Group-wide E.ON Environmental  Champions program and the Code of Conduct e-learning  program. The CR profile topics Next Generation, Climate  Change and Access to Energy were developed in  line with the CR Strategy 2008-2010. A comprehensive analysis of our business activities  (Sustainable Impact Assessments - SIA), including  social and environmental aspects, is applied in project  management processes for the construction of new  power plants. There are ongoing dialogs on CR topics lead by the  relevant departments. An NGO Engagement Workbook  has been developed and contacts with selected NGOs  are ongoing, including a cooperation agreement with  the International Union for Conservation of Nature  (IUCN) for the protection of marine ecosystems. E.ON has published CR Reports since 2005. Since 2008,  these CR Reports are internet-based and are audited in  selected areas. Corruption and bribery risks have been incorporated  into procurement processes and included in CR audits.  The area of ethics has been included in the E.ON Code  of Conduct and incorporated into regular corporate audit  activities.  2008 – 2010 Measures Review Implement Responsible  Procurement Policy through risk  assessments and training courses Assess corporate risks related  to human rights and labor rights  violations A policy for coal, uranium and biomass procurement has  been implemented. The area of ethics has been included  in the E.ON Code of Conduct. Supplier audits and events  are carried out in addition to the usual quality standards.  There are regular training sessions for purchasers, CR  managers, auditors and traders. The E.ON Human Rights Policy Statement has been  developed. Human rights issues have been incorporated  into procurement processes and included in CR audits. Overall CR Management Marketplace & Community Develop a responsible products  and services strategy Support for vulnerable customers  in our retail markets Embed CR elements in our  Group-wide sponsorship strategy Develop and roll out Group  community involvement strategy Develop appropriate community  programs to support existing E.ON  assets and new-build projects E.ON offers different responsible products and services  Group-wide. These are developed both centrally at E.ON  AG in Dsseldorf and in regional units, with the aim of  meeting the needs of the respective customer as best  possible. A Group-wide unilateral commitment to supporting  vulnerable customers has been agreed and its  demands implemented on a regional level. CR has been integrated into E.ON sponsorship activities.  The new sponsorship handbook covers community  involvement on a regional level. A Group-wide regional community involvement strategy  has been developed. There are well-established  programs and initiatives in place in this area in all  countries where E.ON operates. There are visitors centers for all new build projects, as  well as dialogs with the general public and increasingly  so for the immediate neighborhoods of our sites. Develop programs to address  community energy safety issues  in various countries A Group-wide Public Energy Safety Standard has been  agreed as part of our Safety Policy.  2008 – 2010 Measures Review Marketplace & Community Implement the Energy for  Children program NEW: Coordinate employee  volunteering activities The Energy for Children program has been introduced  Group-wide. Staff from over 1,700 day care centers have  been trained as part of this flagship project in Germany. A guideline has been developed to promote employee  commitment on a regional level. Volunteering programs  have been implemented in various countries. Climate Protection & Environment Develop a Group-wide climate  protection and environment policy,  assess current implementation of  management systems and  determine Group-wide application  of a management system A Group-wide policy for climate and environmental  protection (E.ON Global Climate Change and  Environment Policy Statement) has been developed,  and appropriate management systems implemented in  all operational units. Assess the impact of climate  change on E.ON assets Risks resulting from climate change or adaptation to  climate change have been included in E.ONs risk  mapping. Develop a Group-wide biodiversity  assessment and policy Biodiversity has been integrated into the E.ON Global  Climate Change and Environment Policy Statement.  Biodiversity is also part of the comprehensive analysis of  our business activities (Sustainable Impact Assessment,  SIA) undertaken for new infrastructure projects. Identify targets for advanced  emission standards at newbuild  coal-fired power plants Targets for advanced emission standards have been  developed. All new coal-fired power plants and those  under construction in 2010 meet these targets. Develop an E.ON guideline  on Lifecycle Analysis (LCA)  for products, services and  technologies to analyze  environmental impacts A guideline for analyzing the environmental impact of new  processes, products, services and technologies has been  developed. Develop Carbon Accounting  Processes for E.ON A new accounting process for Scope 1, 2 and 3  greenhouse gases has been implemented.  2008 – 2010 Measures Review Health & Safety Evaluate reports on incidents in  hazardous industries (e. g. Baker  report) and draw conclusions for  E.ON Conduct safety assessment on  all Top Executive Group members  (Safe.TEG project) and facilitate  action plans for individuals and  for market units Develop and implement a Group  safety management system Develop and implement  harmonized, Group-wide  minimum safety standards Develop a policy regarding  contractors and subcontractors  safety performance Develop and implement a central  incident reporting system (injuries,  near misses and hazardous  occurrences) Assess the current situation of  health management in the Group Develop a Group-wide health  strategy and policy The relevant reports have been analyzed, critical points  identified, and safety trainings revised accordingly. As a  follow-up project, E.ON is developing a guideline to  address process/plant safety issues Group-wide. As an outcome of the Safe.TEG project, training sessions  have been held for executives and senior management.  Senior management pays great attention to overarching  health and safety issues, and also acknowledges this to  employees and the public. Observation of healthy and  safety issues is promoted by including executive and  senior management in executive incentive schemes,  among other measures. Group management adheres strictly to the Occupational  Health & Safety Management guidelines. Continuous  improvement is the systems guiding principle. Almost  80 percent of our sites have already attained  OHSAS 18001 certification or are on track to do so. A set of eight corporate H&S Standards has been  developed and approved by the E.ON HSE Governance  Council. A corporate H&S standard on Contractor and business  partner management has been developed and  approved. Implementation and dedicated trainings are  ongoing. An HSE incident notification and reporting module has  been developed. Group-wide implementation is ongoing. The assessment has been completed. Its results form the  basis for further steps and will also influence the  Group-wide health strategy. Health management is in development, as it will form a  major part of our revised Group-wide Health & Safety  policy.  2008 – 2010 Measures Review Assess the current situation  regarding Group diversity  management Develop a health management  toolkit Develop an aging workforce action  plan The CR Work Program comprises the objectives and measures of the Corporate  Responsibility, Climate Protection & Environment and Health & Safety departments at  E.ONs Group Management. Health & Safety The health management toolkit has been developed.  General health issues will be addressed annually  Group-wide. Promoting and supporting diversity is important to E.ON  as an international company. In particular, defining  specific targets and establishing support programs has  significantly promoted the advancement of women. The aging workforce issue has been integrated into  various parts of the HR strategy, such as health  management, work-life balance, and employability.  Focus on Themes Through Materiality Analysis Our   have many requirements, which give us important points of reference stakeholders for our   and  . As part of our  , we therefore regularly CR practice reporting CR Strategy analyze in a systematic process those issues most important to our stakeholders. Since 2006 we have published the results annually in a Materiality Matrix, which we also use to develop our strategic CR approach. Evaluating Internal and External Sources As a first step we collect issues from individual groups through stakeholder dialogs, opinion polls and feedback from our topic requests, as well as researching external sources. Simultaneously, we survey experts in various of our departments as representatives of stakeholder groups about topics of interest to them in 2010. This also allows us to feed our stakeholders' concerns into the Group and integrate them in our management processes. Systematic Weighting We assess the topics during the information-gathering stage according to their urgency for specific stakeholder groups and all stakeholders collectively. In this we take individual evaluations into account, for example exactly when specific issues are highly important to a particular stakeholder group. We subsequently enter each topic into the Materiality Matrix according to our assessment of its relevance; the Matrix shows the relationship between a topic's relevance to stakeholders (on the y-axis) and to E.ON (on the x-axis). Weve also added a selection of links to the Matrix with supplementary information. Additionally, this year we've chosen to present topics in bullet-point form: this presents information more precisely compared to allocating them into the four fields of the Matrix as we previously did. For a larger interactive view please click the link in the right-hand column. 24 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29232.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  For an interactive enlarged view, please click on the link in the right column. Changes in Materiality since 2009 Compared to 2009 there are some changes in the Materiality Matrix which are due to changing stakeholder priorities and a refined analysis methodology. New issues have come to the fore, existing ones have been expanded and sub-topics have been divided or removed from the Matrix. At the same time, we've created a better focus for the topics through the creation of new groupings, reducing their number and giving them a sharper profile. For example, we have combined Effects of Climate Change, Greenhouse Gas Emissions and International Climate Protection into Climate Protection in this year's Matrix, making it one of the three most important topics. You can find further information about the topic groups through the links in the interactive Matrix. Top of the agenda are also Energy Efficiency, Pricing and Balanced Energy Mix. Other highly-rated issues are Renewables, Innovation as well as Corruption & Bribery, whereas Attractive Employer, Supply Reliability and Customer and Product Safety lost relevance compared to the previous year. In our choice of   in the current CR Report 2010 we considered the Focus Topics assessments from the Materiality Matrix in an internal workshop. 25 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29232.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Core Policies and Standards We recognize our global and societal responsibility as one of the core values of E.ON's corporate culture and have established clearly defined policies to embed this. These policies apply Group-wide, to individual companies in which we are majority shareholders as well as to processes and shareholdings for which E.ON bears operative responsibility. Contractors and suppliers are required to meet our minimum standards when working on our behalf. Our policies and standards are an integral part of our overall   and define a CR Strategy binding operational framework that supports us in achieving our objectives. As we are faced with ever-changing challenges, our policies continually evolve to meet these challenges consistently across the Group. Our policies and standards govern the following five areas: Environmental Management Human Rights Responsible Procurementand Biomass Purchasing Health and Safety Community More detailed information on the individual policies can be downloaded from the links in the right-hand margin of this page. Environmental Management We recognize that the energy we produce and supply has a significant impact on the environment- globally from our greenhouse gases, regionally and locally. We work continually to mitigate and reduce this impact. We are also committed to providing our customers with energy efficiency advice in line with our commitment in the E.ON Global Climate Change and Environment Policy Statement, which came into effect in October 2008. As part of this, our Environmental Management Group Policy details the ambitious minimum climate change and environmental protection targets we have set ourselves, which often go beyond legal requirements. In detail, the Group Policy: Describes how our environmental and climate protection activities are organized, Sets out the minimum requirement we apply, and Defines the basic framework for environmental management at E.ON. 26 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29226.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  All of our subsidiaries that have a significant environmental impact are required to have a certified Environmental Management System (EMS) that fulfils the criteria of the EN ISO 14001 (or European EMAS II) standards. E.ON operational units using any other EMS must adapt their processes accordingly. Human Rights It is E.ON's responsibility to raise awareness of human rights issues among our employees and to encourage them to safeguard these rights. This is why we work together with our suppliers, contractors, employees and managers to increase their ability to protect human rights. In brief, as laid down in the Human Rights Policy Statement of the E.ON Group which came into force in November 2008, we ensure: diversity and equality in the workplace; the provision of a good and safe working environment; freedom of association and collective bargaining; the exclusion of child and forced labor; the protection of local communities and indigenous peoples. Responsible Procurement Price and performance are important factors when it comes to making procurement decisions- but E.ON also takes its suppliers' environmental and social standards into careful consideration. We therefore carry out audits at our suppliers' facilities to monitor their CR standards. Not only that, we create risk profiles for our suppliers as part of the E.ON Responsible Procurement Policy, valid since March 2007. The Policy provides overarching guidance for procurement and is augmented by specific guidelines such as the new responsible biomass policy. The Responsible Procurement Policy's principal objectives for our contractual partners, as suppliers of goods and services, are to: ensure human rights are respected and ensure appropriate working conditions for employees; minimize the environmental impact of our business; maintain high standards of ethics and business integrity. Biomass Purchasing E.ON increasingly uses biomass for energy generation, thereby offsetting the use of coal or other non-renewable resources. Biomass as a fuel provides business opportunities. However, biomass purchasing and trading also carries societal, environmental and reputational risks. E.ON addresses these risks through the Biomass Purchasing Amendment to the E.ON Responsible Procurement Policy. The Amendment has been in force since November 2009 and establishes: what types of biomass may be used for energy and biogas generation, and under which conditions; a ban on the use of human food as biomass for the above purposes; that the use of animal feed and renewable crops grown as energy sources and agricultural residue for fuel is only permitted within the corresponding national or EU legal boundaries- and only insofar as it does not distort local or global price stability and security of supply; 27 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29226.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  that timber and other forestry products may only be used for energy and biogas generation insofar as they are certified to meet corresponding international standards such as FSC and PEFC. Health and Safety Our goal is to make E.ON the safest company in the energy sector wherever we operate. The health and safety of our employees is of paramount importance to us. The E.ON Health & Safety Policy Statement, in force since October 2008, establishes a comprehensive process for monitoring safety performance and describes E.ON's organization of occupational health and safety. E.ON's subordinate Safety and Occupational Health Management Group Policy sets out the minimum standards that we require Group-wide and from our contractors. In 2010, E.ON defined mental health as a special Group-wide focus. E.ON examines issues relating to mental health both from a purely psychological perspective and in combination with physical health problems. We aim to reduce illness and absenteeism rates, thereby increasing our productivity. Community The community framework has been in place since 2007. We recognize that our success as a company is directly tied to the well-being of the communities where we operate. Our objective here is to be leaders in Corporate Community Involvement- with a strategic focus on supporting local programs related to our electricity and gas business. Those programs address energy needs, energy education and climate change issues of global concern. Key Community initiatives running globally cover areas such as: Energy for ,   and  . Children Employee Involvement Vulnerable Customers 28 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29226.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  With Arguments for Better Parameters It is part of our responsibility as a company to evaluate the consequences of the economic, energy and environmental policy decisions that affect our corporate strategy and to communicate the results of our analyses to policy makers. One motivating factor for political dialog is achieving more certainty for planning investments. We continuously develop and test   to respond effectively to the  of a new technologies challenges sustainable, eco-friendly society. To accomplish this efficiently and on a large scale, we need official support. Lobbying is part of the democratic process. It is legitimate and necessary for companies, scientific institutions and other interest groups to seek dialog with policy makers to advocate for their interests. For this reason, most countries and the European Union have laws that clearly define its place in the legislative process. But that is not all- pursued responsibly, political dialog can make a contribution to the development of society. Companies often provide government officials and administrators with expertise from their scientists or research divisions that form the basis for important decisions. At the same time, it is essential that lobbying is carried out in a responsible manner. This is why we have developed the following parameters, which we adhere to scrupulously: Transparent Processes Our corporate communication guidelines define standards for information conveyed by E.ON and regulate responsibilities, processes and instruments. This includes management systems for information and political dialog, which guide the company's representatives in structuring their lobbying work in a transparent and aboveboard manner. Truthfulness In addition, our guidelines define how we disseminate information. We neither release nor distribute selective information or misleading publications containing inaccurate or incomplete facts. If this should happen unintentionally, we issue a correction immediately. Laws and Regulations E.ON respects the provisions of European law and national legislation. We follow the applicable regulations when participating in committees and political working groups. Furthermore, E.ON is an active member of numerous associations and initiatives and abides by their rules. We use the European Parliament's accreditation procedure for lobbyists to register our representatives to the EU. At present E.ON and other companies are lending our support to an initiative to introduce a similar accreditation process in Germany. 29 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/42160.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Self-imposed Commitments In all of our activities, E.ON adheres to our principles of ethical behavior. One example of this self-imposed commitment is the  . The standards for E.ON Code of Conduct responsible conduct laid out in this code underpin and guide the behavior of every employee. No Unfair Influence Our   state that we will give no gifts or grant other benefits to Guidelines on Benefits government officials that could convey even the slightest impression of trying to influence the decision-making process or arrange a quid pro quo. Targeting policy makers with gifts or contributions in anticipation of pending official decisions is categorically forbidden. We respect the dignity of the individual and their right to form an opinion independently. 30 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/42160.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Continuing to Develop Responsible Business Practices All of E.ON's business activities are founded on our solid commitment to business ethics and Corporate Responsibility (CR). These represent an integral part of our corporate culture. A token of this commitment is our decision to uphold the aims of the United , which we signed in 2005. By setting standards for responsible Nations Global Compact business actions, the Global Compact also establishes important criteria with which we can shape the direction of our company's CR activities. This also includes our internal systems for Monitoring and Compliance, which provide us with the necessary orientation to achieve responsible business practices. General Governance Approach E.ON sees corporate governance as the basis for responsible and value-oriented company management. Excellent corporate governance is essential to the sustainability of our operations and our continued business success. This encompasses our business principles, our organizational, management and supervision practices, and our internal and external control mechanisms. Risk Management Monitoring Forward thinking and effective risk management are prerequisites for a company's success. Our risk management system thus aims to identify potential risks early on and systematically guide our decision-making. We have incorporated appropriate measures into E.ON's overall organizational structure, including Group-wide guidelines, a standardized strategy, planning and controlling processes, producing separate risk reports and establishing a Risk Committee. The effectiveness of our Early Risk Warning system is reviewed regularly by our Internal Audit Department- and, as required by law, also by our statutory auditors. Reporting Compliance Violations Every employee in every part of the Group can report suspected breaches of compliance- anonymously, if desired- to the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) of E.ON AG. To facilitate this, we set up a whistleblowing system in 2010, run by a law firm on behalf of E.ON. Employees can report violations by e-mail to a dedicated global address, or by calling the whistleblowers' hotline, available in 16 countries in the national language. External lawyers receive these reports, and can then pass them on anonymously to the CCO 31 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29225.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  where appropriate. Using an external law firm as a neutral body gives whistleblowers extra security to report suspected violations without fearing negative consequences or reprisals. This also makes it possible for whistleblowers to communicate anonymously with the CCO and respond to further inquiries by using the external lawyers as a third-party conduit. Compliance Organization: Ensuring Rapid Action through Local Compliance Officers Every E.ON business unit, on both a global and regional level, has a Compliance Officer who reports directly to the Chief Compliance Officer at E.ON Group headquarters. The unit in which a Code of Conduct or Compliance rule is breached is immediately responsible for investigation, cessation and sanction of the breach. Compliance Officers at units then immediately file reports about alleged breaches, inform the CCO, and agree on the results of the investigation and necessary follow-up measures together with the CCO. Corporate Audit has an obligatory involvement in all of these investigations. The Areas of Activity of the Chief Compliance Officer The CCO reports to the E.ON Board of Management and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on compliance-related issues. These issues are antitrust law, capital market law and insider rules, fraud, corruption and the Code of Conduct. The CCO is also responsible for updating the Code of Conduct and the compliance regulations on a regular basis. The Compliance Committee advises the CCO in this regard. Decisions regarding amendments to the Code of Conduct and other compliance regulations are made by the Board of Management. The CCO also determines the structure of the compliance organization applied in individual units and prioritizes corresponding compliance goals together with the units. The ongoing implementation of compliance standards is then monitored by Corporate Audit worldwide. E.ON Supports Fair Competition Since the deregulation of energy markets at the end of the 20th century, E.ON has established itself as a successful performer in a competitive market environment. Competition compliance means adhering to national and international competition rules on issues such as collusion with competitors on price, customers or capacity, and the division of regional markets. An Expert Team for Corruption Monitoring and Fraud Detection We strive to operate our business in a way that avoids all forms of corruption. As part of our compliance framework, we have created an expert Fraud Detection and Investigation team within the area of Corporate Audit. This team is a key element in E.ON's efforts to fight corruption and fraud. As part of our commitment to the UN Global Compact, we have pledged to combat all forms of corruption worldwide, and have embedded this in our  and our  . CR Strategy Code of Conduct 32 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29225.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Our Reporting Approach - Overview Since 2008 E.ON AG's annual Corporate Responsibility (CR) reporting has mainly appeared online. You can access all content on the first navigation level at www.eon.com under "Responsibility". Old reports are available in the  . Archive We strive to ensure balanced reporting of the environmental, social and commercial aspects of our business activities. As we do so, we feel it is important to present a transparent and comprehensive overview of our strengths and weaknesses. In selecting the topics for our CR reporting we are guided by the key CR topics in our  . Materiality Matrix General Structure of our Online Reporting The web pages under the headings of  , including Reporting and  CR Management CR  are the core of E.ON AGs CR Report 2010. Other headings,  ,  Performance Dialog Focus Topics and   are intended to provide additional information that complements the CR CR in Practice Report 2010. Several web pages in the Responsibility channel contain links to other Group pages with information on CR topics. The Responsibility channel provides a platform on which we present our commitment in depth. This explains why our online reporting is more detailed than the publications available for download, such as the E.ON CR Reporting 2010 PDF file. In 2011 our print publications also include a  which will appear in June. It CR Magazine supplements our in-depth reporting online and picks up on the   presented there. Focus Topics We also present information on how E.ON meets its social responsibilities in a number of other publications, such as the Annual Report and our Strategy & Key Figures brochure. CR Report 2010: Progress in the Reporting Period Our reporting is aligned with the guidelines of the  (GRI), in which Global Reporting Initiative we have included the Electric Utilities Sector Supplement. At the same time, our CR reporting is also our progress report with reference to the United Nations  . In 2010 we Global Compact added to our CR reporting other key figures in line with the German Association for Financial Analysis and Asset Management (DVFA) and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies (EFFAS) standards. This is intended to increase our reports comparability and to make access to information easier for financial communities interested in CR issues. We are one of the first companies in Germany to offer standardized  . ESG key figures CR Report Audit As in previous years, key aspects of the CR Report 2010 were  by auditors verified PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). This includes most of the web pages under the headings of CR  as well as parts of the   section with key indicators. Verified Management CR Performance content is marked with "Reviewed 2010"; it is valid until publication of the next CR Report and will not be updated during the course of the year. Continuous Updates for Web-based Reporting 33 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/42834.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  For a more flexible response to developments in the reporting period we use the capabilities of the Internet and update our online content under the headings of  ,  and  Dialog Focus Topics CR . This supports our aims of establishing the Internet as a central information in Practice platform for our stakeholders and offering better  . dialog opportunities Reporting Approach The CR Report published by E.ON AG in May 2011 is the Group's seventh successive report. It covers the period from January 1 to December 31, 2010, and is available in German and English. The copy deadline for the established content for the CR Management and Reporting pages of the report was March 31, 2011. The next CR Report will be published in the second quarter of 2012. Target groups for our CR reporting are our investors, rating and ranking agencies, CR opinion leaders, such as decision makers in the fields of politics, civil society and science, and our employees. Feedback from the different user groups, such as that which we received in response to our 2009 reporting, is continuously evaluated and the findings are fed into the creation process for our various publications. The E.ON CR Report is a Group report. Its object is E.ON AG, including any shareholdings it holds directly. At year-end 2009 the Group structure was renewed. Existing market and business units were transferred to global and regional units, although for the 2010 reporting period and earlier, the previous names are valid. As we sold the U.S. Midwest market unit during the course of 2010, we have adjusted our consolidation basis for Group-wide CR key figures and deducted the unit retroactively to 2008 (as in the Annual Report). Through this, we intend to achieve better comparability of our CR performance on the Group level. As part of our E.ON cleaner & better energy strategy, we have deliberately strengthened the Group level and only take into account CR issues from our regional and global units where they have relevance for Group reporting. Any exceptions to this are marked accordingly. The information in the report invariably relates to all subsidiaries and power plants in which E.ON has a majority holding and which are fully consolidated in the financial statements. To improve legibility, we avoid using double-gender pronouns. 34 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/42834.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Independent Assurance Report1 To E.ON AG, Dsseldorf We have performed a limited assurance engagement on selected areas of the Corporate Responsibility Reporting 2010 of E.ON AG, Dsseldorf. The CR Reporting is released as an online version on www.eon.com/responsibility2 Based on our assignment, our assurance engagement has been applied to the websites under the heading of CR Approach (the "CR Approach websites") as well as selected performance indicators on the Performance Report 2010 sections ("the CR Performance websites"). For better traceability content reviewed by PwC is marked with a "Reviewed 2010" sign. Management's Responsibility E.ON AG's Board of Managing Directors is responsible for the preparation of the CR Reporting in accordance with the criteria stated in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3 (pp. 7-17) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Materiality, Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Sustainability Context, Completeness, Balance, Clarity, Accuracy, Timeliness, Comparability, and Reliability. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the CR Reporting and the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the CR Reporting. Practitioner's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on the work we performed as to whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the "CR Approach websites" and selected pages and performance indicators on the "CR Reporting websites" have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the above mentioned criteria of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3 of the GRI. We have also been engaged to report on recommendations for the further development of CR Management and CR Reporting on the basis of the results of this engagement. We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000. This standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement such that we are able to express our conclusion with limited assurance. In a limited assurance engagement the procedures for gathering evidence are less 35 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29265.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  comprehensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend upon the practitioner's judgment. Within the scope of our work we performed amongst others the following procedures: Interviews with representatives of the Corporate Responsibility department in charge of the preparation of the CR Reporting on the process of establishing the group-wide CR Reporting 2010 and internal controls supporting this process. Interviews with management of specialist departments in charge of Corporate Responsibility, Health,Safety, Security & Environment, Community Involvement, Technology and Innovation und Human Resources Controlling. Inspection of documents describing the CR Management approach and the CR Work Program. Review of E.ON's materiality process to determine relevant topics for the CR Reporting 2010. Examination of definitions on selected CR Indicators and review of documentation of requirements on the group-wide processes for collecting, analysing, and aggregating CR Data. Site visits at Group Management in Dsseldorf as well as the Regional Units Germany, Sweden, Russia, Italy and the Global Units Global Gas and Trading as part of our sample assessments of relevant systems and processes. Evaluation of the consistency of the statements provided on the "CR Approach websites" with the findings obtained during our engagement. Coordination with the statutory auditors at E.ON AG with regard to audit procedures performed as part of the 2010 statutory audit of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements on indicators adopted for the CR Reporting and use of this relevant work. Conclusion Based on our limited assurance engagement, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the "CR Approach websites" and selected pages and performance indicators on the "CR Performance websites", have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the above-mentioned criteria of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Vol. 3 of the GRI. Additional Recommendations Without qualifying our conclusion above, we express the following recommendations for the further development of CR Management and CR Reporting: We recommend to E.ON continuing the development of a Group CR Strategy and a Group CR Program including ambitious qualitative and quantitative medium and long-term targets. The CR and HSE organisation should support and monitor the roll-out to the Global and Regional Units. We recommend establishing a group-wide steering body to amend the CR organisation with regard to the new Group Structure and to support the implementation of CR into day to day business. 36 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29265.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  E.ON should further clarify and document group-wide definitions of key CR performance indicators. We further recommend the optimisation and documentation of data collection processes from data source to group management.

According to our self assessment, E.ON's 2010 CR reporting complies with application level B+ of the GRI guidelines. About the Global Reporting Initiative The GRI was established in 1997 with the goal of developing an internationally recognized guideline for voluntary reporting of the economic, ecological and social performance of organizations. The GRI guidelines comprise indicators for all sectors and all types of organization that aim to achieve transparent, comparable and stakeholder-oriented CR reporting. The current G3 standard was introduced in 2006. There are also sector supplements with industry-specific indicators. The EUSS applies to companies in the electric utility sector. Our 2010 CR Reporting We see a clear trend towards a need for more specific information among our . In 2009 we revised the indicators on which we report to comply with the stakeholders requirements of the final version of the EUSS and, along with the general indicators of the GRI guidelines, adapted them to meet the changing information needs of our stakeholders. We do not consider some indicators to be material and/or significant. In these cases, we have added an appropriate comment in the GRI Content Index. GRI Content Index The GRI Content Index shows at a glance how E.ON's reporting meets the requirements of the GRI. The Index lists: Which indicators we report on and to what extent. Where they can be found on our website, in our Company Report, Annual Report, and Strategy & Key Figures publication. Which indicators we are unable to include due to certain circumstances. In addition, the GRI Content Index includes comments and additional information on selected indicators. 38 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29264.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  E.ON AG Responsibility > CR Approach > Managing Our Responsibility > CR Strategy Responsibility > CR Approach > Managing our Responsibility > Monitoring and Compliance Responsibility > CR Approach > Managing Our Responsibility > Policies and Standards Responsibility > CR Approach > CR Program Responsibility > CR Approach > Managing Our Responsibility > Materiality Analysis Responsibility > CR Approach > Commitments > UN Global Compact Responsibility > Focus Topics > Responsible energy consumption Responsibility > Focus Topics > Sustainable Innovation Responsibility > Focus Topics > Carbon Footprint Responsibility > Focus Topics > Nuclear Value Chain Responsibility > Focus Topics > Responsible Fuel Procurement AR (40-47, 48-55) CoR (4, 9, 10ff., 27) Responsibility > CR Approach > Commitments CoR (3) Profile The table below lists the individual reporting elements.

In Germany, company pension plan benefits are a component firmly integrated in the overall remuneration system. In addition to an attractive pension scheme financed by the Group, E.ON offers its German employees the possibility of earning additional benefits by paying contributions. Depending on their individual needs and possibilities, employees can choose between a number of different models (such as direct life assurance schemes, supplementary pensions in accordance with the statutory provisions and/or the conversion of remuneration) and also combine these possibilities. AR (5ff., 11, 43ff.) E.ON regularly investigates what impacts climate change- e.g. gradual temperature increase or extreme weather- has on the business. In this context we evaluate potential physical risks for our employees as well as material risks to our buildings and network systems. In addition we analyze financial risks like accidents.

Additional and Complementary Documents Regarding our Corporate Responsibility 70 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29245.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Since 2009 we have used NPS as the key indicator to measure our progress in improving customer satisfaction: We introduced NPS, which had previously only been measured in the UK, to Germany, Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic during 2010. In 2011 we also intend to implement the program in Spain. To test implementation all business units received a set of ambitious targets. All regional units exceeded their targets. We also assessed the engagement of our employees here, and used the results to set new targets. More than half of the frontline employees in the units involved were included in the NPS process during 2010. In total they gathered individual feedback from more than 100,000 customers. Each regional unit was asked to explain how it had evaluated the feedback and how this had been used to improve its customer interaction. To measure our NPS we ask our customers to state on a scale of 0-10 how likely they would be to recommend us to a friend or colleague. We also ask them for reasons for this rating, and then we use this customer feedback to introduce improvement measures. Examples: Some customers of E.ON UK said, for example, that they didn't like the process for entering meter readings online. We therefore simplified the system and the process, made it quicker and more user-friendly. The changes led to more customers using the system and improvements in NPS results. Customers of E.ON Vertrieb Deutschland (E.ON Sales Germany) told us that some of our letters were unclear and hard to understand, while other letters had been received several times. We subsequently identified possibilities for improvement in the presentation of content and preparation of letters. This, too, led to less criticism from our customers and an improved NPS score. Some of our regional units received awards for their successes: E.ON Italia was Steps towards more Customer Orientation We have developed a strategic approach for improving our customer orientation and being more responsive to our customers' needs, which applies to all markets. You can find further information under  . In 2010 we achieved important progress in CR in Practice this area: We expanded successful customer relations management based on Net Promoter  (NPS) to more regional units. Score We introduced individual product solutions, from energy-saving, through fixed-price to green offers in several markets. We gave customers the possibility to manage their own energy use with smart meters and online portals, such as E.ON EnergieNavi. We introduced various educational initiatives on saving energy, e.g. in kindergartens and schools. NPS: Improving Customer Loyalty 71 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29277.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  We support our customers through a wide range of efficiency solutions and encourage them to save energy. In 2010 they were able to use the following opportunities, amongst others: Our online portals, such as E.ON EnergieNavi in Germany or EnergiDirigent in Sweden, enable our customers to use interactive tools to regulate their consumption. Smart meters enable customers to check their energy consumption around the clock: this helps to control their own consumption and identify tangible savings. Across the Group we have already supplied more than a million households with smart meters, mostly in Sweden and Spain. Customers in Germany and Italy who saved more than ten per cent of energy compared to the previous year received a credit note of EUR 50. Those who switch to combined gas and solar heating, gas-driven heat pumps or micro-cogeneration systems, or buy a new natural gas car, receive energy credits for this in Germany. We also offer our business customers, including those in the housing industry, energy audits and tailored energy-management concepts. From April 2009 to the end of 2010 we visited 150 German cities and communities with our EnergieSpar-Mobil trucks to promote energy efficiency. In 2011 another 200 such events are set to follow. Through Smart Homes in Sweden, the UK and Germany we're participating in an international project on the research, communication and eventual market launch of new energy-efficiency technologies. We approach schools and kindergartens in various countries to raise even very young children's awareness of energy saving. In 2009 E.ON and the Around 27 million customers received services and product solutions from E.ON in 2010. As a key aspect of our customer orientation we continuously widen our product range and adjust it to the needs of our customers. Although product development is managed regionally to suit the specific market and customer preferences, during 2010 some of the following examples prevailed in several markets: Our energy-saving products give customers, for instance in Germany, the Czech Republic and Italy, incentives to lower their energy consumption. They receive bonus points for every kWh saved compared to the previous year, which they can spend on particular services. Thanks to special products with fixed prices or price ceilings, customers in Germany, Sweden and the Czech Republic amongst others have more security in times of fluctuating energy prices. Customers in Germany and the UK preferring green electricity have an option consisting entirely of renewable energy. In Sweden, we even offer green electricity for all products. recognized for customer satisfaction in gas distribution (Premio Speciale CAI Energia 2009) and E.ON Nordic achieved the highest customer satisfaction ratings among Swedish energy suppliers in the 2010 Svensk Kvalitetsindex survey. Tailored Products Increasing Energy Efficiency 72 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29277.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  We want to help ensure in all our markets that   retain access vulnerable customers to the energy supply. Our range of products includes different social tariffs, depending on the country: in Germany we waived the standing charge for some 21,000 vulnerable customers during 2010, while in the same year at E.ON UK almost 25,000 customers received one of our WarmAssist social products. In Spain, as one of the suppliers of last resort E.ON Espaa supplies low-income households with electricity they can afford. In Romania too, low-income households received credits for their energy supply. E.ON UK made EUR 430,000 available for the Caring Energy fund between April 2009 and March 2010, helping customers to replace old heating systems and appliances. During this time we supported 373 customers through the fund. Natur- und Umweltbildung Bundesverband e.V. (ANU) environmental working group initiated the Leuchtpol project. By 2012 we will have delivered learning modules with energy-experience days and educators at 4,000 nursery schools across the country. We have continued our efforts towards the marketability of decentralized generation and heating solutions with gas-driven heat pumps, micro-cogeneration systems and fuel cells. In Germany we support the Callux Project, a practical trial of fuel-cell heating appliances for one-family homes. We also created the Micro-CHP User Group in Germany to expand the field testing of CHP technologies. Commitment to Vulnerable Customers 73 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29277.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Secure, Affordable and with Decreasing CO  Emissions 2 We continue to develop all power generation types in our portfolio to ensure a reliable and affordable supply, and at the same time systematically reduce our CO  emissions 2 further. You can find more information about our strategic approach under  . CR in Practice In 2010, as part of our new E.ON cleaner & better energy strategy we pledged to reduce the specific CO  emissions from our power plants in Europe by 50 percent by 2020 2 (compared with a 1990 baseline) - ten years earlier than originally planned. We intend to achieve this goal both by using more efficient fossil fuel generation technologies and by continuing to expand our use of renewable energy sources. Nuclear power also plays an important role here. The life-time extension of nuclear power plants, as agreed by the German government in 2010, is an essential condition to achieve our goal. Outside Europe, we strive to be one of the best power companies in each of the regions in which we operate. In 2010, we made good progress, as we: increased installed renewable energy capacity by 600 MW to 3.6 GW; put into operation the first offshore wind park in deep water, alpha ventus; built a new combined-cycle plant in Shatura, which is the first in Russia to be recognized as a UN Climate Protection Project (Joint Implementation), and which saves over a million tons of CO  compared to conventional power plants; 2 were included in the Carbon Disclosure Performance Index, the world's most important index of companies with the best climate protection reporting. CO  Intensity in the E.ON Group 2 Compared to the previous year, in 2010 we improved the CO  intensity of our 2 energy production only marginally, by 0.5 percent. Rounded to two decimal places, the values of 0.42 t of CO  per MWh for the entire Group, and 0.39 t 2 per MWh for Europe (excluding Russia) are equivalent to the previous year. The increased use of renewables was offset by the higher use of coal in the UK. 74 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/35071.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  CO  Emissions from Electricity Generation 2 In 2010, the amount of CO  emitted in our electricity generation, including CO 2  emissions attributable to CHP plants in the UK, increased by 1.7 million to a 2 total of 116.7 million tons. This is mainly due to slight increases in production compared to the previous year, related to the economic recovery. The CO2 emissions at Pan European Gas came to 512,000 tons. Energy Mix of Electricity Generated In 2010, the amount of electricity generated in E.ON's own power plants was 275.5 billion kWh, two percent above the previous years' level of 270 billion kWh. We obtained ten percent of our generated electricity from renewables. Fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil continue to play a large role in our energy generation. As in 2009, their share was again 63 percent in 2010. Another important element in our energy mix is nuclear power, with a 26 percent share of our generated electricity. 75 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/35071.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Natural gas: Power plants with combined cycle gas turbine technology (CCGT) achieve high   and therefore only emit comparatively small thermal efficiencies amounts of CO . Through combining heat and power generation (CHP) even higher 2 efficiency levels can be achieved. In 2010, we brought one of the most efficient and powerful CCGT plants in the world onstream in Irsching, upper Bavaria, with an Wind power: By the end of 2010 we had generation capacity of 3.6 GW (about ten times the amount we had three years ago). The major share comes from onshore wind power. In 2010 we commissioned over 350 MW of onshore wind power, including the wind parks Papalotte Creek 2 in the USA with 200 MW, Wielkopolska in Poland with 52.5 MW and Barao Sao Joao in Portugal with 50 MW. In the area of offshore wind power, we have a capacity of 467 MW. In 2010, E.ON installed around 40 percent of all offshore wind power generating capacity installed in Europe. We completed wind farms at Robin Rigg (180 MW) off the UK's northwest coast, Rdsand II (207 MW) in the Baltic sea off Denmark and alpha ventus (60 MW) in the German North Sea. Further wind farms with a total capacity of 3 GW are under development or construction; these include London Array, a cooperation project with Dong Energy and Masdar. The first construction phase with a capacity of 630 MW will be connected to the grid in 2012. After completion of the second phase, London Array will have a capacity of 1 GW.  We have over 4.8 GW of hydroelectric capacity from river and Hydroelectricity: pumped-storage power plants. In 2010, E.ON worked mainly on the construction and expansion of pumped-storage plants, for instance in Waldeck and in south-east Bavaria, which help amongst other things to balance out fluctuating generation from renewables.  Since 2008, we have run a 44 MW wood-fired power station at the Biomass: Steven's Croft site in Lockerbie, Scotland. The plant is one of the largest pure-biomass power stations in the UK and represents a saving of 140,000 tons of CO  every year compared to conventional generation. Other biomass projects with 2 a total capacity of 400 MW are in various stages of development. Progress in Expansion of Renewables Progress in our Conventional Generation Portfolio 76 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/35071.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  efficiency factor of nearly 60 percent. With the highly efficicent gas-fired generating unit Irsching 4 planned for 2011, we will have achieved a total efficiency factor of over 60 percent for the first time ever. Further CCGT power plants have been brought onstream in mile Huchet, France; Scandale, Italy; Malenice, Slovak Republic and Shatura near Moscow. The plant in Malenice with an efficiency factor of 58 percent is the most environmentally friendly power station in Slovakia. Shatura was recently recognized by the UN as E.ON's first Russian Joint  as part of the Kyoto mechanism (see below). Implementation Project    plays an important role to achieve our CO  target. Nuclear Power: Nuclear Power 2 Besides our role as operators of such plants we are also cooperating with construction companies such as Siemens and Areva (since 2008). We're also Member of the European Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP).  Our latest coal-fired power plants currently under construction achieve Coal: thermal efficiencies of more than 45 percent and by replacing older plants they save large amounts of CO . For example, the power plant unit under construction 2 at Datteln 4 (1,100 MW), Germany, achieves over 45 percent efficiency. It will supply district heat to about 100,000 households in the central Ruhr region. The combined coal power plant Maasvlakte 3 in the Netherlands cogenerates heat that is piped to local industrial enterprises and residential areas; it will also be fitted to co-fire biomass. What's more, both power plants are designed for retrofitting with a large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) unit. In Maasvlakte we are also building the first large   with EU support. CCS demonstration plant CO  Allowances from Emissions Trading 2 In 2010 we were awarded emission allowances for 75.1 million tons of CO  as 2 part of the national allocation plans through the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The CO  emissions of our power plants included in emissions trading 2 from electricity and heat generation as well as those emitted by E.ON Ruhrgas amounted to 90.4 million tons of CO , 15.3 more than the allocated emission 2 allowances. International Climate Protection Projects 77 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/35071.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  E.ON was included in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) for the first time in 2008. The CDLI is published by a group of 551 institutional investors, representing a joint investment volume of around EUR 51 trillion (USD 71 trillion). In 2010, we also extended the calculation basis for our   and we carbon footprint were included in the newly compiled Carbon Disclosure Performance Index (CPLI). This index assesses the reports of 500 of the largest companies in the world in their efforts to reduce CO  emissions. 48 of these companies were included in the Index. 2 E.ON is involved in   in South-East Asia, North Africa and climate protection projects Russia under the CO  compensation methods defined in the Kyoto Protocol: 2 The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) regulates the allocation of emissions credits for climate-protection projects in developing countries. We have been working on such projects with Bionersis in South-East Asia since 2009. There, we capture climate-damaging methane gas from landfill sites to generate electricity. Over the project duration of 20 years this will avoid 4.5 million tons of CO  emissions. 2 As part of Joint Implementation (JI) we receive certificates for emission reductions in industrialized countries.

Our activities in Research and Development (R&D) must be measured against this requirement. In 2010 E.ON created a Board of Management function for technologies. This underscores the importance we place on innovative energy technologies. See CR in  to find out more about our aims and organizational structure. In 2010 our R&D Practice expenditure amounted to EUR 93 million and we further strengthened our Group-wide R&D activities: With the completion of alpha ventus, Rdsand and Robin Rigg in 2010, E.ON continues to maintain a leading position in the development, construction and operation of offshore wind farms. We invested more in energy efficiency applications, new energy efficiency projects for our customers, in micro CHP, Smart Homes and E-Mobility. We started several projects to test smart grid applications in our distribution network areas. In addition to the development of products for electrical car owners we worked with auto manufacturers to develop charging and billing for electric cars and their integration into the energy system. We increased our activities in research and testing of energy from the sea, such as the use of wave energy. We awarded some EUR 5 million in prize money to research teams for their innovative research proposals on heat storage and concentrating solar power (CSP). Development of E.ON's R&D Expenditure In 2010 E.ON invested a total of EUR 93 million in research, development and demonstration projects; expenditure was EUR 12 million lower than the year before. The main reason for this reduction is that we completed the alpha ventus offshore wind farm. We invested EUR 61 million in our Group-wide R&D activities and a further EUR 32 million in university funding and demonstration projects. Here, the further development of promising key technologies to achieve market readiness is particularly important to us. 79 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/35072.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Renewables: At EUR 13.8 million we reduced our expenditure by EUR 20 million in 2010; the main reason for this reduction is that we completed the alpha ventus offshore wind farm. Alongside established onshore and offshore wind power we aim to develop other technologies such as solar and marine power on a large industrial scale. Fossil Energy: We invested a total of EUR 41.9 million in this area, an increase of almost EUR 8 million compared to last year. The increase in expenditure is due to trial and development work on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, which requires extensive testing. We also We'll be investing a total of EUR 40 million over the period 2006 to 2015 to fund the E.ON Energy Research Center at RWTH Aachen. This renowned university's existing activities will be complemented with new research activities which we supported with EUR 5.5 million of funding in 2010. These are in the areas of electricity generation and storage systems, applied geophysics and geothermal energy, as well as the automation of power supply networks. We're also providing EUR 60 million in funding over several years for the E.ON Research Initiative, which we award for research projects on a range of topics. Here too, the focus lies on researching new technologies that are not yet market-ready. In 2010 we awarded some EUR 5 million for research projects to five research teams from Europe and the US for their innovative research proposals on "Heat Storage and Concentrating Solar Power (CSP)". R&D Budget by Project Type When we break down our R&D expenditure by project type, it's clear that we cover a broad spectrum - from generation, through transport and distribution to sales. Our focus is primarily on  , but also on developing renewable energies fossil fuel technologies further. 80 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/35072.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Renewables: The majority of our   investment goes into wind energy where renewables we're working on new, efficient technologies. One example is a vertical-axis wind turbine we're currently demonstrating in the Swedish city of Falkenberg. It works without a mechanism to align the rotor blades with the wind and operates in conjunction with a generator at ground level, making it very maintenance-friendly. A considerable share went into offshore wind power research work. By the close of 2010, turbines with a capacity of 467 MW came onstream in the UK, Denmark and Germany - with further wind farms with a combined power output of 3 GW currently under construction or in the planning phase. We're also working together with industry-leading companies such as Masdar, a major investment company based in Abu Dhabi, on large projects including the world's largest offshore wind farm in the outer Thames Estuary: the London Array. Alongside wind power, as a second mainstay we're currently developing concentrating solar power (CSP) technology, which uses large concave mirrors to bundle the energy used to run steam turbines. In 2010 we made very positive progress in establishing two 50 MW concentrated solar thermal power plants, which we're currently constructing in a joint venture with Abengoa, the Spanish market leader in solar power plants. One of the plants is due to go onstream as soon as 2011. Furthermore, we're also involved in the Desertec Industrial Initiative - a project with the goal of generating electricity using solar and wind farms in the deserts of North Africa and transporting it to Europe. In addition we're helping to develop new solutions to utilize biomass and marine power. Here we're involved in the Pelamis project to generate renewable electricity from ocean waves. For this purpose, a floating steel sea snake comprising moving, tubular sections was developed. A 180 meter prototype capable of generating a maximum of 750 kW is due to be launched off the coast of Scotland's Orkney Islands in 2011. focused on raising the efficiency of CCGT power plants as well as coal-fired power plants. Nuclear: Nuclear power will continue to play a role in our energy mix. We're involved in developing new, safer materials and improved safety systems. Our investment in nuclear innovations slightly decreased by EUR 1 million to EUR 12.3 million. Transport and Distribution: We slightly decreased our investment in this area in 2010 by EUR 1 million to EUR 7.9 million. Our focus was on energy-storage systems and smart grids. On the road to an energy future with a growing number of renewable energies, we need smart grids and smart meters. These technologies save energy, help with load management and therefore optimize the use of power plants; they also organize the use of small, point-of-use power generation units and energy storage systems. Energy Applications: Here we invested EUR 11.2 million in 2010, representing an increase of almost EUR 1 million compared to the year before. Energy applications, new projects in energy end-use, micro CHP, smart home systems and e-mobility technologies all gained in importance. Example Projects in 2010 81 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/35072.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Fossil Energy: The increase of expenditure on fossil energy is due to the testing and development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology for flue gas from fossil-fueled power plants. We plan to be able to build all new coal-fired power plants with CCS technology by 2020. We're currently conducting some 100 research projects looking at the commercial application of this technology and in total we're spending EUR 15 to 20 million per year on CCS. We plan to construct an initial large-scale demonstration plant (250 MW) at Maasvlakte near Rotterdam in the Netherlands. With efficiencies of almost 60 percent, the latest natural gas-fired power plants with combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) technology already achieve the highest thermal efficiency levels in E.ON's generation fleet. In May 2010, we put into operation one of the world's most efficient and powerful CCGT power plants in Irsching, Germany, following a construction period of roughly two years. With an efficiency of 59.7 percent the plant sets new benchmarks in terms of energy efficiency and minimized environmental impact. Our latest generation of coal-fired power plants currently under construction achieve thermal efficiency levels of over 46 percent. Additionally in 2010 we tested new materials for highly energy-efficient, ultra-high temperature operations up to 700C. Nuclear: Besides our role as operators of such plants we are also cooperate with construction companies such as Siemens and Areva (since 2008). Energy Applications: We installed about a million smart meters in Sweden by the close of 2010, as required by national law. In Spain we will have installed approx. 750,000 smart meters by 2014. By the end of 2010 we fitted 10,000 appliances for end users during field trials in Germany. By 2022, 80 percent of German households are to be supplied with a smart meter. In Sweden, the UK and Germany we launched our international Smart Homes project to bring households up to tomorrow's efficiency level. To support the development of small, in-home micro CHP units we are a partner in the German government-backed Callux project, a large field test of gas-fired fuel cell CHP units in single-family homes. We also founded an industry user group in Germany. In the UK too, we tested fuel cells and Stirling engines. The main research topics are the connection of decentralized units to large data and power networks, and the integration of domestic electronic appliances. On the latter we have been cooperating with BSH Bosch and Siemens Appliances since the end of 2010. Electric cars, as appliances that both consume and store energy, are an important part of tomorrow's intelligent energy world. We concluded our first large-scale e-mobility pilot projects in 2010, including a fleet test with VW and the MINI E project. Additional projects were initiated, such as a study with the German TV Sd (technical inspection institute) and a research partnership with the Spanish city of Santander.

Since 2009 CR compliance has been included alongside economic criteria as a mandatory component of our supplier audits. To this end, we work with an international auditing firm to train our auditors: In the non-fuels sector, our sustainable procurement processes are supported by a standardized, Group-wide IT solution. Known as the Master Data Hub, this system allows us to create greater transparency and helps to increase supplier awareness of the importance of our responsible procurement principles. In addition, in 2010 E.ON employees conducted a total of 46 CR audits among our non-fuel suppliers, in some cases with the involvement of external auditing firms. In the field of coal procurement, we audited a Columbian and a South African coal mine in 2010. Independent external auditors conducted the local CR audits. After the audits, we worked with the mining companies to develop action plans that outlined corrective measures and areas for improvement. Two further audits of coal mines are planned for 2011. In 2010 we worked with an external auditing firm to conduct a CR audit of a uranium processing and enrichment plant in Russia. The on-site inspections examined aspects such as human rights, occupational safety, environmental protection, integrity of business practices and radiation protection. The audit included the examination of documentation before and during the on-site inspections, interviews with relevant department managers and meetings with representatives of the union and neighboring municipalities, as well as visits to different facilities. As part of the audit process, we work with our suppliers to identify concrete areas of improvement and establish timeframes for implementing measures with our support. Should a supplier in some way demonstrate their unwillingness to cooperate or show no potential for improvement, we decide whether to terminate the business relationship on a case-by-case basis. Progress Towards Responsible Procurement Our business activities do not begin with the generation and distribution of energy; the true starting points are the planning and construction of power plants and the procurement of products, services and   for our operations. While procurement is an fuels essential part of our business, it can be associated with effects on people and the environment. Our aim is to minimize the negative impacts. You can find further information about our strategic approach under  . In the course of CR in Practice integrating sustainable procurement criteria and processes, we were able to make progress in 2010 e.g.: Two audits conducted in coal mines. Cooperation with other power utilities as part of the Better Coal Initiative. Its goal is the continuing improvement of the coal supply chain, focusing on coal mines in particular. A Group-wide IT solution was launched to improve transparency and the flow of information in the non-fuels sector. Supplier Qualification and Audits 91 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29272.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  We also intend to cover up to 20 percent of gas supplies from our own sources in the long term. Here we are focusing on the North Sea off Great Britain and Norway, as well as North Africa and Russia. Since August 2010 we have been operating an initial gas production platform located off the coast of Great Britain. It is set to produce more than 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the next 20 years. Our activities in the dynamic market for liquefied natural gas (LNG) form the third pillar of our natural gas procurement strategy. LNG has developed into an important international commodity; transported to the consumers of Europe from numerous source countries by ship, in the future LNG will represent a favorably priced alternative to pipeline gas. Gas Supply by Source Country Due to our long-term contracts, there were only minor changes in our natural gas sources from 2009 to 2010. The total volume of gas purchased by E.ON Ruhrgas in 2010 was approximately 684.5 billion kWh. This year-on-year increase of almost 10 percent can be attributed in part to the economic recovery and in part to below-average low temperatures in some regions. The most important source countries for natural gas were Russia at 27 percent and Norway at 25 percent, followed by Germany (23 percent) and the Netherlands (17 percent). Hard Coal Procured for E.ON Power Stations by Source Country In 2010 E.ON purchased a total of 21,800 kilotons of coal for coal-based power generation, approximately 50 percent less than in the previous year. This can be traced back to our sale of E.ON US on the one hand, and on the other to the divestment of power plants in Germany that was carried out as part of the compromise with the antitrust authorities. These effects were partially offset by increased output at the power plants in Germany and the first-time inclusion of the power plant in Belgium. All other units also processed larger amounts of coal than in 2009. In the U.K., the decrease in the amount of coal purchased is due to the large stocks at hand at the beginning of 2010, which 92 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29272.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Biomass is gaining in importance within our growing renewable energy portfolio. In 2009, our Executive Board drafted and approved a biomass procurement policy to ensure that the effects of our biomass activities are managed responsibly and in accordance with a set of clear and comprehensive principles. These address impacts on the environment, biodiversity and water supplies as well as consequences for global food markets and the regions in which we work. The policy is included in the The world's largest deposits of uranium are found in stable export countries such as Canada and Australia. Furthermore, natural uranium is suitable for storage in large quantities. In 2010, E.ON met the majority of its uranium requirements with natural uranium from Canada, Kazakhstan and Russia, which was then enriched in Europe. In addition, we have our own stocks of natural uranium that originated in Canada, Namibia, Australia and Russia. On average we need approximately 1,600 tons of natural uranium each year to fuel our nuclear power plants in Germany and Sweden. It is our firm belief that we must work with other stakeholders to identify shared approaches to sustainable procurement. This is why we have sought to cooperate with competitors and NGOs in improving social and ecological standards along the supply chain. We have joined forces with seven leading European energy suppliers who also want to see improvements in the coal supply chain, to develop the Better . This initiative aims to ensure the continuous improvement of Coal Initiative sustainability aspects along the coal supply chain, especially at the mining stage. The plan is to define social, ecological and ethical standards, integrate them into business practices, and involve other stakeholders more deeply in this process. were drawn on over the course of the year. Representing 50 percent of all coal purchased, Russia and Columbia are by far our most important source countries for hard coal. Uranium Supply for E.ON Power Plants by Source Country Biomass Purchasing 93 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29272.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  terms of the purchasing agreements signed by our suppliers and covers all of E.ON's activities from the production of our fuels to the generation of heat and electricity for our customers. In 2010 we undertook a full supply chain carbon balance audit of our largest biomass plant, the 44 MW Steven's Croft facility in Scotland. During 2011 we will undertake similar audits for fours plants currently at the development stage. This will allow us to optimize sustainability along the supply chain from the outset. We are also planning to extend the scope of our sustainability audits to include the activities of a number of biomass suppliers. 94 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29272.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  2010 again saw a number of our established CI programs gain external recognition: " ", the German lighthouse project that is part of E.ON's Energy for Leuchtpol Children program, was one of the first recipients of the "Werkstatt N" quality seal awarded by the "German Council for Sustainable Development". In 2009 it was already included in UNESCO's "National Action Plan" for Germany. In 2010 the ZSE Group received the "European Employee Volunteering Award" in Slovakia. The award-winning project, "Best Idea", offers students in technical schools the opportunity to develop their own business ideas in the field of renewable energy or energy efficiency as part of their preparation By 2010 our flagship project " ", which is part of our CI program Leuchtpol Energy for Children, had reached teachers in more than 1,700 preschools. In 2010 the fourth external interim report reconfirmed the especially high multiplier effect of the project in the field of sustainability education. The   initiative was rolled out in Spain, Environmental Champions in Schools Italy and Hungary. Fifty of our employees in these countries volunteered to bring the project to 27 schools. They were supported by Global Action Plan, an international NGO. Energy for Children's first Energy Day was held in January 2010 at E.ON AG. 190 children of employees enjoyed hands-on activities designed to teach them about renewable energy. After garnering success for several years in England and Hungary, "The " e-learning project was also rolled out in elementary and Energy Experience secondary schools in Slovakia. Community Involvement as Part of Corporate Responsibility Since 2007 our Community Involvement (CI) has taken a clear strategic direction. You will find more details under  . Our aim is to share our expertise as one of the CR in Practice world's leading energy companies with the society in which we live and work, making an active contribution to solving the challenges it faces. In 2010 we made important progress in these areas: Expansion and consolidation of our "Energy for Children" projects Outstanding community involvement by our units' employees Expansion of strategic community activities After rolling out our Community Involvement (CI) strategy across the Group, we continue to focus on dialog between units. At the same time, we plan to further expand our CI initiatives in keeping with each unit's needs and opportunities and to move ahead with our Energy for Children program. We are aware that we can achieve more by working in cross-sector partnerships, and intend to make greater use of these in the future. In 2011 we also plan to identify appropriate measurement tools and performance indicators to better monitor our progress in meeting our goals. Energy and Environmental Education: Tremendous Reach and Powerful Effects Award-winning Community Projects 95 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29372.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  In 2010 we spent a total of EUR 40.8 million Group-wide on initiatives that addressed a range of societal issues. Compared to the previous year, this represents a slight increase in our financial commitment to our communities - despite the continuing subdued business environment and our "PerformtoWin" efficiency program. for their future careers. The students are supported by business experts as well as employees of the ZSE Group. The community involvement of E.ON Hungria was honored with the "National Prize for Corporate Volunteering", the only prize awarded in this field in Hungary. Social Investment in 2010 Social Investment by Strategic Focus and Purpose Our social investment can be broken down into three focus areas: Strategic community involvement; Sponsorships that benefit the community, e.g. sponsoring sports and the arts; Financial corporate giving, including  . disaster relief In 2010 almost 60 percent of E.ON's social investment was dedicated to strategic community involvement. This represents progress towards our objective of moving from donations and sponsorships to providing more targeted support to strategic community initiatives. Broken down by purpose, our community expenditure targeted several different areas, with the most support going to science and education.

In monetary terms, this would be the equivalent of over EUR 500,000. The total sum reported for social investment does not include regulatory compliance activities. It also excludes investments in R&D and all customer marketing expenditures. Including these elements would increase the investment figure reported here many times over. use of energy and providing assistance to  . vulnerable customers Approximately 15 percent was invested in cultural and art projects. Employee Volunteer Work 97 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/29372.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  In our new performance assessment system for upper-tier management, more preventive components have been included in the H&S objectives. In addition to quantitative targets, in 2010 we weighted the implementation of the "Safety " (SIP) at 50 percent for the first time. In 2011 the ratio of Improvement Plan preventative components will be further increased. In December 2010 we also finalized standards to underpin the Group's occupational health and safety guidelines. These minimum requirements apply to our global and regional units and partners and cover issues such as risk management, recording near-misses and measures to prevent falls. Our employees are aware that occupational safety is a top priority for E.ON. In the  , 94 percent of employees surveyed were certain Employee Opinion Survey 2009 that everything possible was being done to prevent accidents in their workplace. We offered workshops to around 650 managers both on-site and at the E.ON Academy as part of the Group-wide H&S training initiative. It is the most comprehensive program in the Group and received above-average ratings from participants. In 2011 we plan to carry out coaching at the tier-one management level and launch a new workshop on risk analysis. Occupational Safety - Our Top Priority The workplace safety of our employees and contractors has top priority for E.ON. You will find more information on our strategic approach and our targets under  . In CR in Practice comparison with other companies in the industry, E.ON is currently among the top performers based on our Group-wide accident rate. In the period under review, we also made progress in the following areas: We extended our Health&Safety (H&S) training program. We established a new performance assessment system that includes targets with H&S prevention components and finalized Group-wide standards. The accident rate among our contractors was significantly lower than the target set by the Group. Eighty percent of our units have certified or certification-ready occupational safety systems that meet international standards such as OHSAS 18001. As a whole, the Group-wide occupational safety culture made further advances in this reporting period. However, we are aware that it will take time to make it an integral part of our daily work. The continued harmonization of our international units' H&S activities is also an ongoing process that is far from complete, although the combined TRIF and our newly introduced H&S standards are important building blocks. The recording of less serious accidents improves our understanding of sources of danger, which will in turn help to further reduce our accident figures. H&S Training Program: Successful throughout the Group Widespread Awareness of Occupational Safety Standards Establishing a Culture of Occupational Safety by Setting Targets and Standards 98 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30422.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  More Precise Analysis Using the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Index To better understand potential safety risks in the workplace, we have been compiling the "Total Recordable Injury Frequency Index" (TRIF) since 2008. The TRIF not only records the number of injuries that lead to lost working hours, but also accidents that result in a limited ability to work, or where employees have needed medical attention, but no working hours were lost. In 2010 the Group average was 4.4. Compared to 2009 (4.1) and 2008 (4.6), this shows that our performance has remained constant, despite the small increase from 2009 to 2010. Our goal is to reach a TRIF score of 3.0 for E.ON employees and our partners' employees by 2015. Lost Time Injury Frequency Index 99 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30422.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  E.ON's high safety standards apply equally to our suppliers and contractors. The LTIF figures for our affiliated companies show that our commitment has borne fruit: Since the initial collection of LTIF data in 2006, this figure has improved across all units, in some cases substantially. In 2010 it sank to 2.2, an almost 35-percent improvement compared to the previous year. It was also significantly better than 3.0, the figure we set as our first-time LTIF target for affiliated companies. In 2010, for the first time some E.ON units required external firms to have a In 2010 E.ON's annual accident rate, calculated using the "Lost Time Injury Frequency Index" (LTIF), remained unchanged from 2009 at 2.3. LTIF reflects the frequency of work-related accidents per million hours worked. We failed to meet the Group-wide LTIF target of 2.0. However, the LTIF rates of the majority of our units are significantly lower than those of our regional competitors. We intend to lower our LTIF in the coming years by expanding safety training and continuing to implement our culture of safety, as well as other measures. Lost Time Injury Frequency Index at Affiliated Companies 100 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30422.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Despite our high occupational safety standards, there were five fatal accidents across the Group in 2010: one at E.ON and four at our contractors. We deeply regret each of these fatalities - every single death is one too many. We plan to move ahead with an even stronger culture of occupational safety, for example by involving the top management more closely as safety role models. In 2009 we launched a Group-wide H&S training program and introduced additional financial incentives. certified management system in place or a similar qualification such as the international "Safety Certificate Contractors" standard before awarding them contracts. We also included our contractors in occupational safety education and training programs and safety briefings. Fatal Accidents 101 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30422.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  As we implemented the PerformtoWin program, the relevant trade-union and works-council bodies were intensively involved in a structured communication and advisory process. In 2010 numerous agreements were again reached with employee representatives in Germany and other countries to ensure socially responsible solutions for the workforce. The sale of the E.ON ultra-high voltage transmission system and the associated transfer of the transpower employees to their new employer, TenneT, also took place with the intensive involvement of the relevant employee representatives. With the sale of the E.ON ultra-high voltage transmission system in the spring of 2010, we met the last of our obligations concerning reorganization under our commitment to the EU. Two years earlier, in the context of measures designed to promote competition, we had given an undertaking to the European Commission to sell off our ultra-high voltage transmission system as well about 5,000 MW of generation capacity. Improving our performance is one of E.ON's priorities - the stronger our performance, the more competitive we are in the marketplace. Against this backdrop, in 2010 we continued to implement our PerformtoWin efficiency program through which we aim to realize EUR 1.5 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2011. The program delivered more than EUR 1.1 billion in permanent savings by the end of 2010. In the future, E.ON will no longer make improving efficiency the focus of special programs or projects, but instead seek to firmly embed it in the company's performance culture. Successful Change E.ON is a dynamic corporation. We have transformed ourselves from a German conglomerate to an international investor-owned power and gas company. Following on from our expansion, particularly within Europe, and the integration of our new units, we have turned our attention to a new goal for the coming years: to become a global provider of specialized energy solutions. With this objective in mind, we have set new strategic priorities and created global functional units in addition to regional ones. We made significant progress in 2010, especially in the following areas: Our "PerformtoWin" efficiency program, which was launched in 2008, has been almost completely implemented. Our commitment to the EU Commission has been fulfilled. You will find more information by selecting Work Environment from the Careers menu. Performance as Part of our Corporate Culture Generation Capacity Divested Participation at all Levels Working with Employee Representatives in other Countries 102 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30844.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  In the Central Europe unit, countervailing trends resulted in a slight overall gain in employees. On the one hand, the inclusion of a series of new subsidiaries led to a significant increase in the headcount of the Central Europe East reporting unit. On the other, the workforce in Germany shrank due to the sale of the ultra-high voltage transmission system and the transfer of staff to our new unit, E.ON IT. E.ON UK's headcount declined by eight percent as a result of efficiency measures in the end-customer business and the transfer of employees to E.ON IT. Decreases in E.ON Nordic's workforce can also be traced to restructuring measures and the relocation of IT activities to E.ON IT. In the New Markets segment, the number of employees grew by almost seven percent. The increase is mainly attributable to the integration of a new gas company in the Spain unit and the creation of a centralized maintenance entity in the Russia unit. The new functional organization of IT activities under E.ON IT led to a more than 20 In E.ON units outside of Germany, employee representatives are also included in the reorganization processes. For example, Group Management reports regularly to the European Works Council on transnational measures carried out as part of the PerformtoWin program. Local employee representatives are also involved in accordance with the laws of the respective country and in keeping with customary practice. The Group-wide Workforce At present, the E.ON Group has over 85,000 employees worldwide. This figure does not include our 2,501 vocational trainees and 301 board members and directors. Following the completion of negotiations for the sale of our U.S. Midwest unit, it has been carried as a discontinued operation since the second quarter of 2010. The figures for 2010 and retroactively for 2008 and 2009 have therefore been adjusted to exclude U.S. Midwest. 103 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30844.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  percent increase in Group Management's headcount. The creation of a central management team for fleet management also resulted in employee transfers to Group Management. The number of employees working outside Germany remained nearly unchanged from the end of 2009. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2010 almost 50,000 employees, or around 60 percent of our workforce, were employed outside Germany. 104 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30844.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Creating the Ideal Working Environment The dedication and performance of our employees are vital to E.ON's success as a company. We want to provide our over 85,000 employees with a working environment in which they can make the most of their personal talents, develop to their full potential, feel motivated and enjoy their work. Fair and performance-related compensation and comprehensive training opportunities are core topics for us in this respect. The overarching goal is to ensure we retain our employees in the long term by providing good working conditions and attractive development prospects within the Group. How we also meet the challenges of demographic change is explained on the Careers page of this site in the Work Environment section. In 2010 we were able to make great progress here. In the 2010 and 2011  , in rankings of the Great Place to Work  Institute  recognition of its attractive working conditions E.ON was again ranked among the top 5 employers. The "Learning@E.ON" (LEON) process brings together Group-wide continuing professional development opportunities within an SAP-based system. More than 50 percent of the workforce constantly participates in our employee stock programs. Long Service and Low Turnover Rate The high satisfaction level among our workforce is reflected in long periods of service with the Group and a low turnover rate. Across the Group, the average period of employment with E.ON is 15 years and the employee turnover rate fell year-on-year to 4.5 percent. 105 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/17328.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Regular employee opinion surveys such as E.ON has been conducting since 2004 form an important part of our corporate culture. As an effective management tool, these surveys enjoy high acceptance and recognition among management and employees alike, and achieve participation rates of between 75 and 80 percent. The most recent random sample survey was conducted in the fall of 2009. As we strive to provide our employees with a safe working environment that also meets their needs, we assign high priority to the topics of  ,  occupational health  and  . occupational safety life balance Professional development opportunities at the E.ON Academy and in our units as well as self-tuition options enable lifelong learning. Group-wide HR development costs amounted to around EUR 73 million in 2010. Along with the programs offered by the E.ON Academy, every E.ON employee can also utilize the shared E.ON-wide learning platform "Academy Online" comprising the entire vocational training and professional development offering of more than 70 internal E.ON training suppliers. With the Learning@E.ON (LEON) process, Academy Online can be seamlessly integrated into the Group-wide intranet and progressively rolled out. In the course of 2011, every employee worldwide will be able to access this offering. Keeping the process centrally organized makes cross-Group cooperation easier for HR departments and will trigger improvements by promoting the exchange of best practices. Fostering Performance and Lifelong Learning Employee Opinion Survey Part of Corporate Culture 106 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/17328.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Fair and performance-related compensation forms part of any good working environment. Along with various retirement plans and other benefits, a large proportion of the workforce participates directly in the company's success through employee stock programs and variable compensation systems. In 2010 a total of 20,470 employees in Germany acquired 980,897 E.ON shares. This represents a participation rate, which is constantly above 50 percent. In some cases, the variable compensation of tier-one and tier-two management also takes account of environmental protection and occupational safety targets - with reference to indicators such as the " " Total Recordable Injury Frequency Index (TRIF). Targeted Implementation of Improvements The findings of the 2009 employee survey show a continuing high level of dedication on the part of our employees - a result which also compares well with other companies. A clear majority of respondents say they put our core values and behaviors into practice in the workplace and are happy with their personal work environment and the cooperation within their team. 77 percent are proud to work for E.ON and 80 percent would recommend E.ON as a good employer. There was criticism for the way we deal with change and our internal communication of the company's objectives. We take this feedback seriously, analyze its causes intensively - not least in conjunction with members of the Board of Management - and implement targeted improvement measures at all levels and in all units. The next employee survey is planned for mid 2011. Direct Participation in the Company's Success 107 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/17328.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  In 2010 E.ON joined with twelve other companies to found the Charter of Diversity Association, which provides funding for the Charter of Diversity, a joint initiative of the German federal government and the private sector. It is also committed to shaping the content of Charter activities and embedding its principles more strongly in the business world. E.ON signed the Charter in 2008, committing itself to respecting the principles of promoting diversity as formulated therein. As a partner in the "Synergie durch Vielfalt" (Synergy through Diversity) corporate network, in 2010 E.ON organized a synergy workshop on the promotion of women. The network's purpose is to supplement the Charter of Diversity and serve as a platform for dialog and benchmarking for its members. Our binding guidelines for equal opportunity and the promotion of diversity clearly define our goals and norms in this area: A zero-tolerance approach to discrimination, prejudice and harassment Active promotion and targeted expansion of diversity within the workforce Equality, not homogeneity; respecting individuality Fostering an intensive internal dialog to boost mutual understanding Diversity Embedded in Corporate Culture E.ON employs people from over 100 nations. Group-wide, our workforce includes around 400 expatriates. We are committed to providing a positive working environment to all our employees in all locations. You will find more detailed information under Work Environment on the Careers menu. We actively cultivate the diversity of our workforce as a source of creativity and innovation and thus of our success as a company. The more our people reflect the diversity of society as a whole, the better we can understand the needs of our customers. In 2010 we succeeded in further advancing diversity across the Group: E.ON is a founding member of the "Charta der Vielfalt" (Charter of Diversity) Association. "Total E-Quality Germany" recognized E.ON's equal opportunity excellence. E.ON became one of the first DAX-listed corporations to set a clear goal for increasing the percentage of women in management positions. In the future E.ON will continue to promote the spread of diversity internally and externally, focusing on three priority areas: gender, internationalism and employability. Guidelines for Equal Opportunity and Promoting Diversity Networks for Equal Opportunity External Recognition for Diversity 108 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30841.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  In 2010 we launched a Group-wide gender-diversity project that sets challenging yet realistic goals for increasing the percentage of women in management positions and defines underpinning measures. It was supported by the E.ON AG Executive Board, and top managers from the Group were involved in its drafting. This allowed us to develop a realistic concept that we will begin to execute in 2011. Through the setting of specific goals, our units were given a clear stake in this In 2010 E.ON received the "TOTAL E-QUALITY Award" for equal opportunity in HR policies. The jury gave special praise to our measures for promoting women and achieving a better balance between families and careers. In the 2010 " " competition held by the Great Best Workplace in Germany Place to Work  Institute, E.ON received particularly high marks in the field of  diversity. 98 percent of our employees stated that they are treated fairly regardless of their nationality and ethnic background; 93 percent said the same regarding gender. E.ON Empowers Women Offering women better opportunities for professional growth within the Group has high priority at E.ON. In 2010, as in previous years, women made up around 27 percent of our overall workforce. A total of twelve percent of all managers in the E.ON Group were women. Our goal is to more than double the proportion of women in management positions Group-wide through tailored development and mentoring programs for female managers and management trainees. Today, 28 percent of all junior managers in the Group are women. Creating a Support System for Women in Senior Management Positions 109 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30841.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Since mid-2008 E.ON has made e-learning tools on diversity available. In 2010 more than 300 online training sessions were recorded on the IT system. In addition, the E.ON Academy offers training in intercultural management. Several hundred employees participated in this course in 2010 alone. Our zero-tolerance approach means that we do not accept any discrimination or harassment whatsoever in the workplace. We explain the applicable standards to our employees and provide various instruments for reporting inappropriate behavior, such as whistle-blowing systems. Should these standards be violated, we take appropriate measures to rectify the situation. Since 2008, all employees have been offered online training on the German "Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz" (General Anti-Discrimination Act). process. They share responsibility for reaching our overall target. In addition, we intend to adjust our Group-wide Placement Policy accordingly, giving greater weight to promoting equal opportunity for women in our placement processes in the future. We will also continue with related measures such as mentoring programs, and top managers will provide career development advice to women with high potential. After more than 50 mentor-mentee teams participated in the successful pilot phase of our mentoring program for women managers in 2009 and 2010, we launched a full-scale mentoring program for women junior managers at the end of 2010. Participants in the 18-month program will also take part in our "Ready to Move" professional development program, which will further assist their career advancement. We help our employees to achieve a better   by offering flexible working life balance hours and support for families with children. This also contributes to better career opportunities for women. Zero Tolerance for Workplace Discrimination Intercultural Training Disability Need not be a Handicap: Higher Percentage of Disabled Workers in our Workforce We at E.ON believe that disability must not be allowed to handicap a career. In 2010, the Group's units in Germany employed approximately 2,100 severely disabled people or people with a similar impairment. This represents around six percent of the total workforce, meaning that we were able to increase the ratio by another 0.4 percentage points year-on-year (2009: 5.6 percent). Every year we offer vocational training for severely disabled young people as part of our "Equal Opportunity for All" initiative. We currently employ 37 apprentices with disabilities. All apprentices who completed their training programs in 2010 did so successfully and were offered fixed-term or permanent contracts. 110 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30841.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Throughout Germany, E.ON's "Learning with Energy" initiative assists young people who have not been able to enroll in vocational training because their qualifications are insufficient. The project was again highly successful in 2010, with a placement rate of approximately 78 percent. Each year 550 young people participate in the initiative in 30 locations. After a three-month orientation phase to prepare them for working life, the participants receive seven months of vocational training in local companies. E.ON covers the cost of instruction as well as stipends and ongoing social support for the trainees. The interests of disabled employees in our units are advocated by our representatives for disabled persons, who perform this role on a voluntary basis. In Germany, the Group's Representative Body for Disabled Persons works closely with the company to create appropriate conditions for the employment of severely disabled persons or employees with a similar impairment. The members of the Representative Body also advise our colleagues on specific issues. A Second Chance for Young People to Receive Vocational Training 111 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30841.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Our commitment has demonstrated measurable success. Nine of our Group companies, including Group Management, have been certified in the "berufundfamilie" (work and family) audit conducted by the Hertie Foundation. The audit examines the development of management instruments for sustaining a family-friendly HR policy. We also underscored our dedication to these principles by joining the "Erfolgsfaktor Familie" (Success Factor Family) corporate network in 2008. The mission statement of this organization was hailed as ground-breaking by Ursula von der Leyen, then German Minister for Family Affairs. Harmonizing Work and Private Life Our employees are among our most important  . Together we are working to stakeholders establish a sustainable performance culture throughout the Group, continuously improving our efficiency. We aim to empower our employees to develop to their full potential and strike a balance between their careers and private lives. You can learn more about the programs that make us an even more attractive employer on our Careers pages under Work Environment. In 2010 we took further organizational steps to support our employees in achieving a positive life balance: E.ON supports the "Familienbewusste Arbeitszeiten" (Family-friendly Working Hours) initiative of the German Federal Ministry for Families. We have expanded our spectrum of flexible time models as well as other measures to support families with children. Most of our units in Germany have signed cooperation agreements with external family services consultants and started setting up employee assistance program (EAP) hotlines. The majority of our units offer their employees individual solutions for achieving a better life balance. It is our goal to continue expanding and harmonizing these initiatives in the future. This works to the advantage of both E.ON and our employees, improving and maintaining motivation and performance in the long term. Certified Commitment to Families Different Models Help Employees Achieve a Positive Life Balance The aim of the Family-friendly Working Hours initiative is to give businesses and their employees suggestions for flexible time models that are more compatible with family life. This initiative was launched by the German Minister for Family Affairs in 2010 as part of the Success Factor Family corporate network. E.ON supports the initiative and offers numerous time and organizational models that allow our employees to achieve a better life balance. The most common are arrangements such as part-time jobs. In 2010, more than 7,900 employees throughout the Group had part-time contracts, of which 55 percent were women. These numbers have remained largely unchanged since 2009. 112 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30423.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  In addition to part-time models, E.ON offers numerous other programs that provide direct support to families with children and employees who act as caregivers for relatives. Each individual unit is responsible for introducing these programs and entering into support contracts where applicable. In the context of the "work and family" audit, we committed to a comprehensive expansion of our support for families by 2011. The amount of subsidized daycare available has been increased to a total of 550 hours per week in the Group Management headquarters alone. We also cooperate with external family services providers which offer country-wide assistance and help quickly organize care for children or other family members. A structured return-to-work program makes it easier for employees to reintegrate after parental leave. In dialog with HR managers, individual Each unit offers different flexible time models in accordance with its needs and capacity: Part-time: E.ON Bayern allows job-sharing and gives part-time employees full access to all training and HR development programs. Flextime: At E.ON Sverige and E.ON IT, for example, employees can use flexible working-time accounts. Group Management employs a model of trust-based working hours. Home office: Numerous units make it possible for their employees to work a certain number of hours from home. Sabbaticals: In almost all of our units, in line with specific rules employees can also take a longer break in the form of a sabbatical. As part of the 2010 "German Corporate Health Awards", E.ON Energie received a special award as a "Family-friendly Corporation" in recognition of its effective use of these flexible models. In addition, E.ON Energie's new Group works agreement on family and career has harmonized existing regulations and established uniform standards for its family-friendly corporate culture. Organizing Career and Family Life 113 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30423.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  expectations and requirements are clarified in as much detail as possible. As part of a special partner program, colleagues maintain contact to employees on parental leave and keep them up to date on events within the company as well as developments in their field. The E.ON Academy also offers seminars on topics such as time management, a further example of E.ON supporting its employees in better organizing their daily lives. We continue to set up EAP hotlines - free, anonymous, external hotlines staffed by experts - to assist employees and their family members in difficult situations. Employees with relatives who require special care can take advantage of internal and external advice and counseling. In addition, we organize information evenings on the topic of home-based and eldercare. 114 of 132 http://www.eon.com/en/responsibility/30423.jsp created on: 05/03/2011  Indicators ESG DVFA/EFFAS (PDF, 149 KB) Indicator Guideline for the Financial Market The German Association for Financial Analysis and Asset Management (DVFA) and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies (EFFAS) have developed a guideline for business to measure and compare environmental, social and governance indicators (ESG) more effectively. E.ON reports their ESG indicators according to the DVFA/EFFAS guideline category "Conventional Electricity". We are increasingly aware of the importance of ESG criteria for the financial market.

The personal performance assessment for  E.ON managers also includes criteria such as environmental protection  and health and safety. Depending on their portfolio, the target  agreements of individual board members and managers contain specific  goals relating to areas such as occupational safety, and bonuses are tied  to these goals. In 2010, we adopted our Code of Responsible Conduct  for Business. In this mission statement, we speak in favor of a clear  relationship between services rendered and services received;  financial losses must be reflected in executives earnings.

This includes  specific sustainability criteria relating to occupational safety, health  and environment, as well as legal criteria. All non-fuel suppliers are  regularly audited with regard to sustainability criteria.  External auditors carry out regular audits in the area of fuel  procurement.
