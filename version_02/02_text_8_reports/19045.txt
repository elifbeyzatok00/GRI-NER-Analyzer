Employee compensation, benefits and welfare  Baran targets to provide competitive terms and conditions for all employees, using market  norms as a benchmark and aligning salaries and benefits with individual performance and  contribution. Employees are paid a basic salary and are entitled to a range of benefits which  comply with or exceed national labor laws.

Volunteering opportunities in the community include taking part in education programs for  disadvantaged children or children at risk, or volunteer through pro-bono engineering projects  to build or renovate facilities that improve community life.

In addition, we  constantly work to reduce the impacts generated through daily activities in Baran Group's  offices around the world. Managing our impacts on the environment rests on a strong  platform of adherence to quality standards in all our operations. Baran holds ISO certifications  for Quality (ISO 9001), EHS (ISO 18001) and for our Environmental Management System (ISO  14001).    Climate Change  Baran's engineering skills and capabilities include advanced methodologies which provide  protection against aspects of climate change, such as earthquake-resistant structures etc,  which in some cases form part of customer specifications or new legal requirements. As a  provider of engineering services, Baran is conscious of customer exposure in new engineering  projects and always targets to provide leading edge support.    Baran's Environment Guidelines  In 2005, Baran formulated and adopted a set of voluntary Environment Guidelines applicable  in all the Company's global operations. The Guidelines, which continue to guide our  operations, serve to ensure that environmental considerations, including biodiversity impacts,  are taken into account at every stage of new project development as well as in the  management of Baran's internal operations and infrastructure.

Principle 8  Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility    Baran is committed to managing its environmental impacts responsibly and to measuring its  progress.     12    Baran Group Global Compact Communication on Progress | November 2012          Energy Consumption  Baran strives to minimize its energy consumption in all its operations and places emphasis on  energy efficiency in Baran office locations. The key practices maintained by Baran in terms of  energy consumption include use of energy efficient light bulbs, central electricity control  systems in all buildings and air conditioner monitoring and savings. 100% of Baran's energy  consumption is based on indirect energy (electricity) sourced from the Israel National Grid.    Water Consumption  Overall, Baran's water consumption is relatively modest and is used mainly for office hygiene,  cleaning and garden irrigation purposes. Where possible, we control water consumption  through water-flow controllers and employee practices.      Waste Management  As a planning and engineering firm with no industrial operations or processes, Baran produces  low levels of waste, none of which is hazardous. Nonetheless, Baran believes it is importance  to minimize all waste and makes constant efforts to do so in all activities. Waste that is  generated by Baran operations is from regular office activities and includes some organic  waste and paper or plastics. There is also a low level of electronic waste from batteries, cell  phones and computer and related products.     Baran disposes of waste in an environmentally responsible manner including the recycling of  all paper waste. Electronic waste in Israel is sent to the social enterprise Ecommunity for  dismantling and recycling. Ecommunity recycles electronic waste using the services of people  with special needs, thus creating employment opportunities and funding for the rehabilitation  of this population.                 Principle 9  Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of  environmentally friendly technologies.    We provide engineering solutions that meet customer requirements in functionality and  design, as well as contributing to a more sustainable environment. Utilizing the experience and  knowledge of our employees, we have successfully developed unique engineering  departments which specialize in environmentally friendly engineering solutions for our  customers.    Green Procurement  In order to ensure environmental considerations are effectively deployed in procurement  decisions, Baran has developed a comprehensive Environmental Procurement Guide for   13    Baran Group Global Compact Communication on Progress | November 2012        procurement staff to assist them in selecting appropriate suppliers, materials and products in  order to support environmental objectives. Examples of areas covered by the Environmental  Procurement Guide include minimization of waste resulting from efficient use of materials,  detailed planning, efficient storage of materials, and prevention of damage to materials, using  industrial multiple-use dies for concrete casting, preventing unnecessary use of packaging, and  recycling.    Green Building  We maintain a company division which specializes in construction and infrastructure projects  that integrate sustainability and green building principles. This unique division provides  consulting and certification services for buildings which meet green building standards, as well  as conducts techno-economic feasibility studies and return-on-investment (ROI) analyses using  local and international green building standards. The Baran Green Building Division works  primarily with leading standards including LEED (Lead in Leadership in Energy and  Environmental Design – U.S), BREEAM (U. K.) and the Israeli Green Building Standard 5281. Our  Green Building Division is staffed with LEED accredited professionals who are licensed to train  and certify others as LEED professionals.    A further demonstration of Baran's commitment to Green Building and promoting awareness  and education of different aspects of green construction is Baran's founding membership of  the Israeli Green Building Council (ILGBC). Baran Green Building experts regularly participate in  ILGBC meetings and Baran is a member of the ILGBC's Regulation Committee. Experts from  Baran's Green Building Division deliver lectures at various ILGBC events throughout the year.      The ILGBC was established in early 2007 as a non-profit organization. The ILGBC is uniquely  supported by industry, government and academic institutions, together with leading  professional, social and environmental organizations. For more information about the ILBC,  please visit:  www.ilgbc.org    Powering up with Solar Energy  Baran has undertaken numerous solar power projects in Israel, supporting the development of  solar as a viable energy source in Israel. Solar energy is one of the most significant sources of  clean energy. Understanding the importance of reducing carbon emissions generated by  energy sources for global sustainability, as well as the growing market for solar energy, Baran  has developed unique expertise in the planning and installation of solar energy systems.        14    Baran Group Global Compact Communication on Progress | November 2012            Principle 10  Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.    Baran Group expressly forbids corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery, and  makes this clear to all employees through the Code of Ethics and related training.    A precautionary approach to compliance and risk management  As a public company, Baran Group maintains mechanisms to ensure the company operates  within legal limits and to the highest ethical standards. Baran Group is Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX)  compliant in accordance with the Israeli version of this legislation.  The Sarbanes–Oxley  legislation of 2002 set new or enhanced standards for all U.S. public company boards,  management and public accounting firms including additional responsibilities to the board.   In  Israel, the act was implemented in 2009 with some modifications for the local market. Baran  has implemented the SOX principles in all aspects of the company, identifying and analyzing  Baran's core processes and all associated risks, with a focus on financial risk. All employees  have been trained in risk management processes.                            15    Baran Group Global Compact Communication on Progress | November 2012              Contact Details    Baran Group welcomes the opportunity to discuss any aspect of this report, and welcomes  queries and feedback.
