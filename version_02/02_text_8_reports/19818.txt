Initiated in 2009, the programme is being developed in pace with the achievement of objectives  and the emergence of new opportunities. A sampling of the programmes points are outlined below.  Theentire sustainability programme can be downloaded from axfood.se Outcome 2011 At year-end 2011, Axfoods energy use had  decreased by 0.3% per square metre com- pared with 2009 in the premises in which  measurement was possible. The reduction  plan includes a review of lighting, ventilation,  refrigeration and heating.  during the year, work was begun on eval- uating the opportunity to install solar cells  on the roofs of all warehouse buildings. Maximum material recycling   shall be profitable All warehouses and Group-owned stores are  to work with extensive waste sorting cover- ing all fractions, including biologically treat- able waste and other waste. All companies in the Group should  achieve better profitability in sales of waste  fractions to material recycling contractors.  Outcome 2011 A Group-wide system was implemented for  sorting of all waste fractions, which are han- dled by three external contractors. A new por- tal was opened, where the contractors are to  report what they have collected. This has made  it possible to formulate quantitative goals and  follow up waste sorting on a continuous basis. Efficient, climate-adapted transports dagab and Axfood nrlivs should reduce  their Co2 emissions from fuel by 20% per  tonne of goods by 2015, from Group-owned  vehicles. A further goal is to reduce fuel con- sumption by 10% by 2015. Outcome 2011 during the period 2009–2011, both compa- nies reduced their Co2 emissions from fuel  by 18.7% per tonne of transported goods  compared with 2009. during the year both companies began  using Evolution diesel, which is partly based  on pine oil. in 2011 dagab increased its use  of rail transport for products coming in to  its warehouses from suppliers in Sweden as  well as from other European countries. Climate neutrality is the goal Axfoods goal is to be climate neutral by  2020. The sub-goal is to reduce energy  use by 30% per square metre by 2015  (base year 2009).  2 AXFOOD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011   Responsible production All of the Groups  suppliers in high-risk  countries have been required to undergo a  social audit by 2013 at the latest. one hun- dred per cent of the palm oil used in Garant  products shall be sustainability certified by  2015.  Outcome 2011 new purchasing guidelines, including life  cycle analyses, have been gradually intro- duced in purchasing work and will continue  in 2012. in 2011, 17 social audits were performed,  including two in Sweden. Axfood continued to purchase palm oil cer- tificates for the volume of palm oil used in  the Groups own products.  Healthy, equal and knowledgeable   employees Axfood shall maintain a work attendance rate  of at least 95% and an Employee Satisfaction  index score of at least 90%. By 2015 the  Company shall have achieved an even gender  balance in management positions, i.e., within  a span of 40%–60%. All employees shall have  completed basic environmental training by  2012 at the latest. Outcome 2011 Work attendance during the year was 95.3%. The employee survey conducted during  the year showed an Employee Satisfaction  index score of 92%. The share of women in management  positions was 21.6% at year-end. At year-end 2011, 82% of employees  had completed basic environment train- ing. At Willys, which has the largest number  of employees, everyone had completed this  training by year-end.

Axfood strives to be an active  driver of work on sustainable development  and thereby be the best in the industry.  This work rests on a foundation of  Axfoods core values and Code of Conduct,  along with the Companys sustainability pro- gramme, which covers environmental mat- ters as well as social issues and animal wel- fare. Through strongly rooted core values  and corporate responsibility, value is also  created for the shareholders.  Axfoods sustainability work is based on  the Un definition of sustainability: devel- opment that meets the needs of the present  without compromising the ability of future  generations to meet their own needs. Code of Conduct for business ethics According to the Groups Code of Conduct,  Axfood shall conduct its business in accor- dance with generally accepted business  practice and high standards of business eth- ics in relation to its suppliers and other busi- ness partners. To ensure uniform conduct  among all employees, Axfood adheres to a  policy that lays out the Groups position on  the offering and accepting of bribes, cor- ruption, and general collaboration within  AXFOODS STAKEHOLDERS Customers: Axfood aims to offer its customers   a wide range of environmentally  adapted, healthy and safe products  at competitive prices. Suppliers: By making demands and con- ducting a dialogue, Axfood strives  to raise the level of its suppliers  sustainability work. Society:  Axfood strives to actively contribute to society by influencing and being responsive. Employees:  Axfood wants proud and committed  employees, and to be a collaborative  and effective organization. Owners:  Axfood shall create enduring value  for its shareholders by exercising  corporate responsibility. Axfoods most important stakeholders are the groups of people  who are affected most by and/or affect the Companys business.  The issues that are perceived by these stakeholders as being the  most important provide guidance in Axfoods work with sustain- ability and corporate social responsibility. Axfoods responsibility – goal  is to be best in the industry Axfood is one of Swedens leading food retail companies. The ability to take responsibility for  sustainable development is essential for maintaining the trust of the Companys stakeholders.  Axfood believes that sustainability work and sound economics go hand in hand. By being a driver  of sustainability issues, Axfood creates the right offerings for its customers, which in turn leads   to better business. 4 AXFOOD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AT AXFOOD  the industry. This policy is updated annu- ally, and pertinent employees are required  to certify in writing that they have read  and acknowledge the policy. These include  employees who have the right to authorize  payments for a profit centre or who in some  other way have a say in purchasing decisions  for goods or services. in 2011, 910 employees signed the policy.  Organization and implementation Axfood takes a business approach to its  work on sustainability matters. A key strat- egy is to integrate issues in the business  activities and to promote involvement  throughout the organization. Axfoods Executive Committee and Head  of Environment and Social responsibility  work on an overarching level with strategies,  overall goals and measures, and follow-up.  To be able to work in an integrated fash- ion, it is important that the individual com- panies within the Axfood Group have oper- ational responsibility for their own sus- tainability work. Sustainability coordina- tors have been appointed in all of Axfoods  companies. it is also important to gradual- ly raise the employees competence in the  area of basic knowledge about sustainability  issues as well as Axfoods commercial bene- fit from being an industry leader in sustain- ability work. during the year, the focus on  environmental training continued through- out the Group. To date, 82% of all employ- ees have completed the training, which aims  to impart a fundamental understanding of  Axfoods sustainability programme. Sustainability programme Axfoods sustainability programme is an  important governance tool for the Groups  sustainability initiatives. The programme  describes goals, strategies and follow-up  of the Groups sustainability work and is  revised once a year.  Axfoods sustainability programme can  be read in its entirety at axfood.com. Precautionary principle The precautionary principle is used in a pro- active sense in the Groups sustainability  work. Examples in practice are that Axfood  has stopped buying baby bottles and cash  register receipts that contain BPA (bisphe- nol). Another example of proactive sustain- ability work involves conducting environ- mental impact statements prior to major  structural changes. Axfood also wants to  offer its customers opportunities to make  wise and conscious choices by working with  its offering of products, such as organic and  Fairtrade Certified products, and with con- sumer information. Reporting Axfood reports on its sustainability work in  accordance with the Global reporting initia- tive (Gri) guidelines, Level B. All indicators  must be relevant, correct and possible to  monitor. Axfoods sustainability work is cur- rently not subject to external audit.

All  of these areas are of major importance for  Axfoods business and have major potential  for improvement. Energy consumption has  particularly high priority, since the cost of elec- tricity as a percentage of total costs is rising. Energy consumption one of the goals set in Axfoods sustainability  programme is for Axfood to be climate-neu- tral by 2020. The most important means of  achieving this goal is to reduce the Compa- nys own climate impact. A transition to  renewable electricity has already been carried  out. important work lies ahead primarily with  energy efficiency improvement and a change- over to refrigerants that do not have an  adverse climate impact. Following a procure- ment process carried out in 2011, a system  for detailed measurement and control of elec- tricity consumption is being installed in all  Group-owned stores. This system will enable  central control and follow-up towards the goal  of reducing energy consumption by 30% per  square metre by 2015. in addition, the store  chains competency in the area of energy will  be strengthened at the central level in 2012. dagab plays a highly important role in the  work on reducing energy use. As recognition  of its success in this area, in 2011 the compa- ny was named as Climate Comet of the Year  and was also the recipient of Haninge munici- palitys 2011 environmental award. during  the year, dagab took steps together with prop- erty owners to reduce its electricity consump- tion. Among other measures, the opportunity  to install solar cells for electricity generation  on warehouse roofs is being evaluated.

The environment – focus on  the climate and recycling onE oF THE MoST AMBiTioUS GoALS in Axfoods sustainability programme is  to reduce the Groups energy consumption by 30% per square metre by 2015. To  achieve this goal, Axfood has decided to work on a Group-wide basis under the  coordination of a management team. Axfoods President and CEo is a member of  this team. new techniques for measurement and monitoring have been tested, a  review of lease agreements has been conducted to ensure that financial incentives  are in place, the stores with the highest energy consumption have been identified,  and work on an improved operations programme has been carried out. in late 2011 a procurement process was concluded for a system for detailed   follow-up and control of electricity consumption in Axfoods Group-owned stores.  installation of the system in stores will begin in 2012 along with a strengthening  ofthe chains central competency in the energy area. The energy challenge One of Axfoods strategic objectives is to be an active driver of sustainable development in  the environmental area and thereby be the best in the industry. In the day-to-day activities,  sustainability aspects are integrated with purchasing and product selection as well as with  logistics, transports, product flows and store operations. 6 AXFOOD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  ENvIRONmENT  Transports Axfoods business requires extensive product  flows. Axfood strives to ensure that these  transports are long-term sustainable as far as  possible and has raised its emission targets.  Axfood manages its logistics flows  through dagab and through a central pur- chasing and product range function. Trans- ports are conducted under own manage- ment via dagab and Axfood nrlivs as well  as through subcontracted freight compa- nies. Axfoods own delivery fleet currently  includes 146 vehicles.  All delivery trucks are to have well  planned routes, and the goal is that they will  always be driven as fully loaded as possi- ble. When renewing the fleet, vehicles with  the environmentally best and commercial- ly most viable engines are to be chosen. All  new delivery trucks that are purchased are  equipped with breath alcohol ignition inter- lock devices. Currently 85% of Axfoods  vehicles are fitted with ignition interlock  devices. To minimize environmental impact, dagab  and Axfood nrlivs work continuously with a  range of measures, including: 	 Maximizing load capacity, i.e., making  sure that delivery vehicles are always  filled to capacity as much as possible. 	 reducing fuel consumption by setting a  maximum speed limit of 85 km/h. 	 restricting use of diesel fuel to green  diesel, which is based partly on pine oil. Both dagab and Axfood nrlivs use so- called eco-driving techniques to reduce fuel  consumption in the companies delivery  vehicles, and drivers receive training in this  technique. An incentive for drivers has been  coupled to this: the savings achieved from  lower fuel consumption are shared between  the company and drivers who save fuel. The  goal is that these measures will reduce fuel  consumption by 10% by 2015.  With the help of a new system for manag- ing vehicle economy, temperature monitoring  and environmental reporting, called FleetTech,  dagab can monitor every single vehicle, which  provides documentation for improvement  measures and follow-up. during the year,  dagab and Axfood nrlivs also improved their  follow-up of the environmental standards that  have been set for subcontracted transports. in 2011 dagab began using rail transport to  a greater extent for deliveries in to its ware- houses. dagab now also uses environmental  pallets made of plastic.  during the year, dagab and Axfood nr- livs began using Evolution diesel, which is  based partly on pine oil. Evolution diesel  offers 5%–16% lower Co2 emissions than  traditional grades of diesel, depending on  seasonal factors.  in view of the success achieved with the  work on lowering transport-related Co2  emissions, in 2011 the reduction target was  raised from 10% to 20%.

When travel is nevertheless required, rail and  buses shall be used as the primary option. Air  travel shall be chosen only when warranted by  special reasons. When leasing a company car,  Axfoods employees are required to choose  an environmental car according to the current  definitions. in 2011, environmental cars  accounted for 99% of the company car fleet.  All Axfood employees with company cars are  offered information on so-called eco-driving.

Waste and recycling Waste sorting is currently practised at all of  Axfoods offices, stores and warehouses. The  ambition is to improve waste sorting in all  activities. in 2011, practical implementation  was begun of a procurement process that was  conducted a year earlier regarding very exten- sive sorting of waste fractions. Three contrac- tors take care of this sorting centrally for  Axfoods operations nationwide. The aim is  tochannel as much waste as possible that is  generated to material recycling and to capi- talize on possible revenues from sorted waste,  such as shrink wrap and corrugated board.  Food waste is sorted for biogas production in  the municipalities that have such facilities.  The new waste strategy includes the creation  of a new portal in which the waste handling  contractors report what they have collected.  This, in turn, generates supplier invoices  directly from the portal to Axfood. The portal  also enables better follow-up of waste sorting.  Since 2002 sorting instructions have been  printed on the packaging of all of Axfoods  private label products. Purchasing and product selection The choice of products in Axfoods offering  has an environmental impact in production,  transport and consumption. Axfood there- fore strives to purchase products that have  the smallest environmental impact. in addi- tion, Axfood strives to make it easier for con- sumers to buy organic products.  during the year, Axfood began applying  new purchasing guidelines based on envi- ronmental and social responsibility con- cerns, including life cycle analyses. The  guidelines are being gradually implemented  in a continuous process that will continue in  the years ahead. Life cycle analyses reduce climate impact A life cycle analysis entails a review of a multi- tude of details which together can make a  great difference regarding the climate impact  of purchases. To identify where the largest  Co2 emissions take place in the production  chain of Axfoods private label products,  detailed analyses are performed with the  assistance of Tricorona Climate Partner and  SiK (institutet fr Livsmedel och Bioteknik  AB). To gain the most accurate calculation  possible, the entire life cycle has been  included: production, packaging, transports  and stock-keeping. With the life cycle analy- ses as a platform, it has become possible to  identify the parts of the chain with the great- est climate impact and to focus efforts on  reducing climate impact where it is greatest. A considerable amount of work has been  dedicated to life cycle analyses of the prod- ucts included in Axfoods new Garant Sklart  brand, which includes body care, cleaning  and laundry products. The products are all  ecolabelled with the nordic Swan seal, allergy  labelled and climate certified. The controls  include everything from extraction and pro- cessing of raw materials to packaging and  PRIORITIES 2012 Continued focus on reducing energy use in stores, warehouses and offices.  in2012 installation will begin of a system for detailed measurement and   controlof electricity consumption in Group-owned stores. increase waste sorting at stores, i.e., reduce the amount of material sent for   combustion. Continue the successful work on lowering Co2 emissions from transports. transport of the products to store shelves.  Theclimate impact that cannot be reduced is  compensated by financial support of a project  inindia.  All fruit and vegetables purchased by  Axfood are to be certified in accordance with  the rules for integrated production. This entails  taking environmental considerations into  account and avoiding the use of unnecessary  pesticides.  Uncertified palm oil to be phased out in 2011 Axfood continued to purchase green  palm oil certificates corresponding to the vol- ume of palm oil used in the production of its   private label products, or substituted palm oil  with other vegetable oils. Axfood received recog- nition for this during the year with a green light  in WWFs Palm oil Buyers Scorecard 2011.  The use of palm oil, which can be found in  virtually any product that includes fat, is con- troversial since in many locations, oil palm  plantations operate on land that was once rain  forest. When a food manufacturer buys cer- tificates, it entails that money goes to growers  who produce palm oil using sustainable pro- duction practices.  Starting in 2015 all palm oil used in  Axfoods private label products is to be envi- ronmentally certified. Today only about 10%  of all available palm oil is environmental- ly  certified. Axfoods goal should be viewed  asaneffort to spark a dialogue with suppliers  and get them to steer development towards  theuse of certified oil. No red-listed fish Axfoods fish policy entails, among other  things, that fish and shellfish from threatened  populations may not be sold in Axfood stores.  The WWFs red list is used as a guideline for  which populations are threatened. The policy is  dynamic and is updated in pace with changed  conditions regarding which types of fish are  red-listed. The policy has also contributed to  continuous improvements in the offering of  ecolabelled fish. 8 AXFOOD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  ENvIRONmENT  Customers – a product range  for conscious consumers Axfoods customers expect Axfood to meet their demands for environmentally adapted,  healthy and safe foods at competitive prices. Customers should feel confident about the  products they buy, which is why Axfood pays  great attention to strict quality control over  its private label products as well as name- brand products. Food safety is further safe- guarded through the Groups internal con- trol programme at stores and warehouses. Animal welfare  Many people who buy organic food do so out  of concern for animal welfare. Axfood has  therefore invested in offering a wider selec- tion of organic beef and pork. Axfood gives  priority to organic meat with the Swedish  KrAV certification, which has considerably  more stringent animal welfare standards  than other organic certifications. in its procurement of conventionally pro- duced meat, Axfood adheres to the animal  welfare criteria that apply for pigs in the UK,  i.e., the requirements that have been set for  danish pork that is imported by certain gro- cery chains in the UK. Both PrisXtra and Hemkp have discon- tinued selling eggs from caged hens. Organic and Fairtrade Certified   product brands Garant Ekologiska varor is Axfoods own organic brand. Coffee, tea and chocolate are  examples of Fairtrade Certified products  sold under the Aware private label. The aim  of the Aware private label is to offer organic  and Fairtrade Certified everyday foods at a  reasonable price. The products are sold in  all of Axfoods store concepts. Sales of organic products in relation to  total food sales in 2011 were 2.6%, compared  with 2.4% a year earlier. Garant Ekologiska varor  products  aredescribed in more detail on   tyckom garant.se/ekologiskt. Garant Sklart first with climate-certified products dUrinG THE YEAr, Garant Sklart was launched in stores, a  line of cleaning, laundry and body care products. The brand represents a new way of taking greater care of the  environment and minimizing products environmental impact. Garant Sklart was the first in  Sweden to climate-certify all of  its products, which also bear the   nordic Swan ecolabel and the seal  of the Swedish Asthma and Allergy  Association. Climate certification of products  entails that steps have been taken  to reduce or compensate for their  climate impact. The first step is to conduct a detailed analysis of the products  life cycle in order to minimize all emissions as far as possible.  This analysis covers everything from extraction and processing  of raw materials to packaging and transport of the products to  store shelves. For any remaining parts than cannot be reduced,  Garant Sklart products are climate-certified through a cooper- ation with Tricorona Climate Partner. Higher sales of organic products 6.3%  9 AXFOOD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011     Quality assurance of private label products Axfoods private label products are a vital  part of the Groups work on offering the best  possible customer benefit. Axfood has two  quality levels for its private label products:  mid-range, encompassing the Garant brand  (which is gradually taking the place of the  Willys and Hemkp brands), and discount,  under the Eldorado brand. Added to these  are Garant Ekologiska varor (organic prod- ucts), the Fairtrade Certified brand Aware,  and the Garant Sklart range of climate-  certified skin care and other products.  regardless of product, food safety is a  keystone on which no compromises can  be made. Suppliers of Axfoods private  label food products must have plants that  are certified according to any of the stan- dards sanctioned by the Global Food Safe- ty initiative (GFSi). For household chemi- cal products, cosmetics and skin care prod- ucts, iSo 9001 or GPM standards apply. For  certain other nonfood products, such as  toys and electrical appliances, documen- tation and certification for CE labelling are  required. For products designed for contact  with food, suppliers must be able to certify  that the product is made of approved mate- rial in accordance with normpacks rules.  For vegetables, root vegetables and fruit,  Axfood purchases only from suppliers that  are certified according to Global GAP or  equivalent. Packing companies must be  certified according to any of the standards  approved by GFSi. Suppliers that have not completed certi- fication can request dispensation if they can  present a credible timetable for certification. To ensure the ongoing work on food safe- ty for its private label products, each year  Axfoods quality assurance inspectors con- duct their own analysis programme, includ- ing microbiological and chemical analyses  of products based on the relevant risks for  each individual product.  Prior to launch, every mid-range prod- uct is blind-tested by an external consumer  panel of 65–80 people, and to make it all the  way to store shelves, a product must receive  comparable marks to the market-leading  product.  Budget products are blind-tested internally  in Axfoods own test kitchen to ensure that  they, as a minimum, are comparable to other  budget products on the market.

Magnus, Hemkp  Why do you shop at Hemkp? – The product selection, without a doubt. i can find  everything i need here. Food safety Axfood applies its internal control programme  in both the retail and wholesale operations to  ensure customers right to safe food.  in cooperation with the trade organization  Svensk dagligvaruhandel and others, Axfood  has participated in the creation of set of  guidelines called Safe food in your store,  which has been endorsed by the Swedish  national Food Administration. The pro- gramme is in place at all of Axfoods stores  and serves as a platform for how the stores  structure their internal control programmes.  Under the control programme, stores per- form certain daily controls, delivery arrival  controls and temperature controls at the  departmental level. Clear routines are in place  for handling unpackaged foods to ensure food  hygiene and the integrity of the cold chain.  Axfood also has a Group-wide agreement  with an external partner in the area of hygiene  and pest issues, which visits the Group-owned  stores on a regular basis. during these visits,  microbiological tests are taken and an assess- ment is made of the stores internal control  work. in the internal concept follow-up  activities that are also conducted on a regular  basis, food safety is a key control point. Municipal environment and health depart- ments conduct inspections at the Groups  wholesale and retail facilities. in connection  with these inspections, controls are made to  ensure that the facilities meet the statutory  requirements for food handling and sales. Alcohol, tobacco, betting and   pharmaceuticals Sweden has a minimum legal age of 18 for  the sale of tobacco, alcoholic beverages  and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals.  Thesame applies for all types of betting and  for certain types of lotteries. in its Group- owned stores Axfood has chosen to not sell  lottery tickets to youths under 18 years of  age. Axfood has also set a minimum age of  15 to purchase energy drinks at its stores. To ensure compliance with minimum age  requirements, Axfood conducts its own inter- nal control programme for age-restricted  products, consisting of staff training and rou- tines for verifying ages. Axfood requires all  checkout employees to check ids of custom- ers purchasing age-restricted products who  appear to be younger than 25. internal con- trols are also conducted that measure stores  performance in requesting customer ids in  accordance with this policy. Ethical exclusions in its wholly owned stores, Axfood has  decided to avoid product groups that are  incompatible with the Companys values.  These include, among others: 	 magazines with a pornographic content 	 cider and so-called alcopop (fruit drinks  with an alcohol content of more than  2.25%) 	 concentrated energy drinks (shots) 	 foie gras (goose liver) 	 fish and shellfish on WWFs redlist. in addition, Hemkp and PrisXtra have  stopped selling eggs from caged hens. PRIORITIES 2012 Axfood will continue to prioritize a  larger selection of environmentally  adapted and healthy products to  meet customer demand. 11 AXFOOD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011     Axfood decides to conduct  a social audit of a parti- cular supplier or producer.  The decision on which supp- lier to be visited is based on  specific criteria that weigh in  such factors as risk country  and risk industry.  on-site meeting with  the suppliers mana- gement at the plant  along with a review of  how the audit will be  performed, based on  Axfoods Code of Con- duct.  review of documents, such  as time cards, payroll slips,  employment contracts and  policies. inspection of the  production facilitys   premisesand interviews  with employees.  Concluding mee- ting with suppliers  management to   go through any  deviations from   the requirements  in the Code of  Conduct.  An action plan is  drafted through  dialogue with the  supplier in the  event any devia- tions have been  discovered.  The social audit process A guiding point in these relationships is the  Axfood Code of Conduct, which draws from  internationally recognized conventions on  human rights and workers rights as well as  international environmental regulations. The  Code of Conduct lays down Axfoods position  and commitment to its suppliers as well as to  the individual employees and other partners.  in 2011 the Code of Conduct was integrated in  all of Axfoods operations. Companies that supply products or services  to Axfood Group companies are required to  meet the requirements stipulated in the Code  of Conduct. in addition, all suppliers of prod- ucts and services are responsible for ensuring  that their subcontractors also meet the Codes  requirements. Human rights inspections Axfoods Code of Conduct stipulates that suppli- ers that produce goods for Axfoods stores must  be in compliance with Uns and iLos conven- tions on human rights and rights of the child.  Together with local auditors, Axfood vis- its production facilities of selected suppli- ers to see how well they comply with the laws  in their own countries with respect to work- ers rights and working conditions, as well as  to the above-mentioned Un and iLo conven- tions. These visits are based on SA 8000, the  internationally recognized standard for social  audits. Axfoods primary focus is on such fac- tors as child labour, workers rights, work  environment and housing conditions.  The number of inspections has been increased  gradually, and follow-up measures have been  improved, such as repeat visits that are to be  carried out within a year. A systematic risk  country assessment has been produced, based  on a number of different indices. This assess- ment provides documentation for priorities  regarding inspections and also serves as a  guide in purchasing. deviations from laws and conventions  are addressed in a dialogue between Axfood  and the supplier and lead in most cases to  improvements at the companies visited. in  theevent no improvements are made, Axfood  terminates the cooperation.  Axfoods representative office in Shanghai,  China, plays a key role in improving risk  assessments. The office participates in pur- chasing from China and Southeast Asia, builds  up supplier contacts and monitors develop- ments in markets in China and Southeast Asia.  The office is a vital resource for recruiting good  suppliers and avoiding quality problems and  suppliers that do not live up to Axfoods  Codeof Conduct.  during the year, a full-time auditor was  hired at the representative office, and the num- ber of social audits performed of Axfoods sup- pliers increased from 12 to 17. Major emphasis  has also been put on raising quality in such  areas as risk assessment, audits, monitoring  and action plans. Toward the end of 2011, a  new system for risk country assessment was  procured, based on actual observations made  in connection with social audits in the various  countries. This is resulting in a clearer picture  of which type of remarks are being made, how  many are made, and how serious they are. it is  also providing better guidance for Axfoods  own social audits. Some of Axfoods private label products are  purchased via the jointly owned purchasing  company United nordic. United nordic has its  own code of conduct and is gradually increas- ing the number of social audits it performs.  Keypersons in the nordic food retail chains  who represent United nordic meet regularly to  ensure uniform standards and that the right  priorities are made moving forward.

The new, environ- mental purchasing guidelines are being  implemented in purchasing activities and in  the development of private label products. Axfoods relations with suppliers are to be characterized by generally accepted business practices  and high standards of business ethics. At the same time, it is important that suppliers of products and  services comply with national laws and regulations and that international conventions are respected. Within 6 to 12  months after the  visit, a follow-up  visit is made to  ensure that the  action plan has  been followed.  12 AXFOOD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  SUPPLIERS  industry-wide matters are conducted within  the framework of the trade organization  Svensk dagligvaruhandel, which has its own  environmental council. Examples of activities  include the setting of standards as well as  instructions on how to implement EU legisla- tion in Swedens national regulatory frame- work. other trade organizations, such as for  packaging and newspaper recycling, are also  contact interfaces with society at large. Diversity network during the year, the diversity Charter Sweden  network was launched, with Axfood as one of  the initiative-takers. The aim of this company  network is to share knowledge and experience  surrounding diversity and thereby contribute  to successful and profitable work with diversity  issues. Axfood sees employee diversity as a  key to success and profitability, and therefore  strives for an embracing and inclusive com- pany culture that will enable the Company to  fully benefit from all its employees experience  and competence. Membership in the diversity  Society – cooperation   and involvement Axfood participates on a regular basis in consultations and discussions with various organisations  and authorities on current issues. The Swedish National Food Administration, the Swedish Board  ofAgriculture and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency are the main agencies whose  purviewconcerns Axfoods operations. The Haga Initiative Axfood is one of the initiative-takers  behind the Haga initiative, a climate  network dedicated to reducing emis- sions from industry, advocating the  climate issue and acting as a model  for companies that take responsibil- ity for climate concerns. one requirement for member- ship is that the company commits  itself to reducing its carbon emis- sions by at least 40% by 2020.  Axfoods target is to cut its emis- sions by 75% by 2020. Eight companies have joined the  Haga initiative: Coca-Cola Enter- prise Sverige, Fortum Vrme, JM,  Lantmnnen, Procter & Gamble  Sverige, Stena Metal, Svenska Statoil  and Vasakronan. The network is  coordinated by Tricorona. Charter entails that all member-companies  sign a contract that they will work actively  with diversity based on set targets. The diversity Charter was founded in  France in 2004 and is active in several other  European countries, with thousands of  member-companies. other initiative-takers  include Loral, Managing diversity, novar- tis, Scandic, Sodexo, Skanska and Volvo Car  Corporation. Retailers security work Handelns Skerhetsgrupp (HSG), a security  organization in which Axfood is a member,  is a non-political association for security  officers from retail chains throughout Swe- den. on behalf of the retail industry, HSG  lobbies decision-makers and the media on  security issues and strives to promote  cooperation between its members in devel- oping security work. The overall objectives  of security work are to create greater secu- rity for employees and customers, and to  create conditions for greater profitability. One requirement for being a member of the   Haga Initiative is that the company is committed   to reducing its carbon emissions by 40% by 2020 13 AXFOOD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011     Non-profit organizations Axfoods intention is to establish long-term  partnerships with non-profit organizations on  sustainability initiatives, such as the Swedish  Society for nature Conservation (SSnC) and  WWF.  As part of its effort to help protect the  worlds rain forests, Axfood is a member of the  roundtable on Sustainable Palm oil (rSPo).  rSPos mission is to establish a credible and  practical system for trading in certified palm oil. Axfood is also a member of the roundta- ble on responsible Soy Association. it works  according to the same premise as for palm oil  – to contribute to the development of sustain- ability criteria for certification of soybean  plantations.  Axfood does not ally itself with positions   taken by any political parties. More than SEK 4 m collected   for Save the Children during the year, collection activities with  customers, suppliers and employees  raised more than SEK 4 m for Save the  Children. This represents a doubling  compared with a year ago.  it was mainly Willys customers who  donated bottle and can deposit money  and bought selected Save the Children  products and thereby accounted for the  large increase in collections. other activi- ties carried out during the year included  collection of deposits from PrisXtra  stores, an auction at an Axfood nrlivs  supplier expo, and collections among  employees. When the alarm was sounded  for the impending disaster in the horn of  Africa, Axfood and Hemkp donated a  lump sum to Save the Children. The money has been used to help  children in both Sweden and abroad.  during the peak of the famine in the horn  of Africa, the money was directed to that  area. during the rest of the year, the col- lections went to education and shelter for  children in conflict-torn ivory Coast.  Axfood has contributed to the education  project in ivory Coast since 2009. in 2011  Axfood also sponsored a project to com- bat bullying and discrimination in chil- drens and youth sports in Sweden. An  action plan has been presented for sports  clubs, with practical advice on how to rec- ognize and prevent bullying among chil- dren. The project will continue in 2012. Axfood has been working in part- nership with Save the Children Swe- den since december 2009 and has  been the organizations main sponsor  since spring 2010. As one of the fore- most independent childrens rights orga- nizations, Save the Children is dedicat- ed to ensuring childrens rights to food,  housing, healthcare, education and a life  without violence, assault or exploitation. A total of SEK 4,036,634 was donated  to Save the Children in 2011. The part- nership is being developed and expand- ed with additional activities in 2012. PRIORITIES 2012 Continue developing the partnership with  Save the Children, for whom Axfood is a  main sponsor. Cooperation and membership in organizations Carbon disclosure Project Swedish Society for  nature  Conservation CSr Sweden Swedish Association for   Environmental Managers diversity Charter Sweden roundtable on   Sustainable Palm oil Global Compact Save the Children The Haga initiative SoS Childrens Villages   Sweden Handelns Skerhetsgrupp 14 AXFOOD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  SOCIETY  Proud employees, diversity and good career  paths create a positive spiral that leads to  more satisfied customers and better business. With investments in knowledge-sharing,  training and dialogue, Axfood strives to foster  a shared view on matters such as employee- ship, leadership and treatment of customers.  For example, through a broad-based e-learn- ing initiative, most employees obtain a basic  level of competence, which in turn increases  their opportunities to develop at Axfood.  Confirmation of Axfoods attractiveness as  anemployer can be found in the past years  Employee Satisfaction index score, which was  far higher than the industry average and indi- cates that the employees feel a sense of  inclusion and that they are satisfied with their  managers. At the same time, indications of  areas for improvement are taken seriously. during the year, the Hr organization con- tinued its coordination activities aimed at  raising the quality and efficiency of work.  Part of this includes an employee support  function that was established during the  year, where employees can turn for answers  to their questions at one and the same place.  Axfoods employee initiatives in 2011 resulted  in several gratifying distinctions, including: 	 Axfood was the recipient of the Swedish  e-learning award in 2011 for its compe- tence development initiatives. The award  was presented by Promise and the   Swedish Learning Association. 	 Universum and Fretagsbarometern  (the Swedish Student Survey) nominated  Axfood as rocket of the Year in the  Most Attractive Employer category. Employee pride and diversity  lead to good business Axfood wants proud and committed employees who work according to the Groups  core values in a collaborative and entrepreneurial organization. Growing with Axfood The Axfood Academy is the Groups  centre for training and trainee pro- grammes. The Academy provides train- ing to all employees as well as develop- ment programmes for managers within  the Group. Training activities are  focused on ensuring basic competence  toward the goal of increasing sales and  conveying Axfoods core values and  view of leadership and employeeship. in 2011, 3,325 employees partici- pated in a total of 4,014 days of training.  implementation of Axfoods new  business system entailed extensive  training during the year. To take advan- tage of the potential inherent in this  change, some 500 employees received  training in the SAP business system  during the year.  e-learning E-learning is a cost-effective and envi- ronmentally friendly form of training  that can be offered to all employees  regardless of their geographic location  across the country. Since the introduc- tion of this form of training in 2008,  70,000 courses have been completed,  and today more than 4,200 employees  are certified in knowledge about store  operations and perishables.  in line with Axfoods long-term envi- ronmental work, focus on a Group-wide  environmental training programme  continued during the year. 82% of  employees have completed the training. Development and opportunities A manager profile has been created  which shows the type of leadership  that Axfood encourages and provides  a model for further development and  new recruitment of managers. Paral- lel with this, a new management train- ing course entitled Leading at Axfood  has been developed. The course is  mandatory for new managers and con- veys Axfoods core values and view of  leadership and employeeship, in line  with Axfoods manager profile. Axfood takes a structured approach  to management succession within the  Group in order to meet future compe- tency needs. Every year an inventory  is taken of potential managers within  the Group and of which employees are  ready to take on a management role.  Each year Axfoods Group trainee  programme is carried out for aspiring  store managers. The programme is  designed to secure access to compe- tent and committed employees with a  breadth of knowledge about Axfoods  operations. The 2010/2011 programme  included both external and internal  participants. 15 AXFOOD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011     Satisfied employees in early 2011 Axfood conducted the second employee survey  of its kind to measure the work climate, with leadership as a key  component. The results of the survey showed a high score, with  an improvement in the Employee Satisfaction index from 86 to  92 in just one year. Equal opportunity and diversity during the year, Axfood adopted a Group-wide equal opportunity  and diversity policy. Based on this, all companies within the Group  are required to draw up plans to support their local equal oppor- tunity and diversity work. diversity in society and among Axfoods  customers shall also be reflected in the diversity of Axfoods  employees. Active measures for creating greater diversity include stan- dardized job notices, objective selection methods, and clear goals  and key ratios. The Groups explicit objective is to achieve an even gender bal- ance in management positions, entailing representation of men  and women within a span of 40%–60% by 2015 at the latest. At  year-end the share of women in management positions was 21.6%. read more on page 41. Sandra, Willys  Why do you work for Willys? – The work is varied, with a lot of customer contact.

Well-being at work Axfoods employees are encouraged to take the parental leave they are entitled to.  Among other measures, the Company tops up the state benefit so that employees  receive 80% of their salary during leave if their salary exceeds the ceiling amount  provided by the social insurance office. Axfood also encourages employees to partici- pate in fitness activities through payment of a fitness subsidy.  All Axfood employees are required to participate in an annual performance review  with their immediate superior.  Company health services are provided in close proximity to the respective work- places, with a primary focus on preventive care.  Axfood conducts systematic work environment and safety activities to ensure safe  and sound workplaces. This work, which involves all employees, is based on identify- ing risks as early as possible and ensuring that business is conducted in compliance  with the Work Environment Act and the regulations of the Swedish Work Environment  Authority. As a rule, reporting is done to the respective companies boards to guaran- tee that work environment matters are brought to the attention of management at the  respective companies. Daily talks with the unions depending on what business they are engaged  in, Axfood AB and its subsidiaries are bound by  at least one of the three nationwide collective  bargaining agreements for the retail trade, the  wholesale trade, or salaried employees. The  union counterparts for the first two of these are  the Commercial Employees Union, and for the  last one Unionen and Akademikerfrbundet  SSr. All employees are covered by collective  bargaining agreements, since individual  employment contracts refer to such agreements  with respect to general terms of employment.  The collective agreements stipulate the mini- mum level of employee benefits. Thus in certain  areas more favourable terms may exist than  those stipulated by the collective agreements.  The collective agreements contain rules on  notice periods, whose length varies from one to  twelve months, depending on the employees age  and length of employment. They also describe  the importance of performance reviews for iden- tifying a need for competence-raising measures. Axfood has representatives in the collective  bargaining process that was started during the  year. Clara, Hemkp  Why do you work for Hemkp? – We have a tight crew here, with good employees,  which i think shines through for our customers. We  treat our customers well, because we like our work. Per, Hemkp  Why do you work for Hemkp? – im a believer in Axfoods core values, especially  the Store is the Stage. They highlight Hemkps  long-term perspective and focus on the customer. 17 AXFOOD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011     GRI table – Level B For the fourth year in a row, Axfood is reporting on its sustainabil- ity work in accordance with the Global reporting initiative (Gri)  guidelines, level B. Axfood is a participant in the Global Compact  and adheres to its principles for its sustainability work. The calcula- tion methods for carbon dioxide emissions are based in part on the  guidelines outlined in the Haga initiative, which are based on the  GHG protocol. The calculation method used in the Haga initiative is  described in more detail on Axfood's website: axfood.se.  The sustainability indicators listed below cover Group-owned  retail and wholesale operations. The Groups franchise stores cur- rently do not report sustainability data centrally to Axfood and are  therefore not covered by the report. The same applies for external  transport contractors in the wholesale operations. in this respect,  thereport does not differ from Axfoods previous reports and the  methods used there. However, certain emission factors have  changed compared with the preceding year. in contrast to a year   ago, the reporting of En16 does not include refrigerants. Axfood is  reviewing its data collection method for this.  during the year, Axfood was not issued any fines or sanctions for  violations of environmental legislation, food safety or other legislation. The table below references where the information is presented in  the report. in addition to the profile and governance data prescribed  by the Gri, the table covers all core indicators as well as the com- plementary indicators that are judged to be relevant for Axfood.
