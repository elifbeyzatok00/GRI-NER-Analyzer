2010-11 Corporate Sustainability Report    Cover: The Banyan Tree (Ficus Bangalensis), which lives on for hundreds of years, is the ultimate symbol of  sustainability. Its broad, green canopy supports an entire eco-system, providing shelter to various species of birds,  arboreal animals and insects. Its roots grow long and run deep, securing the ground and reducing soil erosion.  Traditionally, the banyan tree has been a community hub, with village councils congregating under its shade (the  name itself derives from traders transacting business in its shade). This rootedness in the community and the eco- system perfectly captures the spirit of TCS sustainability.  Moreover, the Banyan supports its expanding canopy by  dropping aerial prop roots which grow to the ground and form secondary trunks – not very different from how TCS  expanding capabilities outside India are all locally rooted. 2  TCS publishes Sustainability Reports annually, the last report being for Financial Year 2009-10.  This is our fifth Sustainability Report, for Financial Year 2010-11 (April to March). It has been prepared  in conformance to the G3.1 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines published by the Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI). The report addresses the key sustainability topics gleaned through interactions  with the different stakeholder groups, based on the core principles of materiality and stakeholder  inclusiveness. These topics cover the full range of material economic, social and environmental  impacts of the organization. The report boundaries and exclusions are provided below: About the Report Data measurement techniques and the bases of calculations and estimates are furnished in the relevant areas of the report.

A sustainable corporation, to my mind, does much the  same. It creates a harmonious ecosystem, aligning its economic interests with those of its  stakeholders: employees, customers, shareholders, local communities and society at large. Once that  alignment is achieved, sustainability becomes core to its business and no longer just an afterthought.  At TCS, we keep looking for how better we can align ourselves with our stakeholders. Our strategy for  longer-term growth – consisting of Customer Focus, Full Services Capability, Global Network Delivery  TM Model , Strategic Acquisitions and Non-Linear Business models – is all about aligning our  organization and our business model with the needs of our clients and with the technology  landscape.  My frequent meetings with our teams, customers and partners convince me that the opportunities  before us are immense in every one of our markets. Each of our industry segments, service lines and  market units has tremendous potential. To realize that potential, we have built a customer-centric  organization where the customer is the focus for every improvement and every innovation so our  efforts today result in improving the customers business tomorrow. This alignment with the  customers interests helped us deliver excellent financial results this year. But the theme of harmony through alignment extends to other stakeholders too. Take employees for  instance. In a people-centric business such as ours, a motivated, engaged workforce is important for  business success. And as we get larger, empowerment and engagement are key to energizing our  people. At the start of the year, we launched an initiative called Realize Your Potential – a vehicle  designed to enable each employee to realize his or her potential, and to commit to making a  difference to their colleagues and helping them realize their potential. To my mind, helping every  individual achieve self-actualization is also the path to building a high performance culture. Its not  only the virtuous thing to do, its also good business. Little wonder then, that we consistently top the  industry in employee retention. It is no different when it comes to our environmental stewardship or our community engagements.  Greening our IT infrastructure and lowering our carbon footprint is not only the responsible thing to  do, it also brings down energy costs and those savings directly flow into the bottomline. This year,  against a target of a 2% reduction in our per capita electricity consumption, our teams actually  delivered a 7.7% reduction. We reduced our per-capita carbon footprint by 6.8% year on year. For the  future, we have even more ambitious targets – a 50% reduction in carbon intensity by 2020 and a 20%  reduction in water consumption by 2015, vis--vis baseline year FY2008. 6  We help many of our clients – largely Fortune 500 and Global 2000 corporations – similarly bring down the energy footprint of their IT infrastructure with our Green IT offerings. Our Eco-Sustainability practice  leverages our process expertise and IT prowess to help our clients reduce their overall environmental  footprint by measuring and optimizing their resource consumption, waste generation and recycling. By  turning an altruistic mission into a business, we can not only multiply the good we can do to the environment  but also benefit commercially. The most exciting demonstration of this win-win model is our launch of iON in India this year. This cloud-based,  enterprise automation platform for Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) has democratized enterprise  computing and made best-in-class process automation tools accessible to SMBs at an affordable price point,  on a pay-per-use basis and delivered in the most energy-efficient fashion.  Which brings me to our commitment to society. We are fortunate to have an ownership structure which is  fully aligned with community; about half the dividends we pay out goes to the Tata trusts which own our  promoter group, and into funding the various social and philanthropic causes they support. Maximizing  shareholder wealth, in our case, results in maximized social good. But that doesnt stop us from undertaking a  whole lot of socially responsible activities in the three broad areas of education, health and environment.  Im happy to report that this year, TCSers and their families volunteered over 55,068 person hours of their  personal time towards various causes within their local communities. Making a difference to the community,  is also a source of individual sense of fulfillment – yet another instance of aligned interests.  Lastly, I want to talk about our continued investments in various communities, often building technology  solutions pro-bono to address such issues as illiteracy, child welfare or farmer connectivity. Some of these  could have business potential in the future, but for now, our interest is entirely non-commercial.  We also have fully commercial offerings which end up doing social good. Our e-governance solutions help local,  state and central governments become more accessible, efficient and responsive to their citizenry. When a small  farmer in rural Andhra Pradesh can get a record of his land holdings within 10 minutes from the local citizens  service center, that is social and economic empowerment at the grassroots level. And it is enabled by technology  that we built.  Once you align business and responsible citizenry, you stop looking at one as being different from the other. In  an aligned organization, there are no three different bottomlines; they are the same.  N Chandrasekaran Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director N.

Business  (or, in some cases, policy) considerations largely govern the decision on what stakeholders to engage with and in what manner. While Customers, Employees and Shareholders are obvious stakeholders, the supply-chain of our people- centric business consists of various academic institutions, engineering colleges, staffing agencies and  other vendors. Staying at the cutting edge of technological developments requires us to closely  collaborate with other technology firms to develop and go to market with industry-specific solutions.  TCS is a member of a number of industry bodies like NASSCOM and CII. We work closely with these bodies  in shaping policy, with local, state and central governments across the world to roll out e-governance  initiatives or as part of government-facilitated community betterment initiatives. Lastly, we work with  local communities directly or through various NGOs as part of our CSR initiatives in different parts of the  world, and with the larger society. Given below is a list of key stakeholders that TCS engages with, the interfacing group within TCS, the  forms of engagement and the frequency. Some other stakeholders that we closely engage with, such as  Industry Analysts, Equity Analysts and the media have not been mentioned here because they are proxies  for other named stakeholders – customers, shareholders and the larger society respectively.

A team of  senior managers evaluated these various topics for materiality to the business to arrive at the key  sustainability topics for coverage in this report, summarized in the table below:  Stakeholders Material Topics Customers Business knowledge, Delivery capability, Quality, Data privacy and  security, Ethical behavior, Fair business practices Employees Safe and comfortable workplace, Engaging assignments, Learning  opportunities, Career development, Compensation structure Shareholders Continued revenue growth, Profitability, Cashflows, Corporate  Governance, Transparency and Disclosure, Dividend payouts Academic Institutions Job creation, Curriculum enhancement, Internship opportunities,  Faculty development Vendors, Partners  and Collaborators Ethical behavior, Fair business practices, Governance, Sustainability  of Demand, Credit-worthiness Governments/NGOs /Local Communities Good governance, Ethics and Compliance, Support for developmental  programs, Job opportunities, Responsible Citizenry Society at large Environmental impact Definition of Content 17  Corporate Governance  Corporate Governance At the heart of corporate sustainability is sound Corporate Governance. An enlightened governance  body that oversees the companys business strategies and ensures fiscal accountability, ethical  corporate behavior and fairness to all stakeholders, creates all the conditions necessary to foster  sustainability.  This is best exemplified by the longevity of the Tata group, which has been around for  over 150 years.  Being part of such a group, TCS has inherited a strong legacy of fair, transparent and ethical  3 governance, as embodied in the Tata Code of Conduct  (TCoC). This is aligned with the ten principles  articulated in the UN Global Compact to which TCS is a signatory. At the top of the governance structure is the Board of Directors representing the shareholders, and  various Committees on the Board, overseeing the Executive Management. TCS has a unitary board  4 structure consisting of 12 members of whom 9 are Non-Executive Directors  (including the Chairman  5 and Vice-Chairman) and 6 are Independent Directors . The composition of our Board and detailed  6 profiles of Board Members are available on our website .  3 The full text of the Tata Code of Conduct is available on our website. (URL:  http://www.tcs.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/About%20TCS/TCS_CodeofConduct_Oct-2008.pdf ) 4 A Non-Executive Director is defined as a Director who is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the Company and is not a full-time employee of  the Company. 5 An Independent Director is a Non-Executive Director, who (a) does not have any material relationship/ transaction with the Company, its Directors,  Promoters, senior management, holding company and its subsidiaries, (b) Is not related to Promoters/Board/Senior Management, (c) Has not been  an executive of the Company in the past 3 years, (d) Has not been a partner/executive of the Companys statutory audit/ internal audit firm,  legal/consulting firm in the past 3 years, (e) Has not been a material supplier, service-provider or customer or a lessor or lessee of the company, (f) Is  not a substantial shareholder i.e. owning 2% or more and (g) Is not less than 21 years of age. 6 http://www.tcs.com/about/corp_facts/board_directors/Pages/default.aspx Non-Executive Board Members Independent Board Members Ratan N Tata Chairman S Ramadorai,  Vice Chairman  Ishaat Hussain Laura Cha Executive Board Members Prof. Clayton  M Christensen Aman Mehta Dr. Ron Sommer Venkatraman  Thyagarajan Dr. Vijay Kelkar 1 N Chandrasekaran,  CEO and MD 2 S Mahalingam,  CFO and Executive Director 3 Phiroz A Vandrevala,  Executive Director and Head,  Global Corporate Affairs 1 2 3 20  Different aspects of TCS Corporate Governance are addressed below: Aspect How TCS has a Code of Conduct for Non-Executive Directors, requiring them to always act in  the interest of the company and ensure that any other business or personal association,  which they may have, does not involve any conflict of interest with the operations of the  company and their role therein.  Similarly, all employees including the Managing Director and Executive Directors are  prohibited from freelancing or accepting any position of responsibility with or without remuneration with any other  company without TCS written approval. For Executive Directors and the Managing Director, such approval must be  obtained from the Board. Conflict of interest between the Boards executive function and the supervisory function is minimized by making the  Chairmanship of the Board a non-executive role, and keeping it separate from that of the Chief Executive Officer and  Managing Director. Avoidance of Conflict of Interest TCS does not derive any material revenues (~1% of revenues in FY 2011) from other Tata  group companies. There is no intermingling of employees and resources including cash  amongst the Group companies.  Independent Directors make up half the Board. Any dealing with Tata Sons or with a  group company is done on an arms-length basis and has to be approved by the Board.  Such transactions are reviewed closely by the Board to ensure that all shareholders interests are protected before they  are approved. All transactions with Tata group companies are disclosed in our Annual Report (Page 102-106). Intra-group  Transactions To ensure that Business Sustainability gets adequate governance focus, TCS' Board of  Directors meets 7 to 8 times a year. While four of these meetings are for review and  approval of financial results, the remainder is for more detailed oversight of business,  strategy and sustainability matters.  Meeting more than the statutory number of times ensures that the Board's focus goes  beyond financial performance alone and covers various operational and strategic issues including sustainability  aspects, budgets, industry performance, peer review and competition analysis, overall risk assessment, performance of  subsidiaries, opportunities for organic and inorganic growth etc.  The CEO and Managing Director personally oversees the Company's sustainability strategy and reports on the  initiatives and progress at the Board meetings. He is supported by dedicated teams for Corporate Social Responsibility  and Environment, each headed by highly-qualified specialists in their respective domains. Their goals are determined  by Senior Management in line with the Company's overall sustainability objectives, and performance on these two  7 specific aspects of our sustainability agenda is reviewed by the Board on an annual basis . Board Oversight  of the  Sustainability Agenda 7   There are currently no processes in place for evaluating the Boards own performance with regard to sustainability matters. 21  An Audit Committee, consisting of independent, non-executive Directors, provides  oversight of TCS disclosure process to ensure that that sufficient and credible information  is disclosed, and that the published financial statements reflect a true and fair position of  the companys finances. Four meetings are held during the year for approval of quarterly accounts and another three to four meetings for in- depth consideration of internal audit reports. The Audit Committee also actively ensures that the internal audit  processes provide adequate support in improving the Companys business processes, i.e., making the Company more  efficient and cost-effective.  As an additional governance control on access to the Companys cash, TCS has a Bank Account Committee of Directors  which approves the opening and closing of bank accounts of the Company and to authorize persons to operate the  bank accounts of the Company. Fiscal Oversight The Company has appointed E&Y to oversee and carry out internal audits of TCS  activities. The audit is based on an Internal Audit Plan, which is reviewed each year in  consultation with the Statutory Auditors and the Audit Committee. In line with  international practice, the planning and conduct of internal audit is oriented towards the  review of controls in the management of risks and opportunities in the Companys activities. Based on various internal  audits conducted, there has been a substantial amount of improvement in areas of Accounts, HR and Project  Management.  The external auditors of the Company are Deloitte Haskins and Sells, who do not have any undue dependence on TCS. Independent  and Effective Validation  Benchmarked against global peers, TCS discloses significantly more operational and  financial metrics on a quarterly basis. The quarterly, half-yearly and annual results are  published in leading Indian newspapers, emailed out to analysts and investors who  subscribe to that service and posted on our website www.tcs.com. Half-yearly results are  sent to shareholders along with a message from the Managing Director on the Companys performance.  The Earnings Release every quarter is accompanied by a press-conference which is video webcast live through our  website. There is also a conference call where Management briefs investors and analysts on the quarter gone by, and  takes questions.  In addition, there is a robust investor outreach program as part of which the TCS Management meets investors at our  premises or at investor conferences and addresses their queries and concerns. Disclosure and  Transparency The Tata Code of Conduct, which every employee signs at the time of joining the  company, contains 25 clauses that make up a governing framework for responsible  corporate citizenship and ethical behaviour. TCS has established procedures to deploy  the TcoC and to enable employees, customers, suppliers and partners to understand the  code and follow it in letter and spirit.  The leadership team personally conveys TCS values and the importance of the TCoC at employee events. There are  Local Ethics Counselors at every Company location to advise and guide employees on ethical matters. Customers and suppliers are made aware of the TcoC through specific clauses in proposals, contracts, contract  discussions, and through the TCS website. In addition, senior managers with access to privileged information, have to comply with an additional code for the  Prevention of Insider Trading.  TCS also has a global policy to address Sexual Harassment at the work place.  At the Board level, the Ethics and Compliance Committee oversees TCS compliance to the Codes of Conduct to be  followed by the Directors, Officers and other employees. Monthly Reports are sent to the Committee on matters  relating to the Insider Trading Code and the CoC. One meeting of the Ethics and Compliance Committee was held  during the year. 8 Ethics and Compliance Aspect How 8 No significant legal or regulatory non-compliance in general or specifically in relation to the Companys products and services was brought to the Companys  attention in FY2011. 22  Aspect How The Nominations Committee, consisting of two independent Directors and the Chairman,  makes recommendations regarding the composition of the Board, identifies suitable  individuals who can be inducted as Independent Directors and takes steps to refresh the  composition of the Board from time to time. The supervisory capability of the current Board has been significantly boosted by the  inclusion of highly capable individuals with global management perspectives, broad corporate experience and specific  expertise in corporate governance and compliance as independent, non-executive directors. Board Composition and  Selection of  Board Members The Corporate Governance philosophy at TCS, based on the Tata Code of Conduct,  emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. The Company also has a variety  of channels through which minority shareholders can interact with the Management /  Board to express their concerns. There is a year-round, global investor outreach program where investors can interact with Management. Minority  shareholders can move their private resolutions for discussion by the Board of Directors, or even requisition a General  Body Meeting. Small shareholders can interact with the Board of Directors in person at the Annual General Meeting and have their  queries/grievances resolved. They can also communicate any grievance to the Company Secretarys office where  complaints are tracked to closure. In FY 2011, TCS received 355 complaints – mostly about matters regarding transfer  or credit of shares, non-receipt of dividend, notices, annual reports, etc. – all of which were resolved. At the Board level, a Shareholders/Investors Grievance Committee of Directors consisting of two Independent  Directors and one Non-independent Director oversees the redressal of these complaints. This Committee met once  during the year, on March 18, 2011. Protecting Minority  shareholders interests Employees at TCS are highly empowered and the Companys culture encourages open  communications and offers various channels for communicating concerns and grievances.  Larger concerns are represented to the Board by the Executive Directors. In addition,  individual senior-level employees are also invited to present to the Board on specific topics  under discussion, from time to time. Lastly, we have a Whistle Blower Policy, with the necessary mechanism for employees to directly report concerns about  unethical behavior to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee, without fear of reprisal or victimization. Employee access  to the Board TCS has an Enterprise-wide Risk Management (ERM) process administered by a Risk Office  that continually identifies and the various risks threatening the Companys continued  sustainability, as grouped under: (1) Strategic      (2) Operational     (3) Financial and     (4) Compliance related risks The Risk Office maintains a Risk Register and draws up suitable risk mitigation plans for each of the risks identified  therein. These risks are reviewed by the Board periodically. Sustainability and  risk management 23  The Company follows a compensation mix of fixed pay, benefits and Economic Value  Added Analysis based variable pay. Individual performance pay is determined by business  performance and the performance of the individuals measured through the annual  appraisal process. Compensation for Non-Executive Directors on the Board consists of: n Sitting Fees for attending Board meetings and meetings of Committees of the Board, to the tune of Rs 10,000 per  meeting. n Commission, as decided by the Board of Directors and approved by Members at the Annual General Meeting,  within the ceiling of 1% of the net profits of the Company as computed under the Companies Act, 1956. The  commission is distributed amongst the Non-Executive Directors based on their attendance and contribution at the  Board and certain Committee meetings, as well as the time spent on operational matters other than at meetings.  n Reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Directors for attending meetings. Remuneration of the Managing Director and Executive Directors consists of a fixed component (salary, benefits,  perquisites and allowances) and a performance-liked variable component (commission).  The Remuneration Committee decides the annual increments within the salary scale approved by the Members, and  the commission payable to the Managing Director and the Executive Directors out of the profits for the financial year  and within the ceilings prescribed under law. The commission amount is based on the companys performance as well  as that of the Managing Director and each Executive Director, measured along several sustainability-linked criteria  discussed in this report. Details of the compensation paid out to Members of the Board in 2010-11 are disclosed on Page 64 of our Annual  Report. Remuneration Policy Aspect How Business sustainability requires consistency in management vision and minimization of  impact when there is a leadership change. Therefore, succession planning is an important  element in ensuring smooth transitions. At TCS, succession planning occurs at every level  – at the corporate level, at the business unit level, at the account level and even at the  project level. At the highest level, succession planning of senior management is directly reviewed by the Executive Committee of  the Board. Business/Unit Heads are invited to Board Meetings from time to time to give presentations to the Board to  update them. This provides an opportunity for the Board to interact with Senior Executives periodically and assess  values, competencies and capabilities to help them identify suitable internal successors and provide feedback.  In these last four decades, TCS has gone through two CEO-level transitions, the last one in October 2009. The seamless  manner in which that transition took place is evidence that the Companys succession planning is working well. Succession planning 24  Sustainability of  Business Performance  Sustainability of Business Performance Key stakeholder concerns around the sustainability of our business performance are centered around  five major areas: whether there is sufficient headroom for continued growth, whether the Companys  size could impede agility, whether supplyside constraints could hamper growth or impact margins,  whether macroeconomic uncertainties or new technologies might impair business and lastly, whether  the company is investing sufficiently in innovation. Some of these concerns are addressed in this  section of the report.  Some of the key risks to our longer-term sustainability, and TCS approach to mitigating these risks are  summarized on Pages 26-29 of our FY 2011 Annual Report. TCS has had a consistently stellar track-record of revenue growth. Our 6-year CAGR is 22.5% and we  closed FY 2011 with a revenue of USD 8.187 Bn (up 29.1% YoY).  Demand-side Sustainability Other highlights of FY 2011:  n 97.8% of revenues from existing customers n Volume growth of 29.6% YoY n Gross Margin of 45.3%, EBIT margin of 28.1% n Gross headcount addition of 69,685 n Net headcount addition of 38,185 TCS believes that a strong growth trajectory is sustainable in the foreseeable future because (a) the global market for IT services is growing, (b) offshore outsourcing is today a mainstream strategic  option, (c) TCS has the strong foundational elements needed to partake of this growth and  (d) TCS strategy for longer-term growth is delivering results. Global market: Headroom for growth  According to the IDC-NASSCOM Strategic Review 2010-2011, global spend on IT Services and BPO was  estimated to be $732 Bn in 2010, i.e. 2% higher than in 2009. This is a highly fragmented market in which  our marketshare is ~1%, suggesting significant headroom for growth. Going forward, technology spending is expected to further increase as the technology intensity of  businesses increases and lagging verticals as well as geographies play catch up. The 5-year CAGR for the  period 2011-2015 is expected to be 4% according to Gartner. Historically, TCS growth is far higher than  the growth in global spend on IT services. This is due to shifting customer preferences favoring greater  offshore outsourcing – a shift that became even more pronounced in the last few years of global  economic dislocation and drift.  Sustainability of Business Performance 28 Figure 5: Revenue Growth in USD (FY2006-2011)  Foundations for growth Best-in-class Quality The pre-requisites for sustaining our growth are (a) maintaining the same high quality of service that  our customers have come to expect from us, (b) continuing to invest in innovation so we remain  at the cutting edge of technological and business evolution, (c) ensuring that we remain agile despite  the size and (d) creating a strong brand that creates customer loyalty.  In the next few sub-sections, we explore these four foundational elements in further detail. The TCS Quality Management System is a complete set of documents, tools, methods and practices built  on and around the business model, with a focus on service & solution delivery, customer management,  security management and people processes. It also includes suitable measurement protocols to  continuously monitor the effectiveness of the quality system. It focuses on all aspects of project  management, knowledge management, technology management, customer management, product and  service delivery, security management, business continuity, career development and competency  management, associates and other parameters of diversity; thus, ensuring that customers experience a  level of certainty that no other organization can match. Every project executed by TCS goes through a three-tier quality check to ensure that the customer  receives a deliverable of the highest quality: Product Quality Internal Quality Assurance All work items, products or  deliverables undergo peer review /  independent review / self review /  code walkthrough. External Quality Assurance Competent associates external to  the project verify each work item  or deliverable. Product Quality & Process  Compliance Final Inspection An external reviewer does the final  quality check to ensure  completeness and usability of the  package before delivering the final  product to the client. In addition,  the external reviewer periodically  verifies that the team is complying  with all quality process. The Project Leader also does a final  inspection before delivery. 29  In addition, Project Management Reviews (PMR) are conducted every quarter by senior  managers to check the overall health of the project and identify potential risks. Project audits  are performed by an external quality controller (representative of TCS Quality Assurance Group  or a senior team member from another project) to verify compliance with customer-specific  processes and TCS iQMS. Information security and data privacy is critical to our business. Our Security Vision statement is:  To make TCS reliable, resilient and immune to the existing and evolving volatile environment of  constant changes, accidents, attacks and failures so as to enable all our stakeholders experience  certainty. In pursuit of this vision, TCS has implemented a comprehensive Information Security  Management System (ISMS) framework based on the globally recognized ISO 27001:2005 ISMS  standard, covering network controls, network privacy, internet security, patch management  system and controls against malicious software. Our Information Security is managed by a team  of security professionals having industry-recognized credentials such as the CISA, CISM, CISSP,  CEH, CBCP etc, and hailing from varied backgrounds and experience, such as application  development, Infrastructure services, Networking, Forensics, Legal and Compliance.  We consider all client information as confidential and have rigorous processes in place to  protect the same. Our security policy has been framed to comply with all international privacy  laws and information security laws as applicable. Collection, processing and dissemination of  9 any personal data is done under highly controlled conditions .  Constant innovation is important for business sustainability, ensuring as it does, the continued  relevancy of the Company to its customers needs. Innovation is an important part of the  organizational DNA of TCS and a key enabler of the Experience Certainty proposition.  The Company has well defined processes and a framework to drive innovation across its diverse businesses.

The Company continues  to support sabbaticals, internships and PhD sponsorships in research areas relevant to the Company, in  premier academic institutions. Research based competencies have been introduced in the Companys  learning portal. A range of tools from the TCS Tools Group provided automation, process efficiencies,  improvements and innovation in current business areas.  In FY 2011, TCS filed 223 patent applications and got 6 patent grants. Cumulatively, TCS has filed  448 patent applications, of which 68 have been granted.  Research themes for the next year include (but not be limited to) greater focus on non-linear solutions.  Other research areas will be tools, performance and agility, security and privacy, customer experience,  ubiquity and mobility. 31  Non-linear initiatives are those which businesses which can deliver revenue growth without  a commensurate headcount addition. Some examples are:  n  Our products, primarily in the banking, capital markets and insurance  areas (branded as TCS Bncs) contribute about 3.6% of revenues and have been ranked  the best in the respective areas by industry analysts. We are now investing in building  products in the healthcare, retail and government sectors. n  This is a first of its kind software platform targeted at small and medium enterprises,  wherein a monthly subscription fee gives SMEs access to the complete stack of hardware  and a fully integrated suite of software that they need for their end-to-end process  automation needs, all delivered through the cloud. Formally launched in February 2011  in India, this platform has evoked enthusiastic acceptance in the market. n We offer core banking software in a Software-as-a-Service model to the  hundreds of rural banks and co-operative banks that service the large rural population in  the Indian hinterland. This makes available a world-class banking platform at an  affordable cost to these small banks, obviating the need for expensive capex or the  complexities of managing technology. n  TCS has built multi-tenant platforms in the areas of HRO, Finance and  Accounting, Procurement and Analytics partnering best-in-class technology providers  and in Life Insurance Policy Administration using our own Bancs platform. Clients are  migrated from their legacy software to our standardized, shared platform which is  operated by our staff to deliver the desired process outcomes to the client. In effect, the  client pays only for the process outcomes without having to worry about the logistics of  the delivery. Despite an overall focus on cost reduction, TCS R&D expenses actually increased in FY 2011,  in absolute terms as well as a percentage of revenue. Expenses reported under this head  are only those incurred in designated Research and Development centers in India,  including employee cost of research personnel, infrastructure maintenance costs and  other operational costs incurred by these teams. It does not include expenses incurred  by individual business units investing in building products, platforms and other  intellectual property. Software Products: iON: Bank-in-a-box:  Process-in-a-cloud: Expenditure on R&D FY 2010-11 ($ Mn) FY 2009-10 ($ Mn) % Increase R&D Expenses              23.4               18.3         27.9 Structured for Agility  A key concern that sustained growth engenders is the potential loss of agility in an  organization that has outgrown its structure. Another concern is around whether and how the  organization will be able to focus on the right sectors for future growth. Both these concerns are addressed by the new organization structure that TCS rolled out in  2008. This structure was designed to not only enhance customer focus and accountability, but  also to provide agility by reorganizing TCS into multiple, smaller operational units consisting of  32  4,000-15,000 employees, each pursuing the best possible growth in their individual domain (See Figure 8).  Each of the market-facing Business Units owns its own resources and pursues growth in its respective  domain at the best possible pace that the domain can support, with all the agility and focus of a smaller  company. The effectiveness of this structure was evident in FY 2011, when every business unit turned in  the best growth its industry afforded, enabling the Company to report industry-leading topline growth,  while expanding margins further year on year.  CEO & Managing Director R&D Corporate HR Corporate Finance Corporate Affairs Marketing Legal Major Markets Industry Solutions Units New Growth Markets Strategic Initiatives Organizational infrastructure Figure 8 Organization Structure designed for agility Brand-building Being a services company catering to a purely B2B market, sustainability issues such as the  10 environmental, health and safety impacts of products and services are not applicable . Likewise,  product labeling requirements do not apply. Documentation of the custom applications we build for clients is as per mutually agreed specifications. System documentation is not governed by any  regulation or industry code and therefore, the issue of non-compliance does not arise. All our  marketing communications including advertising, promotions and sponsorships comply with the  relevant laws of the countries that we operate in. No instance of regulatory non-compliance was  brought to our attention in FY 2011. 10  No non-compliance with environmental laws /regulations were brought to the Companys attention in FY 2011 33  The related issue of sustainable consumption also does not arise because our clients are sophisticated  consumers – mostly large Global 2000 corporations that consume our services rationally, in accordance  with their business requirements, staying within the vendor concentration limits specified by their risk  oversight policies.  Accordingly, all our marketing communications – including advertising, promotions and sponsorships  – tend to understated, designed to strengthen the trust our clients repose in us when they outsource  the development and upkeep of key mission-critical systems to us, along with other key attributes they  most appreciate in our work: high quality, reliability and dependability. Our tagline, Experience  Certainty captures the essence of these attributes.  Some of the events sponsored by TCS in FY 2011 are as below: TCS is the official technology partner for Team Garmin-Cervlo, a top-ranked  powerhouse in professional cycling for the racing season 2011. TCS is the technology partner of the Rajasthan Royals, the Jaipur franchise  cricket team that represents the state of Rajasthan in the Indian Premier  League. TCS provides IT expertise to help the team analyze the players'  performance, simulation and other areas. In turn, TCS enjoys greater visibility  among cricketing fans, with the RR players sporting the TCS logo.  To reinforce TCS brand attribute of commitment to excellence, we sponsor  various marathons across the world in order to support the commitment to  excellence of the participants.  These sponsorships also serve to reinforce our commitment to wellness,  because they give us an opportunity to engage with runners, their friends  and family, and the broader community to drive home the importance of  fitness and health. In FY 2011, TCS sponsored five major marathons: n Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon (which won the Gold Label by the  IAAG in 2010, the highest recognition of organizational excellence for a  road race) n World 10K Bangalore n Boston Marathon n Bank of America Chicago Marathon n ING New York City Marathon Building awareness around the TCS brand amongst school children and  sparking an interest in IT amongst them is important for future supply-side  sustainability. One way we do this is by sponsoring and organizing TCS IT  Wiz, Indias first and biggest IT quiz for schools, conducted in 12 cities. This  event, in its twelfth year, has become a benchmark in the inter-school  quizzing circuit for the level of research, the intensity with which teams  compete and the sheer participation numbers it draws. 34  TCS evaluates the health of the corporate brand at regular intervals in select markets. The evaluation  is benchmarked against a pre-defined competitive set, and along specific image and personality  parameters that include attributes such as ethical and trustworthy. The Companys marketing and  communications strategy is fine-tuned based on findings from this brand survey. In FY 2011, we  launched the Certainty 2.0 campaign, which further improves on the positioning achieved through  the original Experience Certainty branding.  Figure 9 TCS' advertisement on our marathon sponsorships 35  Strategy for long-term growth TCS revenue growth comes from following a multi-pronged strategy built around  (I) expanding our addressable market by geography, by industry and by service-line and  (ii) deepening our client relationships. Key elements of this strategy for sustainable, longer- term growth are summarized in Figure 10 and explained in greater detail on Pages 19-20  of our FY 2011 Annual Report. Strategy for Long-term Sustainable Growth Customer Centricity TM GNDM Strategic Acquisitions Non-Linear Business Models Full Services Capability Financial Sustainability Figure 10 Five point strategy for long term growth Successful execution of our strategy for sustainable growth requires investments in building  capacity, in people and in new business initiatives. The ability to fund these investments either  through internal accruals or from the outside is critical to business sustainability. Happily, TCS  business model has a financial profile characterized by strong cash generation, low capital needs,  low working capital requirements, negligible debt and very attractive Return on Equity. TCS is a  near zero-debt company, funding its growth entirely through internal accruals. We did not receive  11 any significant governmental financial assistance in FY 2011 .  These are structural attributes of our business model, and sustainable going forward. Equally  important, we have a robust risk management framework using which we scan the environment  for potential risks to this sustainability and take mitigative steps. Some of the key attributes of our  financial sustainability are further explored in this section. The Companys growth is financed by cash generated from operations. As of March 31, 2011,  Total Shareholders Equity stood at $5,657 Mn of which Retained Earnings made up $5,031.5 Mn. As at March 31, 2011, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $348.5 Mn (FY10: $228.2 Mn)  and Bank Deposits of $713.2 Mn (FY10: $813.1 Mn). Cashflow from Operations was $1,526.4 Mn. Strong Cashflows 11  Excluding tax incentives applicable in specific locations 36  The Company believes that it has sufficient cash from operations to meet its working capital  requirements. In addition it has short term working capital facilities with various commercial banks.  The available lines of credit with banks were $ 307 Mn as at March 31, 2011. Although we have historically never used debt to fund growth, that option is always available given  our strong credit-worthiness. An independent assessment of the Companys financial strength and  sustainability is the credit rating assigned to TCS by various global rating agencies.  Independent Credit Ratings Credit Rating Agency Rating Comments Moodys Investor Services A3 Investment Grade Issuer Baa1 indicative foreign currency  debt rating with stable outlook The rating is not for an specific debt issuance by  the Company.  Standard and Poors Ratings Services BBB corporate credit rating Outlook: Positive Dun & Bradstreet 5A1 (Condition-Strong) The rating is assigned  on the basis of tangible  net worth and composite  appraisal of the Company. Shareholder Value delivered, year after year After going public, TCS has consistently paid out dividends to its shareholders every year, maintaining  a payout ratio of around 30%. In FY 2011, the Company paid a total dividend of $0.29 (Rs 14) i.e. a  payout ratio of 36.63% of the unconsolidated profits under US GAAP. TCS market capitalization as of March 31, 2011 was $51.9 Bn, a 53% increase over the market-cap at  the end of FY 2010.  Supplyside Sustainability The largest factor that goes into our business is human capital and therefore sustainability of  revenue growth in the IT Services industry is directly dependent on the organizations ability to attract the right talent in the right quantity and thereafter, upskilling, motivating and retaining them 12 in the organization .  Ours is a highly educated, highly aware workforce whose technical skills are much valued globally and  consequently, many of the labor-management imbalances found in traditional industry (or the  corrective measures sought through collective bargaining) are largely absent here. Employment is at  will with one months notice period from either side for termination, but employees have significantly  higher bargaining power in this industry, so workers interests are largely protected by the free market  and less than 0.01% of the workforce is unionized.  Recognizing the criticality of human capital to the business and its sustainability, TCS has  mature processes devoted to attracting, retaining and developing this human capital, assessed at  PCMM Level 5.  12  The supplyside part of our business is largely around human capital. In addition, we procure various pieces of equipment and software that make up the  Companys IT infrastructure, largely sourced from the local offices of leading global technology providers. Office supplies and consumables are all locally  sourced by individual operating units in the different regions where we operate.  37  The total number of employees including subsidiaries as at March 31, 2011 was 198,614  (End-FY10: 160,429). Excluding non-wholly owned subsidiaries, the headcount stood at  175,373 (FY10: 140,619). It is a predominantly young workforce, with an average of ~28 years.  A break-up of the workforce by employee category and age is given below: Senior Level 4% Middle Level 38% Junior Level 58% Figure 11 Break up of workforce by category >50 Yrs, 1% 40-50 Yrs 3% 30-40 Yrs, 26% <30 Yrs 70% Figure 12 Breakup of workforce by age Talent Acquisition A most critical component of sustaining the Companys growth trajectory has been the  companys ability to attract good talent in sufficient numbers and to successful scale up the  talent acquisition process.   The capacity and capability needs to meet short, medium and long-term business plans drawn  up by business units and corporate functions serve as the basis for our global workforce  planning. The consolidated requirements are part-fulfilled by re-skilling / up-skilling existing  unallocated associates and the balance fulfilled through focused drives by the Talent  Acquisition Group. Experienced professionals are recruited through online jobsites, head- hunters, recruitment agencies and through employee reference schemes. Other sources of  experienced talent include strategic initiatives like M&A and In-sourcing. On-campus recruitment of fresh engineering graduates plays a very significant part in the  Companys talent acquisition strategy, so the Company is invested in building strong  relationships with universities across the world and in improving the quality of academic  training at engineering colleges. In FY 2011, TCS recruited 69,685 employees on a gross basis  (FY 2010: 38,063). Of this, 26,458 i.e. 38% of the gross hires were fresh graduates.

The Academic Interface Program (AIP)  helps build a robust high-quality, long-term relationship between the Company and academic  institutions. Key highlights of our AIP are: Faculty Development Programs (FDP): TCS senior consultants conduct training programs for faculty, to keep them abreast with technology developments and provide them with an industry perspective.  Student Workshops: Training sessions for students on technical, managerial or soft-skills topics to  enhance competitiveness and workplace-readiness.  Membership of Board of Studies (BoS) / Curriculum Committees: TCS representatives participate in Curriculum Committees or Board of Studies of select academic institutes, to help shape the curricula and make it more industry-oriented. Project Support and Internships: TCS provides internship opportunities for students from Indian  and overseas institutions and sponsors the Best Student and for the Best Student Project awards.  Sponsorship of Academic Events and hosting professors on sabbatical in TCS. Dedicated portal for academia: TCS maintains a web portal linked to TCS website for continuous  dialogue with academia on the performance of their alumni and on the curriculum, with useful  resources for students deciding on their career. Sangam, an annual meet with academic leaders from major engineering and management institutes TCS offers higher education programs for its associates in partnership with prestigious Institutes in  India like Anna University – Chennai and Jadavpur University – Kolkata. With custom-tailored training programs and greater gender / cross-cultural sensitization,  TCS has been able to expand the talent pool from which to recruit, in terms of gender, geography  and academic discipline.  n n n n n n n n 39  TCS is an Equal Opportunity Employer and subscribes to the Tata Code of Conduct in embracing  diversity in race, nationality, religion, ancestry, marital status, gender, age, ethnic origin, physical  ability and sexual orientation. Compensation levels are merit-based, determined by qualification,  experience levels, special-skills if any and performance. Gender and any of the other diversity  parameters dont play any part. Nevertheless, a formal Diversity and Inclusion policy is currently  under preparation. TCS participates in the Tata groups Second Career initiative which offers job opportunities to  women returning to the workplace after a break in their careers. We also have an initiative called  DAWN (Diversity and Womens Network), a support group for women and minorities, that fosters  inclusivity through collaborative dialog. DAWN organizes leadership-connects, mentoring,  discussion forums, sensitization workshops, wellness sessions and reorientation programs for  associates returning to the workplace after long-leave. 'Culture Meter' aims to build appreciation in  the workforce for different cultures and practices across the globe through mailers, quizzes and  other online resources. As at March 31, 2011, women constituted 30 % of TCS workforce (unchanged since last year). The number of non-Indian nationals in our workforce stood at 11,682 (excluding subsidiaries),  representing 99 different nationalities (FY 2010: 80 nationalities). The breakup by nationality is  provided in Figure 16.

Designed as an intensive  seven-month training program covering computing, core technology skills, TCS processes and  tools, communication and team skills, business literacy, and cultural awareness along with live  project experience, Ignite equips science graduates with the skills necessary to pursue a career in  the IT industry.  TCS is a multinational company with operations in 42 countries. Local recruitment is an  integral part of our staffing strategy in each of these countries, spanning every level in the  local organization. In FY 2011, TCS recruited ~7500 employees outside India. The percentage of senior-level employees amongst local recruits was 6.12% (FY 2010: 5.54%), higher than the  enterprise average of 4%. 40  Fresher recruitment is facilitated by the relationships built up with empanelled universities through  our University Outreach / Academic Interface Programs in different parts of the world. The brand  awareness created by those programs helps attract quality talent when we formally participate in their  placement programs and conduct on-campus interviews. Recruitment of experienced professionals is  done through our empanelled recruitment agencies and head-hunters.  A key element of the manpower demand fulfillment strategy is the need-based use of contractors,  especially for assignments which are of a short-term nature or which require skills not readily available  or in sufficient numbers internally. For this purpose, TCS maintains strong relationships with a network  of empanelled vendors – staffing agencies and head-hunters – in every country that we operate in.  We tap into this network to find suitable candidates whenever the need arises. In case those skills are  needed on a longer term basis, TCS looks to build equivalent capabilities internally and eventually  replace these contractors with employees. In FY 2011, TCS spent $465 Mn (5.7% of Rev) on  subcontractors (FY10: $351.2 Mn, 5.5%). TCS views talent retention as another critical success factor – as important as talent acquisition – and  has invested heavily in building an employee-friendly culture and developing mature people- processes towards improving it. We have been assessed enterprise wide at PCMM Level 5 and our  retention programs are considered best-in-class in the industry. Employee retention has been  enhanced through a wide range of competency enhancement and career growth options, role  mobility, challenging assignments, competitive and differential compensation, flexible working hours,  a collaborative work environment, rewards, recognition and benefits. The outcomes of these retention programs have also been best in class. The return to work and  retention rates after parental leave are high, at 74%. The majority of parental leave is taken by female  associates. 6 out of the 8 employees who opted for adoption leave were women. Our attrition figures  have historically been, and continue to be, the lowest in the industry. In FY 2011, attrition in IT Services  was 13.1% (on a LTM basis) while overall attrition, including BPO, stood at 14.4%, which is the lowest in  our peer group. Of this, attrition caused by departures of new hires within the same year was 4.4%.  Attrition amongst female employees was 31.21 %. Attrition levels are higher at junior levels – at 16%.

To enable systematic tracking of the training  roadmap of a large workforce, TCS has an integrated competency management system in  which the various systems for learning, competency management, skill assessment and  individual development are integrated and which provides employees with an end-to-end  view of their learning and competency development needs, as well as their progress against  the plan.  At the start of the year, every employee in consultation with her/his supervisor, works out a  learning and development plan for the year, based on their interests and aspirations as well as  the needs of the specific project / Business Unit. Thereafter, the employee goes through various  training sessions and workshops as outlined in the plan. These could be through e-learning  sessions on our in-house Learning Management System, external certifications, classroom  sessions conducted by various technical centers of excellence within TCS or Management  Development Programs (MDPs). Each associate is assessed biannually on the progress made  against this plan.

The breakup of this is as below: Senior Level 1% Middle Level 6% Junior Level 93% Figure 20 Breakup of learning days by employee category Of this, some 123,822 learning days went into developing management skills and leadership  qualities amongst employees identified for managerial and leadership roles.  Training programs at the entry level as well as the continuous learning programs that cover  technology, domain and project management practices have been enhanced during the year  to ensure that TCS develops the right competencies in its workforce that can deliver and meet  customers' business needs. This process, in turn, helps individuals drive growth in their careers  and realize their potential in different ways. 42  TCS places significant emphasis on training and grooming employees at all levels with a long term  perspective that develops the right competencies which help individuals drive growth in their careers  and realize their potential in different ways to support their continued employment and post  retirement phase. In addition, HR also organises multiple programs on financial management, health  and other areas that assist them in managing career endings. Every individual aspires for career progression, so catering to these aspirations, motivating  employees to realize their potential and providing them with a predictable roadmap and  necessary tools for personal growth is key to retaining employees.  Personal Development Planning for all employees, male and female, forms a central part of our  annual appraisal and goal-setting process, and is linked to the competency development and  learning plans described in the earlier section. Apart from technical competency development,  there is also tremendous focus on soft skills development including team building, innovative and  creative thinking, cross cultural adaptation etc.  TCS keeps employees engaged and motivated by providing opportunities for continuously upgrading  competencies by rotation across roles, technologies, customer and industries and geographies. With  an explicit linkage to competency and performance, career progression becomes a highly transparent  experience and serves as a powerful motivator. TCS has to attract and retain talent in a highly competitive labor market. The workforce consists of  mainly software engineers who hold engineering graduate and post-graduate degrees and even  entry-level wages of engineers in any country tend to be several times higher than the minimum  wage in that country. Our employee cost over the last three years is given below: Career Development Competitive Compensation Model  To ensure competitiveness in the pursuit of talent, TCS regularly benchmarks its compensation  13 plans and benefits  with those offered by peers to ensure that competitiveness. There is also a skill- based allowance for employees possessing niche skills, designed to motivate employees to acquire  marketable skills thereby benefiting themselves as well as the company. Compensation structures are driven by prevailing practices in the different countries we operate in.  But across the enterprise, remuneration is the same for men and women working at the same 14 location and in the same grade . In India, in addition to a fixed component of the salary, there is a  variable component linked to the Economic Value Added (EVA). Payout of that component depends on  13  TCS offers gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan for eligible employees in India and in certain overseas locations. The plan provides for a lump sum  payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment. Total benefit obligation at the end of FY2011  stood at $181.7 Mn. More details are provided on Pages 136-137 of the Annual Report. 14 Remuneration for men and women at the same location and grade is in the ratio 1:1 43 $Mn FY09 FY10 FY11 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Employee Costs 2009-11 Figure 21 Rising employee costs FY2009-11  organizational performance as well as individual performance. This alignment of the  Companys interests and the individuals interests has the effect of strengthening team spirit  and improving collaboration amongst teams. TCS has several schemes for recognizing and rewarding employees. In addition to a formal  online reward and recognition system called GEMS, there are various rewards like Star of the  Month, On the Spot Award, Faculty awards, Young innovator award, long service award and  appreciation certificates that recognize and reward good performance. Other forms of rewarding outstanding performance include fast-track promotions,  sponsorship of external training and certification programs, assignment to key positions,  membership to professional bodies, sponsorship to international conferences, public  announcements of individual/team achievements on the intranet, internal magazines, town  hall meetings and so on. The importance of work content and an individuals quest for self actualization can never be  overstated. By virtue of its broad footprint across geographies, across industries and appetite  for executing large complex projects, TCS offers plenty of opportunities for ambitious  individuals who seek challenging assignments and exposure to different kinds of roles,  technologies and geographies. This has been an important aspect of TCS best-in-class ability to  retain high performers. Employee retention and motivation are greatly facilitated through closer engagement with  employees and by fostering a spirit of community, through shared activities outside of work.  TCS sponsors picnics and social gatherings at every location so employees and their families  get together under informal settings. Another forum for employees and their families to  participate in and develop sense of camaraderie is Maitree, which harnesses their energy  and enthusiasm to undertake activities for the betterment of the local communities and the environment.  Wellness is the other side of the same coin. TCS actively supports athletic and sporting activities  at the national, regional and local level and encourages employees to participate. On TCS  campuses, the focus on wellness translates into a myriad of activities, from yoga to aerobics;  from tennis and badminton coaching to cricket and football tournaments. Our sponsorship of  the Mumbai Marathon and other long-distance events across the world has sparked  widespread interest in fitness and running. TCS is committed to providing a healthy and safe work environment to all associates and  partners on TCS premises. Occupational Health and Safety Management System as per OHSAS  18001:2007 has been deployed and enterprise wide certification for 67 facilities (including  7 overseas facilities) has been received by Third Party certification agency.  To ensure continual improvement in the safety standards, TCS has instituted HSE committees  across all its centres. Fire and other emergency preparedness drills are conducted as per  defined frequency. TCS facilities located in various geographies track and comply with all local  legal and statutory requirements related to occupational health and safety. Reward and Recognition Challenging Assignments Employee engagement and motivation Occupational Health & Safety 44  The occupational risks related to associate activity in the facility is low and mainly consist of workplace  environment issue like slips, trips and falls, vision-related issues associated with display screen  equipment (computer monitors), ergonomic issues related to long sedentary hours and work station  design, illumination, thermal comfort, indoor air quality, food and water hygiene-related issues, etc.  TCS has addressed all the above issues in the design stage itself through appropriate infrastructural  facilities. In addition, there is periodic monitoring, periodic upgrades, training, awareness campaigns  and mock drills. Employee workstations and chairs are ergonomically designed, sufficiently spacious and well-lit, as per  BEE (Bureau of Energy Efficiency) standards. Other features include: thermal comfort monitoring, slip- resistant flooring, training on correct ergonomic postures, low radiation display screens, indoor air  quality monitoring and fire drills.  Apart from these, trainings on preparedness in natural and other  emergencies are also imparted. Other proactive initiatives include camps for periodic medical checks,  in-house doctors, first aid facilities and counseling for stress management. The risks related to contractor activities in the facility are addressed through engineering controls,  administrative, PPEs etc.  Guidelines and manuals are in place to ensure road safety, incident, injury & illness reporting, pest  control guidelines etc. In FY 2011, more than 75,000 associates and contractors were a part of  classroom sessions, floor-walks, awareness campaigns and web based training on Health & Safety. In FY 2011, a stringent incident and near-miss reporting system was deployed to ensure 100% closure  of all incidents that were reported. This system was a step forward towards creating incident free work  environment. A large number of associates participated in awareness campaigns on occupational  health and safety that were periodically convened in FY 2011.  Nutrition Week (1st – 7th September, 2010) A series of mailers were circulated on healthy living, the importance of exercise etc. The Body Mass  Index calculator was launched on the internal portal. The portal provides tips to employees to  promote a healthy lifestyle.  Road Safety Week (1st – 7th January, 2011) Road Safety Week was observed at various TCS locations to create awareness about safety and road  rules and regulations for pedestrians and drivers. The awareness sessions also focused on safety while  travelling in company buses and incident reporting.  Safety Week (1st – 7th March, 2011) In line with the National Safety Council, the theme for the Safety Week was Behavior Based Safety  (BBS). A variety of competitions were convened to promote that Safety is everyones responsibility.  Competitions were convened to encourage incident reporting. Within the safety week, 50 situations  were reported from various TCS offices.  Typical to any service sector company, injuries common in TCS offices include first aid cases, slips, trips  and falls, illness and road accidents that the associates meet with while commuting. The focus is on  capturing the all the incident data including near-misses. An increase in the number of incidents/near- misses reported (97 in FY 2011) reflects the success of the drive. Occupational Health & Safety Campaigns Injury Data 45  The increase in the injury incidence rate over the last three years (as shown below) is a  reflection of the increase in incident reporting rather than an increase in the actual number of incidents. TCS has deployed an online occupational incident management tool to facilitate tracking and  effective management of all incidents. In 2010-2011, the HSE vendor assessment was initiated. The assessment engaged 50 key vendors  and mandatory and desirable requirements as per TCS were communicated to them. The vendor  selection process is a part of the mandatory criterion. The desirable criterion has been enforced to allow the vendors the opportunity to build capacity to meet the stakeholders expectations.  The desirable criterion shall become mandatory for the vendor over a timeline of 3 years. The  forms of engagements are convened to promote among vendors an assurance of compliance  with the mandatory HSE requirements while encouraging them to gradually comply with the  other criterion as well. Vendor audits are also conducted for key vendors to ensure compliance to regulatory  requirements. TCS has created campus-style facilities across various locations. At present, construction is in  progress at 5 locations which include Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Chennai. In order to monitor the safety at the construction sites, TCS has appointed an independent  construction safety officer for unbiased assessment at construction site. Amenities like safe  drinking water, proper drainage, regular medical check-up of labors and waste disposal facilities  are available at site and labor camps. Safety induction trainings for new workers are mandatory. Various trainings like On-the-job  training, tool box talks are provided to create awareness about safety amongst the workers and  project staff. Regular inspection of construction plant and machinery equipment, work permit  systems, personal protective equipment, is conducted as a part of the safety management  system. Quarterly comprehensive audits are also conducted to assess the sites safety  performance. All applicable legal and statutory requirements are identified, assessed and  complied with.

No fatalities were reported during the financial year 2011 on account of effective implementation of  stringent safety practices. In addition, during financial year 2011 there were no lost time injuries. The  construction safety performance measured in LTIFR (Loss Time Injury Frequency Rate) was zero with  no reportable accidents recorded across all the construction sites. Several measures for example the  number of safety trainings including tool box talks (37,448), number of safety observation (6,831),  number of safety audits and inspections (583) and number of safety meetings (121) are also being  tracked as lead indicators. Being part of the Tata group, TCS has a unique relationship with society at large, the capital structure  ensuring that shareholder interests are fully aligned with societys. In this section, we examine this  relationship further, look at the direct and indirect impact that TCS operations have on the local  communities and TCS global CSR initiatives – through volunteering, funding and pro bono leveraging  of our IT capabilities – in the areas of Education, Health and Environment. While the traditional corporate mandate of maximizing shareholder returns has been gradually  replaced with a more enlightened, more inclusive and therefore more sustainable concept of  stakeholder value, there is always the question of whose interests gets primacy when the interests of  individual stakeholder groups are not fully aligned. The unique ownership structure of TCS ensures that the interests of shareholders and those of local  communities as well as that of the larger society are fully aligned, allowing the organization to perform  greater social good by just focusing on running the business well. Tata Sons Ltd, the holding company of the Tata group, owns close to 75% of TCS. Around two-thirds of  the equity of Tata Sons Ltd is held by various philanthropic trusts – the largest being the Sir Dorabji  Tata Trust and Sir Ratan Tata Trust – which have created and nurtured leading national institutions for  science and technology, medical research, social studies and the performing arts.  These trusts also provide aid and assistance to various non-government organizations working in the  areas of education, healthcare and livelihoods. More details of the work funded by these trusts can be  found on their websites (www.dorabjitatatrust.com and www.srtt.org).  Thus, nearly 49% of the dividend paid out by TCS every year goes towards funding the philanthropic  work carried out by these trusts. It is a source of tremendous pride and motivation to our associates  that that their efforts and contribution to the companys success results in tangible benefit to society  on a scale much larger than what any standalone CSR program could hope to achieve. The most significant, direct economic impact we have is the productivity benefits that our clients gain  from the automation of their various business processes using the IT applications we build for them  and also from plain vanilla IT outsourcing. According to one recent study of labor productivity in the  credit union industry spanning 1992-2005, the first wave of productivity improvement (at a time  where the IT function was largely managed in-house) mainly came from computerization of hitherto  manual processes and thereafter, the largest benefits came from outsourcing. The authors found that  credit unions which outsource IT incurred 30% lower costs than if they performed the function in- house. Greater cost-efficiency and productivity at a firm-level translates into better productivity at the  Community Engagement 47  level of the larger economy and thus, we can claim a role in a transformational phase of the  global economy, marked by significant productivity gains from the deployment of IT.  The productivity benefits from our IT-related work directly translate into community benefits  when we engage with various governments to digitize their operations, that too in the area of  citizenry services. The level of transparency, access and empowerment that these initiatives can  create in communities can never be overstated. We do not believe that any part of our  operations has a potential or actual negative impact on the communities we work in. Secondly, our profitable global operations result in payment of the applicable corporate taxes  in multiple countries, helping fund the governments there and thereby improving the quality  of civic services in those jurisdictions. Tax expense relating to overseas operations is  determined in accordance with tax laws applicable in countries where such operations are  domiciled and provided for. In FY 2011, TCS provided for a total tax expense of $465.3 Mn,  distributed across 50 countries.  TCS strategy of a distributed delivery capability, tapping into the local talent in each of our  delivery locations has resulted in a largely balanced, positive economic impact in each of those  locations through employment generation – direct and indirect. Direct employment results in  the creation of a few tens of thousands of high-paying, white-collar jobs, broadening the tax  collections at the local, state and central levels.  And then there is indirect employment. Each of our delivery centers, housing a few thousand  employees are massive and their construction employs architects, engineers and hundreds of  construction workers. Once the facility is commissioned, the center opens up tremendous local  employment opportunities for workers with all kinds of skills as our vendor-partners begin to  hire housekeeping staff, security guards, drivers, gardeners, maintenance workers, chefs,  cafeteria staff etc. The creation of all these jobs, direct and indirect, at one location, creates a massive demand  for local housing there, sparking a secondary real-estate boom in residential properties  with multiple projects coming up, employing hundreds of skilled and unskilled construction  workers.  Moreover, the beneficiaries of these net new jobs are often young (median age of the  workforce: 28 years) and therefore tend to display high consumption patterns, benefiting local  businesses and by extension, the local economies. The spending behavior and consumption  patterns of our employees open up tremendous business and entrepreneurial opportunities.  Banks set up branches or ATMs to service this highly attractive demographic. Small businesses  come up in the vicinity to supply all varieties of services and products – restaurants, grocers,  departmental stores, gyms, pharmacies etc. These in turn generate even more local  employment and opening up new tax revenues for the government.  15 All in all, it is conservatively estimated that we generate 4 indirect jobs for every 1 direct job .  Taking these indirect jobs into account, TCS consolidated, global employment footprint is  estimated at over 800,000. The coming up of new communities around our delivery centers is also accompanied by  development of the local infrastructure. Local municipalities and utilities respond to the needs  of the growing community by improving existing roads and building new ones to improve  connectivity, extending the grid to supply electricity and laying pipelines for water and  sewerage. Public and private transport providers begin catering to the commuting needs of  local residents. Telecom companies set up towers nearby for mobile connectivity and cables for  Direct and Indirect Employment Infrastructure Development 48 15  Source: NASSCOM Strategic Review 2010  voice and data services. The blooming of physical infrastructure is accompanied by development of  educational and healthcare infrastructure, resulting in a vibrant, standalone township.  Historically, Indian IT industry came up mainly in the four metros (New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and  Kolkata), Bangalore and Hyderabad, taking advantage of the availability of engineering talent and  supporting infrastructure.  Recognizing the multiplier effect that the IT-BPO industry has on the local economy, various state  governments are encouraging IT companies to establish centers in smaller cities in order to broadbase  the resultant economic development beyond just the Tier I cities – a geographical trickledown of sorts. Consequently, the IT industry has started establishing centers in Tier II and Tier III cities, taking  advantage of lower costs and the highly motivated local workforce. TCS has been leading this foray  into the hinterland, with headcount in Tier II/III cities* steadily growing as a percentage of our total  India headcount over the last 3 years.  Broadbased Regional Development Year FY09 FY10 FY11 Tier II/III Headcount 6.7% 8.4% 9.7% * Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Pune, Kochi, Bhubaneswar etc Intangible benefits Serving as an Ethical Exemplar TCSers comprise a set of highly educated, highly visible young professionals, almost a third of them  women, working out of campuses on the outskirts of the cities and increasingly in the smaller cities.  This has other intangible influences on the more traditional communities in which our campuses  might be located.  The evidence of social progress and individual prosperity resulting from college education influences  parents in these communities to invest in their childrens further education. Traditional biases against  the girl-child weaken and girls in the community find inspiration to overcome traditional barriers and  seek higher education and pursue careers. These changes in behaviors and outlooks have a positive  impact on the overall developmental metrics of nearby communities. Another impact of TCS operations in the community is the superior moral environment we help foster  through our values-driven behavior. TCS regards integrity as a core value that underpins all business  activities. Our reputation of trust has been earned through several decades of such consistent, value- driven conduct.  We have adopted the Tata Code of Conduct (TCoC) which every employee of TCS signs up on joining  the company and which serves as an ethical roadmap in our daily activities. Training on Tata Code of  Conduct (TCoC) is a mandatory part of the induction of all associates. Awareness is heightened by  organizing road-shows, compliance workshops and an annual Ethics Week featuring quizzes,  awareness sessions, essay-writing contests etc. There is also a Whistleblower Policy through which  instances of malfeasance can be reported directly to the Board without fear of reprisal. The outcome of this corporate-wide emphasis on ethical behavior, integrity and individual  16 accountability is a very high level of employee awareness of the Companys values . In the 2010  employee satisfaction (PULSE) survey, 93.3% percent of associates expressed satisfaction with the level  of awareness of the Tata Code of Conduct and with TCS adherence to it in spirit and letter.  16  2010 employee satisfaction (PULSE) survey, 93.3% percent of associates expressed satisfaction with the level of awareness of the Tata Code of Conduct and  with TCS adherence to it in spirit and letter.  49  The fact that the Company has been able to build a strong, highly successful, global business  without compromises on the ethical front makes TCS a moral exemplar worthy of emulation,  spreading our culture outside the organizations boundaries. In all our contracts we explicitly  mention the TCoC clause to our Customers, Partners and Suppliers. We also participate in  international and group forums as part of the learning and sharing mechanisms. While TCS works closely with consultative bodies and working committees of various industry  associations in advising governments on policy formulation or advocating changes to policy,  the Company does not spend on lobbying and maintains an entirely apolitical stance in line  with the Tata Code of Conduct. We do not support any specific political party or candidate for  political office. Nor do we offer or give any company funds or property as donations to any  political party, candidate or campaign. A strong commitment to human rights is an integral part of the Tata Code of Conduct. TCS  follows a rigorous screening process before entering into a business relationship with its  vendors. All the contracts that we enter into, representing 100% of our operations, in every part  of the world, require the counter-party to comply with the relevant laws safeguarding labor  rights and human rights in the respective jurisdiction. All employees, including security  personnel, are sensitized to human rights as part of their orientation program. The nature of  our business precludes operations at risk of human rights violations. So we do not carry out  formal human rights reviews or impact assessments. No incident of discrimination or non- compliance with relevant labor laws by any of our business partners was brought to our notice  in FY 2011. No grievance related to human rights violation was filed in FY 2011.  Tata Consultancy Services works towards realizing social good by nurturing people and planet  in recognition that an equitable socio-economic system is vital to the sustainability of a  corporation. As part of our Corporate Social Responsibility, TCS undertakes programs for  communities in the three broad areas of Education, Health and Environment. The engagements  take three broad forms: Apolitical Stance Commitment to Human Rights Corporate Social Responsibility Core  Competencies TCS employs pro  bono use of our core  competencies for  example: IT for  community welfare Sponsorships TCS sponsors  initiatives,  organizations and  engages in  philanthropic  activities Volunteering TCS-Maitree is our  volunteering and  employee  engagement arm. It  consists of TCS  employees and their  families 50  TCS has created process documents which use specific indicators to identify significant communities in  the geography within which they operate. The Strategic Planning document and the Community  Locator prepared and applied in 2010, identify generic steps leading to a customized and strategic CSR  plan for developing and deploying an initiative in a particular geography. We do not believe we have  any significant negative impact on any community where our operations are based, so our community  initiatives are largely promotive or preventive in nature, rather than curative. In FY 2011, TCS spent an estimated USD 6.6 Mn on CSR initiatives. In addition, TCS associates and  families volunteered 55,068 hours on CSR activities. TCS community initiatives have focused on enabling communities and people to take lead in their  own live and improve their well-being. TCS has sought to achieve this through literacy, training and  information on skills, and education on health, financial management etc.  Impact through Empowerment Figure 23- Adult Literacy Programme Computer-based Functional Literacy  The Adult Literacy Programme, the flagship  programme of CSR at TCS, enables inclusion of  people into information streams so that they are  equipped to make better choices . TCS developed the Computer Based Functional  Literacy paradigm through the use of its IT core  competencies. The programme was first  launched in 2000 and till date has made 1,75,000  people literate. In FY 2011 TCS is partnering with  the National Literacy Mission Authority in India  to spread literacy under the Saakshat Bharat  Programme through a camp based mode.  A pilot programme of 9 camps in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh were held  between July to September 2010, where 399 women were made literate with writing and numeracy  skills. By June 2012 a larger rollout of 228 camps all over India will cover around 23,000 women to  make them functionally literate in reading, writing and numeracy. Figure 24- mKRISHI providing assistance  to farmers in India mKRISHI TCS developed a mobile based crop advisory service to help  rural farmers throughout India have better access to  agricultural information through a cell phone application. It  provides expert advice and personalized information to rural  farmers in their local language and is also adaptable to illiterate  farmers who can register a query using voice-specific functions. The value of mKRISHI and its business implications in the rural  scenario are quite significant. In rural India there is a limited  availability of electricity, therefore the use of a mobile phone is  an effective way to provide timely information to the rural  population.  mKrishi delivers personalized rural services like Crop Advisory,  Best Practices, Financial Services, Rural Employment,  Government Services and Weather Information.   51  Figure 26 Childline: emergency helpline for  children in distress Figure 27 TCS Application prepared for  Smile Train Farmer logs have indicated that mKRISHI has  resulted in increase in yield, reduction in cost,  improved efficiency and better price for the  produce for farmers. It has also led to income  generation opportunities for the rural youth and  agricultural graduates. Information about appropriate use of chemical  fertilizer has led to the avoidance of soil erosion  and infertility. There has also been a reduction in  ground water pollution as a result of excessive  use of nitrogen fertilizer. Figure 25 Farmers using the mKRISHI application In 2010-2011 farmers from Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh  have benefitted from services provided by mKRISHI. In the UK, TCS is working with the Governments Department for International Development  (DFID) potentially to deploy its IT capabilities in developing countries. In FY 2011, mKRISHI was  identified as one of only 30 DFID supported world beating projects.  ChildLine Smile Train TCS uses its core competencies to develop  Management Information Systems pro bono  for NGOs.  TCS developed the ChildLine/ChildNet  application for Chidline India Foundation that  has been deployed extensively. At present,  this software covers 200 cities/districts in  India and by 2015 the organization plans to  cover 640 districts/cities with this software.  TCS has also provided a comprehensive  Donor Management System to the  organization. TCS has developed a comprehensive solution  to enhance patient care for Smile Train, an  NGO that works with children with cleft  palates. The solution encapsulates  information across all Smile Train partners  and helps synergize best practices. 52  Figure 28 Supporting operations of  Impact India Foundation Figure 29 TCS Created a MIS system for  Mumbai Mobile Crches Impact India Foundation Impact India is a part of an international initiative  against avoidable disablement.  The organisation consulted with TCS for their  Community Health Initiatives. TCS recommended  the development of an MIS to reach their curative  and preventive measures. This system was  subsequently developed by TCS to help track  success against targets and improve traceability and  accountability for the ground staff as well as the  management team.  The system enhanced the Foundations ability to  quantify activities from a perspective of Social Return on Investment (SROI) by accurate articulation of  Inputs, Tangible Outputs, Measurable Outcomes and Socio/Economic Impact. It also enhanced accuracy  in reporting of the programme to Donors, Management and other stakeholders and therefore provide  the visibility of a Single Truth across the programme. The system provides measurement of Disability  Reduction in that geography and a trend analysis across regions within the geography to identify  similarities, changes and developments. It also tracks key performance indicators (KPI) to ensure that  the programme is sustainable and replicable.  Mumbai Mobile Crches Volunteering at TCS- Maitree TCS analyzed the internal tools and the business needs  of Mumbai Mobile Crches and designed an Inventory  Solution to assist them in capturing their monthly  quarter spend per centre as well as the derive cost per  child. TCS also designed a comprehensive Donor  Management system which also included a provision for  tracking repeat donations. The employee engagement arm of TCS was enhanced to  include socially relevant activities. The approach to  social initiatives entails being proactively involved and  working at the grassroot level. The projects undertaken  include aiding underprivileged children across various  schools in India and helping rural communities at  Panvel (Maharashtra), Nainar (Chennai), Padmapur  (Odisha) and Challera (New Delhi). In FY 2011, TCS  associates reached out to 3500 beneficiaries in 5  villages.  TCS associates have developed a sustainable model to  improve education, healthcare and the environment of  these villages. In Panvel, Maharashtra, and Nainer  Chennai, TCS associates were engaged in primary and  secondary school education. Women in Panvel  underwent a paper product certification program by  Jan Sikshan Sansthan (Raigad) which enables them to  procure loans from banks.  Figure 30 Computer Center for children  at Nainar, Tamil Nadu 53  In FY 2011, TCS-Maitrees rural initiative at Nainar,  in Tamil Nadu India, reached more than 140  beneficiaries. Training in screen printing and job  referrals for house-keeping and helped to  increase the womens income from Rs. 600 to  Rs. 1500 Computer Literacy Training and Personality  Development Programmes were conducted at  Padmapur, Odisha and Challera, Delhi. In FY 2011,  TCS reached 240 villagers in Padmapur, Odisha  Figure 31 Primary School Initiative at Wazepur Figure 32 Supporting Social Entrepreneurs  in India India and about 300 villagers in Challera, New Delhi India.

In FY 2011, 10,225 children were  reached by over 6,610 TCS volunteers and families. Client partnerships- TCS-Yale  Morgan Stanley In FY 2011 TCS partnered with its client Morgan  Stanley and Yale School of Management to  promote Social Entrepreneurship. Core  Competencies of TCS, Morgan Stanley and Yale  School of Management were leveraged  effectively to bring about societal transformation  in multiple areas like rural entrepreneurship  development, eco-tourism, sale and marketing of  eco friendly products, womens empowerment, employment generation and micro-financing.  Students from Yale analysed the work being done by various social entrepreneurs in India. To  identify their challenges and obstacles faced by the organization and assisted in developing  potential solutions. As a follow-up measure, TCS volunteers continue to work with the social  entrepreneurs identified.  TCS also organized a School Health Education Programme to educate students on topics such  as health, hygiene and personal care. Health Camps and Awareness programmes such as eye  and dental camps, camps on women health awareness, etc. were also conducted in FY 2011. TCS organized fundraising through walks and other events in support of health related causes  such as Cancer etc. In FY 2011, TCS organised 24 Blood Donation drives. A total of  3,498  associates participated in these camps. Health Initiatives Initiatives in India 54  Figure 33 Creating awareness  for Breast Cancer Initiatives in North America Initiatives in UK & Europe TCS has supported various health-related causes such as the  Walk for Hope which is in support of cancer research and  cure. In FY 2011, TCS in support of the American Diabetes  Association organized the Boston, New York and Chicago  marathons. 33 TCS marathon runners raised about $14,000  for the organization. TCS associates also participated in the  Heart Walk for American Heart Association, the March of  Dimes in support of healthy mothers and healthy babies  and Making Strides against Breast Cancer. TCS volunteers have supported the Salvation Army by  organizing food and clothes drives at their local community  centers. In addition, TCS associates also volunteer at old age  and nursing homes. In FY 2011, 10% of TCS associates in  North America participated in various community  engagement initiatives. From April 2010 to January 2011, a match funding scheme  was initiated in UK and Europe through which a total of  66k was donated to charities. TCS raises funds through  marathons and fun runs, cricket tournaments as well as  through donations and general volunteering. In October 2010, TCS Europe initiated fundraising and  awareness activities for Multiple Sclerosis and Breast Cancer.  Today is a Good Day, TCS flagship health programme was  formally launched on 3rd March 2010, which is also the  Founders Day for Tata group. The initiative was launched in  UK and in FY 2011  12 walks were organized to promote  healthy lifestyles. TCS also conducted employee fundraising  for the Institute of Cancer Research, Leukemia and  Lymphoma Research, Myeloma UK, Macmillan Cancer  Support and Anthony Nolan bone marrow donation. The  programme has also supported local hospitals and  hospices. In FY 2011, a bone marrow donation registration awareness  event was conducted at TCS London offices which resulted  Figure 34 CEO Mr. N. Chandrasekaran at the  Chicago Marathon Figure 35 Associates supporting  the British Heart Foundation in 19 potential life saving donors. The charity with support from TCS is also working to prevent late  diagnosis of cancer and aims at saving 27,000 lives each year in UK through awareness of the disease.  Through its TIAGD programme, TCS encouraged 10 major Tata Steel sites in UK to have Macmillan  information units for a day. TCS offices in UK held cancer awareness days in association with Macmillan  Cancer Support.  Community Health Initiatives in UK have focused on Cancer as a major health concern.  Oganisations  such as the British and Irish Heart Foundations, National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children,  Leonard Cheshire Disability for people with learning and physical disabilities, Air Ambulance, Royal  British Legion have also been supported. 55  Initiatives in Asia Pacific and Australia In FY 2011, in support of Operation Smile, a charity  auction was held to help cleft lip and palate children.  RMB 26,000 raised through the auction helped 8  children undergo the surgery. TCS China also  organised a volunteer initiative at the Operation  Smile Hospital in Hangzhou. TCS involvement with  Operation Smile included collection of patient  information and undertaking supportive roles in the  operation, and during recovery. In FY 2011, TCS was  able to help 63 patients undergo surgery and 200  patients (aged 4-35) to receive free diagnosis and  medical advice.  Figure 36 Associates donating blood for  the Red Cross at Singapore In FY 2011, several blood donation drives were organized in China. Associates also donated  clothes and radio cassette recorders to orphans at the Zhejiang Disabled Hospital. In Australia, TCS associates participated in a charity run on the 11th of February 2011 in support  of the Friedreich Ataxia Research Foundation.  TCS associates in Africa supported Breast Cancer Month by making donations to Reach for  Recovery. TCS is working closely with Dream Fields Project which brings sustainable soccer  fields and equipment for youth in disadvantaged communities in Africa. TCS also works with  Reach a Dream Foundation to help terminally ill children between the ages of 3-11 realise their  dreams. In South Africa, TCS has worked with the Cecilia Rivandeneira Foundation and since August  2010 has been working to develop the Volunteer Programme at the public Hospital Baca Ortiz  where volunteers work with children suffering from cancer. 25-30 volunteers participate in each  visit to the hospital. TCS also works with the Ecuador Red Cross on their Blood Donation Programme which takes  place every six months. This semi-annual Campaign promotes solidarity by popularizing the  message of Donate Blood, Save a Life. During the last campaign held on October 2010, TCS  donated 11 bags of blood. In FY 2011, TCS reached out to 65 institutions in China, Ecuador, India, South Africa and UK.  Programmes initiated by TCS reached 10,225 children globally through the efforts of over 6,610  TCS associates and families. Initiatives in Middle East and Africa Education & Skill Development Initiatives in India TCS has a long running programme to create an  interest in Information Technology among high  school students and to encourage them to  choose a career in IT. TCS IT Wiz, now in its 10th  edition, has become the benchmark in school  quizzing. This annual event reaches out to over 2  lakh school students from 5,000 schools across  12 cities in India. In FY 2011, the quiz was held  over 12 regional rounds with the grand finale in  Chennai in December 2010.  Figure 37 Participants at TCS Wiz 56  Since 2000, TCS has also partnered with the Department of  IT- Government of Karnataka, to conduct the Rural IT Quiz.  This event has been conducted annually for 2 years and has  attracted 14 lakh students. TCS set up the Advanced Computer Training Centre for  training the visually impaired. The training centre offers IT- enabled vocational courses that are in sync with the  industry requirements.  The objective of the programme was to create a platform  for imparting computer training and personality  development training to enhance employability for the  visually impaired individuals. The programme also seeks to  create suitable opportunities for these individuals within  TCS and other organizations. Till March 2011, 77 visually  impaired individuals were trained through this initiative. TCS participated in the International Daisy Conference held  at New Delhi. This conference focused on capacity building  in developing countries to allow information to be  accessible to all people including those with disabilities. TCS  presented the Advanced Computer Training Centre for  Visually Impaired and TCS Exegenix Technology, developed  for visually impaired individuals.  Figure 38 Winners of TCS Wiz 2010-2011 Figure  Advanced Computer Training  Center for the visually impaired The Advanced Computer Training Centre was also presented by TCS at the ILP Global Business and  Disability Network Meeting held at Bangalore in FY 2011. TCS also seeks to address the IT Skills Gap in school students through its programme goIT. Students  engage in workshops within the school. TCS Seven Hills Park campus in Ohio hosted a summer  robotics camp in which 12 local schools, 65 students and 125 parents were involved. The programme  has grown from 2-12 schools in two years.  As a consequence of the programme, two school districts have restructured their technology  education programme, adding teachers and resources to increase technical education in their schools.  70% of the programme participants indicated an increased interest in pursuing science and  technology after completing their high school education. The programme received the 2010 Investing  in People Awards by the Workforce One Investment Board of Southwest Ohio. For the past 3 years, TCS has been working with the Department of Education in the UK and the British  Council to support 300 Global Fellows and has hosted them in India and China. The purpose of the  Initiatives in North America Initiatives in UK & Europe UK Global Fellowship programme is to encourage a global understanding and  to understand a corporate organization as it functions  globally. The fellows also serve as ambassadors to 3,000  UK secondary schools.  TCS has established a partnership of schools between  India and UK to encourage cross country correspondence  between students and a teacher's exchange programme  funded in part by TCS. In FY 2011, nine schools in India  were identified to be a part of the initiative. Global Schools Partnership Figure 40 Children interacting with teachers from India through the Global School  Partnerships 57  Local School Partnership TCS established a partnership with a school in Tower Hamlets, London which specializes in  Science, Computing and Math, with the intention of enhancing knowledge of the IT  Industry. The programme provides a series of full day workshops to teach soft skills  in  addition to giving students an understanding of the IT industry, its roles and jobs. The  programme has reached out to 180 students till date. TCS also provides work placements  every year.  Wings of Hope TCS partners with the Young Enterprise with a  Social Conscience scheme that helps UK students  to develop business skills and gain an  understanding of the education in India and  Malawi. In FY 2011, 1,400 students from schools  across UK participated in the programme. TCS  provides a structured placement initiative named  Mission You. Students who participate in this  Figure 41 Associates supporting  "Wings of Hope" at the London 10k initiative develop a strategy plan that would be beneficial for TCS to adopt by 2020. These  ideas are then presented to TCS directors who make decisions on the work placements for  these students.  TCS associates in Belgium collaborated with 6 other companies to develop Discover Your  Talent. This programme focuses on creating employability for immigrant children. The  initiative was recognized and appreciated by Business and Society, a member organization  that unites companies from various sectors with a common interest in Corporate Social  Responsibility. Under their social inclusion programme, TCS has provided 6 scholarships to students in 3  Australian Universities. TCS sponsored the 3 year IT course that all 6  students were enrolled in.  In FY 2011, TCS made donations in excess of USD 500,000 to a variety of organizations such as  America Cancer Society, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Habitat for Humanity, Juvenile  Diabetes Research Foundation, March of Dimes, Toys R Us Childrens Fund and the National  Underground Railroad Freedom Centre. In addition, Stg 200,000 was donated to various  charities with the primary focus being on influencing a change in the Marketplace, Workplace  and Environment. TCS also supported more than 200 charities in UK associated with health  and education,  several of which were related to the Millennium Development Goals such as  the Loomba Foundation, UNICEF, Railway Children and the Simon Community. In South Africa, TCS associates are regular visitors to the Jordan House-Home for the Aged and  in FY 2011 donated reusable goods in addition to money for the benefit of the senior citizens. In FY 2011, 1,028 associates volunteered 3,602 hours to engage in 246 community benefitting  activities.  In February 2010, Chile experienced a massive earthquake measuring 8.8 on the Richter  scale. TCS quickly responded to the needs of the families affected by the earthquake by  organizing a donation of desalination plants and water purifying filters. TCS donated and  implemented5 Desalination Plants and 2,000 Filters cum Water Purifiers, making an  investment of USD 1 million. Initiatives in Middle East and Africa Reaching where it matters 58  The plants were put up in the Southern Region of Chile to  reduce the incidence of water shortage experienced by the  coastline and rural sectors. In July 2010, the first  Desalination Plant was inaugurated for use. Four other  plants were ready for use by the end of 2010. TCS associates in Switzerland worked with a TCS client Swiss  Re to collect funds for the Haiti Earthquake Relief. A  collection drive was also initiated by TCS associates in  Australia to assist the victim of the Queensland floods. TCS  contributed AUD 30,000 towards the Queensland Flood  Disaster Fund.  Figure 42 TCS donated Swatch water  filters at Chile CASE STUDIES TCS BPO Employability Programme India produces 3.2 million graduates each year. However the unemployment rate among Indias  graduates is around 17.2% (Govt. of India 2005). TCS visualized that the problem of graduate  unemployment can be resolved by increasing employability of rural graduates. Initial visits made to rural colleges in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu indicated that a large percentage of  students from these areas do not have access to high quality education or skills training that are  essential in a competitive corporate environment like TCS.  In 2010-2011, TCS targeted underprivileged rural youth and individuals from marginalized sections of  the society in the Indian states of West Bengal, Odisha, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu for  providing free training in English Communication, Corporate Etiquette and Basic Computer Skills. TCS has trained over 3600 graduates out of which 375 have received conditional offers of employment  from TCS BPO. At present, 250 of the trained candidates are working at entry level jobs in the TCS BPO  at Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Baroda. The initiative facilitated the training and subsequent  employment of Rita Toto, the first woman to graduate amongst the Totos- a tribe designated by the  Government of India as a particularly vulnerable tribal group.  The programme offers 100 hours of free training to improve the English Communication skills,  Computer skills and Corporate etiquette. At the end of the training, the candidates are put through the  regular recruitment process. Figure 43 Enhancing employability of Rural Youth in India 59  TCS-Maitree Initiatives  Manikandan - A student helped by TCS Volunteers for 4 years TCS Maitree has been rendering community support for Nainar Rural Development  Initiative in Chennai, India since September 2007. Based on the community request we  started daily tutoring classes for 50 school children.  25 volunteers visit the community every weekend to provide training in school subjects like  English, Mathematics and Science. To ensure interest in learning, a trained teacher from the  same community was also appointed.  70% who were trained under our supervision passed their Board exams. Before the weekly  coaching classes by TCS Volunteers a majority of the students lacked basic mathematical  knowledge. The sustained effort of our volunteers resulted in increasing the percentage of  students that passed the exam.  This year, with the help of TCS volunteers I was able to score 90% in my 10th grade  examinations. My family was very happy with meI want to become an engineer, join TCS and  help other children like me  Figure 44 Providing support to a village in Nainar, Tamil Nadu 16 year old   passed his 12th grade examinations in April. He regularly attended  special coaching from TCS Maitree Volunteers who helped him with various school subjects.  Subhashs hard work and will to succeed in becoming an Engineer was evident. In addition  to coaching him in school subjects, TCS volunteers helped him gain confidence in his  abilities. Subhash fared well in his examinations and through the support of TCS  Management secured a place at Vel-Tech Arts College, Avadi and is currently pursuing his  Bachelors in Science.   from TCS Delhi comes from the same school where TCS extended its help  through volunteer intervention to improve the quality of education. In his times, things  were difficult and he had to fight to achieve success. Mr. Singh is now an employee at TCS  and his heart is filled with pride each time he volunteers to teach underprivileged students.  He says, that he experienced a moment of pride when after years of sustained effort two of  his students qualified the entrance exam for a professional course in fashion designing  Subhash Mr. Harendra Singh 60  Figure 45 Students attending classes at  TCS Maitree School Initiative, Delhi 61  Environmental Impact  Environmental  Impact Being an IT consulting firm, TCS does not consume non-renewable resources nor generate  process wastes and emissions on the same scale as many traditional industries. On the other  hand, the use of Information Technology has helped significantly reduce transmission and  distribution losses, leading to a more efficient and smarter use of the electricity generated  and thus reduce the global emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). TCS thus views the  growing cognizance of the risks of climate change not only as an opportunity to use our  consulting services and green IT methodologies for a greater good, but also as a source  of revenues. TCS is committed to measure, report and continually improve its overall environmental  performance by optimizing its resource consumption, minimizing its ecological impact and  in line with the precautionary principle espoused by Article 15 of the Rio Declaration,  working to reduce its carbon footprint.  17 We have an Environment Policy that guides key activities designed to minimize our    ecological footprint and mitigate the impact of our operations. The pillars of the Policy are: n Leadership, going beyond mere compliance n Climate change mitigation through commitment to reduce GHG emissions and  corresponding carbon footprint n Green Procurement n Reduce, Reuse, Recycle n Resource Efficiency n Green Infrastructure – Green Buildings n Green IT All TCS sites are compliant to all relevant environmental laws, acts, rules and guidelines. No  instances of non-compliance to environmental laws and regulations were brought to our  notice in FY 2011. At TCS, the environmental initiatives are seen as a part of the overall operational  improvement and the expenditure is not tracked separately. Running expenses incurred –  such as, monitoring and measurement costs, investment in energy efficiency projects, fees  paid to the state and central pollution control boards for consents/NOCs, etc. – are met  through operational budgets. Further, green infrastructure changes like setting up of  Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) or incremental cost incurred for green building projects are  counted under the capital expense budget. However, going forward, we intend to start  capturing all relevant environmental expenditure through our existing Management  Information System.  64 17 http://www.tcs.com/about/corp_responsibility/environmental/Pages/default.aspx  18  19 Environmental Performance Objective Target Achieved Reduce Electricity Consumption  (kWh/FTE/month)  2% 7.75% Reduce Water Consumption (liters/FTE/month)  2% 11.85% Reduce Paper Consumption (Reams/1000 FTE/month)  10% 17.40% 20 Increase Recycling of Sewage water (as % of total water consumed) 10% 8.36% Increase solar water capacity (litres/day)  10% 99% 21 Reduce waste generated (Kg/FTE/annum)  5% -35.61% Amount of compost generated (Kg/month)  10% 57.81% Reduce Carbon footprint (tonnes CO2/FTE/annum)  5% 6.77% Increase Rainwater Harvesting Potential (Cum)  10% 10.43% Environmental Targets and Performance Our FY 2011 environmental performance against targets is given below: Going forward, we are doing away with year on year targets in key areas and setting ambitious  longer-term targets against which we will report annual progress.

Backup support – during power outages – is through diesel generator (DG)  sets maintained at each location. In addition, some TCS facilities procured green power,  from sources like hydroelectric power and wind power farms. A source-wise breakup of the  365,056 MWh (1,237,498 GJ) of electricity consumed by TCS in FY 2011 is given in Figure 46. Figure 46 Electricity Consumption by Source (%) 2% 7% 91% Electricity from Green Source  Electricity from Grid Electricity from DG TCS strives to manage its energy footprint through a series of initiatives including  infrastructure to operational changes, the highlights of which are summarized below. Area Action Green office infrastructure TCS views green infrastructure as a key tool in  the drive to reduce energy footprint, material  footprint and carbon footprint. All new offices  coming up are designed as per LEED Green  Buildings - Gold rating. TCS already has 3 LEED  Certified Green Buildings; at Chennai (Siruseri  – Gold Rated), Bhubaneswar (Kalinga Park –  Platinum Rated) and Trivandrum (Peepul Park –  Silver Rated). A few more are under review for  the certification. Some key features of the TCS green buildings  include use of solar photovoltaic panels and  chiller waste heat recovery units. Other initiatives include setting up of solar  water heaters for generating hot water. In FY  2011, TCS increased its solar heater capacity by  99% over 2009-10, helping reduce the energy  used in heating water for use in kitchens,  gymnasiums and washrooms. 66  Green internal IT TCS has undertaken a series of initiatives to reduce the energy footprint of our data centres and computer workstations, such as server virtualization and consolidation, server cooling load management, shift to blade server, procurement of energy-star rated equipment, remote desktop control, etc. Pilot desktop virtualization projects are underway to help reduce the energy consumption further by consolidating individual CPU loads on a single server for load optimization. Energy audits TCS has taken up the internal energy audit projects at various locations to identify potential energy efficiency projects to come up with all possible innovations and ideas to improve the energy performance of the older buildings.  Operational energy efficiency Operational controls that have been put in place include: n Switching on the AC half-an-hour late every  morning and turning it off half-an-hour earlier in  the evening n Regulating temperature in a close band (24+1o C) n Replacing tube-lights with CFL luminaries and LED  for common areas n Installing Variable Frequency Drive in air handling  units n Capacitor Bank Power Factor Management n Putting solar PV based peripheral light system n Minimizing use of halogen and other energy  intensive lighting n Switching off of monitors when not in use through  central programming n Employee Engagement through awareness drives  and putting up posters etc. 67 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 Solar Water heater capacity (litres/day) 75,700 38,100 21,500 13,900 2007-2008 2008-2009 2009-2010 2010-2011 Figure 47 Solar Water Heater Capacity (ltr/day)  All these initiatives have helped TCS reduce its energy consumption by 7.75% over FY 2010  and 22.80% over baseline year FY 2008. Lastly, total fuel consumption by company owned vehicles in FY 2011 was 112,123 liters of  Petrol and 177, 625 liters of Diesel. The total direct energy consumption by primary energy  sources is 310,324 GJ (from fuel consumption in owned vehicles, diesel consumption in  Diesel Generators, LPG combustion in canteen kitchens). Fresh water consumed at TCS comes from municipality supply, borewells, tanker supply and  a small fraction of packaged drinking water procured at some sites. A source-wise breakup  of the 1.6 million kL of water consumed in FY 2011 is shown in Figure . Other than the  groundwater aquifers that the on-premise borewells and tankers tap into, no other water  sources are impacted. Water Performance Bottle 1% Municipal 49% Tanker 27% Borewell 23% Figure 49 Freshwater consumption by source Some of the steps taken to reduce fresh water consumption at TCS include: n Dual flushing system in toilets n Taps with variable output and sensors n Drip irrigation system n Throttling of valves  n Regular maintenance of water pumps n Sewage treatment plants where feasible; recycled water for A/C cooling tower make-up,  flushing and gardening  n Employee engagement and education through awareness drives  As an outcome, per capita water consumption decreased YoY by 11.85% in FY 2011.  See Figure 50. 68  Sewage Treatment and Reuse Many TCS facilities have sewage treatment plants (STP). The treated effluent from the STP is tested  regularly against various national and state effluent standards and recycled for use in HVAC System  cooling tower, washroom flushing and gardening. The recycled treated sewage quantity has  increased from 268,901 kL to 306,652 kL, an increase of 8.36% (Figure 51). The percentage of the total sewage recycled to the total water consumption has increased from 17.3%  in FY 2010 to 18.80% in FY 2011. All new TCS facilities have Sewage Treatment Plants and do 100%  22 recycling of the treated effluent . Many TCS owned campuses have rainwater harvesting systems which collect the rain water during the  monsoons, stored in storage tanks and used for groundwater recharging (through recharging pits),  borewell recharging or for creating artificial lakes within campus. There has been 10.43% increase in  the rainwater harvesting potential at TCS sites in FY 2011 over the prior year (Figure 52).

Printer cartridge consumption  remained unchanged YoY, at 6 cartridges/per 1000 FTE/mth. Figure 53  Paper consumption in reams per 1000 FTEs/mth Figure 54  Cartridge consumption per 1000 FTEs per month Emissions and Waste Management GHG Emissions (Carbon Footprint) Being an IT services and consulting organization, there are no significant primary emissions or  process wastes. In this section, we discuss the various emissions and wastes generated by our  operations and the steps taken to mitigate their impact. The sources of GHG emissions contributing to TCSs carbon footprint are: n Scope 1: Diesel-run Generator sets, Company-owned vehicles, Refrigerant gas (fugitive)  emissions and LPG combustion n Scope 2: Purchased Electricity n Scope 3: Business Air Travel 23 It is estimated  that our combined (Scope 1 + Scope 2 +Scope 3 business air travel) Carbon  emissions in FY 2011 was 3.01 tCO2/FTE/yr. Scope-wise breakup of our emissions is given in  Figure 55. 23 Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions have been calculated using the emissions factors published by the Green House Gas protocol. For Scope 2 emissions i.e.  purchased electricity related carbon emissions, the source is the emissions factor published by the CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector, User  Guide, Version 6.0, March 2011 published by Central Electricity Authority of India. Scope 1 0.261, 9% Scope 3 0.565, 19% Scope 2 2.184, 72% Figure 55 Breakup of Carbon footprint by scope (actual emissions in tCO2/FTE/yr and % of total) 70 0 50 100 250 2007-2008 2008-2009 2009-2010 2010-2011 72 150 200 87 231 133 0 2 6 8 10 12 4 2007-2008 2008-2009 2009-2010 2010-2011 10 9 6 6  In the year FY 2011, TCS reduced the overall per capita carbon footprint (tonnes CO2e per FTE  per annum) by 6.78% over the prior year and by 37.91% over the baseline year 2007-08 (Figure 56). Figure 56 Steadily reducing Carbon footprint (tCO2/FTE/yr) Also the per capita carbon footprint due to electricity consumption (DG + Purchased electricity) has  reduced as shown in the exhibit below (Figure 57). This reduction in the energy carbon footprint is a  result of multiple initiatives including procurement of biomass based green power, procurement of  low emissions natural gas based power and various energy efficiency initiatives. Figure 57 Carbon footprint in tCO2/FTE/yr due to energy consumption (Scope 1 & 2) Scope 3 emissions, due company-hired vehicles, have increased from 0.004 tCO2e/FTE/yr in 2010-11 to  0.105 tCO2e/FTE/yr due to increased scope of reporting to include company-hired buses used for  employee commuting. This figure is not included in the above figures and performances to maintain  year-on-year data comparability. TCS continues to control its business air travel to the extent possible  by promoting greater use of audio and video conferencing infrastructure. Refrigerants used in the HVAC systems have an Ozone Depleting Potential, eg. R22. All the ozone  depleting refrigerant gases as per the Montreal Protocol will be phased out and replaced with ODP  free refrigerants. The new facilities coming up at TCS have HVAC systems based on non-ozone  depleting refrigerants. The Ozone Depleting Potential of the total refrigerant emissions is 0.29 tonnes  in FY 2011. Emissions from the diesel generator sets, used during power outages, are as below: Ozone Depleting Substances   Other Emissions Emissions Quantity (tonnes) SOx 4.26 NOx 522.70 71 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 2007-2008 2008-2009 2009-2010 2010-2011 4.85 3.76 3.23 3.01 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 2007-2008 2008-2009 2009-2010 2010-2011 3.656 3.176 2.479 2.342  Waste Management Due to the nature of our business, waste generation is fairly limited. There are dry wastes, wet  wastes, e-wastes and a small quantity of hazardous waste. Our Waste Management practices  seek to reduce the environmental impact of even this limited waste to the extent possible. The wet and dry waste generated by the canteens at various TCS facilities went up even on a  per-capita basis in FY 2011, but we believe much of this is due to ongoing improvements in  data capture and reporting practices. Biodegradable waste The first step to any waste management practice is waste segregation at source. The hierarchy  for disposal of biodegradable waste is biogas recovery through bio-digesters (methane  avoidance) followed by vermicomposting, disposal as fodder to piggeries and, as a last resort,  to the municipal garbage collection system where no other options are feasible.  TCS has two bio-digesters, one at Mangaladas (Pune) and the other at Yantra Park, Mumbai.  The methane generated from the bio-digesters is used as fuel in the Canteen Kitchen. More  bio-digesters and organic waste composters will be installed at various locations in 2011-12.  Our vermicomposting initiative is progressing well. 16 of our centers carry out composting,  either in campus or at an external facility. Compost generated per month in FY 2011 went up  by 60% YoY. Paper Recycling Initiative  Instead of going into landfills, paper waste is shredded and sent for recycling. In some  cases, they are sent to NGOs which purchase the waste paper for a nominal amount and  supply notepads made of recycled paper to TCS.  In FY 2011, the recycling initiative progressed further. The number of TCS facilities recycling  shredded paper waste went up to 52 (FY 2010: 32). 78% of the total paper waste was sent  for recycling in FY 2011 (66% in FY 2010). 72 Figure 58 Waste Generated (Kg/FTE/yr) 2007-2008 2008-2009 2009-2010 2010-2011 0 5 10 15 20 25 8.0 14.0 14.7 19.9 Figure 58 Waste Generated (Kg/FTE/yr) 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 3,500 2007-2008 2008-2009 2009-2010 2010-2011 478 1,290 2,066 3,260 Figure 59 Compost generated (kg/month)  E-waste Management Hazardous Waste Management The e-waste generated at the various TCS facilities include defunct computers, monitors, servers and  allied hardware. Management of e-waste is as per TCS E-waste Management policy which complies  with the WEEE directive and the Government of Indias draft e-Waste Rules 2010.  In FY 2011, 5,733 pieces of equipment from all centers, amounting to 100% of e-waste generated, were  disposed of through authorized handlers / recyclers. In addition, computers which were deemed  obsolete for TCSs purposes but are in full working condition, are donated to charitable institutions  which often lack such equipment. Recipients of such donations are advised to return the hardware to  TCS once it reaches end-of-life, for proper disposal. 24 Hazardous wastes  are disposed of as per the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) Hazardous  Waste Handling and Management Rules, through MoEF-authorized vendors only. This is overseen in  some states by the local pollution control boards. Hazardous Wastes FY 2011 FY 2010 Lube oil from DG sets (litres) 18,723  12,563  Used batteries from UPS sets (nos.) 6,711 nos. 5,182 nos Additionally, all the used printer cartridges and photocopier toner bottles are sent back to the  manufacturer under product take back arrangement. TCS facilities are located in urban centers, with no proximity to protected areas. A few of our facilities  have a relatively higher biodiversity value and TCS has various initiatives for preserving and enhancing  the flora and fauna in those ecosystems. Taxonomically, the flora present in select TCS campuses are of  221 plant species belonging to 135 genera and 106 families. The diversified flora supports a variety of  25 fauna. There are 123 animal species identified, including birds, butterflies, mammals and amphibians . The following biodiversity programs have been implemented at some of the TCS campuses. Biodiversity Protection 24 There were no reported spills of hazardous wastes in FY 2011. Zero percent of our wastes are shipped internationally and none are deemed hazardous  under the terms of the Basel Convention Annex I, II, III, and VIII.  25 None in the IUCN Red List or national conservation list.

World environment week, 1st – 7th June 2010  - It was held across all TCS locations with various  activities including competitions, quizzes, site level activities like painting competition to  increase awareness on environmental issues. Awareness mailers were circulated on various  themes under resource conservation with various activities planned around these themes.  Wildlife Week observed in TCS in October, 2010 saw participation from the employees  showcasing the interest the TCS associates have for such issues. The event saw a series of  mailers being sent to the associates on Biodiversity & Wildlife. Also, competitions like  photography competition, quiz and an interesting treasure hunt was conducted to add an  element of intellectual inquisitiveness to the event. Earth Hour Championship – 26th March 2011 - TCS observed the Earth hour by switching  of all non-critical lights during the earth hour on 26th March 2011. To encourage participation  by various location an inter branch competition was organized on maximum savings achieved  during the hour and the winners were recognized. The campaign was well received by  the associates who appreciated the organizations intent to spread the Save Power  message across. Among the various marine communities, the Marine Turtles act as flagship species owing to  their vital role in maintaining the health of the worlds oceans. Climatic change is pushing these  sea turtles towards extinction throughout the globe. The major causes of the worldwide  decline in the number of sea turtles also include nest predation, collection of eggs by human  beings and killing of adult turtles on nesting beaches.  The loss of nesting habitat can have  disastrous consequences on the marine turtle population.  A total of seven species of marine  Environment Awareness Campaigns Marine Turtle Conservation Program @ Velas, Maharashtra - November 2010 – May 2011 Figure 60 A view of the turtle nesting beach Figure 61 Provision of hatchery for eggs 74  turtles have been recorded throughout the world,  out of which the Olive Ridley Turtle  (Lepidochelysolivacea) breeds along the coastal  region of Maharashtra. It is included as an  endangered species in the IUCN Red Data Book.  Protection of breeding beaches is an important step  towards conservation of the marine turtle  population. In order to protect the breeding sites or  beaches, the TCS-Health Safety and Environment  had orga ized the Marine Turtle Conservation  Program on a participatory basis, with the leading  NGO, Sahyadri Nisraga Mitra, at Velas, Maharashtra.  The project involved sponsoring of expenditure for  hatcheries for protection of eggs, provisioning  protection watchers for patrolling the 6 km beach to  prevent hunting or killing of turtles, while the turtles  lay eggs and ensuring successful release of turtle  hatchlings into their natural habitat, leading to  protection of their population. A total of 23 nests  were protected in the hatcheries, 2,737 eggs were  successfully translocated and 1,305 hatchlings were  successfully released into their natural habitat,  during the breeding period, from November 2010 to  May 2011.   In order to create awareness about turtle  n conservation, the Turtle Festival 2011 was arranged  at Velas, during which turtle hatchlings were  released into the sea during the morning and  evening times in presence of tourists.  A total of 120 associates participated in the Turtle  Festival in which, various programs such as film  show on turtles, nature track and expert talks were  arranged. Thus, TCS has significantly contributed in the  conservation of wildlife, that is, the endangered  species of the marine turtles (Olive Ridley  Lepidochelysolivacea) and has helped in preventing  the depletion of the marine turtle population. TCS  has also created awareness among its employees by  participating in the Turtle festival.  Biodiversity enhancement project at the Kalinga  Park campus in Bhubaneswar, India has helped turn  the barren land around the campus to lush green  landscapes. TCS is focused on enhancing biodiversity  within and outside our campuses where possible.
