We have been proud signatories to this international voluntary initiative since November  2003. In 2007 Kjaer Group A/S further confirmed our support for a cleaner environment by joining  UNs environmental initiative, Caring for the Climate.  The UN Global Compact establishes an important framework for the activities of Kjaer Group A/S and  it is incorporated into the companys governance framework: The Kjaer Group Way of Management  (KWOM).   In 2009, Kjaer Group A/S started facilitating the communication and interpretation of KWOM  including the implementation of key policies and processes. This has resulted in a systematic  approach and structure, which allows us to follow up on, improve and appreciate the achieved  success.   An example is the focus on implementing our Global Risk Management, Remuneration and HSE  policies, which have given us insight and direction on how to improve our business in a sustainable  way. Though we have not reached our overall targets yet, we are confident that if we carry on aiming  at the target set in 2009, we will continue the growth of our business in a responsible manner,  balancing the financial results with social and environmental responsibilities.   We are optimistic about the opportunities for our business and the positive effects our approach will  continue to have on peoples lives in the developing countries we are operating in. We strongly  believe that the systematic approach we are practicing through KWOM will contribute to the  development of international high standards in these emerging economies in the area of social  obligations and environmental challenges.   Thus, on behalf of Kjaer Groups 250 employees, I reaffirm our commitment to compliance with the  10 Principles of the Global Compact. I hope you will find this Communication on Progress informative  and I invite you to view the Kjaer Group website www.kjaergroup.com and our Annual Report 2010.     Per S.
