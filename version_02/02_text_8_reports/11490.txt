Enduring Offerings reflects our Companys approach to sustainability issues that have relevance to our operations and have significant economic, environmental and social impact.  The report covers performance of each of the Companys Divisions and functions but excludes performance of its subsidiaries and Joint Venture companies. This report is an in-house effort. The reporting data relate to the major operational streams of IndianOil, primarily carried out through its Divisions, viz. Refineries, Pipelines, Marketing and R&D. We have also suitably covered an account of the continuing progress beyond our core business and along the expanded areas of operations, viz. Petrochemicals, Exploration & Production (E&P) and Gas Marketing. The reporting data is based on the recordable database of the activities carried out in the various operational areas. However, readers are requested to keep in mind that we have significant operations at different consumer locations known as direct customers (viz. Government agencies, private industry locations) where we do not have much control; hence data pertaining to consumer locations has not been dealt with in this report. This report also aims to properly reflect the implications, risks and challenges inherent in each of the Companys business lines. In drafting this report, IndianOil identified and selected the material aspects of its activities, within the broad scope of corporate responsibility. The Company expanded upon the approach to each issue in accordance with the various channels for dialogue, stipulations, and advices available from our majority stakeholders from time to time. The Government of India owns 78.92% of IndianOil shares and the Board of Directors of the Company discharges its responsibilities through the devolution of powers under several provisions of empowerment conferred upon them from time to time. The Government of India in turn, besides issuing administrative and functional directives, has in place several policy decisions which impact the business operations relating to socio-economic and environmental aspects of the Company. These issues have been duly considered while addressing the materiality of the report. The completeness principle requires that the assurance process evaluate the extent to which the reporting organisation can identif y and understand its sustainability performance associated with activities, products and services, for which it has management and legal responsibility. This report aims to properly reflect the implications, risks and challenges inherent in each of the Companys business lines.

As a corporate entity that is consistently adding shareholder value, as an organisation that is committed to the society and as an employer that celebrates a truly unique work ethic, IndianOil has always been focused on sustainable development. This commitment permeates the entire organisation. When we sign a MoU with the Government of India committing on performance and operating parameters, we have CSR and Sustainable Development as major operational parameters. At the grassroots level, our focus has always been on ensuring that the communities who we share our lives with can aspire for a better tomorrow. Our primary concern is still energy security and how we can translate investments in energy into affordable products for our fellow citizens. We are aware that as India develops, the energy needs of the future will increase and to meet this future demand, we need to act today. We need to increasingly boost investments and step up our efforts in the international marketplace witnessing intense global competition for acquiring precious energy assets. IndianOil has been a pioneer in launching green auto fuels, energy efficiency, low emission lubricants, alternative energy options, rural retail outlets, etc. Our next step is on boosting our exploration forays in India and abroad. Clearly sustainable development is about the future, and the choices we make today and the decisions that it would lead to, impact the next generation. And increasingly, the younger generation is even more aware of this need. Today, young professionals believe that business should benefit both the individual and the broader society. While they want opportunities to grow, they also want their work to be meaningful and productive to society. Nothing is more rewarding than knowing that what you do for a living positively affects the lives of those within your community, the country, or even the world. This edition of the Corporate Sustainability Report has been compiled as per the guidelines of GRI-G3. It is only a modest effort to express our abiding commitment to build a sustainable and secure India that grows inclusively while at the same time, ensuring uninterrupted supply of fuel for its citizens at affordable prices. A word from our Chairman B.M. Bansal Chairman & Director (Planning & Business Development)  4 Sustainability Report 2009-10  5 Sustainability Report 2009-10 Key Impacts, Risks & Opportunities Sr. No. Issue 1. Product pricing Selling of those petroleum products at a price fixed by the Government below the desired level leading to impact on profitability as well as uncertainties in revenue stream. 2. Challenges in inbound supply chain - uninterrupted supply of crude oil Over 75% of crude oil requirement of the country is met through imports.  Geo-political events across the world could lead to disruption in supplies. 3. Challenges in outbound supply chain â€“ reaching products in far flung areas and  formidable terrain Preparedness for disruption of  transportation links, damage pipelines, etc. thereby challenging our ability to ensure oil supplies across the length and breadth of the country 4. Environmental imperatives Future regulatory regimes imposing restrictions on carbon emission, water consumption and waste management, Renewable Energy Purchase Obligation (RPO) etc. 5. Enhance operational efficiencies Future business strategies would require adopting a low carbon path with growing awareness and concern amongst civil societies.  Products & services would need to be based on optimum utilization of natural resources to remain competitive. 6. Sustainable offerings through innovative R&D solutions Organisations would have to adopt sustainable business practices to receive patronage from customers, financial and other institutions. 7. Meeting rural aspirations Inclusive growth efforts to reduce income inequities. IndianOil  Initiatives Constant engagement with the Government of India to put in place a mechanism to compensate Oil Marketing Companies for selling products at subsidised rates administered by the Government  Diversify procurement sources; add new varieties of crude and enhance processing capabilities.  Opportunity 1.  Secure E&P assets overseas 2.  Participating in the domestic efforts for E&P. IndianOil has put in place an extensive programme for pre-monsoon and pre-winter stocking of petroleum products to ensure sustained supplies of petroleum products to areas that experience isolation through disruptions in transportation links.  This is supplemented through emergency measures, including air lifting of POL products to affected areas. IndianOil has created a distinct organisational set-up to address these issues. Renewable Energy & Sustainable Development group with its nodal offices in each Division is deeply committed to take effective pre-emptive actions on issues like carbon emission reduction, water and waste management and develop a road map through policy intervention for a sustainable business solution. It also envisages participating in emerging opportunities in the Renewable Energy space and use it as an abatement opportunity.  Efficient use of energy and energy conservation has been a primary area of focus at IndianOil refineries. The energy Index in terms of MBN has been reduced to 62 from 64 in the previous year, and against an Industry performance of 69.  Water conservation is another area that has been receiving considerable attention in IndianOil refineries. About 77% of treated effluents were reused in refineries during 2009-10.  108 rain-water harvesting facilities areas installed across IndianOils various Divisions to re-charge aquifers.  Responsible management and disposal of wastes is another area that receives focussed attention. Oily wastes are bio- remediated or sold for reprocessing to agencies approved by State Pollution Control Boards. Spent catalysts and used batteries, etc. are also responsibly disposed. R&D efforts on alternate energy sources, environment friendly products and services have been stepped up with research work on bio-fuel, bio-remediation of wastes, nano-technology etc. IndianOils initiative on setting up rural format Retail Outlets, Kisan Seva Kendras (KSKs) are fuelling the  growth story in rural India.  6 Sustainability Report 2009-10 IndianOil: Over five decades in the service of the Nation IndianOil is a key player in the Indian energy sector, a Maharatna, meeting 47% of petroleum consumption (2.77 million barrels/day) and contributes 6% of the revenues to the Nations exchequer. Established as an oil marketing entity on 30th June 1959, Indian Oil Company Ltd. was renamed Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. on 1st September 1964 when Indian Refineries Ltd. (established in August 1958) was merged with it. The integrated refining & marketing entity has since grown into the countrys largest commercial enterprise and Indias No.1 Company in the prestigious Fortune Global 500 listing of the worlds largest corporates, ranked at the 125th position in the year 2010. With over 34,000-strong workforce, IndianOil has been helping to meet Indias energy demands for over half a century. IndianOil is Indias flagship national oil company with business interests straddling the entire hydrocarbon value chain â€“ from refining, pipeline transportation and marketing of petroleum products to exploration & production of crude oil & gas, marketing of natural gas and petrochemicals. With a corporate vision to be the Energy of India, IndianOil closed the year 2009-10 with a sales turnover of Rs.271,074 crore and profits of Rs.10,221 crore. At IndianOil, the operations are strategically structured along business verticals - Refineries, Pipelines, Marketing, R&D Centre and Business Development â€“ E&P, Petrochemicals and Natural Gas. IndianOil and its subsidiaries account for approximately 48% petroleum products market share, 34.8% national refining capacity and 71% downstream sector pipelines capacity in India. IndianOil has a countrywide marketing network of over 35,600 sales points. Its world-class R&D Centre has won recognition for its pioneering work in lubricants formulation, refinery processes, pipeline transportation and alternative fuels. To seek growth beyond traditional areas of competence, IndianOils business development efforts are now focussed on vertical integration â€“ both upwards into oil exploration & production and downward into petrochemicals â€“besides diversification into gas marketing  and alternative energy,  and globalisation of downstream operations. Having set up subsidiaries in Sri Lanka, Mauritius and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), IndianOil is simultaneously scouting for new business opportunities in the energy markets of Asia and Africa. Alternative Energy Renewable energy is expected to be a game-changer in the medium to long term. As a spin-off, these projects generate major environmental and social benefits. To leverage an emerging business opportunity as well as reduce its carbon footprint, IndianOiI has forayed into alternative energy options such as wind, solar, bio- fuels, Hydrogen and nuclear energy. A Renewable Energy & Sustainable Development Department has  7 Sustainability Report 2009-10 been set up at Corporate Of fice to spearhead renewable energy and sustainable development initiatives. Wind Energy IndianOils first Wind Power project (21 MW installed capacity) in Kutch, Gujarat was commissioned on 5th January 2009 to supply power to five pipeline Outlets (RO) and LPG Distributorships was launched in the States of Odisha and Karnataka in 2009. Presently, solar lanterns are being marketed across 20 states and will gradually be taken to the remaining States. IndianOil has drawn up plans to put up a 5 MW scale solar power plant at Barmer, Rajasthan. It has selected BHEL to provide the technology and solar panels. Biofuels In the year 2007, IndianOil amended its Memorandum and Articles of Association to include agricultural activities necessary for Biofuels production. IndianOils biofuels initiative is aimed at producing green fuel and reducing greenhouse gas emission. In addition, it will also uplift rural communities and create environmental benefits. locations in the state and to the State grid. Costing Rs. 132 crore, the project has generated over 7.22 crore kwh of electricity and revenues of Rs. 28.22 crore till September 2010. It is estimated to generate about 34,000 CERs (Certified Emission Reduction) annually under Clean Development Mechanism. Solar Energy IndianOil launched its Solar Lantern project with an objective of replacing kerosene as fuel for lighting in rural areas. Besides providing quality lighting to facilitate studying and pursuit of economic activities beyond sunset, the improved smoke-free environment obviates health hazards. IndianOil commissioned two pilot Solar Charging Stations (SCS) at its Kisan Seva Kendras at Sathla and Chokoni in Uttar Pradesh in the year 2008 where villagers, who cannot afford to purchase lanterns, can also rent them. Sale of solar LED lanterns from our Retail  8 Sustainability Report 2009-10 Over 5000 hectares of Jatropha plantations has been undertaken in three states â€“ Chhattisgarh, MP and UP, making IndianOil the owner of Indias largest captive energy crop plantation. The project has generated about 2.32 lakh mandays of rural employment and is estimated to generate about 1.1 lakh CERs yearly upon maturity. Biodiesel from Algae A MoU for collaborating on commercial production of biodiesel from algae has been signed with Petro Algae LLC, USA. Nuclear Energy To partner low-carbon energy business, IndianOil has signed an MoU with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) to set up Nuclear Power plants. A JV company is proposed to be formed for the purpose. IndianOil. The Energy of India As a leading public sector enterprise of India, IndianOil has successfully combined its corporate social responsibility agenda with its business offerings, meeting the energy needs of millions of people everyday across the length and breadth of the country, traversing a diversity of cultures, difficult terrains and harsh climatic conditions. The Corporation takes pride in its continuous investments in innovative technologies and solutions for sustained energy flow and economic growth and in developing techno-economically viable and environment-friendly products & services for the benefit of its consumers. Group Synergy IndianOil acquired Governments stake and management control of stand-alone refiners Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (CPCL) and Bongaigaon Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. (BRPL). BRPL has since been formally merged with parent company. IndianOil acquired IBP and seamlessly merged it with the parent company, leading to the formation of a larger and more formidable marketing network. IndianOil has set up three overseas subsidiaries - Lanka IOC Ltd. in Sri Lanka, IndianOil (Mauritius) Ltd. in Mauritius and IOC Middle East FZE in the United Arab Emirates. In addition, IndianOil has active joint ventures in operation with reputed Indian and overseas partners in the areas of aviation refuelling, city gas marketing, LPG and LNG imports and storage, specialty lubricants and additives, terminalling services, etc. Future Plans IndianOilPeople have been at the forefront in adapting to changing environment and enhancing the organisations capabilities to provide innovative and value-added offerings to the customers. In the backdrop of a rapidly changing business environment, IndianOil is focussing on certain key issues for sustained growth in the deregulated market. These are: prudent finance and projects management, optimum capacity utilisation of refineries and pipelines network, competitive business strategies, customer-  9 Sustainability Report 2009-10 focussed innovations in product and service offerings, streamlining of business processes, and achieving greater synergy with group companies for enhanced efficiency and effectiveness in the market place. Investing in the Future The year 2009-10 witnessed singular focus on efficiency improvement, and development, demonstration & commercialisation of environment-friendly green technologies at IndianOils R&D Centre. In this direction, demonstration of in-house developed DHDS/DHDT catalyst - INDICAT-DH-IV at CPCLs Manali Refinery has been very successful in producing Bharat Stage-IV compliant diesel. A single-step compact reforming process for production of Hydrogen-CNG has been developed for direct dispensing into vehicles, thus eliminating the need for separate production storage and blending of Hydrogen. A demonstration unit at pilot plant scale for this technology is being set up at the R&D Centre at Faridabad. IndianOil has developed less carbon intensive technologies for deep desulphurisation of diesel and gasoline through the adsorption route that consumes less hydrogen. Efforts are being made to commercialise this technology at Cauvery Basin and Guwahati refineries. In the future, gasification is likely to get integrated with petroleum refining due to its environmental benefits and ability to facilitate processing of a variety of feedstock. Keeping this in view, IndianOil has initiated research in gasification and Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) technologies. Work has been initiated on Algal Development / Lignocellulosic Ethanol / Bio-hydrogen from organic waste / Bio-butanol production. IndianOil has been extensively promoting co-processing of non-edible vegetable oil in existing refining infrastructure. The technology for de-metallation of vegetable oil has been perfected, patented and process is underway for conducting plant trials. The setting up of the pilot plant for conversion of ligno-cellulosic biomass to ethanol is expected to give fillip to the development of alternative fuels. Life cycle assessment of bio-diesel from Jatropha was completed in collaboration with NREL, USA. The study is now being extended to its application in the road transport sector.  10 Sustainability Report 2009-10 Detailed studies have been undertaken on a fleet of vehicles using 10% Ethanol-blended petrol in collaboration with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) and ARAI, Pune. Indians first semi-commercial H-CNG dispensing station was set up in Delhi and demonstration projects on use of H-CNG blends in automotive vehicles (light duty & heavy duty vehicles) were undertaken in collaboration with SIAM and the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy. The year 2009-10 also marked our resolve to overcome challenges of our refineries in meeting new Minimal National Standards (MINAS) of oil content in treated ef fluent, etc. The Oilivorous-S technology was successfully extended to marine applications to bio- remediate oil spill from a sunken vessel for the first time. IndianOil achieved major successes in the area of development of environment friendly, emission compliant, energy efficient and long drain oils such as the long drain gear box oil for Voith gear boxes of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, Bharat Stage-IV compliant diesel engine oils, low pour transformer oils, etc. We are also the first Indian company to have commercially launched food grade lubricants with NSF International, USA listing. Work has also been initiated to develop lubricants for alternative fuels, nuclear power plants and aircraft using synthetic base materials for longer drain capabilities. IndianOil has volunteered to develop the Delhi Driving cycle, an initiative which is a step towards redefining and replacing the conventional pattern of measuring the automotive exhaust emissions and fuel economy in India.  This will also help in measurement and prediction of the fuel economy and emission level of Indian automobiles on Delhi roads.  11 Sustainability Report 2009-10  12 Sustainability Report 2009-10 IndianOil has been the key supplier of petroleum products to the Indian economy for over five decades now. In the post liberalization period, petroleum products consumption growth in the country has averaged at around 5% per annum and IndianOil has catered to a majority share of this growth. When we compare this to the world average growth of 1% during the same period, one is able to appreciate the scale of growth that Indias petroleum market has witnessed. Looking into the future, even faster growth rates are projected for the Indian economy and petroleum products would continue to be key fuels to sustain this growth. Besides, other growing demand centers in South East Asia are expected to emerge as major export markets for Indian refiners. It is gas, the other hydrocarbon that is set to take the lead. IndianOil in the recent years has invested in the gas business in the country and in the future too will try to tap opportunities in this area. With increase in sourcing oppor tunities, especially with the commercialisation of shale gas, the sector holds significant growth prospects. Across the world, Oil & Gas sector is under regulatory and societal pressure to reduce both direct & indirect CO2 emissions, and in the coming years we will Economic Strategy & Management Approach increasingly be expected to provide solutions and make investments in this area. IndianOil understands its responsibility in this regard. Energy efficiency has generally been a focus area for IndianOil as an energy cost minimization strategy, and now in the context of climate change considerations it acquires even more importance and IndianOils investments in this area would continue. In the core business of petroleum products, a pressing issue has been that of price subsidization of some petroleum products. While Petrol has been taken out of the subsidisation net, Diesel, LPG & Kerosene continue to create under-recoveries for IndianOil. Being a major player in the Indian Hydrocarbon sector, IndianOil as per its new vision sees itself in the future as the Energy of India. This vision brings along with it a lot of responsibilities, especially given the crucial link between energy sector & sustainable development. The main focus areas are:  Increasing presence in the renewable & alternative fuel spaces  Producing green & environmental norms compliant products & making production processes energy efficient by employing and developing (through in-house R&D) such technologies.  Expansion of presence in the E&P of oil & gas through both conventional & non-conventional methods both within & outside the country.  Greening of supply chain through an organization wide environmental mapping exercise.  Strengthening core businesses by increasing value addition through downward integration into the petrochemicals business.  13 Sustainability Report 2009-10 2009-10 2008-09 2009-10 2008-09 2007-08 2006-07 2005-06 (US $ Million) (` in Crore) I FINANCIAL Turnover (Inclusive of 57,116 62,043 271,074 285,398 247,457 220,779 183,172 Excise Duty) Gross Profit * 3,976 2,461 18,872 11,319 14,334 14,622 9,931 Profit Before Interest & Tax 3,294 1,800 15,632 8,281 11,626 11,990 7,728 Profit Before Tax 2,972 941 14,106 4,329 10,080 10,485 6,706 Profit After Tax 2,154 641 10,221 2,950 6,963 7,499 4,915 Dividend 665 198 3,156 910 656 2,251 1,460 Dividend Tax 107 34 509 155 76 362 205 Retained Earnings 1,382 409 6,556 1,885 6,231 4,886 3,250 Value Added 6,895 6,849 32,725 31,507 24,667 24,716 17,132 Contribution to Central Exchequer 5,592 5,628 26,541 25,891 34,249 28,431 24,449 (incl.

With a rising world population and economic development, increased energy use is a need to support the desire for a better quality of life. At the same time, the burden on this environment is increasing to the extent that in various parts of the world, natural resources that always have been renewable-fresh water, clean air, soil, forests and fisheries are losing their ability to replenish and sustain growing local populations. Tensions arising from economic development and environmental conservation are major contributors to social pressures and conflicts. The explosion of global electronic communication heightens public awareness to these problems calling for greater transparency and accountability of Governments as well as Business. In response to these pressures, the oil and natural gas industry is placing greater emphasis on understanding the varied needs and expectations of the countries and communities in which they operate. This not only means to conduct oil & gas activities in an economically, socially and environmentally responsible manner, but also working together with stakeholder groups  to identify and implement constructive solutions to shared problems. At IndianOil, compliance with laws and regulations established to promote Safety, Health & Environment are accorded the highest priority. Beyond compliance, however, excellence in Safety, Health & Environmental Performance and a commitment to good corporate citizenship are encouraged. Such efforts are adding value to the company and its stakeholders. Raw Material IndianOil refineries processed 50.7 million tonnes of crude oil during the year, representing a drop of 1.4% over the previous year, due to reduced domestic demand and planned turnarounds of our refineries. However, capacity utilisation remained above 100%. Crude oil constitutes the major raw material import to our refineries. 38.3 million tonnes of imported crude oil was processed during the year. This amounted to 75.5% of the crude oil processed. At IndianOil, the optimum utilization of crude oil to improve gross refining margins (GRM) has always been monitored. Various measures including intermediate stream sharing amongst refineries, processing of higher volumes of low cost, high sulphur crude oils, upgrading residue to distillates, Environment Strategy & Management Approach  18 Sustainability Report 2009-10 value addition through implementation of an integrated business plan and putting up new secondar y processing facilities have been undertaken. Energy Conservation As a part of the continued efforts towards energy conservation, a number of projects, as indicated below, have been implemented during 2009-10 at Refineries, Marketing, Pipelines and R & D Centre. Major investment schemes implemented for energy conservation in Refineries are:  Flare gas recover y system at Barauni and Bongaigaon Refinery.  Step-less control of DHDT & CRU MUG Compressors at Barauni Refinery.  Routing of VDU hot well off-gas to furnace at Gujarat Refinery.  Vent gas recovery from VDU-II at Haldia Refinery.

While this error is regretted, the figures have been corrected in this report.) Despite commissioning new facilities during 2009-10, the increase in power consumption over the previous year has been kept at a marginal level through implementation of energy conservation measures. Power Consumption (MWH)  19 Sustainability Report 2009-10 Trends in Energy Index With greater emphasis on this important aspect of refining operations, the targets for energy index have been further tightened as shown in the figure. Energy conservation in buildings is another area that is receiving greater attention. Our officials are being exposed to awareness and capacity building programmes.  Energy audit of several buildings has been undertaken across the organization and recommendations are being implemented. CDM Projects Two Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Projects at Barauni and Gujarat refineries were registered during the year with United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Certified Emission Reduction (CER) for the projects is 11,988 and 27,834 respectively. A total of five CDM projects have been registered till date, with CER of 56,374. The wind power project at Gujarat has received host country approval and validation is in progress. Also, eight additional projects under CDM have been taken up at our Refineries. In Pipelines and Marketing Divisions and at R&D Centre, improvement in lighting energy efficiency has led to replacement of GLS with CFL lamps.  Other initiatives like installation of variable drive motors has also resulted in optimum utilization of electric power.  20 Sustainability Report 2009-10 Refinery Effluent Balance M3/hr (2009-10) Generation Discharge Reuse Reuse % Guwahati 212 91 121 57.1 Barauni 550 329 221 40.1 Gujarat 1193 11 1182 99.1 Haldia 529 223 306 57.8 Mathura 533 199 334 62.7 Panipat 948 117 831 87.7 Digboi 52 11 41 78.8 Bongaigaon 271 10 261 96.3 TOTAL 4288 991 3297 76.9 Effluents & Emissions Effluents The corporation approaches its responsibilities towards minimizing the environmental impact of its operations very seriously and continuously upgrades its facilities and processes towards this objective. The treated effluents are reused / recycled for various purposes in refineries like fire water and cooling tower make up, coke cutting in Delayed Cokers and also for captive irrigation in our green belts & Eco parks as well as make up to Eco-ponds. This has helped in reducing discharge of treated effluent outside the refinery premises. About 77% of the treated effluent was reused in refineries during 2009-10. Refinery wise data on effluent generated, treated and re-used is given below:  21 Sustainability Report 2009-10 Some of the major initiatives taken at our refineries on reducing / improving effluent/ emissions are listed below  A new state-of-the-art ETP is being constructed at Barauni Refinery comprising of Primary, Secondary and Tertiary treatment sections.  A Tilted Plate Interceptor (Capacity 550 M3/Hr) is being provided in ETP of Guwahati Refinery for further reduction of oil content at outlet of gravity separation treatment section.  A new ETP was constructed and commissioned along with the Hydrocracker Unit (HCU) at Haldia Refinery. The old ETP is also being augmented.  Installation of Dissolved Air Floatation mechanism is in progress at Digboi Refinery ETP. This will reduce the oil & grease content in the final treated effluent, though presently also it meets the norm. Emissions During the production processes in the refineries there are emissions of pollutant gases from the stacks, namely, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Utmost attention is given to control / reduce emissions in our refineries. The major sources of gaseous emissions are flue gases from boilers and heaters, FCC regenerators and Sulphur Recovery Units (SRU). Hydrocarbon leaks and evaporation during storage, handling and transportation of petroleum products and crude oil are also potential sources of emissions to air. Our refineries have adopted various measures to control emissions & effectively disperse the flue gases.  Some of these measures are:  Use of low sulphur fuel oil / sweet natural gas/ desulphurised refinery gas in our boilers and heaters to minimize SO2 emission  Hydrogen  Sulphide  generated  during desulphurisation of refinery gas is converted to elemental sulphur in Sulphur Recovery Units  22 Sustainability Report 2009-10  Sulphur dioxide emissions from Catalytic Crackers are controlled by effective feed sulphur management  Cyclone separators are provided in FCCU regenerators to arrest catalyst fines  Low NOX burners are provided in furnaces  Use of floating roof tanks for crude and other light product services & provision of primary and secondary seals in floating roof tanks for minimizing fugitive emission of hydrocarbons  Use of mechanical seal in pumps  Use of closed blow down vessels & safety release to flare system for arresting any emission of hydrocarbons during all situations, normal, abnormal as well as emergencies  Continuous Stack Analysers for measurement of SO2 and NOX in flue gases are provided / being provided in the stacks.  Monitoring ambient air quality at fixed monitoring stations. Mobile van equipped with sophisticated monitoring equipment is also in use at Mathura, Panipat, Guwahati and Gujarat Refineries.  During 2009-10, monitoring of fugitive emissions from Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) sources was carried out in our Refinery units under Leak Detection & Repair (LDAR) Programme.  Continuous reduction in fuel consumption by ENCON measures Our refineries fully complied with the applicable emission standards for process units as also total Sulphur dioxide emission limit prescribed by statutory bodies: Refinery Prescribed Actual Actual Limited (KG/HR) (KG/HR) (KG/HR (2008-09) 2009-10) Guwahati * 67-82 55-110 Barauni 1080 724-841 727-835 Gujarat 1360 515-1052 825-979 Haldia 1340 752-842 719-897 Mathura 450 266-350 267-358 Digboi * 50-80 50-80 Panipat 1275 1164-1234 972-1169 Bongaigaon * - 66-111 (*Limit not prescribed by Assam State Pollution Control Board for Guwahati, Digboi and Bongaigaon Refineries which process very low sulphur Assam Crude) At Marketing and Pipeline Division installations, Generator exhaust, ambient air quality and discharge from Oil water separators is regularly monitored and are within norms.  23 Sustainability Report 2009-10 At IndianOil, we believe that water will be one of the most important and scarce resource in future. Hence considerable attention is being placed on its efficient utilisation. Total water sourced and consumed by various Divisions of IndianOil during 2008-09 and 2009-10 is given in the table above. Water consumption during 2009-10 has gone up slightly despite increased operations, inclusion of water consumption at Bongaigaon Refinery in the 2009-10 data for refineries and commissioning of Hydro Cracker Unit at Haldia Refinery during the year. Water Conservation A greater emphasis is being given to the efficient use of water.  Measures such as use of air cooling instead of water cooling, wherever feasible, installation of water efficient taps, automatic water sensing taps, flushing systems etc. are being considered / implemented. Additionally, as stated earlier, a slew of measures in the refineries helped recycle and re-use about 77% of treated effluent during 2009-10. At our R&D Centre, 100% reuse of treated effluent continues to maintain Zero discharge. Recharging ground water through rain-water harvesting As a responsible corporate citizen, IndianOil has taken the initiative of installing rain-water harvesting facilities at its various locations to recharge the ground water table. Such facilities have been put up at 73 Marketing installations & are in progress at another 28 installations. In Pipelines and Refinery installations, the number of such facilities installed was 19 and 16 respectively. Waste Management Oily sludge generated from periodic cleaning of storage tanks in refineries is reprocessed to recover oil to the extent possible and the sludge with residual oil is either bio-remediated to remove hydrocarbons or are disposed to approved agencies.  Other significant wastes like spent catalysts are also disposed off to Water Consumption Increase Decrease in Total Water Sourced 2008-09 2009-10 Division Total Water Ground Water % Ground Total Water Ground Water % Ground % Sourced M3 Sourced M3 Water/ Sourced M3 Sourced M3 Water/ Total Water Total Water Refineries 78,427,818 35,329,121 45 81,124,078 20,968,171 25.85 3.44 Marketing 1,184,500 1,045,131 88.23 1,195,464 1,052,178 88.01 0.93 Pipelines 335,281 299,737 89.40 343,268 305,212 88.91 2.38 R&D 182,000 182,000 100 200,700 200,700 100 10.27 Total 80,129,599 36,855,989 46.0 82,863,510 22,526,261 27.18 Water Ambient air quality of the R&D Centre is being monitored regularly using ambient air quality monitoring van.

In addition to the analyzers the Air Quality Monitoring Van is equipped with a weather station which can continuously log the wind (speed, direction & intensity), temperature and humidity data.  This van is monitoring the ambient air quality at IOC fuel retail outlets at Delhi & NOIDA. It is also being used for ambient air quality data collection for pre-CNG vis--vis post CNG period at Faridabad.  24 Sustainability Report 2009-10 registered agencies for re-processing. Policy formulation for advanced and more environment friendly processes of waste management is under process at the corporate level. Green Belts About 91,000 trees were planted during the year at IndianOil installations across the country, adding to over 10 lakh trees already adorning our green belts.  These serve as carbon sinks and also contribute to the bio-diversity.  Flora and fauna thrive in these green belts which are home to migratory birds.  A large number of birds set up temporary homes at our ecological parks - a testimony to the harmony created with nature. Safety & Occupational Health Safety management is an integral part of the overall management ethos of the Corporation and the highest priority is accorded to safety and occupational health. IndianOil diligently follows the standards laid down by the Oil Industry Safety Directorate (OISD) and the norms set of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) for environment protection. Safety Our Corporate Safety, Health & Environment (S,H & E) Policy establishes the framework for a sound Safety, Health & Environment ambience and serves as a foundation for its integration into the companys processes and activities. S,H & E management receives the highest attention at IndianOil.  A Board sub-Committee on S,H & E was constituted in 2009-10 with an independent Director as Chairman and comprises of two independent Directors and three Functional Directors as Members to further improve systems, practices and performance. However, despite constant focus on safety, on 29th October, 2009 a major fire incident occurred at IndianOils Terminal at Sanganer in Jaipur, Rajasthan. The incident led to 11 fatalities including six IndianOil personnel.  The loss of precious lives has hurt IndianOil people across the organization and has shaken the strong foundation on which safe operations at our installations were built.  Several lessons were learnt from the incident and actions have been initiated to strengthen and improve systems, procedures and practices and also upgrade safety features in our infrastructure.  Greater emphasis is being put on training to equip our personnel with better knowledge on safety systems etc. Occupational Health Today, health and safety management is a complex activity requiring the expertise of specialists from many disciplines, such as industrial hygiene, occupational medicine, ecology, psychology and safety engineering. Moreover, concerns in health and safety management now ex tend beyond physical conditions in the workplace to embrace regard for workers mental and emotional well-being, and a commitment to protecting the surrounding community from pollution and exposure to toxic substances. All IndianOil refineries have well equipped Occupational Health Centres. Doctors and paramedics are specially trained to monitor the health of employees working in hazardous areas. At locations where these facilities are not available, employees health check up is carried out through retainer doctors. All Occupational Health Centres are certified under Occupational Health & Safety Management System (OHSMS). The employees are regularly exposed to training programmes in work- related hazards and ways and means of protection from such hazards. The health care personnel regularly interact with shop floor managers and staff in the shop floor meetings on health and safety. Various media of Communication like House Journals, Posters, Video Films, etc. are extensively used for creating awareness.  25 Sustainability Report 2009-10  26 Sustainability Report 2009-10 At IndianOil there is a commitment to society that is all pervading. Our tradition of giving back to the society dates back to our inception in 1964 when we started community development activities in the vicinity of our units. Starting with welfare programmes for the underprivileged SC/ST community, these activities have reached all parts of the country as part of our corporate social responsibility programme. CSR has been included as a parameter for assessing our corporate performance.  In fact, one of the  cornerstones of our new Vision is Environment â€“ Caring for the environment and community. Over the years, IndianOil Corporate Social Responsibility Policy has been revised to reflect the changing needs of the country. Community Development Programmes The IndianOil Board from the year 2009-10, has enhanced the annual expenditure for Corporate Social Responsibility activities carried out by the Corporation from the earlier existing level of 0.75% of the Net Profit registered during the previous year to 2.00% of the retained Profit of the previous year. The unspent amount, if any, will be carried forward to the next year. IndianOil Board has constituted a Corporate Social Responsibility Committee comprising of five Board members which includes three Part-time Independent/ Government Directors, Director (Marketing) and Director (Human Resources) to monitor and administer CSR activities in IndianOil. With this increased emphasis on Corporate Social Responsibility, IndianOil has identified three thrust areas where efforts will be channelized - Health & Medical Care, Education & Clean Drinking water. Out of the total allocation under Communit y Development Programme, about 25% is spent under Special Component Plan (SCP) and Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) for improving the quality of life of the SCs and STs. Social Strategy & Management Approach Key Focus Providing Clean Drinking Water During the year, IndianOil provided over 100 tube wells/ ring wells all across the country, mostly in areas facing scarcity of potable water. The company also provided Water purifiers/Water coolers at schools and community centres improving the quality of drinking water available to children and people living in arid areas. Other activities include:  Installation of hand pumps,  Construction of elevated water tanks,  Providing water tap connection, etc. in select neighbouring villages,  Funding of rainwater harvesting projects/kits Health & Medical Care IndianOil also organized large number of medical camps on Family Planning, Eye Care, Blood Donation, Animal Health and provided ambulances to increase the reach of medical care in several remote parts of the country. Various other activities undertaken include:  Supply of medicines to primary health centres  27 Sustainability Report 2009-10  AIDS awareness drive & distribution of free condoms  Providing hearing aids/wheel chairs to physically challenged  Providing financial assistance & medical equipments for running of hospitals & medical research centres Similarly, the hospitals attached to the refineries also serve as centres for creating health awareness and hygiene, holding medical camps etc. Besides the above, IndianOil runs and maintains the following for the benefit of the local community:  50 Bed Swarna Jayanti Samudaik Hospital, Ranchi Bangar, Mathura  200 Bed Hospital set up by Assam Oil Division, IOCL at Digboi, Assam  Assam Oil School of Nursing, AOD, Digboi The IndianOil Board has also approved setting up of a 50 Bed community hospital in the memory of Late Shri Manjunath S, in Lakhimpur Kheri District, Uttar Pradesh. Late Shri Manjunath S., a Sales Officer in IndianOil, is remembered for his integrity and dedication towards duty. Expansion of Education Expansion of education is another thrust areas of community development wherein IndianOil facilitates education of children, vocational training for adolescents and youth etc. During the year, IndianOil has helped improve the infrastructure of several schools/colleges by providing them with furniture, constructing buildings, clean toilet facilities, hostels, providing computers, books, laboratory equipment etc. In addition, IndianOil has sponsored the education of underprivileged girl children through Nanhi Kali programme of the Naandi Foundations and the K C Mahindra Education Trust. IndianOil also conducts vocational training programmes during the year, In addition, the company also awarding meritorious students, providing delivery vans for distribution of mid-day meals to Govt. School children etc, sponsors/organises rural sports/games, sports meets/events and supports education and research activities. IndianOil Board has accorded approval for the setting up a senior secondary school in Dist. Sitapur, Uttar Pradesh. IndianOil has set up and runs a 200 bed hospital at Digboi with ultra-modern medical facilities for the benefit of the people of the area. The hospital established in the year 1906, occupies an important position in the socio-economic scene of this extreme North East corner of the country. Not only does it serve the employees of IndianOil, it also serves as a tertiary referral hospital in the districts of Tinsukia and Digboi and also parts of Arunachal Pradesh (right upto the areas bordering Myanmar). The hospital doctors alongwith paramedical staff also visit the nearby villages for providing health care services to the villagers. The medical care services provided by the hospital are heavily subsidized. In addition, over one lakh patients per year are treated by the hospital and IndianOil incurs over Rs.3 crore every year only on account of non-employee Patients. IndianOil Scholarship Schemes Since the year 1984-85, IndianOil has been operating an Educational Scholarship Scheme for poor and deserving SC/ST students. The following types of educational and sports scholarship schemes are awarded to deserving candidates: A. IndianOil Educational Scholarships: The Scholarship is awarded to 450 meritorious students on merit-cum-means basis in select categories to nurture and support talent among deserving students belonging to families (with less than rupees one lakh as the gross joint annual income of the family). Out of this, 50% are reserved for SC/ST/OBC students whereas 25% of the Scholarship is earmarked for girl students and 10% for Physically Handicapped students in each categor y/sub-categor y. IndianOil awards educational scholarships at two levels:  28 Sustainability Report 2009-10 i. IndianOil Merit Scholarships Scheme for 10+/ITI studies ii. IndianOil Scholarships Scheme for Graduate and Post-Graduate students B. IndianOil Sports Scholarship Scheme: IndianOil had introduced a Sports Scholarship Scheme from the year 2006-07 for promising young sports persons. The Sports Scholarship Scheme initially awarded 55 scholarships for 7 games/sports (Cricket, Table Tennis, Badminton, Tennis, Chess, Hockey and Golf). The scheme has been revised during year 2009-10 and the number of scholarships has been increased to 77 for 10 games/sports (incl. Billiards/ Snooker, Carrom and Athletics). The scholarship amount is in the range of Rs.9000/-, Rs.14000/- p.m. based on performance. National Causes and Natural Calamities IndianOil has always responded proactively to provide aid and relief to the victims of any natural calamities like floods, tsunami, earthquake, cyclones etc. During the year, IndianOil has contributed Rs.41.00 Lakh towards the setting up of community kitchens and towards the Chief Ministers Relief Fund for benefit of the Andhra Pradesh flood victims. It has also contributed towards the distribution of food packets in areas affected by heavy rains/floods during the year in Sitapur and Lakhimpur Kheri Districts of Uttar Pradesh. In addition, IndianOil also contributes generously for any national causes in the benefit of the nation for instance the investment for the setting up of educational institutions of national importance like the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology etc. LPG Schemes From the year 2009-10 onwards, IndianOil is contributing a fixed amount of its retained profit of previous year (20% of 2% of Retained Profit) towards the following schemes for the benefit of the rural communities:  Provision of Common LPG Community Kitchen facilities in villages  Release of one-time grant to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families in the rural areas for release of new LPG connection under Rajiv Gandhi Gramin LPG Vitarak Yojana (RGGLV Yojana)  29 Sustainability Report 2009-10  30 Sustainability Report 2009-10 Labour The human resources strategy in the organisation aims at ma ximising return on investment on the organisations human capital and minimise financial and non-financial risks for business success. Human Resources seeks to achieve this by aligning the supply of skilled and qualified individuals and the capabilities of their workforce, with the organisations ongoing and future business plans. To meet the emerging challenges of the post- deregulated era of the oil and gas sector, IndianOil is working relentlessly to create a vibrant pool of knowledge managers. IndianOil does not merely offer a job, it instead offers a lifelong career with a commitment to continuous learning and skill development and motivating assignments at each stage of the employees careers. We recruit bright and professionally qualified people through a combination of open and campus recruitment. Management Development Programmes are conducted round the year at IndianOils own learning institutes and in collaboration with renowned institutes. With IndianOils emphasis on growing its own timber, most of its top management personnel, including Board Members, have risen from within. IndianOil has also provided leadership positions to the industry with several CEOs in PSUs and private enterprises being ex-IOCians. IndianOil has been continuously benchmarking its HR processes and labour practices and has won recognition as a pioneer in evolution of robust human resource development systems, including recruitment, training and development, employee engagement, succession planning and other sub-systems. Recruitment IndianOil believes in offering equal opportunity to all. Recruitment is facilitated to include persons from weaker sections of the society classified under Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Physically handicapped, women, etc. In 2009-10, IndianOil took a major strategic initiative by introducing Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE)-2010 score instead of conducting its own written test for selection of engineers through open recruitment. This has brought in more objectivity in the recruitment system. Besides, the campus recruitment process has been strengthened to attract the best talent. Mid-level recruitments have been carried out to bridge skill gaps in new business verticals like petrochemicals and bio- fuels. To kick start its Exploration &Production business vertical, IndianOil has engaged qualified manpower with requisite level of technical skill and experience on contract. Induction and On-boarding New recruits join IndianOil at its premier learning centre- IndianOil Institute of Petroleum Management (IiPM) located at Gurgaon for a customised training program for two weeks called Common Corporate Induction Module. This gives them glimpses about all the business processes of IndianOil. A lot of behavioural input is given at this stage to facilitate the smooth transition of youngsters from the bonhomie of student life to the responsibilities of professional life. At the very early stages the newly recruited employees are assigned to mentors, who do the initial hand-holding and psychological mooring in the organisation. Labour Practices  31 Sustainability Report 2009-10 Training and Development IndianOil is known as an academy company for its state- of-the-art training infrastructure and the cutting edge training it provides throughout the life cycle of its employees. The company has 20 centres of learning for meeting the Training & Development needs of its employees in-house. Of these, seven are located at its various Refineries, four at respective marketing regional offices, three at pipeline regions, one at R&D Centre Faridabad and one each at the head quarters of Refineries and Pipelines.  IndianOil has set up three centers of higher learning; the IndianOil Management Academy (IMA) at Haldia, IndianOil Management Centre for Learning (IMCL) at Mumbai and the apex learning centre, IndianOil Institute of Petroleum Management (IiPM), at Gurgaon. IndianOil has collaborated the leading international institutes like Universitas-21 Global (U-21) of Singapore, iFP-France, IIMs, MDI, Gurgaon, etc to develop programmes customised for the need of IndianOil employees. IndianOil employees on an average receive about three to five days of training per year, which is comparable with the best companies in India and abroad. To further enhance the scope of training, IndianOil is investing heavily in its e-learning initiatives. Employee engagement IndianOil conducted its first employee engagement survey in 2007 among both executives and non- executives. It identified engagement drivers like leadership, HR alignment, learning and development, decision-making and work-life balance. To improve the level of engagement a number of new initiatives like on-boarding and welcoming of newly recruited executives, mentoring etc have been initiated.  The channels for employees communication has been revamped and e-platform has been created in form of Discussion Forum for exchange of views and ideas amongst the employees. The employees have been empowered to forward their grievances directly to the Director (HR) through Personnel Touch. New Vision The new vision of IndianOil, which was formally adopted in September 2009, has been developed through a bottom-up approach by a series of consultation with employees at all the levels so that the new Vision emerges as a Shared Vision rather than Vision Shared. As per the new vision, IndianOil envisages to be the Energy of India and a Globally Admired Company. Collective bargaining There are 23 recognized unions in the Corporation representing workmen while the IndianOil Officers Association (IOOA) represents the executives. A common and shared set of industrial relations values and strategies between management, collectives and employees has been evolved over time, resulting in harmonious industrial relations. The major demands of the recognised unions pertaining to revision of wages and allowances are negotiated at the divisional level and are settled through a long term settlement (LTS). As far as executives are concerned, their pay revision and allowances are implemented after due deliberation with Officers Association, within the framework of Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) guidelines received under presidential directives. Workforce diversity and opportunities IndianOil is an equal opportunity organisation and makes no distinction on the basis of caste, creed, colour, gender and religion. IndianOil is also committed towards affirmative action to bring the historically disadvantaged into the mainstream of life. By diversifying our workforce, we can give individuals the  32 Sustainability Report 2009-10 break they need to earn a living and achieve their dreams. IndianOil has been providing equal opportunity to women employees and minorities at all levels ever since its inception. Statutory requirements and policy guidelines are adhered to without any discrimination. Gender mainstreaming IndianOil is one of the largest employer of women employees amongst the PSUs in India. As on 31st March, 2010 there were 2,624 women employees comprising 7.64% of the total workforce. Out of this, 1,147 (about 44%) of the women employees are in the executive cadre at various levels. IndianOil has extended a plethora of liberal policies to benefit its women employees which include 135-day Maternity Leave and Special Leave. The Corporation encourages women employees to compete and excel at their work.  They are encouraged to author and present papers at National and International level. Several papers have been presented at Global Compact National Convention, ISTD National Convention, CII National Convention, European Congress of Psychology and World Petroleum Congress. Inclusiveness and affirmative action Inclusiveness and affirmative action initiatives for marginalised groups encompassing the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Scheduled Caste (SC)/ Scheduled Tribes (ST) include following activities:  Reservation in Recruitment  Reservation in Promotions  Relaxations/concessions in Recruitment/ Promotions  Pre-promotional training in Marketing Division (Grade VI to A)  Complaint Register  SC/ST Cell  Liaison Officer  Nomination of Officers for Training etc. Inclusiveness and affirmative action for the physically challenged include:  Reservation in Recruitment  Reservation in Promotions  Relaxations/concessions in Recruitment/Promotions  Allowances - Conveyance allowance, medical equipment  Special Training  Special Equipment  Provision of Barrier Free Access  Preference in terms of place of posting to the extent possible Manpower Positioning and Succession Planning Manpower planning in IndianOil is done ver y systematically keeping in view a cycle time of two years. Original manpower budget estimate (OBE) is prepared  33 Sustainability Report 2009-10 for a particular year for at least two years in advance based on the projections received from the Divisions. The original budget estimate then forms the basis of revised budgetary estimate (RBE) for the immediate next year by incorporating more accurate projections from the Division. To have an effective succession planning, IndianOil has already identified pivotal positions and the critical success factors in those pivotal positions. The leaders are identified at early stages of their career based on their performance and their adherence to the core values of IndianOil, ie. Care, Innovation, Passion and Trust. The leaders so identified are rotated in different jobs to hone their technical and people management skills. Selective training is also imparted for supplementing their business knowledge and soft skills. To fine-tune the process of succession planning, a major Corporation-wise initiative is currently being finalised.

UN Global Compact Principles IndianOil conforms to the widely accepted UN Global Compact principles and is also one of the founding members and active participant of the Global Compact Society (India). IndianOil became a permanent member of the society in 2007-08. Gender Sensitivity Training Gender Sensitivit y Training is imparted during Workshop/ Training for women employees by Training Dept. and Unit level WIPS (Women in Public Sector) Cell. The company has created a specifically designed programme for its employees on Gender Sensitivity. These programmes on Gender Sensitivity are attended by male and women employees, focuses on increasing understanding between both the employee groups and Human Rights collective bargaining. We also prefer that our business partners treat their employees similarly. Suppliers Our supply chain extends from vendors to their sub- vendors and their suppliers, transporters, contractors, associates, dealers, distributors etc. IndianOil acknowledges that its responsibility goes right down the chain and while it cannot control all compliance and monitoring, it demands statutory compliance from all and holds up the code of conduct as a guide for action.  37 Sustainability Report 2009-10 are aimed at increasing work harmony. This has resulted in negligible gender related complaints. Forum of Women in Public Sector (WIPS) For proper implementation of the companys policies, Womens Cells have been established at most of our installations.  Each Cell is steered by a women leader. IndianOil has established 17 Womens Cells across the company, each of which is headed by an organizational level leader known as Apex Level WIPS Leader to provide a platform for their development under the WIPS. Child Labour The organisation supports effective abolition of child labour. No person below the age of 18 years is engaged by the Corporation in any area of work. The organization has prescribed the minimum age limit of 18 years for employment/contract labour in its General Conditions of Contract (GCC) â€“ the guidelines for any contract drawn with IndianOil. Labourers engaged by contractors are also monitored.

Refineries All our refineries have the systems certifications of ISO 9001/9002 which ensures that the stipulated product quality processes are adopted all through the operations. Product batches are certified to meet the stringent industry quality norms at the marketing locations for further despatches to the market.
