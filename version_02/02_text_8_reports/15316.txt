We are the doers behind the doers—creating the tools that are pioneering,  practical and powerful enough to make the world better. Focusing on  quality and sustainability in everything we do is how we give back to our  communities. So we do what we say and we own what we do. Were here  to empower the doers of the world. And thats what we do best.    This is Lenovos fifth annual sustainability report. It covers the Fiscal Year 2010/11 (April  1, 2010 through March 31, 2011). The most recent report prior to this was published in   January 2010 for the Fiscal Year 2009/2010. This and previous reports are available at   http://www.lenovo.com/sustainability   Lenovo  publishes  annual  reports  and  interim  reports  which  are  available  at   http://www.lenovo.com/ww/lenovo/annual_interim_report.html The annual report contains a  sustainability overview.   Lenovos most material risk and opportunity drivers in the areas of Governance Operations  and Human Resources are outlined in this report covering strategic outlook, managerial  approach and current year performance. Lenovo is currently in the process of developing a  materiality-weighted approach for defining the most material sustainability tasks to prioritize  on an annual basis.     Lenovo conducts outreach with a variety of stakeholders, e.g., NGOs, investors, regulators,  think tanks and academia. Lenovo attempts to incorporate their feedback in each sustainability  report. This includes interaction with the sustainability ratings community, which provides  substantial input.

Lenovo may in some instances face various challenges when measuring its performance.      If there are contingencies with data provided, those contingencies will be noted in       the documentation.     Lenovo continues to drive for excellence in measuring and improving its     performance by adding new indicators. When new indicators are added, it may take       time to deliver trending information. Therefore, while we may be measuring       something internally, we may not always provide the information publicly until we       are certain that these statistics can be delivered in a high quality and consistent way.      Scope of the Report      All references are to Lenovos fiscal year, which ends March 31, unless otherwise stated.      This report covers all Lenovo operations with the exception of our recently acquired      company, Medion. Any data pertaining to joint ventures and acquisitions will be included in       subsequent reports.         Our Operations:      Primary operational hubs in Beijing, China; Singapore, Singapore; and Morrisville,       North Carolina, USA      Major research centers in Yokohama, Japan; Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, China;       and Morrisville, North Carolina, USA       PC manufacturing and assembly facilities in Beijing, Shanghai, Huiyang       and Shenzhen, China; Pondicherry, India; Monterrey, Mexico; Greensboro, North         Carolina, USA; contract manufacturing and OEM worldwide       Over 3,200 sales representatives worldwide and an extensive global channel        partner network 4   Well over 90% of Lenovo notebooks, workstations and monitors and 50% of    desktop platforms are ENERGY STAR qualified.   Lenovo has challenged its product teams to incorporate post-consumer recycled    plastic content into every PC product released by the end of the current fiscal     year (March 2012) and increase each business units use of post-consumer     recycled content by 20% year-to-year.    The company has used local manufacturing strategies to shorten ship   requirements and achieved award-winning use of thermoplastics and other     recycled packaging materials.   In FY 10/11, Lenovo supply chain operations continued to show improvement in    supplier engagement and commitment to the EICC code; 99% of our Tier one     suppliers are committed to the EICC and have signed formal agreements.    In August of 2010, I signed a comprehensive Climate Change Policy  for Lenovo    and approved associated targets to support these policy goals. Our climate     change strategy focuses on five areas of influence within which Lenovo works to     drive and facilitate global, national and local Greenhouse Gas emissions     reductions, and weve continued to make great progress in each of these areas. At the same time, we recognise challenges that lie ahead. For the period 2011/2012  Lenovo aims to:   Continue our efforts to formalise program management and corporate    governance of Lenovos Sustainability Programs under the umbrella of our    new chief sustainability executive.  Maintain and grow our leadership in the use of post-consumer recycled content    in the design of our products.  Meet or exceed the climate change goals weve outlined in our Climate    Change Policy. At Lenovo, our mission is to become a leading personal technology company. We  will do this the right way—with a commitment to our customers, our people, our  communities and our planet. We know that great companies are not only successful  in the market, but they make the world a better place. On behalf of Lenovos  26,000+ global employees, I am proud of what we have achieved; I am committed  to continuing to improve and do even more across the sustainability spectrum; and I  am confident that Lenovo can achieve our goals and become a truly great company  that will make a positive impact on our planet for many years to come. Thank you, Yang Yuanqing, Chairman and CEO 6  General Data U.S. Dollars Million Sales: FY 2006/07 FY 2007/08 FY 2008/09 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 $13,978 $16,352 $14,901 $16,605 $21,594 Sales Breakdown Balanced Geographical Mix FY 2008/09 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 Emerging Markets (excluding China) 15.8% 15.9% 17.9% Mature Markets 42.4% 36.6% 35.7% China 41.8% 47.5% 46.4% Totals 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Sales Breakdown By Product FY 2006/07 FY 2007/08 FY 2008/09 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 Notebook 54.8% 57.6% 58.6% 62.6% 60.2% Desktop 43.7% 41.0% 39.6% 35.0% 33.9% Mobile Phone 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.5% 3.7% Others 1.5% 1.4% 1.8% 1.9% 2.2% Research and Development FY 2006/07 FY 2007/08 FY 2008/09 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 Expenditures/Sales 0.0140 0.0141 0.0148 0.0129 0.0141 Employees, Health and Safety FY 2006/07 FY 2007/08 FY 2008/09 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 Number of Employees 25,100 23,111 22,511 22,205 27,039 Hours of Training and Education Per   Employee (including part-time)  CY 2007 CY 2008 CY 2009 CY 2010 N/A N/A N/A 35 Incident Rates  CY 2007 CY 2008 CY 2009 CY 2010 Recordable Rate 0.23 0.17 0.59 0.41 Lost-time Rate 1.57 1.05 2.48 2.06  CY 2007 CY 2008 CY 2009 CY 2010 Number of OHSAS 18001 Registered Facilities 6 6 6 8 Communities and Philanthropy Charitable and Other   Donations FY 2006/07 FY 2007/08 FY 2008/09 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 $1,138,150  $7,796,652  $2,993,000  $497,000  $2,143,000  Charitable Giving  CY 2007 CY 2008 CY 2009 CY 2010 U.S. Employee Charitable Giving Campaign  (given by employees)*  $369,000   $562,000   $317,000   $406,000  Lenovo Matched Contributions (based on  employee contribution above)*  N/A   N/A   N/A   $140,000  Volunteering FY 2007/08 FY 2008/09 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 Volunteering by hours – North Carolina* 1720 2990 770 1300  Site Environmental Data GHG Emissions (metric tons CO2 equivalent – MT CO2e)** CY 2008 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 Scope 1 1,468 1,495 1,249 Scope 2 76,621 68,133 61,072 Scope 3 14,819 15,675 24,316 Total Scope 1, 2 and 3 92,908 85,303 86,637 Emissions Intensity: GHG Emissions – Scope 1 and Scope 2  (metric tons per $ million revenue) CY 2008 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 5.24 4.19 2.89 Operational Energy Intensity Use – Scope 1 and Scope 2  (MWh per $ million revenue) CY 2008 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 Fuel Combustion 0.47 0.43 0.27 Purchased Energy (electricity and steam) 7.18 5.65 4.15 Operational Energy Use – Scope 1 and Scope 2 (MWh) CY 2008 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 Fuel Combustion 6,934.58 7,177.27 5,907.84 Purchased Energy (electricity and steam) 106,961.97 93,894.46 89,677.22   Water CY 2008 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 Water Use (cubic meter) 305,179 295,212 302,391 Waste Water Discharge Values (cubic meter) 278,798 259,451 272,541 Waste Water Exceedances  0 0 0 Waste (metric tons) CY 2008 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 Non hazardous Waste (processes and operations waste,  product waste separately) N/A 11,995.84 12,691.89 Hazardous Waste (processes and operations waste,  product waste separately) 10.39 34.61 17.87 Product Environmental Data Disposition of Products Returned from Customers (metric tons) CY 2009 CY 2010 Reused 198.76 160.00 Recycled 5,751.85 7,582.80 Waste to Energy (WTE) 955.59 1,471.76 Incinerated 31.35 165.59 Landfill 222.62 283.93 Customer Returns by Geography (metric tons) CY 2009 CY 2010 EMEA 6,104 8,326.76 The Americas 386 364.89 Asia Pacific 676 972.43 Recovery and Recycling Trends  (metric tons)   CY 2007 CY 2008 CY 2009 CY 2010 Product End-of-Life Management (PELM) 17,275.65 17,919.40 11,546.64 13,468.63 Product Take Back (PTB) 5,773.96 6,527.07 7,166.17 9,664.08 Total End-of-Life Disposition (metric tons) CY 2009 CY 2010 Reused 483 547.26 Recycled 8,572 10,992.08 Waste to Energy (WTE) 956 1,471.76 Incinerate 1,297 171.11 Landfill 240 286.42 Lenovo ISO 14001 Registered Sites Number of ISO 14001 Registered Sites FY 2008/09 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 14 14 15 Footnotes:  *Lenovo is working to provide charitable giving and volunteer hours for more work sites in future reports. **Lenovos GHG Emissions Inventory Specifics:  Data for 2008 is based on a calendar year; fiscal year data for 2008/2009 is not available.

In 1984, Legend Holdings was formed with 25,000 RMB in a guard house in China. The  company was incorporated in Hong Kong in 1988 and would grow to be the largest PC company  in China. Legend Holdings changed its name to Lenovo in 2004 and, in 2005, acquired the  former Personal Computer Division of IBM, the company that invented the PC industry in 1981. Today, Lenovo is a US$21 billion personal technology company and the worlds second-largest  PC vendor. We have more than 26,000 employees in more than 60 countries serving customers  in more than 160 countries. A global Fortune 500 company, we have headquarters in Beijing,  China and Morrisville, North Carolina, U.S.; major research centers in Yokohama, Japan;  Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, China; and Morrisville; and we have manufacturing around  the world from Greensboro, North Carolina and Monterrey, Mexico to India, China and Brazil. We create and build exceptionally engineered personal technology, but we are much more  than a tech company. We are defining a new way of doing things as a next generation global  company. We have our core strength in China, rapid growth in emerging markets and a unique  global footprint. Lenovo builds on its dominant position in China to grow globally. The expansion  from East to West—introducing our newest products in China and then spreading across the  globe—is a new way of viewing the world, one we believe will be the way of the future. That means we are years ahead of the game in terms of understanding what it will take to win  5 or even 10 years from now. That focus on the future is based on a strong history of success  that is driving results today.  We have momentum. Long the leader in China with more than 30% market share in PCs, Lenovo  is growing rapidly and winning market share in all parts of the world. Lenovo has realized strong,  balanced growth while achieving a number of major breakthroughs. Achieving optimal balance  in all that we do is Lenovos operating philosophy. This mindset encompasses every aspect of  Lenovos business, from balancing leadership with consensus-building, to valuing both short  and long-term thinking. As a result, we have created a balanced business model and strategy  that take maximum advantage of profit and investment across both core and new businesses. Lenovo has consistently outgrown the worldwide PC market in unit shipments and gained  market share across all geographies, products and customer segments, making it the fastest  growing of the four major PC companies in the world for two years running.  We are the number one PC company in China and now in Japan.  We are the number one PC company in the world for large business and the public sector.    We have been the fastest growing major consumer PC brand on the planet in the past year.    We make the fastest booting notebook in the world. Its a ThinkPad—and in 18 years, 60   million of them have been sold.    We make a smart phone in China and every day our app store there delivers more than   25,000 downloads.  We have launched a family of tablets targeting both the consumer and commercial    markets internationally.  We are growing in triple digits in the all-in-one market worldwide, funding an application   developers movement in China, and growing our retail presence from Germany to Japan. Lenovos business is built on product innovation, a highly efficient global supply chain and  strong strategic execution. The company develops, manufactures and markets reliable,   high-quality, secure and easy-to-use technology products and services for customers who   want technology that does more—because people have a lot more to do. Our product lines  include legendary Think-branded commercial PCs and Idea-branded consumer PCs, as  well as servers, workstations and a family of mobile internet devices, including tablets and   smart phones.  We have a long-term goal of becoming the leading personal technology company in the world.  We aspire to achieve this goal by leading in three key areas:  Personal Computers: Lead in PCs and be respected for our product innovation and quality.  Convergence: Lead the industry with an ecosystem of devices, services, applications    and content for people to seamlessly connect to people and Web content.  Culture: Become recognized as one of the best, most trusted and most well-respected       companies to work for and do business with. And we want to do it the right way—the Lenovo Way—with our own perspective, our own global  point of view and our own commitment to building technology for people who view technology  as a tool to accomplish great things. 14  Our Values At Lenovo we view our culture as a critical asset as important as an effective business model.  We call our culture the Lenovo Way, and at its most basic, that culture is reflected in the  statement: We do what we say and own what we do. Our values serve as the foundation of our company and define who we are and how we work.  Principal among them are:    Serving Customers   Trust and Integrity   Teamwork Across Cultures   Innovation and Entrepreneurial Spirit Our Heritage Lenovo came about as the result of the merger of two of the most storied companies in  technology and business: Legend Holdings in China and IBMs Personal Computing Division  in the United States. The merger was heralded as a watershed event in global business with  the potential for integrating two disparate cultures, languages, processes and markets. Our Commitment to Corporate Citizenship (CSR)  Lenovo is committed to being a responsible and active corporate citizen, consistently working  to improve its business while contributing to the betterment of our local communities, the  environment and society overall. Lenovo practices corporate citizenship in many ways:    Product quality and safety: Lenovo is focused on the safety of our products throughout    their entire lifecycle, from manufacturing, transportation and installation to use, service     and recycling or disposal.   Safe and healthy workplaces: Lenovo prides itself on creating a world-class    experience for its employees at facilities across the planet—from our headquarters     and sales offices to our R&D labs to the manufacturing floor. In addition to meeting     the legal requirements of the countries in which we do business, we ensure our     employees have safe equipment and facilities; are offered competitive compensation     packages; and are supported by stringent voluntary workplace safety standards.   The highest ethical standards: Lenovo is committed to the highest standards of    integrity and responsibility, including respecting and protecting intellectual property.      We provide guidance to every employee on a wide range of issues, including ethical     business practices, securities trading, health and safety, and compliance with legal    and regulatory requirements.   Concern for the environment: Lenovo is committed to environmental responsibility in    all aspects of its business, from product design and supplier selection to manufacturing,     facilities management, transportation and logistics and product lifecycle management,    including recycling and reuse.   Donating time and resources to philanthropy: Lenovo and its employees are  committed   to helping those less fortunate and, when disaster strikes, to lending a  helping hand to those    who are in difficult circumstances. In addition, Lenovo has committed 1% of its pre-tax    income to programs and initiatives that serve society to adress issues in  areas of great    need, no matter where those areas or issues happen to be. Innovation: A Core Value  Lenovo owns the greatest track record for innovation in the PC industry and remains  committed to innovation in its products and technology. We will continue to leverage the spirit  of innovation and history of technological breakthroughs into new product categories and  drive future growth. Innovation is how Lenovo achieves competitive differentiation and drives  new market opportunities, such as mobile Internet, digital home and cloud computing. Lenovo products consistently win awards and receive rave reviews. They deliver the high  quality, reliability and durability to meet our customers demand. The ultimate goal of Lenovos  R&D team is to improve the overall customer experience while driving down the cost   of ownership. Lenovo operates 46 world-class labs, including research centers in Yokohama, Japan; Beijing,  Shanghai and Shenzhen, China; and Morrisville, North Carolina, U.S. Lenovos innovation  strategy is based on a two-tiered approach to solving real-world customer problems:   Focus the majority of development on ideas that can be brought to market within 24 months.   Invest longer term in research targeting game changing big plays. The company is rich in talent, employing more than 3,000 engineers, researchers and  scientists. Lenovos R&D teams have introduced many industry firsts supported by a track  record of innovation—including more than 2,000 patents and more than 100 major design  awards. Acquisitions, collaboration with industry associations, and investments in research  and development even in down cycles enable us to stay ahead of market trends and deliver a  comprehensive portfolio of products. Lenovos global scale and emphasis on innovation also give us a degree of visibility regarding  the health and well-being of the communities and markets we serve. Through this we are better  able to innovate and deliver relevant solutions that address a number of key sustainability  measures addressed in this report from climate and energy to environmentally-conscious  products, education and employee voluntarism. As a result, Lenovo embodies unique market possibilities in combining the best of East and  West—joining North American and China-based technology players in the creation of a unified  global personal technology leader with growing market positions in developed and emerging  markets alike. Everyone at Lenovo takes great pride in our ability to attract top talent from diverse backgrounds,  representing a broad collection of nationalities and languages. We view our differences and  diversity as a source of strength in building a collaborative culture with one unified language  and vision: to build the worlds most exceptionally engineered personal technology products  and services. 15  In Percentage FY 2010/11 1.15 1.20 1.25 1.35 1.30 1.40 1.45 1.50 FY 2009/10 FY 2008/09 FY 2007/08 FY 2006/07  ThinkPad    ThinkPad Edge    ThinkCentre    ThinkStation    ThinkServer    ThinkVision    IdeaPad    IdeaCentre    Lenovo Essential  Lenovo Products Innovation Capacity Expressed as a Percentage of Sales Graphic Representation of Sales by Region 18% 46% 36% CHINA MATURE MARKET  EMERGING MARKET (ExCLUDING CHINA)  17 Acquisitions/Joint Ventures In January 2011, Lenovo announced an agreement to establish a strategic joint venture with  NEC Corporation (NEC).

See http://www.lenovo.com/ww/lenovo/investor_relations.html for more information.  Governance is the foundation of a sustainable company. Lenovo provides detailed information  about its governance structure, policies and performance on pages 30–54 of the Annual Report.  For quick reference, the following overview is provided:  The governing structure of Lenovo consists of the Board of Directors (the Board) led by  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Board and the Companys senior  management strive to attain and uphold a high standard of corporate governance and to maintain  sound and well-established corporate governance practices in the interest of shareholders and  other stakeholders.  The Company abides strictly by the governing laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where  it operates and observes the applicable guidelines and rules issued by regulatory authorities.  It regularly undertakes review on its corporate governance system to ensure it is in line with  international and local best practices.   Throughout the year, ended March 31, 2011, the Company has complied with the code  provisions of the Code on Corporate Governance Practices required for companies traded on  the Hong Kong Exchange. The Company has also adopted the Model Code set out in Appendix  10 of the Listing Rules and has implemented a company policy based on this Model Code to  govern securities transactions by directors and designated senior management of the Company.  Finally, to address potential conflicts of interest at the Board level, it is expressly provided  in the Companys Articles of Association that, unless otherwise permissible in the Articles of  Association, a director shall not vote on any resolution of the Board approving any contract or  arrangement or any other proposal in which he/she is materially interested. Board of Directors The Board is responsible for overseeing the overall strategy of the Company and directing and  supervising its affairs in a responsible and effective manner, while management is responsible for  the daily operations of the Company under the leadership of the CEO. The Board has formulated  a clear written policy that stipulates the circumstances under which the management should  report to and obtain prior approval from the Board before making decisions or entering into any  commitments on behalf of the Company.  As of May 26, 2011, there were eleven Board members consisting of one executive director, six  non-executive directors and four independent non-executive directors. The biographies and  responsibilities of directors and senior management are set out in the Annual Report, pages 62–65. The Company has established four Board Committees: the Audit Committee, Compensation  Committee, Strategy Committee and Governance Committee. Each Board Committee has  defined terms of reference, available upon written request to the Company Secretary. Further  detail on the duties and operation of these Board Committees is included in the Annual Report,  pages 32–35. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The positions of the Chairman of the Board and CEO at Lenovo have traditionally been held  by separate individuals. The Chairman leads the Board in the determination of its strategy and  in the achievement of its objectives whereas the CEO has delegated authority of the Board to  take direct charge of the Group on a day-to-day basis and is accountable to the Board for the  financial and operational performance of the Group. As of March 31, 2011, the posts of Chairman  and CEO were held by Mr. Liu Chuanzhi and Mr. Yang Yuanqing respectively. Aside from their  service to Lenovo, there is no relationship of any kind (including financial, business, family, other  material and relevant relationships) between the Chairman and the CEO. Investor Relations and Communication with Shareholders  The Company is committed to the safeguarding of shareholders interests. Shareholders  are provided sufficient notices of the Companys annual meetings and are encouraged  to attend and to actively participate in such meetings. All resolutions at the General  Meetings are conducted by way of poll voting. Results of the poll are published on the  Companys website (www.lenovo.com/hk/publication) and the HK Exchanges website  (www.hkex.com.hk).   Lenovo has also established an investor relations team to promote open, transparent, efficient  and consistent communications with shareholders, investors and equity analysts. The team  commits to proactively providing the investment community all necessary information, data and  services in a timely manner, in order to promote a solid understanding of the Companys strategy,  operations and new development. During the Fiscal Year 2010/11, the Company hosted a series  of analyst briefings, webcasts, conference calls and global investor roadshows, and the senior  management team presented its annual and quarterly earnings results in Hong Kong, New York,  Beijing and San Francisco.  Further information about Lenovos 2010 Annual General Meeting and Investor Relations  activities is available in the Annual Report at pages 44–45.  19  Lenovo has a well-earned industry reputation for delivering superior quality products. Lenovos  global Quality Management System, which has received ISO 9001 (International Organization  for Standardization) certification, ensures the continual delivery of design improvements into  Lenovos current and future products.  ISO 9001 is the international standard for achieving overall quality in business process  management. ISO 9001 requirements create the framework for conducting business in a manner  that enables companies to realize the highest caliber of workmanship and customer satisfaction.  This framework comprises the entire span of product and service delivery, from the purchase  of raw materials or components, contract review, quality control product inspection, design,  development, handling, delivery, employee training, and customer service and support. Lenovo  strongly embraces the ISO 9001 commitment to an effective quality management system, and is  dedicated to exceeding industry standards when it comes to detail, product quality and product  reliability. Building upon our companys heritage, Lenovo combines the talents of the innovation-driven  China Legend team and the quality heritage from the former IBM Personal Computing Division,  including some of the industrys top PC engineers to create a powerful global company focused  on exceptionally engineered products. Product managers are responsible for establishing  objectives and measuring results to drive continual improvement in quality and customer  satisfaction throughout the organization. Lenovos comprehensive product development process includes prototype development,  product testing and focus groups to ensure the company meets the diverse needs of our global  customers. For instance, Lenovo proactively seeks input on design and product features from  customers and partners. Prototypes are extensively evaluated, and final products undergo  rigorous testing to ensure that they meet stringent standards specific to their application and use  before they are cleared for shipment.  Lenovos Technical Evaluation Center provides information and recommendations to Lenovo  Engineering. Lenovos Lessons Learned feedback loop aids in refinement and the maturation of  our processes and elimination of recurring problems. As a result, Lenovos product repair action  rates are among the lowest in the industry. Lenovo leaders are responsible for establishing objectives and using measurements to drive  continual improvement in quality and customer satisfaction. All Lenovo employees are expected  to contribute to this continual improvement as an integral part of our quality management system. Lenovos corporate quality policy is available at: http://www.lenovo.com/quality Customer-Focused Testing Once the product development phase is completed and before production, Lenovo products  undergo a series of customer-driven tests. These include ongoing customer simulation  evaluations and customer simulation audits to evaluate product quality by removing systems from  the box and setting them up in typical customer configurations. In addition, extended customer  simulation tests are conducted on a sample basis with various configurations of product options  and software. This last evaluation simulates the performance of the product through various  standard customer applications. Lenovo has continued to enhance our customer-focused  program by sending technical teams to support installations at customers premises.  During and after the installation, there is ongoing dialogue between the customer and Lenovo.  This provides timely feedback on installation progress, allows corrective actions to be rapidly  implemented and pre-empts potential issues. This has proven to be highly advantageous  during new product release as issues can be promptly addressed to minimize the impact on   all customers. 21  Lenovo is committed to ensuring that our products are safe throughout their lifecycle, including  manufacturing, transportation, installation, use, service and disposal. Corporate strategies,  policies and guidelines have been designed to support this commitment to product safety. Each  employee bears a personal responsibility to advance the following objectives:  Meet all applicable legal requirements and voluntary safety and ergonomics practices to which    Lenovo subscribes wherever we sell products.  Select suppliers that demonstrate a similar commitment to safety and provide customers with    adequate information to enable them to safely use Lenovos products.  Foster employee involvement and provide appropriate resources to develop and implement    successful product safety initiatives.  Continually improve product safety initiatives.  Investigate product safety incidents and take prompt remedial actions to protect Lenovos    customers and employees.  Periodically report on safety initiatives and incidents to senior executive management.

Hardware Safety Assessment Requirements at Lifecycle Points 22  As a global company with a rich heritage of Eastern and Western cultures, Remove valuing  and respecting diversity is instrumental to Lenovos success. By leveraging the diversity of our  workforce, Lenovo is able to exceed market expectations, attract and retain top talent and create  a workplace where employees achieve their greatest potential.  Lenovo bases our corporate policies on four key company values: customer service, innovative  and entrepreneurial spirit, teamwork across cultures and trustworthiness and integrity. Lenovos  diversity policy is also grounded in these core values, seeking to drive innovation and creativity  at Lenovo by leveraging both the similarities and differences of our diverse, talented and global  workforce to support strong business performance.  Diversity Commitment Lenovo values the strength of our global workforce and recognizes that by bringing together  employees with different perspectives and experiences, we spark innovation and better decision  making, which contribute to our long-term success.

Marketplace and Supplier Diversity Lenovo also strives to promote diversity in the companies we choose to partner with as  subcontractors. Lenovo is continuing to refine our U.S. marketplace and supplier diversity  strategy, which will focus on three key goals: increasing access to diverse talent, increasing  access to a diverse supplier base and supporting entrepreneurship in local communities. Lenovo is a key sponsor of the Girls in Engineering Program and the Global Marathon, which  provide education and awareness to encourage girls to consider careers in engineering and  technical fields. Diverse Business Relationships Lenovo is committed to promoting diversity in our business relationships, including fostering  the utilization and development of minority, women and other small business concerns for the  procurement of products and services. Lenovos corporate strategies, policies and guidelines  are aligned to support this commitment to diverse business relationships. advice and where to obtain it. All Lenovo employees are required to comply with the  Code, which is available in seven languages and is accessible on our website at  http://www.lenovo.com/social_responsibility/us/en/2011_Lenovo_CodeofBusinessConduct_EN.pdf Furthermore, in keeping with best practices, Lenovo has developed and implemented an Anti- Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy which reinforces the message in the Code of Conduct and  provides additional specific guidance regarding compliance with rules and laws related to bribery  and corruption. Employees are further required to participate in regular training to reinforce the companys  commitment to compliance and to conducting business with integrity. In addition, all new  employees receive training and information about our ethics and compliance program upon start  of employment. Additional information about the companys commitment to conducting business  with integrity is provided through the companys intranet and other periodic communications. Lenovo provides formal, confidential ways to report when potential violations of law, company  policy or the Code of Conduct occur. These include postal mail, e-mail and our LenovoLine,  which is a confidential reporting system accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week by secure  website or toll-free telephone with translators available. Where allowed by law, employees may  report concerns about business practices anonymously if they choose, which is designed to  encourage reporting and protect against fear of retaliation. The LenovoLine and other resources  are also available to help counsel employees who may have questions or concerns. Lenovo  regards any suspected violation of law, policy or the Code as a serious matter and is committed  to follow up on all reported concerns, which are addressed and tracked to resolution. Lenovo also provides a detailed description of its Internal Controls and Internal Audit function,  including risk assessment, risk management and compliance, on pages 42–44 of its 2010/11  Annual Report. Lenovo has a chief ethics and compliance officer who manages the companys global ethics and  compliance program. Lenovos Ethics and Compliance Office oversees ethics and compliance  across the organization, working in partnership with our business units to see that we achieve  our business goals while meeting the letter and spirit of the legal and regulatory framework in  which we operate. Our Ethics and Compliance Office plays a critical role in providing employees  with the resources and information they need to make the right choices and decisions. With these  systems in place, we describe clear expectations for employees and hold them accountable for  their behavior. To make sure employees understand the companys expectations, we established a Code of  Conduct in 2009 that applies to all employees worldwide and which is an integral part of our  ethics and compliance program. The Code demonstrates Lenovos commitment to  a culture of uncompromising integrity and helps employees determine when to seek  Lenovo employees support  blood drives Lenovo Morrisville together with Rex Blood  Services sponsors blood drives throughout  the year. During FY 2010/11, 351 Lenovo  employees donated 309 pints of blood,  which will save as many as 960 lives. 25  Fostering a safe and healthy working environment for Lenovo employees located in more than  60 countries is essential to our core values and our ability to attract, retain and motivate the   best talent. Lenovo is committed to creating and maintaining a workplace that provides for optimal employee  health and safety. This commitment is reflected in Lenovos corporate health and safety policy,  which focuses on creating and maintaining a workplace that provides for the health and  safety of all employees and reinforces the importance at every location in which the company   does business.  Full support of employee health and safety through education, prevention and controls is vital  to our innovation, productivity and continual improvement. Every employee and contractor of  Lenovo must follow this policy and report any safety and health concerns to Lenovo management.  Health and Safety Performance There were no significant accidents involving Lenovo employees, fires that resulted in property  damage or regulatory violations at any of our locations in which we do business.   Standardizing Lenovos Global Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) organization across the  companys operations has helped establish world-class standards and procedures to ensure  employee workplace safety and prevent work-related injuries and illnesses. Lenovo is OHSAS  18001 certified from Bureau Veritas, a leading independent certification body, at all global  manufacturing locations.   The OHS team conducts rigorous corporate, internal audits and self-assessments to ensure  compliance while continually driving processes and program improvements. We monitor injuries  and accidents and perform investigations to prevent reoccurrence.   For 2010, Lenovos manufacturing incident rates were well below comparable industry averages.  Specifically, the total incident rate was 0.41 and lost time rate was 2.06. Acquired companies  may gather and report data in a different manner relative to the sector standard. As part of  Lenovos OHSAS 18001 change management process, OHS is proactively involved in business  integration efforts to ensure consistent implementation across all global manufacturing locations.  This would include performance metrics such as incident rates.  Training Global manufacturing employees receive mandatory safety training and are required to follow  all Lenovo safety and health requirements. At all manufacturing and select field locations, safety  committee-type programs have been established. The goal of these committees is to provide  a mechanism for employees to bring forward potential safety concerns and participate in the  necessary corrective action.  Lenovo voluntarily conducted Radiation Awareness training to global manufacturing employees  following the 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that occurred in Japan on March 11, 2011, as a  result of cooling failure at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. In addition, Lenovo  conducted radiation measurement testing at our internal manufacturing facilities and at major  ODMCM locations. This process is to both ensure that our global manufacturing employees  are educated on radiation awareness safety and provide information for any potential customer  inquiries regarding our products. With over 23,000 units tested, there were no recorded levels of  contamination in our manufacturing facilities or shipped products.  At our field locations Lenovo offers safety training, such as Emergency Evacuation, Office Safety  and Ergonomics training and has developed a comprehensive global internal website and  tools to assist employees in assessing their work environment. One of the tools is a dedicated  AskOHS e-mail account available to all employees that enables them to obtain safety and  health direction and support.  Employee Wellness Informational resources are made available to assist employees on various wellness matters and  disease prevention. Health and safety information/requirements are available and shared with  non-Lenovo employees on a needs basis. In support of business continuity planning, Lenovo has  developed and activated comprehensive pandemic plans and procedures to limit the potential  impact of health-related concerns, such as the H1N1 virus.    Additionally, the company engages in a number of comprehensive wellness initiatives, and  provides employee assistance programs and medical consulting services to promote overall  employee health. For instance, medical screening services offered in a number of China locations,  eye care services offered in Pondicherry, India and a PowerUp Fitness Center available to U.S. –  Morrisville, NC employees are just a few examples to motivate employees to engage in a health  and fitness lifestyle. Examples of other employee health promotion offerings include health risk  assessments, influenza immunization clinics and a wellness program that rewards employees for  engaging in healthy behaviors and activities.  We are proud that a number of local, national and best in class awards have recognized Lenovo  in consecutive years dating back to 2005 at our China and North America facilities for wellness  programs and low work-related injury and illness rates by government agencies. Lenovos Shenzhen (LIPC), China facility was recognized with its sixth consecutive Safety  Outstanding Contribution award from the FuTian District Safety Government Committee for  2010. This award is noteworthy because Lenovo was one of only 57 recognized companies and  institutions out of over 5,000 submissions to the government as a responsible corporate citizen,  actively taking care of employees and the community.  The United States Fulfillment Center (USFC), in Whitsett, North Carolina was recognized by  the North Carolina Department of Labor with their third consecutive annual Gold Award while  the Morrisville, North Carolina headquarters location was recognized with its sixth consecutive  Gold Award for accident prevention in 2010. In addition, both the USFC and Monterrey, Mexico  locations received the Highly Protected Risk award from Factory Mutual Global Commercial  Insurance Company by following FM Global property loss prevention programs such as fire  protection system testing and emergency planning.    26  Lenovo is committed to protecting human rights. We are a signatory to the United Nations  Global Compact, which is a public-private strategic policy initiative for businesses committed to  aligning operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human  rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. As a signatory, we support and respect the  protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and ensure that our business practices are  not complicit in human rights abuses.  Human Rights in the Supply Chain Lenovo is also a member of the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and is  an adherent to the EICC Code of Conduct internally and for our supply chain. The Code  safeguards the working and environmental conditions, which include the area of human rights,  of our employees and suppliers. To that end, Lenovo has established strong EICC-compliant  operations and tracks independent third-party EICC audits. The EICC Code of Conduct  provides guidance in five critical areas including: Labor, Health & Safety, Environment, Ethics  and Management Systems. Specifically, Lenovo executes EICC efforts with over 99 percent of our procurement spend, and  100 percent of these targeted suppliers have agreed to comply with the EICC. This includes  tracking suppliers for annual self-assessments using EICC-approved providers and tools,   bi-annual third-party audits, audit reports and tracking of action items. In addition to conducting supplier education and training on EICC code/compliance, Lenovo  has partnered with the EICC on supplier training events relating to topics such as supply  chain capability building, material extraction, working hours, EICC eLearning modules, carbon  reporting and energy efficiency. Lenovo has partnered with the EICC and member companies on supplier training events in  China to increase awareness and assist China-based suppliers to understand and conform to  the EICC Code of Conduct.  Lenovo participates in the EICC validated audit program and requests suppliers to conduct  EICC audits on their facilities. Corrective action plans are put in place and tracked to closure for  any non-conforming areas. Also, Lenovo has strengthened its supplier performance process to  reward and/or penalize performance as it relates to sustainability efforts. Conflict Minerals  Lenovos strategy and performance on this issue is discussed in the Global Supply Chain section  of this report (section 4.2). Personal Educational Development Lenovo University is the companys personal educational development initiative designed to  give employees the opportunity to acquire core competencies and skills needed for the future,  while helping Lenovo retain a competitive global work force. With a growing list of innovative  educational offerings, Lenovo University offers various programs ranging from online training to  individual development planning.  Most recently Lenovo has implemented Learning@Lenovo, a suite of new employee development  initiatives that reaches executives, people managers and individual contributors through three  global programs (Leading@Lenovo, Managing@Lenovo and Contributing@Lenovo). All Lenovo employees receive ongoing training in areas such as culture, compliance, information  security and performance management during the year. One hundred percent of employees  receive performance and career reviews at least annually.  Mentoring Lenovo also supports an active mentoring program. Mentoring relationships are an excellent way  to grow an employees skills and knowledge in order to develop his or her full potential. Mentees  and mentors both gain from participation in a mentoring relationship. Mentees can increase  their understanding in the targeted subject area, and mentors can sharpen their leadership and  coaching skills. To aid employees in the mentoring process, Lenovo provides an online book, A  Guide for Mentoring at Lenovo.  Lenovo welcomes new employees with the Lenovo New Employee Orientation Program, which  helps educate new employees on a wide variety of topics, including Lenovos history, culture,  business practices and policies as well as all of the tools and resources available to employees. Lenovo encourages cross-cultural development by means of diverse experiences. Development  is strengthened by increased frequency and quality of the career development discussions that  employees have with their managers. The new program Managing@Lenovo has a particular  focus on improving career development discussions. The primary source of career development  support comes from an employees immediate manager. As managers learn to better support their employees career development aspirations, they will  be guided to help employees understand that career development happens not only in moving  up the hierarchy, but also by moving laterally and improving growth and mastery within ones  current role as well. We also encourage employees to take ownership of their careers and utilize  the strategy of a mix of diverse experiences, relationship building and educational components  to aid in further development. Lenovo employees volunteered more than  280 hours in support of Habitat for Humanity  in the local Morrisville, NC area. Habitat for  Humanity  is  an  international  nonprofit  organization devoted to building simple,  decentand affordable housing. Homes are built  using volunteer labor and are sold at no profit. 27  Lenovo recognizes the importance that employees and their families place on a comprehensive  benefits package. To ensure that Lenovo can attract and retain high-quality talent in the  competitive technology marketplace, a variety of benefits are offered that are designed to aid in  managing and protecting the physical and financial well-being of employees and their families.  Benefit packages are designed to follow these strategic guidelines:  To position Lenovo competitively within the local marketplace.  To align with and support Lenovo business and cultural strategy.   To be differentiated through Lenovos commitment to wellness. To achieve these goals, Lenovo must be flexible and consider varying customs, practices,  legal requirements and employee expectations around the world to design impactful   benefits programs.   Health Benefits Private health benefits are offered in many countries to supplement government-provided  health care. These arrangements often permit employees to provide coverage for dependents,  including spouses, domestic partners, children or other family members. Employees may share  in the cost of these benefits, especially when coverage for dependents is available. However,  Lenovo shoulders the majority of these costs as an investment in the well-being of employees. Wellness is a critical component of Lenovos benefits programs. Lenovo believes that a  successful wellness program can result in benefits that go way beyond the financial measure  of reduced medical costs, with more productive employees and less absenteeism most notable  among them. Live Well with Lenovo, the Lenovo wellness brand, will be re-launched in 2012  as Lenovo begins a strategic partnership with a new vendor to introduce a redesigned and  comprehensive wellness and incentive program in the U.S. Components of the U.S. program  will include a health risk assessment, health coaching, expanded nutrition and fitness online  tools, wellness seminars and other educational content, an incentive program designed to foster  participation in the programs, and a free employee membership in Lenovos PowerUp Fitness  facility located at the Morrisville, North Carolina campus. Outside the U.S., Lenovo currently  offers a variety of wellness programs, including fitness facility discounts, health coaching, stress  and lifestyle management programs, and access to health educational material. Lenovos   long-term wellness goals include the expansion of its wellness brand and related programs  globally under one comprehensive umbrella, where appropriate. Income Protection In the event that an employee is unable to work due to illness or injury, Lenovo provides for  protection of income in many countries. These benefits may take the form of salary continuation  for a period of time and generally supplement government-provided benefits. For longer periods  of illness or injury, Lenovo commonly provides additional disability benefits.  Retirement or Post-Employment Savings To supplement the income of employees and survivors after retirement or separation from  Lenovo, a variety of savings programs are offered. These programs may be mandatory or  voluntary, depending on legal and marketplace considerations. It is quite common for programs  to have both an employee and employer contribution component, with the latter signifying  Lenovos willingness to make a current investment to provide future security for employees  and their families. It should be noted that even during volatile economic times and company  performance, Lenovo did not reduce its contribution levels to employee retirement programs.   Lenovo is a leading member of InterElles, a woman-focused network created 10 years ago  by large technology companies Air Liquide, AREVA, CEA, EDF, Orange, GE, IBM France,  Schlumberger and Thales. The groups objective is to share best practices to ensure  diversity within teams in the technology environment and facilitate the hiring and retention  of female talent. Lenovo contributed to the annual conference on March 8th, 2011, which  was attended by 600 people. Lenovo will  lead the organizations next conference.  InterElles is a French initiative that is part  of the WILL global activities. Lenovo Japan is focused on how Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can  play a role in innovative approaches to education, environmental affairs and entrepreneurship.  In 2010 Lenovo Japan announced the U.dream project directed toward schools. Among the  many projects U.dream has been involved with during the year, one of the most notable  has been the Innovative Schools Project. This project works collaboratively with Microsoft  to drive and promote the use of ICT in  innovative curriculums for next generation  educational methods. Lenovo donated 60  ThinkPad X220 Tablets to the University of  Tokyo and also 40 tablets to a public high  school in Toshima Ward. 28   We believe that our employees are the most valuable strategic resource at Lenovo. We  recognize the importance of each unique individual and their need to be recognized frequently  and rewarded fairly. A fully engaged workforce is the key to our differentiation and exceptional  business performance. Lenovo believes, and invests heavily, in the concept of Total Rewards  which consists of five key elements: compensation, benefits, work-life, performance and  recognition, and development and career opportunities. We believe that, collectively, these five  elements are critical to attract, motivate and retain our most valuable strategic resource. Lenovos culture is to tie pay to performance. We believe that exceptional individual performance  will support and drive exceptional business performance, which will result in exceptional pay  for individuals. All Key Performance Indicators throughout the organization are linked to a  business strategy. In terms of our pay practices, we carefully monitor and evaluate market trends in each of our  geographic locations to ensure that we remain competitive. Our culture allows us to react quickly  when we see trends changing. In addition to maintaining a competitive wage, we have a comprehensive and globally consistent  performance management and bonus program that we call the P3 Bonus Program. P3 stands  for Priorities, Performance and Pay and is closely aligned to what we call The Lenovo Way. The  Lenovo Way contains two key elements: delivering on our commitments and taking ownership  in everything we do.   Reward and recognition are very important at Lenovo, so much so that we also encourage every  business unit leader to develop supplemental programs, based on broad global guidelines, which  reinforce frequent and continuous recognition of successful collaborative efforts and exceptional  performance within their organizations. Privacy Lenovo is committed to protecting the personal data of our employees, customers, resellers  and others. Corporate strategies, policies and guidelines support this commitment to protect  personal information. Managers and employees are responsible for fulfilling the following  general principles for collecting, using, disclosing, storing, accessing, transferring or otherwise  processing personal information.

Work Environment Lenovo is committed to providing a work environment free from harassment, including harassment  based on race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, national origin, ethnicity,  sexual orientation, sex, age, disability, veteran status or any other characteristic protected by law.   Click here to see Lenovos Employee Health and Safety Policy. Employee Complaint Process Lenovo provides guidance to its employees regarding how to raise questions or concerns about  any aspect of their work at Lenovo, and has established clear processes to support these  reporting channels. This guidance is communicated in several ways, including through Lenovos  Code of Conduct and the Diversity and Non-Discrimination Policy.  Click here to see Lenovos Commitment to Diversity and Nondiscrimination. Employees are directed to report to their managers, Human Resources, the Ethics and  Compliance Office, or the local Lenovo Legal Department any information pertaining to:    Fraud by or against Lenovo    Unethical business conduct    A violation of legal or regulatory requirements    Substantial and specific danger to health and safety    A violation of Lenovos corporate policies and guidelines, in particular its Code of Conduct Lenovo has a clear nonretaliation policy, and will not tolerate harassment, retaliation,  discrimination or other adverse action against an employee who:    Makes an internal report in good faith    Provides information or assists in an investigation regarding such a report; or     Files, testifies or participates in a legal or administrative proceeding related to such matters Managers are required to report and help resolve any suspected violation of the nonretaliation  policy. Complaints of alleged retaliation will be promptly addressed and investigated. Reports of inappropriate behavior, policy violations or alleged retaliation will, to the extent  permitted by law and consistent with an effective investigation, be kept anonymous   and confidential. 29  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been a key component of the assessment process  since 2007.  Focus areas for the year were in the key areas of logistics, GSC site operations, packaging,  production supplier engagement and procurement. Details on each area are provided below. 1. Logistics Lenovo continued its membership in SmartWay, a voluntary partnership with the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA). Through this partnership, Lenovo continues to measure and improve our  Canada and U.S. shipping efficiency. The lessons learned through SmartWay also transfer to other  parts of our global operations. In addition, the Global Logistics team has continued to drive from  higher-carbon air shipments to more environmentally friendly ocean shipments. In FY 2009/10,  Lenovo improved its notebook ocean shipments by 18 percent. Finally, the Logistics team completed  a risk assessment of its China shipping suppliers for EICC compliance. 2. GSC Site Operations Lenovo conducts regular Occupational Health, Safety and Environmental assessments at  our major contract manufacturing locations to ensure high levels of compliance and social  responsibility. As part of these reviews we also assess the effectiveness of our suppliers  management systems.   3. Packaging This year Lenovo started a pilot run for a new lightweight pallet. The pilot run is ongoing with  an estimated savings of approximately 1,000 tons of wood per year. This materials replacement  initiative started in January 2011 and is estimated to achieve significant cost savings per unit while  achieving energy, climate and materials resource load reduction objectives. 4. Production Supplier Engagement  Lenovo completed third-party EICC    audits at six manufacturing facilities     in China, Mexico and India. Results of    these audits were considered strong     by the third-party auditors along with     prompt corrective measures  provided     for items identified during the audits.   To ensure continuous improvement,    Lenovo  is  currently  conducting     ongoing EICC validation audits of     these facilities on a periodic basis.   Lenovos Occupational Health and Safety organization is in the process of pursuing EICC    auditor certification to further align with its current ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 auditor     certifications and internal audit process. All manufacturing operations are in compliance     with the latest international environmental, health and safety standards. 5. Procurement Lenovo Global Procurement is responsible for buying products such as computer parts and  services. Lenovo strives to balance cost, quality, technology and innovation to provide the  greatest value to our customers. The chief procurement officer has mandated the highest  levels of ethical standards through our formally stated core values, principles and practices   (http://www.lenovo.com/global_procurement/us/en/index.html).  Current Procurement Activity  Procurement sustainability efforts covered approximately 99 percent of our procurement    spend and all high-risk areas.   Currently 100 percent of these suppliers have executed formal agreements to comply with    the EICC, 97 percent have conducted self-assessments on time and 76 percent have     conducted audits on time.     Procurement has conducted over the past two years 12 training events, several jointly    with the EICC on Awareness, E-Tasc, Audit and other topics covering hundreds of suppliers.     Audit findings are mostly occurring in Labor and Health & Safety areas with fewest findings     in the Environmental area.  In FY 2010/11 we tested our program semi-annually to ensure that we were achieving our    internally stated targets. Compliance testing results and any corrective actions are     summarized and communicated to the chief procurement officer. China Health Management Program Wins Award One of Lenovos key manufacturing sites has been honored  for the outstanding health programs it runs for employees. The  Occupational Health and Safety organization at the Lenovo  Shenzhen (LIPC) site won the International Corporate Health  Management Excellence Performance Award. This award was given at the 2010 Shanghai Expo Enterprise  Health Management Summit Forum, an event organized by the  Chinese Medical Doctor Association and Health Maintenance  Organization (CMDA-HMO). The event was held in Shanghai  on June 17, 2010. Lenovo was honored for its wide- ranging wellness programs, the health/medical consulting  services offered employees, preventive-medical programs such as flu vaccinations, and   well-organized emergency plans. This award for LIPC comes after winning local awards for  three consecutive years from the local health management department in Shenzhen. The Forum honored more than 20 enterprises with the award. Among the other organizations  honored were GE China, Motorola China, Abbott China and Huawei. 31 Key EICC Focus Areas: Lenovo is participating in new  and on-going EICC projects. Lenovo has conducted EICC  Carbon Reporting programs to use a standard approach  to measuring, reporting and reducing carbon emissions in  the global electronics supply chain–http://www.eicc.info/ CarbonReportingSystem.shtml. We also are involved with  growing focus with EICC Minerals Extraction programs to  trace, audit and certify the supply chain with respect to  conflict materials–http://www.eicc.info/initiatives02.shtml  We continue to promote supplier diversity programs through annual strategies, procurement  buyer training and community outreach. Each year we set goals to increase the amount of  our diverse supplier business including small business, women-owned business, minority  owned business and other diverse segments. We train our procurement buyers annually to  ensure continual focus, to provide tools to locate diverse suppliers and to drive identification of  opportunities at sub-category levels.

Lenovo     employees helped distribute an additional 250     computers to children of U.S. military service    men and women who met Kramdens program     criteria.   Lenovo employees at the Morrisville, North Carolina location collected almost 4,000    pounds of nonperishable food items in FY 2010/11 to benefit the Food Bank of Eastern     and Central North Carolina, and also donated over 1,370 employee volunteer hours to     support various community service projects. Europe and Africa  Lenovo Western Europes partnership with PlaNet Finance aims at selecting    innovative projects from young entrepreneurs in France and Europe, promoting     micro financing in business environments, and optimizing technical and financial     support coming from diverse populations and emerging markets. Global Disaster Assistance 35   Lenovo supports South Africas Black Economic Empowerment (BEE). This program   was launched by the South African government to open and grow the market and     assist previously disadvantaged groups in participating in this growth. The intent of BEE is     to govern business operations in which all suppliers are treated equally while trading.  In December 2010 Lenovo, partnering with the International Microfinance Award Ceremony  2010 organised by PlaNet Finance at the Louvre Museum in Paris, awarded Madame Faida  Bakaji Tshuma with the PlaNet Finance Education Award 2010.   Click here for more details about PlaNet Finance.   Education Award, Sponsored by Lenovo   Faida is a 29-year-old refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo living in    Israel. Her great ambition was to run her own day care center where she could     provide learning and play activities for children and, most of all, enable them to be     part of Israeli society when they reach adulthood. Her dream came true following the    training she received under the PlaNet Finance-supported Microfy program. This     meant that Faida was able to gain the skills needed for running a childrens day care     center and in August 2009 she started accepting children, mainly from refugee     families. A loan of EUR 525 enabled the day care center to grow and it now caters to 30     youngsters—and all the childrens mothers are delighted by the quality of the     education. Most of the children originate from Africa and are learning English, French and     Hebrew, thus boosting their chances of integrating successfully into Israeli society.     Thanks to the centers success, Faida has been able to leave the two-room apartment     that she shared with her sister, brother-in-law and their two sets of young twin girls     and move into a flat. 36  Lenovos long-term, comprehensive approach to environmental management encompasses  everything from site operations to product design to recycling.

CELP (China Environmental Labeling Program)   Many Lenovo products are certified by CELP, an initiative assessing electronic products in     relation to environmental criteria such as reduction/elimination of environmentally sensitive     materials, product longevity/life extension, high energy efficiency/energy conservation,     end-of-life management, etc.    VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association)    Lenovo is leading the industry and is actively involved in the development of energy-efficient    interface standards for monitors (mercury-free, low halogen).    IPC (Association Connecting Electronics Industries)    Lenovo supports IPC industry association programs for printed circuit board and electronics     manufacturing service companies, their customers and suppliers.    iNEMI (International Electronics Manufacturing Initiative)   Lenovo follows efforts to develop industry-standard approaches to BFR/PVC phase out—    the trend toward low-halogen materials in electronics products. Lenovo is a member of     the iNEMI Environmental Leadership Sub-Committee.    ITI (Information Technology Industry Council)   Lenovo has a board-level position on the ITI Environmental Leadership Council which     provides guidance on key environmental issues, including recycling,energy materials     and green procurement.  The North Carolina adopt-a-highway program is aimed at keeping North Carolina clean  and green, as well as reducing the cost associated with maintaining the states roadways.  Last year the United States Fulfillment Center (USFC) in Whitsett, NC adopted a 2.1 mile  stretch of Rock Creek Parkway located adjacent to the facility. As a part of the program,  volunteers from the USFC meet quarterly during non-working hours to pick up litter and  recycling along the roadway. We are proud to be part of this program and hope it has not  only improved the area we maintain, but has also helped our employees think twice about  littering and develop a better appreciation for the environment as a whole. ADOPT-A-HIGHWAY 42  To support Lenovos emissions reduction commitments where actual energy reductions are not  technically or economically feasible, Lenovo has partnered with NextEra Energy Resources  to carbon balance a portion of our electricity and steam usage by purchasing Green-e Certified  Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) through the companys innovative EarthEra program.  Lenovo initially committed to purchasing over 10 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year  for three years. This will help avoid over 15,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over those three  years. In addition, 100 percent of the proceeds from Lenovos purchase of RECs will be directed  to the EarthEra Renewable Energy Trust and used by NextEra Energy Resources to build new  renewable energy facilities in the United States.  Click here to view the certificates for RECs retired by Lenovo to date or visit  http://www.lenovo.com/climate Lenovo also has chosen to offset part of the direct emissions associated with the operation of  owned vehicles and fuels we burn on site. Therefore, Lenovo purchased 3,000 wind carbon  offsets from NextEra Energy Resources Capricorn Ridge Wind Energy Center project in Texas,  USA. This will help avoid 3,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Lenovo has committed to purchase  the same amount for FY 2011/12. Lenovo manages the environmental elements of its operations through a global Environmental  Management System (EMS) which is ISO 14001 certified and covers Lenovos global manufacturing,  research, product design and development activities for personal computers, servers, and digital  and peripheral products. In FY 2010/11, Lenovos newly formed Mobile Internet and Digital Home  Business Group (MIDH) division was not included in the scope of our product EMS. All of Lenovos  manufacturing and development facilities are included in the global EMS registration which is  issued by Bureau Veritas. Additionally, all Lenovo China manufacturing and R&D sites are covered  by an ISO 14001 registration with the China Electronics Standardization Institute.

GREEN PROGRAMS Many Lenovo products meet the requirements of the   following environmental programs:   UL Environments Sustainable Products Certification: In early    2011 Lenovo became the first computer manufacturer to obtain UL     Environments Sustainable Products Certification to the Gold level     for the IEEE 1680.1 standard. As part of this certification, products     undergo rigorous in-house testing at Underwriters Laboratories to the     IEEE 1680.1 standard, including criteria such as energy efficiency,     design for recycling and materials usage. Since obtaining this     industry first, Lenovo has gone on to certify with ULE several     additional models of ThinkPad laptops as well as Lenovos full lineup of     ThinkVision monitors.  Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT):    Created by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the     nonprofit Greener Electronics Council, EPEAT rates computers and    monitors based on 51 criteria over eight categories that cover toxics     reduction, recycled content, energy efficiency, ease of recycling,     product longevity, company environmental performance, product     takeback and recycling programs and packaging. Computers and     monitors are awarded a rating of Bronze, Silver or Gold based on     their performance. Gold-rated computers meet all required criteria     plus at least 75 percent of the optional criteria that apply to the     product type being registered.  ENERGY STAR: ENERGY STAR is a joint program between the U.S.    Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy    conceived to promote energy efficiency and reduced Greenhouse Gas    emissions in hardware of all kinds. Products meeting certain    standards earn an ENERGY STAR label. Such labeling identifies    and promotes energy-efficient products and helps customers decide     what to buy to lower electricity costs.   TCO certified ensures that all products come with an ergonomic    design, deliver high performance, are low on energy consumption     and meet the toughest environmental requirements including use of     recycled content and limits on hazardous materials.  GREENGUARD certificates are awarded by the GREENGUARD   Environmental Institute (GEI) for contribution toward improving public   health and quality of life through improvement of indoor air.    Performance-based standards are incorporated in the selection     criteria for products with low chemical and particle emissions.  Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive: The    directive electronic equipment, commonly referred to as the     Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS), was     adopted by the European Union in February 2003. This directive     restricts the use of six hazardous materials in the manufacture of     various types of electronic and electrical equipment. 44  Geography Location Primary Function ISO 14001   Certificate China Beijing Manufacturing 3 China Beijing Research and Development 1 China Huiyang Manufacturing 1 China Shanghai Manufacturing 2 China Shanghai Zhangjiang Research and Development 1 China Shenzhen Manufacturing 1 China Shenzhen Research and Development 1 India Pondicherry Manufacturing 1 Japan Yokohama Research and Development 1 Mexico Monterrey Manufacturing 1 U.S. Morrisville, North Carolina Research and Development 1 U.S. Whitsett, North Carolina Light Manufacturing/Fulfillment 1 Within the framework of our EMS Lenovo annually identifies and evaluates those aspects of  our operations that have actual or potential significant impacts on the environment. Metrics and  controls are established for these significant environmental aspects. Performance relative to  these metrics is tracked and reported on a quarterly basis. Performance improvement targets  are established for select environmental aspects annually, taking into consideration performance  relative to the environmental metrics, the Environmental Policy, regulatory requirements, customer  requirements, stakeholder input, environmental and financial impact and management directives. During FY 2010/11 our significant global environmental aspects included:  Product materials – including use of recycled plastics and environmentally preferable materials,  Product packaging,  Product energy use and associated Greenhouse Gas emissions,  Site energy consumption, and  Waste management. PAPER AND PLASTIC  REDUCTION Lenovo is committed to changing the way people  around the world use technology. During FY  2010/11, a global Lenovo project team, including  representatives  from  Manufacturing,  Legal,  Service and Support, Regulatory Compliance,  User Experience, and Product Safety collaborated  to reduce the amount of paper and plastic shipped  with our products by over 4 million pounds per two  year. The team created an innovative process to  deliver special bid products to large enterprise  customers with a two page flyer instead of the  full set of hard copy publications and the plastic  bag that had been required to hold them. A soft  copy of all product publications is included with the  products software preload. Customers can also  access product publications electronically via the  Internet. This new publication strategy eliminates over 12  million pounds of Greenhouse Gases from entering  the atmosphere every year.  Additional projects are  underway to further reduce our carbon footprint.

This includes compliance with regulatory requirements as well as other requirements to which  Lenovo subscribes in support of managing and minimizing the environmental impact of our  operations and our products. These other requirements include commitments such as:  Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (as a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship   Coalition EICC)  International Standard ISO 14001:2004, Environmental Management Systems  ECMA-370 – The Eco Declaration Standard  Rechargeable Battery Recycling Corporation (RBRC)  Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT)  U.S. EPAs ENERGY STAR Program  International Electronics Manufacturers Initiative We verify compliance with regular, periodic internal and third-party audits of our facilities  and operations.Lenovo received no notices of violation nor incurred any known breaches of  regulatory requirements during FY2010/11.   These controls included actions such as signage and employee education, adjustments in     hours of operation for lighting and air conditioning, seasonal adjustments in operating hours,    requiring use of energy saver modes on personal computers, replacing CRT with LCD     monitors, implementing the use of energy-efficient light bulbs, purchasing wind generated    electricity, increasing use of video and telephone conferencing and instituting energy patrols    to turn off unneeded lights.  Engineering controls were implemented at Morrisville, Buenos Aires, Campinas, Sao Paulo,   Hook, Paisley, Paris, Oslo, Prague, Bangalore, Sydney, Wellington, Huiyang, Shenzhen,    Shanghai and Beijing. These controls included projects such as installation of energy-efficient    lighting, motors and air conditioning systems, installation and use of building management    systems, changing to more energy-efficient equipment in data centers, installation of solar    lighting, installation of timers and motion sensors to control lighting, installation of LED lighting    and initiation of linked elevator motion technology. While Lenovo has taken many actions to reduce GHG emissions, data is not currently available  on the specific impacts of individual projects.  Improving energy efficiency is a fundamental element of Lenovos strategy to meet its GHG  reduction targets. Projects to reduce energy consumption initiated during FY 2009/10 continued  during FY 2010/11. Throughout the organization these activities are driven by site energy  champions who lead energy teams that help to drive energy reduction projects.   During FY 2009/10 and FY 2010/11 Lenovo implemented over 40 energy efficiency projects at  sites around the world. These projects contributed to a near 20 percent reduction in electricity  consumption over this time period. These activities included:   Administrative controls were implemented in Mexico City, Monterrey, Caracas, Bogot,   Morrisville, Whitsett, Buenos Aires, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Hook, Paisley, Lima, Dublin,    Zagreb, Paris, Oslo, Copenhagen, Bratislava, Pondicherry, Bangalore, Singapore, Kuala    Lumpur, Sydney, Melbourne, Wellington, Huiyang, Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing.   PLANTING TREES Lenovo has joined the United Nations  Environment Programme (UNEP), an  authoritative advocate for the global  environment, and has been proudly  contributing to the UNEPs Plant for the  Planet Billion Tree Campaign. Lenovo employees planting trees in Delhi and Pune, India. 47  Consistent with Lenovos significant reduction in operational energy consumption, global GHG  emissions reductions were also very positive. Total Scope 1 and 2 GHG were reduced by 10.5  percent from FY 2009/10 to FY 2010/11. Lenovos reported Scope 3 emissions increased over  the same period due to an increase in travel. Our Scope 3 emissions currently only include  those associated with business travel. Base Year FY 2009/10 April 1, 2009 – March 31, 2010 Boundary Organizational Operational control approach Operational Scope 1, 2 and 3 in worldwide  manufacturing, research and  development sites and office locations Scope Scope 1 (direct GHG emissions) On-site fuel combusted, operation of  controlled vehicles, and fugitive emissions Scope 2 (indirect GHG emissions) Purchased electricity and steam Scope 3 (other indirect GHG emissions) Business travel Greenhouse Gases All GHG covered by the Kyoto  Protocol CO2, SF6, CH4, N2O, HFCS, and PFCS Note: Data for 2008 is based on a Calendar Year.

In order to align environmental  and financial reporting, beginning April 1, 2009 Lenovo transitions from tracking and reporting energy and climate change  data in conjunction with the Calendar Year to Lenovos Fiscal Year (FY – April 1 through March 31). Click here for more information about Lenovos global environmental data. Note: Scope 1 GHG emissions are calculated based on the purchased quantity of commercial fuel and using published  emission factors from 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The worksheets World Resources  Institute (2008), GHG Protocol Tool for Mobile Combustion, Version 2.0 and the GHG Protocol Tool for Stationary  Combustion, Version 4.0, were used for making the calculations. The tools were developed by World Resources Institute  (WRI) and copyrighted. They are available at http://www.ghgprotocol.org  Scope 2 GHG emissions are associated with the purchase of electricity from the grid. Information on emissions from all  Lenovo non-retail facilities worldwide is included in this report. For facilities solely owned or operated by Lenovo, emissions  were calculated using actual quantities of purchased electricity and the international electricity emission factors for the  relevant country. Lenovo emissions from shared facilities were calculated using the floor area occupied by Lenovo and  international electricity emission factors for the relevant country. World Resources Institute (2009), GHG Protocol Tool for  Stationary Combustion, Version 4.1 was used in calculating emissions associated with purchased electricity. The Similar  Building/Facility Estimation Method was used for facilities that are partially occupied by Lenovo operations. Scope 3 GHG emissions are calculated using air miles traveled by employees in commercial jets, ground miles traveled in  rental cars and air miles traveled in leased airplanes. The worksheet World Resources Institute (2008), GHG Protocol Tool  for Mobile Combustion, Version 2.0 was used to perform the calculations. Lenovo began disclosing Greenhouse Gas emissions, climate change strategies and climate  change risks and opportunities assessment through the voluntary public reporting system — Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in 2009. Lenovos annual GHG disclosures are publicly  available at www.cdproject.net Lenovo initiated gathering Scope 3 data on two additional of 15 categories included in the  Greenhouse Gas Protocols Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting  Standard: emissions related to product transportation and emissions associated with employee  commuting. Historically, Lenovo has reported only on one of the categories, business travel.   Additionally, Lenovo continues participating in the development and implementation of the  EICCs carbon/water reporting tool for the top Tier 1 suppliers. Lenovos FY 2010/11 CO2e Emissions Inventory is detailed in the following figure. MT CO2e Lenovos GHG Emissions 0 20,000 40,000 60,000 80,000 100,000 Scope 1 Scope 2 Scope 3 CY 2008 FY 2009/10 FY 2010/11 Total Scope  1, 2 and 3 48 Lenovos GHG Emissions Inventory Specifics  Managing Nonhazardous Solid Waste One of Lenovos primary environmental objectives for operational facilities involves minimizing  solid waste and maximizing recycling and reuse. Lenovo manufacturing and R&D facilities  worldwide achieved a reuse/recycling rate of 89.7 percent during FY 2010/11. Detailed below is  the disposition of solid waste from Lenovo manufacturing and R&D facilities globally.   Water Resources Lenovos manufacturing and product development operations do not have any wet processes.  Because Lenovo withdraws water only from municipal sources and only for human support, we have  minimal impact on local water resources. As such, there are minimal opportunities to reuse water.  We do however identify and implement opportunities to reduce the amount of water we consume.  In Morrisville, USA our cafeteria uses a high-efficiency industrial dishwasher that cleans and reuses  water in the wash process. Also in Morrisville, we have implemented the use of xeriscaping, which  utilizes indigenous plants for landscaping, minimizing the need for irrigation. During FY 2010/11 our  Beijing R&D facility installed wastewater treatment equipment that allows the reuse of wastewater to  operate restroom fixtures. We have also installed water-efficient fixtures in restrooms in numerous  facilities around the world. Detailed in the chart below is water use at Lenovos manufacturing and  R&D facilities over the past three years. Lenovo does not engage in any intentional discharge of waste water other than into municipal waste  water disposal systems. There were no accidental releases at Lenovo facilities during the Fiscal Year.  Other Air Emissions Lenovo prohibits the use of ozone-depleting substances in our products and manufacturing processes  except in HVAC equipment. Ozone depleting substances used in HVAC equipment are managed  in accordance with local regulations and intentional releases are prohibited. Lenovo requires the  reporting of unintentional releases of chemical substances as an environmental incident. During FY  2010/11 there was one incident in Morrisville, NC, USA involving the release of approximately 22  kilograms of R-22. The incident involved failure of solder on a check-valve joint on HVAC equipment.  In response to this all soft solder joints in similar service were replaced with hard solder joints. Managing Hazardous Waste Lenovo operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous waste. Hazardous waste generated  at operational facilities includes oils, coolants, batteries, fluorescent light bulbs and ballasts. All  are disposed of in accordance with local environmental regulations with reputable vendors who  are approved through a stringent audit process. During FY 2010/11, Lenovo neither imported  nor exported any hazardous waste. During this reporting year, there were no significant spills.

We support legislation assigning financial responsibility for end-of-life management to the     individual producers.    We advocate legislative initiatives that allow at least the option for manufacturers to     recover their own brand products, using the information gained from recycling their own      brands to be fed back into the product design process. This practice optimizes the cost not      only for the manufacturer, but the consumer as well.     We encourage our customers to reuse or recycle products at the end of their lifecycle by     offering consumers and/or commercial clients a range of recycling options for disposing of      products, batteries and product packaging worldwide through voluntary programs and/or      country, province or state mandated programs. If you are interested in learning more about      these programs, please visit: http://www.lenovo.com/recycling    Initiatives    2005 – Lenovo implemented legally required product take-back and recycling solutions in     all regions where Lenovo directly sells products.     2005 – Lenovo established a product take-back and recycling program in the United States     providing free collection and recycling to consumers for Lenovo and select IBM PCs.     2006 – Lenovo introduced a free product take-back and recycling program in China for    Legend and Lenovo-branded PCs, laptops, monitors and servers, ThinkPad laptops,      ThinkCentre PCs and ThinkVision Monitors.     2007 – Lenovo launched free take-back and recycling program in India for the same products.    In late 2009, Lenovo launched an Asset Recovery Services offering for the secure and     environmentally sound return and processing of Lenovo business customer replaced      products with coverage in over 40 countries. This offering is maturing with increased      annual customer returns with over 80 percent of returns being used as products as originally      intended.     In 2011, the free product take-back and recycling program in the United States was enhanced     to provide increased collection opportunities, including at-home pickup.    Customers can obtain information about Lenovos product take-back services by visiting:     http://www.lenovo.com/recycling Lenovo maintains an extensive program for ensuring remarketed products and parts and the  refurbishing, remanufacturing, recycling and disposal of end-of-life products owned by Lenovo or  returned by customers are accomplished in an environmentally conscious and legally compliant  manner. This program includes Lenovo on-site environmental evaluations and approvals in  accordance with Lenovos stringent auditing protocol.  Some of the critical evaluation requirements include:  Suppliers completion of Lenovos initial supplier evaluation form declaring their processing    capabilities and controls, environmental, health and safety management systems, and     legal compliance.   Suppliers full downstream disclosure identifying facilities receiving equipment or waste to    point out whether it is reused as a product, part or material, or disposed as a waste and     ensuring their compliance.  Successful Lenovo on-site environmental and services audit of all facilities and processes    prior to their use, and documentation of audit findings and recommendations in a final report.  Review of all audit documentation and recommendation by Lenovos Product End-of-Life    Management Program Manager and final approval by Lenovos Director of Global     Environmental Affairs.  Maintain Lenovo Corporate Approved Supplier Facility listing by geography and approved services.  Establishment of Lenovo contract with each approved supplier with specific environmental    terms and conditions related to expected environmental performance and reporting. Suppliers include surplus buyers, asset recovery services, legal and voluntary product take-back  providers, field services, dismantlers, recyclers and disposal vendors. All recovered products  and parts are required to be data wiped, refurbished, tested for function, labeled as refurbished  and resold where they will be used as originally intended without further refurbishing before  use. Suppliers are required to use Lenovo-approved recyclers for the disposition of non-working  products and parts and waste generated from their refurbishing processes. Lenovo prohibits the  shipment of hazardous waste to non-OECD countries. Additionally, Lenovo incorporates specific  environmental terms and conditions into contracts and agreements with all of these suppliers.

Of this total, 4.06 percent was reused as products or  parts, 81.6 percent was recycled as materials, 10.9 percent was incinerated with waste to energy  recovery, 1.3 percent was incinerated as disposal treatment and only 2.13 percent was disposed  of by landfill. As part of Lenovos continual improvement activities, we look for opportunities to  reduce the use of incineration and landfill and maximize reuse and recycling. Since Lenovos establishment as a global company in May 2005, we have processed more   than 83,000 metric tons or 183 million pounds of computer equipment through our contracted  service providers. Our consumers have shown considerable interest in our recycling programs. In 2010, customer  returns constituted more than 9,600 metric tons or more than 21 million pounds of the total  processed equipment, which is a 34.8 percent increase from the 2009 performance. 2010s  performance includes third-year data from Lenovos Asset Recovery Services offered to  large enterprises along with data from Lenovos other voluntary and legal product take- back programs for consumers and businesses. The recycled customer returns in 2010  represents 3.5 percent of the total weight of new products put on the market in 2010 and 7.65  percent of the weight of products shipped in 2003. Shipments in 2003 include only Lenovo  China shipments because Lenovo did not purchase IBMs PC business until May 2005.   The figure on page 52, illustrates customer returns by geography.

Lenovo had already developed technical specifications for PCs that included  environmental attributes such as energy. In addition, all commercial products were designed to  meet Chinas energy-saving targets. With the globalization of Lenovos reach in 2005, the company took environmental sustainability  a step further and adopted a comprehensive Environmentally Conscious Products Program  aimed toward leadership in the global PC business. The program is implemented by a network of  Environmentally Conscious Product Engineers and Green Product Teams within each business  unit with the support of the Global Environmental Affairs Team. Lenovos corporate-wide environmental standards and specifications require the designers of all  Lenovo IT products to consider certain environmentally conscious design practices to facilitate  and encourage recycling and minimize resource consumption. For example:   All product lines adhere to marking of plastic parts greater than 25 grams for identification of    resins for recycling.   Products are designed to minimize the types of plastics they contain and avoid contamination    of plastics by paints, glues or welded connections. Tools needed for disassembly to subsystem     levels are also universally available. 5.5.1 materiaLs  Product-specific upgradeability features    are described in product literature and     declarations for all Lenovo product lines.   Recycled resins, ranging in recycled    content from 10 percent to over 85     percent, are used in a number of Lenovo     hardware applications and are specified     as preferred materials where practical.     Lenovo is working toward the goal of     including some amount of recycled     plastic in all new products.  New products are evaluated for chemical emissions. To minimize potential VOC emissions,    non-solvent based powder coatings are used for decorative painted parts wherever practical.  Lenovo supports a precautionary approach, ensuring Lenovo will take appropriate action even  if some cause-and-effect relationships are not fully scientifically established.  Lenovos priority is to use environmentally preferable materials whenever applicable. In adhering  to the precautionary approach, Lenovo supports restricting the intentional addition of potentially  concerning materials when economically and technically viable alternatives exist. These  restrictions may also include implementing concentration limits for incidental occurrences. For  materials where economically and technically viable alternatives do not exist, Lenovo collects  data on the usage of these materials above the defined concentration limit. This data can  then be reported to customers or other stakeholders. Lenovo continues to actively search for  environmentally preferable materials that can be used as substitutes. We also expect our partners/suppliers to demonstrate the same commitment to environmentally  sound practices. Our supplier specifications are available at: http://www.lenovo.com/global_ procurement/us/en/Guidelines/Restrictions_and_Packaging.html Lenovo restricts the use of environmentally sensitive materials in our products. The specification  encompasses both regulatory and Lenovo-imposed material bans and restrictions, including the  prohibition of ozone-depleting substances in all applications and the elimination of European  Union (EU) Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Registration, Evaluation,  Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)-restricted materials beyond those  jurisdictions where regulatory requirements exist. Lenovos implementation strategy and  requirements are consistent with the requirements specified in the EUs RoHS Directive and  REACH Regulation. Additional information about RoHS and REACH can be viewed at:  http://www.lenovo.com/social_responsibility/us/en/sustainability/RoHS_Communication.pdf http://www.lenovo.com/social_responsibility/us/en/sustainability/Lenovo_REACH_SVHC_ Disclosure.pdf Metric tons EmEA The Americas Asia Pacific Customers Returns by Geography CY 2009 CY 2010 7,000 8,000 9,000 6,000 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 4Lenovo supports the definition of "BFR/PVC free" as defined in the "iNEMI Position Statement on the 'Definition of  Low-Halogen' Electronics (BFR/CFR/PVC-Free). 52 Lenovo supports the goal to phase out Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs) and PVC and is  committed to driving its supply chain toward this goal. PVC and BFR-free4 monitors:   The ICT industry has been driving huge productivity gains for decades and today has the  capacity to deliver solutions that can yield the greatest impact in delivering reductions in GHG.  A new IDC (International Data Corporation) report, dubbed the G20 ICT Sustainability Index, has  identified roughly 5.8 billion tons of CO2 that can be eliminated by 2020 with the focused use of  ICT-based solutions.  With several product energy efficiency specifications already in use even before Lenovos  inception in 2005, we launched the Climate Savers Computing Initiative (CSCI) in 2007 in  partnership with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and other technology companies. CSCI and its  member companies advocate and promote energy-efficient computer products globally. CSCI  has set the goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 54 million metric tons annually by  2010, and the final goal is to lower the total energy consumption of all the computers in the world  to half of the current level by 2010.  The energy consumption and performance of Lenovo products meets the efficiency requirements  of China, Japan, the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions. Many Lenovo laptop,  desktop, server and monitor products satisfy and even exceed the current ENERGY STAR  requirements. The ENERGY STAR qualified models are listed at Home: ENERGY STAR –  http://www.energystar.gov For more information about Lenovos energy-efficient products, go to:  http://www.lenovo.com/energy PRODUCT GREEN AWARDS AND RECOGNITION Lenovo ThinkPad L412: Green Laptop  Lenovo ThinkVision L2251x Wide – In addition to earning the TCO EDGE certification, this model is  EPEAT Gold and ENERGY STAR 5.0 compliant.
