Approved by the Board of Directors on 16 December 2011  Effective as of 1 January 2012          RUUKKI CODE OF CONDUCT      1. Introduction    Ruukki recognises the importance of proper business conduct, which is in the long term  interest of the company. It creates loyalty and trust in employees, shareholders,  customers, other stakeholders and in the local communities where Ruukki operates.    Ruukkis Board of Directors has approved this Code of Conduct (Code). The Code  applies to all Ruukki companies and employees regardless of Ruukki companys  whereabouts or employees title or position. Compliance with the Code is a non- negotiable requirement and all of us should follow this Code without any exceptions.    As an experienced and high moral company, we must especially notice our  responsibilities to corporate responsibility. Commitment to proper business conduct  and fair game are worth upholding. We all must act and work in accordance with this  Code.    The idea of this Code is to give guidance to Ruukkis employees and business  partners. It does not cover all situations. If you are ever in doubt about its interpretation,  do not hesitate to contact your supervisor or Ruukkis Legal for guidance.    Ruukkis values  Ruukkis values describe our way to work and the things that are important to us. The  values engage the employees to share a common way of doing things. They also set  the ground by which we want to be successful in the future. Values guide our choices  and decision making.    We take responsibility    We are worth our customers trust    We keep our promises    We work safely and responsibly    We work honestly and responsibly as individuals    We succeed together    We succeed together with our customers    We deliver results    We trust each other    We benefit from our multicultural expertise    We challenge tomorrow    We understand our customers future needs    We are curious about new things    We quickly take action    We encourage continuous renewal and learning              2/5      2. Compliance with laws and regulations    We are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations. It is important  for each Ruukkis employee to be aware of the laws and regulations applying to his or  her own job and to comply with them. Wherever Ruukki or Ruukkis employee works,  we respect the local way of doing business under their legislation.    Ethics  We are committed to doing business in accordance with high ethical standards. Ruukki  wants to be a good business partner and to act as a responsible corporate citizen in  the community.      Fair competition  We comply with competition and antitrust laws in all our operations and do our best to  avoid working practices that could be regarded as restricting competition. Ruukki as a  company or Ruukkis employee must not take part in any discussions or agreements  with competitor where, for example, prices, customers, markets or other activities are  agreed and they restrict or could restrict free and open competition.     Insiders  As a listed company Ruukki complies with all insider regulations. Insiders are provided  with strict guidelines and each insider is responsible for ensuring that his or her actions  comply with the law, Finnish Financial Supervisory Authoritys (FIN-FSA) standards  and Insider Guidelines of Rautaruukki Corporation.      Ruukkis policies  Besides this Code, Ruukki also has other policies that guide our work and operations,  for example, regarding company information disclosure, corporate governance and  competition compliance.    3. Human rights    We participate in the UN Global Compact Initiative and promote other universally  accepted international declarations, such as the ILO Declaration on Fundamental  Principles and Rights at Work and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises    Accordingly we respect different cultures and understanding of human and childrens  rights. Ruukki actively monitors those countries in which we have business activities  and under no circumstances do we tolerate child or forced labour.    We respect each other in everything we do. Each Ruukkis employee has freedom of  speech, opinion, association and other rights governed by laws and regulations. We do  not tolerate working conditions which are in conflict with human rights and treat our  employees equally and fairly.     4. Employees    Recruitment      Ruukki is committed to equal and proper treatment of all job applicants and employees.  Therefore, employees are selected and employed on the basis of their professional  skills and competence.       3/5      Family, friends or other acquaintances are not employed based on their personal  relationship with a Ruukki employee. In such situations, a person having a conflict of  interest cannot be involved in the job application process or be the persons superior.     Employment  We appreciate the diversity of our employees as well as the experience and history of  our personnel. Employees are supported and encouraged to express their opinions and  to discuss things with their supervisors. Ruukki also gives employees opportunities to  develop their skills by offering training.        We do not accept any kind of discrimination based, for example, on disability, race,  gender, social position, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief. Neither do we  tolerate any kind of harassment or bullying at work.      Safety and working environment  Everyone has the right to work in an accident-free environment. We aim to permanently  change attitudes and the safety culture in our company and to motivate our employees  to continuously improve safety and working conditions.    This is achieved when all of us pay attention to the instructions and work in accordance  with the agreed rules. We must all contribute to making a safe and pleasant working  environment. The wellbeing of our working community requires everyones  commitment. Safety decisions made not only affect yourself, but also other employees  - your colleagues.     5. Confidentiality and privacy    Ruukki respects trade secrets and other confidential information. This applies to  Ruukkis own information and that of its customers and other business partners.  Employees are not allowed to use this information with any unauthorised persons or for  their own benefits.     Data protection laws are followed in all Ruukki Companies. Personal information given  by individuals is strictly used for the sole purpose of enabling the company to carry out  its obligations.     6. Business conduct    Proper business conduct applies in all areas of Ruukkis business. There is no right  way to do the wrong thing.     Conflict of interest  Each employee must avoid situations where there is a conflict of interest between  personal benefit and the companys benefit. If Ruukkis employee works for another  company or business during working hours and uses Ruukkis equipment or assets for  such work, this can lead to conflict of interest. We all are business cards of Ruukki and   should act in the best interests of our company.    If you ever suspect conflict of interest and do not know how to handle the situation, do  not hesitate to contact your own supervisor or Ruukkis Legal!        4/5      Gifts and bribery  No employee is allowed to give, acquire or accept any financial benefits or other  hospitality for their own personal benefit. Common items of low value given or received  in the ordinary course of business are acceptable. None of the gifts given or received    must influence our business decisions or be a tacit agreement to exchange important  information. It is not allowed to accept entertainment during contract negotiations.  Blackmailing is not how we work.    Any kind of corruption is prohibited. Ruukki as a company does not support  government institutions, any political parties or candidates, religions or associations by  giving them any funds or donations. All sponsoring must comply with Ruukkis  sponsoring policy and marketing principles.     Company assets  Each employee is responsible protecting company assets including, for example  intellectual property rights, products, manuals, plans and customer lists. All assets  belong to Ruukki and they can be used only for the business purposes accepted by  management. Theft or misuse of company assets is strictly prohibited.     7. Supplier and customer relations    Suppliers and sub-contractors  Fairness is a key principle between Ruukki and its suppliers or sub-contractors. We do  our best to improve relationship, trust and respect with our partners. Ruukki expects all  suppliers and sub-contractors to comply with this Code of Conduct. Ruukki will use its  best efforts  to enter into contracts with such suppliers and sub-contractors that comply  with this Code. If a supplier neglects this Code or legislation, future co-operation with  Ruukki might be jeopardised.     Possible gifts or hospitalities from suppliers or sub-contractors do not influence our  decision-making. We do not trade company or business secrets and we expect our  suppliers and sub-contractors behave in the same way.    Besides this Code all suppliers and sub-contractors must comply with national laws  and regulations of the country in which they operate.    Customers  We are in business for our customers. Success is achieved when customers are  satisfied with our products, we have long-term customers and they choose us time after  time. We take responsibility to be worth our customers trust and keep our promises.    8. Environment     Ruukki is a responsible corporate citizen. The environment is our common cause and  Ruukki considers it important to make products energy efficiently. We strive to offer  environmentally effective solutions and to improve the level of environmental protection  and energy efficiency of our operations.      We provide solutions to customers environmental challenges by increasing  environmental awareness in product development and by developing competitive, eco- efficient products. We seek to reduce the harmful environmental impacts of our  products and operations by improving in particular our energy and raw material    5/5      efficiency. The ISO 14001 environment management system is the tool to continuously  improve environmental performance.     Ruukki regularly reports the results of its environmental performance. Environmental  risks are managed systematically by taking environmental matters into account while  planning and implementing operations and products. Environmental risks are also  taken into account as part of the corporate risk management process.    Environmental legislation governs our work and decision-making. All employees should  know the environmental risks arising in their daily work and must take the necessary  actions to prevent them.     9. Implementation    The Code is effective as of 1 January 2012.    This Code guides us in our everyday work and all Ruukki employees must act  according to this Code. Employees are encouraged to talk with their supervisors about  important matters related to this Code.    More detailed instructions of this Code can be given in other duly approved Ruukki  Policies. The Code is made known to Ruukki employees through training and e- learning tool. The original language of this Code is English, but it has been translated  into the major employee languages.    Reporting violations  Violations against this Code must be reported immediately and all violations are  monitored by Internal Audit. Each Ruukki employee must inform either their own  supervisor or Internal Audit if they notice actions contrary to this Code.

Under the com- panys Articles of Association, the company may hold  its Annual General Meeting either in Helsinki, the  companys registered office, or in Espoo.  The Annual General Meeting transacts the  business  assigned to it pursuant to the Finnish Limited   Liability Companies Act and the companys Articles  of Association. This business includes: 	 adoption of the financial statements 	 distribution of profit 	 discharge from liability for members of the Board  of Directors and for the President & CEO 	 election of the chairman, deputy chairman and  members of the Board of Directors and the deci- sion on their fees 	 election of the companys auditors and decision  on their fees 	 proposals made by the Board of Directors and  share holders to the Annual General Meeting  (including amendments to the Articles of Asso- ciation, purchase of the companys shares, share  issues). The Board of Directors is responsible for convening a  General Meeting of Shareholders. Notice of General  Meetings is published in one or more national news- papers with wide circulation and is posted on the  companys website no earlier than two months and no  later than three weeks before the meeting.  By law, a shareholder is entitled to have a matter   falling within the remit of a General Meeting of  Shareholders considered by the General Meeting pro- vided that the matter is submitted in good time for  it to be included in the notice convening the meeting.  A proposal is deemed as having arrived in good time  if the Board of Directors has received it at least four  weeks before notice of the meeting is given.  To be eligible to attend a General Meeting, share- holders must be on the companys shareholder regis- ter maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd on the record  date of the meeting, which is eight (8) business days  before the meeting, and have registered their inten- tion to attend the meeting by the deadline given in  the notice of the meeting.

In external financial reporting,  group companies comply with local laws and regula- tions. Corporate financial management is responsible  for developing the financial reporting process and  control processes. The Corporate Finance and Control function is re - sponsible for reporting at the corporate level and  the Controller of each division is responsible for   reporting at the divisional level. Financial  reporting  at the corporate and divisional level is carried out  jointly by these functions (corporate financial man- agement) and underpins achievement of the targets  set. Corporate financial management reports regu- larly each month to the companys management and  Board of Directors. Corporate and divisional finan- cial performance, forecasts and the annual plan are  implemented in one consistent process.  Reporting  includes corporate and divisional key figures and a  performance analysis. Corporate financial manage- ment assists the divisions in the decision-making and  analyses required to achieve financial targets.  Corporate policies applying to different areas of the  business reinforce the commitment to achieving cor- porate financial and other targets and to mini mising  business risks within the company. Rautaruukkis  internal control process is described in policies and  manuals. Accounting policies and manuals related to financial  reporting are available on the companys intranet site  and are accessible to persons involved in financial  reporting.

Each Rautaruukki employee is required to  be familiar with the legislation and policies applying  to his or her own area of responsibility and, without  exception, to comply with them.

In keeping with the values, we take  responsibility, we succeed together and we challenge  tomorrow. Each of the companys business areas (divisions) is  responsible for ensuring compliance with the Code of  Conduct, corporate values and laws and regulations  in force. Business area management is responsible  for the internal control of operations to ensure that  all employees in the business area are familiar and   comply with the laws, regulations and principles   applying to them in their own work. In conjunction  with internal audits, the company seeks to ensure  that control has been properly organised and works  effectively. Internal audits are carried out by all cor- porate functions as well as by the internal audit unit. 12.1 Policies Corporate policies applying to different areas of the  business reinforce the commitment to achieving cor- porate financial and other targets and to mini mising  business risks within the company. Some of these  policies are in the public domain and can be found on  the companys website. All policies are posted on the  companys intranet, where they may be accessed by the  personnel. In addition, training is given and the most  important policies are included in the personnel induc- tion programme.

Risk management is an integrated part of the  manage ment system and the risk aspect is incorpo- rated into the everyday activities and decision- making of all divisions or business areas and the main  corporate support processes. The risks in each area are identified and evaluated  in all Rautaruukkis operations and risk manage- ment strategies are determined accordingly. The  corporate risk management function assists with  evaluation and compiles a summary risk report.  The evaluation results and key risks are reported to  corporate manage ment and to the companys Board  of  Directors. A more comprehensive description of Rautaruukkis  key risks and the risk management process is shown  on the companys website at www.ruukki.com. 11.2 Control functions Rautaruukkis financial reporting process and asso- ciated internal control consists of different areas: 	 Effective registration and processing of business  transactions 	 Compliance with financial reporting regulations 	 Financial reporting supporting business and  decision-making.

Group reporting is based on International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS). These support corpo- rate financial planning and reporting instructions  10.

The internal  control process also seeks to ensure that business  is conducted ethically in compliance with applicable  laws and regulations, and in accordance with the prin- ciples of Rautaruukkis Code of Conduct and internal  policies. The control of corporate-wide operations takes place  through the management system described above.  The Board of Directors and its Audit Committee regu- larly evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness  of the companys accounting, financial management,  internal control and risk management. The Board of  Directors is also responsible for ensuring the proper  organisation and oversight of the companys ac- counting and financial management. 11.

The internal control system is operative at all levels  corporate-wide. 11.1 Risk management The company has defined risk as an external or in- ternal uncertainty that could prevent the company  from carrying out its strategy, achieving its targets  or  continuing its business.

In practice, the cost-effective management of material flows between  our units and in the direction of our customers means that we are committed to minimising  unnecessary transport and handling and that we leverage economies of scale in our operations. Its a long way from Ruukkis steel mill in Raahe, Finland to the construction businesss unit in Romania  or the engineering unit in China. Besides the logistics challenge, theres also the challenge of storage  on the way. Optimisation of stock size and location is also part of our supply chain management.  Ruukki could never profitably make every product itself, which is why seamless cooperation with our  network of suppliers and subcontractors is essential for us to ensure delivery accuracy and manage  our supply chain. Above all it is our customers who benefit from supply chain management and optimisation in todays  challenging business environment, but the operation has wider social implications. An efficiently  planned, well-managed supply chain means a smaller carbon footprint and saves energy.  Business cycles, demand for our products and constant market changes mean we cannot rest for a  moment. We are continuously developing and rolling our new, innovative supply chain management  solutions. We will continue to work with our partners to give priority to supply chain transparency and  forecasting. Supply chain management includes:  Sourcing: Working with suppliers to ensure products and services, controlling purchasing  operations and safeguarding supplies of raw material  Logistics: In a global environment, the best logistics concepts ensure our products reach their  destination reliably and cost-effectively  Operational excellence: Safety comes first at all times, followed by continuous development of  operational activities to improve quality and productivity  Ruukki operational excellence, OPEX, is targeting sustainable major improvements in the key areas of  Safety, Cost, Quality, Delivery and Flexibility with people in focus through a company-wide competency  program. Since the start of the initiative in 2009 more than 7,000 employees have been trained in the OPEX  tools of Lean, Six Sigma, Project management and Change management. This has resulted in the  completion of 421 improvement projects, big and small. Out of these an annualised sustainable benefit  of 10.3 million has been realized, with an additional potential of 31.7 million. The cornerstone in implementation of OPEX and making it the way of doing structured improvements  with focus on safety and economic benefit is the OPEX Professional network with some 147 members.  Taking into account cost factors, Ruukki values delivery flexibility, reliability and delivery accuracy, as  well as the quality of goods and services in sourcing. The general terms and conditions of sourcing  contracts take into account the companys Code of Conduct. Ethical values, environmental facts and  energy efficiency are also taken into consideration when choosing suppliers.  Reducing the number of suppliers is still one of the main aims of sourcing at Ruukki. During the past  year the number of suppliers decreased from around 17,000 to around 13,000. This reduction was  largely achieved by actively focusing sourcing. Ruukkis international sourcing teams work together  across country and divisional boundaries.

Australia 3% (2%) Netherlands 2% (2%) France 2% (1%) Switzerland 2% (1%) Suppliers are regularly evaluated An important part of the supplier management system is to regularly evaluate suppliers. Around 70  such evaluations were carried out during 2011. Ruukkis supplier evaluations examine the following  aspects: management responsibility, environmental management, risk management, quality and  supplier management, sourcing processes, materials management, the production process and  facilities and equipment. Problems in complying with the principles of good business practice, without  exception, results in cooperation being discontinued. Raw materials are the most important purchases financially. Iron ore, limestone and iron pellets are  mostly imported from Sweden, and coking coal from North America and Australia. In 2011, 41 per cent  of purchases were sourced from Finland. Just over 12 per cent of purchases were sourced from low- cost countries, which is 2 percentage units higher than in 2010. Our logistics operating models are continuously being developed in our ongoing commitment to  improve the overall total quality, cost-efficiency and delivery reliability of supplier management.      In addition to the financial aspects, we also consider it particularly important to avoid unnecessary  environmental impacts and so, among other things, we use the most appropriate modes of transport  and choose companies that share our values and environmentally aware solutions as subcontractors.

For example, increased EU environmental regulations have changed Ruukkis operating environment  and imposed new requirements on products and production processes over the past ten years. Also  national regulations impact on the companys operations.  The company maintains dialogue with society through industrial organisations and public debate.  Ruukki has sought to improve the effectiveness and predictability of legislation by providing  constructive information already when legislation is drafted.

Our customer base has traditionally mostly been from the  Nordic countries, although the focus has now partly shifted and continues to shift to countries in  Central Eastern and Eastern Europe and to the emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil. Our  largest customers are companies and retailers. In 2011, the ten largest customers accounted for about  9 per cent of net sales. Consumers who use Ruukkis building products and installation services also  form an important customer segment. Ruukki has a total of around 12,000 active customers. In  addition, Ruukki also provides direct service to consumer customers in, for example, the residential  roofing business. In 2011, Ruukki was present at a total of over 60 trade fairs around the world. Through these fairs,  Ruukki met thousands of existing and potential customers and other stakeholder representatives  during the year. In addition, Ruukki held hundreds of customer events, where experts in different fields,  both from Ruukki and outside, shared information about products, services and about other topics of  interest to customers. Ruukkis presence at fairs and arrangement of events grew strongest in the  emerging markets such as India, Brazil and Russia.

Consistently better customer service Customer meetings at trade fairs and other events around the world Energy efficiency is a significant factor in buying decisions In 2011, the most extensive customer surveys examined customer buying behaviour and factors impacting on the decision to buy. Respondents  represented investors, construction decision-makers and designers, as well as the end-users and manufacturers of transportation equipment and  mobile machines. The studies show that customers rank energy efficiency as a significant factor impacting on buying decisions. In addition,  equipment weight and thus higher payloads are also important. Surveys were carried out in seven countries. Better customer encounters a special focus in improving customer satisfaction One of the ways Ruukki measures customer expectations and feedback is by an annual customer satisfaction survey. In late 2010, the survey  drew responses from almost 1,400 customers across 29 countries. The results show that customers were satisfied with the scope of Ruukkis  product portfolios, delivery accuracy and correctness. However, customers would like to see a slight improvement in delivery speed. Overall  customer satisfaction improved for the fourth year running. Detailed development plans were prepared on the basis of the customer satisfaction  survey. These plans have a direct impact on business practices at both the local and corporate level. In addition, the results were communicated  both within Ruukki and outside by, for example, a letter sent to those taking part in the survey. Customer satisfaction with Ruukki 2010 2009 2008 2007 Customer satisfaction index* -0.47 -0.56 -0.59 -0.71 *The index is calculated on the basis of the results of the customer satisfaction survey (importance- how successful Ruukki is). When the index value is below  -1.0, the result can be considered poor. If the index is between -1.0 and -0.5, the result is average. If the index is above -0.5, customer satisfaction can be  termed good. No customer survey across Ruukki was carried out in 2011 because we wanted to focus on one point for development identified in the extensive  survey for the previous year. This point was the collection of feedback to measure the satisfaction of more direct customer encounters and to  process the feedback faster.

Consistently better customer service Customer meetings at trade fairs and other events around the world Global view of customer relationships  Based on the results of the customer survey, the corporate wide customer relationship management CRM) system supporting customer work has  been developed to be increasingly more customer driven. The system has also been enthusiastically adopted in the emerging markets. A  centralised customer relationship management system enables an extensive view of customer relationships and the sharing of customer  information within Ruukki irrespective of time or place. Further improvement in customer feedback management We rolled out a new customer feedback channel in 23 countries to enable customers to assess the success of customer encounters. Based on  customer feedback received, we further improved preparation for customer events, meeting content and follow-up actions. Customers answer a  question about the usefulness of the visit and at the same time they have an opportunity to give written comments. The feedback process has  been linked to the reporting of customer visits in the customer relationship management system. This helps to increase our understanding of  customer needs and to act proactively.  Competence development in construction customer relationship management We started a training programme, Forceful Sales Leadership, in the construction business. The programme has been used to create systematics  for customer visits: number of meetings, methodicalness, quality and follow-up of actual visits. In addition, a specific sales process has been  created for various business areas. The key personnel of business areas took part in the programme, which ended in January 2012.  A similar programme, Reinforced Leadership, for sales management in the steel business ended in the early part of the year and during the year,  the focus was on cascading down the decisions agreed in practice. During the year, all Metals sales persons took part in hands-on workshops,  which focused on systematic customer encounters and the creation of new customer relationships in special steel products. The workshops were  conducted in the local language at each site and the programmes were completed in all countries in the autumn.  All Engineering salespeople also focused on active customer work and on the successful leadership of difficult customer negotiations in their own  Sales Camp workshops.

Consistently better customer service Customer meetings at trade fairs and other events around the world Ruukki Express - near the customer Ruukki is developing the Ruukki Express chain of roofing product stores to give customers better service in roof construction. The stores and  stocks are located near the customer base both of consumers and construction professionals. As the name suggests, Ruukki Express provides  fast, convenient roofing products and services. In 2011, roofing experts served customers at 46 outlets in nine countries. There are plans to expand the network in 2012 especially in Central  Eastern Europe. First Ruukki certified partners Ruukkis Certified Partner Programme (CPP) is helping to create a network of Ruukkis distribution partners that provide the best selection of  Ruukki special steel products and services on the market, to the benefit of the end users. The first partners were chosen in early 2011 and good  experiences have been obtained from pilot projects. The programme aims to raise the level of expertise of the selected distribution companies for Ruukkis special steel products. The programme  offers mutual benefits for both parties: in return for providing partners with marketing cooperation, technical support and training, Ruukki gains  increasingly more knowledge about end-customer needs and wishes. In this way, end customers benefit from more suitable products and better  service. At the moment, the community includes members both in Europe and emerging market countries. Ruukki has been working together with many  of the partners for a few years and now the cooperation has been formalised through certification. Special Steels Day The first Ruukki Special Steels Day events were held in India, Brazil, Indonesia, Poland, Russia and the Czech Republic during 2011. Ruukkis  Special Steel customer seminars attracted hundreds of customers who were interested in learning about the latest developments in Raex  weather-resistant and Optim high-strength steels. Customers were also interested to hear about the benefits of special steels compared to those  of standard steels. These benefits are lighter weight end products, lower fuel consumption and increased payloads. Special Steels Day events  were held either in conjunction with industrial fairs or as separate events.

A number of new products were rolled out for the  mining industry, construction and automotive industry markets. New high-strength products provide  quality solutions for heavy industry applications worldwide and direct quenching technology enables a  broader spectrum of steel grades and dimensional ranges of metal-coated products. Ruukkis double  grade high-strength structural tube was launched on the European market. It combines the strength of  fine-grain steel and the usability of conventional structural steel in the same steel grade. The first  phase started in the transition to chromium-free colour-coated products designed for outdoor use. Tin Smith Pro, Ruukki's new tailored steel for sheet metal workers, is ideal for applications where good  steel formability is required together with the corrosion-resistance afforded by colour-coating and  galvanisation, for example machine-seamed steel roofs. Tin Smith Pro enables faster working,  complex shapes and tighter seams than with traditional materials. Adequate thickness also ensures  good resistance to the forces of nature such as snow loading. Tin Smith Pro does not age and its  mechanical properties remain unchanged during storage. Ruukkis Litec 1000CP steel is a newcomer to the automotive steel market. It improves collision safety  and enables lighter body work. Ultra-high-strength, formable Litec 1000CP is three times stronger than  the steel traditionally used in construction. It is also twice as strong as Litec 600CP steels, which  belong to the same product range. Ruukkis energy panel system can help save up to 30% in your buildings annual maintenance cost.  The panel system consists of airtight Ruukki energy panels, structural details, accessories, airtightness  instructions, installation and Ruukkis airtightness promise.  Solar-power producing Liberta Solar panels are the latest newcomer to the Ruukki Design Palette  family. Design Palette has been created to provide architects with a range of quality faade cladding  shapes, materials and colours to provide signature design. Solar panels provide an extra dimension to  the palette in the form of energy production.  Energy piles utilising ground-source energy were chosen for the foundations of the new Technopolis  Innova 2 office building under construction in Jyvskyl, Finland. Ruukki and Uponor together  innovated a system using the steel piles used in a building's foundations to collect energy. Heat  collector pipes are installed inside the hollow steel piles, which are then concreted so that the ground- source energy can be efficiently transferred to the heat transfer fluid inside the pipes. Energy piles are  particularly suitable for commercial buildings that require both heating and cooling. The results from  simulations show that free energy from a ground-source heating solution integrated into energy piles  can at best provide as much as 50-70% of a building's heating requirements and 50-100% of its  cooling requirements. Snow accumulation on the roof can cause many problems. However, the risk of roof collapse can now  be checked the smart way, using sensors. Sensors developed by Ruukki can be fitted to roofing sheets  to measure the loading on the roof and when necessary send an alert to a mobile phone. We can  really talk about smart roofs. Sensors fitted to the roof notice changes in loading. The technology  developed by Ruukki can be fitted to both new and existing roofs where load-bearing sheets have  been used. Sensors fitted to roofing sheets send out an alert when maximum permitted loads are  approaching. Signals from the measurement sensors are transmitted via a wireless internet network  router and the alert can be directed to a mobile phone or email. The technology developed by Ruukki  also provides up-to-date information about roof loading and changes in loading during the required  period.

This equates to one per cent (1) of the companys comparable  net sales. R&D at Ruukki focused mainly on broadening the special steel portfolio, strengthening customer product development support and working on a  number of projects aimed at benefiting from the user experience in developing products and solutions. In addition, work continued on the  successful development of energy-efficient products by creating lighter structures and more energy-efficient building components. Ruukki Construction continued work on the energy-efficiency front. Ruukki energy panels were successfully launched in Finland, where sales  developed well over the year. The year also saw the launch of Liberta Solar, a glazed faade featuring fully integrated photovoltaic system. A pilot  project was completed for energy piles which utilise ground source straight from the foundations of a building. The roof safety of industrial halls  was improved through the innovation of an intelligent roofing system, which reports the actual roof loading. Within residential roofing, a new roof  profile, Adamante, was launched. A number of new products such as Ruukki Easy Bridge, rock shoes for drill piles and new median road barrier  were developed within infrastructure solutions. In addition, the new lattice wind tower design received certification. In Finland, the  competitiveness of single-storey construction was strengthened through a new fire protection certificate, which affords up to 90 minutes  protection for steel structures when using sprinklers. Also CE labelling has been applied for the sprinkler system. Ruukki Engineering continued work on developing the Products & Technology function, where the focus was on cabins and components. Two  new cabin products entered production in 2011. Work started on a number of cabin technology development projects aimed at building on  competence in virtual design, noise and vibration control and in utilising operator experience. A new components development team was set up  to support component business customers and to develop competence in the design and application of special steel components. The focus of development in steel products was on high-strength, wear-resistant and structural steels, as well as chromium-free colour-coated  products. A number of new products were rolled out for the mining industry, construction and automotive industry markets. New high-strength  products provide quality solutions for heavy industry applications worldwide and direct quenching technology enables a broader spectrum of steel  grades and dimensional ranges of metal-coated products. Ruukkis double grade high-strength structural tube was launched on the European  market. It combines the strength of fine-grain steel and the usability of conventional structural steel in the same steel grade. The first phase  started in the transition to chromium-free colour-coated products designed for outdoor use. The production process moved ahead by switching over to using only iron pellets in iron-making instead of a combination of iron ore concentrate  and pellets when the sinter plant at the Raahe Works was closed down in December 2011. During the year, Ruukki joined the large ULCOS II EU  project consortium. The project aims at building a full-scale demonstration plant capable of radically decreasing CO2 emissions in steel-making.  In addition, Ruukki is participating in the CLEEN CCS project, which is studying carbon capture and storage in Finnish conditions. In the process  development of hot-rolling products, opening production bottlenecks and improving surface quality were high on the agenda. Two new research programmes got under way in the Finnish Metals and Engineering Competence Cluster (FIMECC Ltd): Research of business  development based on customer and user experience (UXUS) and the programme for the industrial service business (FutIS).

The study module and competition provide a good opportunity for students to especially develop  new innovative steel structures, but also steel components suitable for industrial production.  The Studio seeks to show students the potential of steel in solutions for compact urban structures,  especially in construction that poses a challenge from the cityscape aspect. The theme of the  study module is sustainable construction, which is also important for Ruukkis construction  business.  First passive building in Romania Ruukki sponsored a project to build the first internationally certified passive building in Romania  by providing consultation and delivering steel solutions for it.  The products of a number of building materials and solutions suppliers were tested and those  suppliers whose products best satisfied the specified quality and energy-efficiency requirements  took part in the passive building project. Ruukkis faade claddings and roofing solutions were  among the solutions chosen.  Romanian universities and research bodies specialising in architecture and construction took part  in the project. The passive building consists of two wings of a large building on the Politehnica  University campus in Bucharest. For Ruukki, it was important to participate in the project because it triggered public debate on the  content of norms related to the construction of passive buildings. This in turn promotes Ruukkis  role as a supplier of energy-efficient building solutions.  Community support Ruukki sponsors efforts that promote our corporate image, strategy, brand and values. Sponsorship  efforts are always in line with our Code of Conduct. Ruukkis sponsorship of sports associations and their junior activities has already been visible for  years. Pattijoen Urheilijat Finnish baseball team, which plays at Finnish championship level,  Hmeenlinnan Pallokerhon edustusjkiekko ice hockey team and the junior activities of  Hmeenlinnan Jalkapalloseura football club were some of sports associations that Ruukki supported in  2011. The WWF Baltic Sea Campaign was the recipient of Ruukkis most significant charitable support in  2011 for a cleaner environment. Instead of sending Christmas cards in 2011, we made a donation,  which, as a result of voting by our customers and stakeholders, went to the Baltic Sea Campaign.  Internationally, we supported, for example, various charitable organisations, kindergartens and  childrens homes in Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Germany. We were also a partner in various  international events in the construction and steel industries.  Ruukki considers it important for Finnish universities to maintain top-level research and teaching.  Ruukki previously made generous donations to support university activities in 2010, when Aalto  University, Tampere University of Technology and Lappeenranta University of Technology were the  beneficiaries of donations totalling 900,000.  Ruukki is also involved in the Technology Industries of Finland Centennial Foundation fund to promote  metals-related teaching, scientific research and studies. In 2011, the fund awarded grants for 2012 and  recognition awards for theses totalling around 300,000.

In keeping with its environmental policy, Ruukki provides solutions to customers environmental  challenges by increasing environmental awareness in product development and by developing  competitive, eco-efficient products. By improving the energy and material efficiency of our products, we  are reducing and preventing harmful environmental impacts.  We consider it important to be aware of the environmental requirements aimed at our operations and  products and to deal with the factors affecting environmental impacts. One of the requirements of a  certified ISO 14001 environmental management system is to recognise, study and assess all the non- compliances that impact on the environment in our operations. Internal and external audits monitor the  implementation of our environmental management systems.  The ISO 14001 environmental management system is Ruukkis tool to continuously improve  environmental performance. Certified management systems cover 99 per cent (2010: 99) of  production.  Read more about certificates   We drive improvement in environmental performance through environmental objectives and targets set  at corporate, function and site level. Management reviews regularly track achievement of these targets.  In practice, each of our sites and operations is responsible for putting environmental protection into  place.  Each and every person at Ruukki is responsible for environmental performance. In-house training  provides employees with the means to manage the environmental impacts of their own jobs. We also  encourage our subcontractors to take environmental aspects into account.  Ruukki takes thorough steps to actively track and anticipate future changes in environmental  legislation, which may bring about significant future changes in the business environment.

Environmental risks are managed by systematically taking environmental matters into account in planning and implementing operations and  products. Environmental risks are taken into account as part of the corporate risk management process. Risk management seeks to underpin the  companys strategy, achievement of targets and to ensure business continuity. Risk management at Ruukki is an integrated part of the  management system. The effects of climate change The impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather conditions or a rise in sea levels, can indirectly impact on our business as a result of,  among other things, changing building requirements. Property risks and business disruption risks are assessed as part of regular risk  assessment. Risks are also assessed together with the authorities as part of environmental and construction permit processes. Climate change and the ensuing additional costs impact on Ruukkis investments and competitiveness, especially if the same rules of play do not  apply equally to all players in the field. The most significant legislative risk to our business as a result of climate change is the lack of a global  climate change agreement based on efficiency and the unilateral emissions trading scheme in the European Union. In addition, Ruukki actively  tracks legislative changes, such as the proposed amendment to the Sulphur Directive to lower maximum sulphur content levels for shipping fuels  used in the Baltic Sea. Stricter sulphur restrictions would weaken the competitiveness of companies in the northern regions both in and outside  the EU. In the next emissions trading period starting in 2013, there will be fewer emissions allowances as a result of more stringent carbon dioxide  reduction targets. The EUs Emissions Trading Scheme allocates certain amount of free emissions allowances to so-called carbon leakage  sectors. This is done in an attempt to prevent production from being transferred to countries outside the EU and to prevent an increase in global  carbon dioxide emissions. Ruukki actively tracks changes in the European Union`s Emission Trading Scheme.

Future carbon dioxide emission reduction targets in the European Union will be more stringent than at present. The EUs climate and energy  package aims at a cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 to 20 per cent below 1990 levels. At the same time, the EU has an energy savings  target of 20 per cent and to increase the use of renewables by 20 per cent by 2020. Fewer free emissions allowances than earlier will be  allocated to cover the following emissions trading period for 2013–2020. The steel industry will receive free emissions allowances on the basis of  efficiency, which means companies that have invested in low emissions will benefit from their efficiency. Final information about the allocation of  free emissions allowances will be available during 2012. Energy Performance of Buildings Directive One of the ways for the EU to achieve the targets of its energy-climate package is the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, which  entered into force in 2010. Under the Directive, all new buildings should meet nearly zero-energy construction criteria from the end of 2020  onwards. The regulations apply to public buildings already after 2018. In addition, a considerable share of the energy need of buildings must be  obtained using renewable energy sources. Ruukkis solutions already feature a choice of options that can help to meet the future minimum  requirements under the EU Directive. Read more about Ruukki`s energy efficient products Proposal to amend the Sulphur Directive The International Maritime Organization, IMO, decided the sulphur content limits of fuels in 2008. In July 2011, the EU Commission drafted a  proposal to amend the Sulphur Directive to reduce the maximum permitted content of sulphur in shipping fuels in the Baltic Sea to 0.1 per cent as  of 1 January 2015. Their geographical location makes the Nordic countries very dependant on shipping. Stricter sulphur regulations would  weaken the competitiveness of companies in the northern regions both in and outside the EU. Ruukki has been actively involved in the  discussion to safeguard the business conditions for Finnish industry.

Ruukki  actively tracks changes in the European Unions Emissions Trading Scheme and the ensuing financial impacts. We monitor carbon dioxide  emissions in our production processes and make forecasts regurlarly as part of continuous balancing of carbon dioxide emissions. The Raahe Works and steam boilers at the Hmeenlinna Works in Finland come within the scope of the EUs Emissions Trading Scheme as  regards Ruukkis operations. Ruukkis total carbon dioxide emissions in 2011 were 4,1 million tonnes (2010: 4.1), of which 98 per cent came  under emissions trading schemes. As part of managing the global carbon dioxide emissions balance, Ruukki is a participant in the World Banks Community Development Carbon  Fund and GreenStream Network Oys Fine Carbon and Climate Opportunity Funds. These funds purchase certified emissions reduction units,  based on the Kyoto Protocol, that can be used in the EUs Emissions Trading Scheme. Emissions trading affects the market price for electricity because the opportunity cost method factors the cost of emissions allowances into the  price of all market electricity. Ruukki manages electricity price risks through electricity derivatives and long-term supply contracts. We generate  about half of our electricity needs by using the process gases and heat originating as by-products in production and implement cost-effective  energy-efficiency investments. In addition, Ruukki is involved in carbon-dioxide-emission-free electricity production development projects so that  the company can avoid unfavourable financial impacts caused by emissions trading in sourcing electricity in the future.  Emissions trading period 2008–2012 In the free initial allocation of emissions allowances for the second period 2008-2012 of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, the Raahe Works  and the steam boilers at the Hmeenlinna Works received a total of 23.5 million emissions allowances.  In 2011, trading in emissions allowances generated income totalling 4.4 million (2010: 9m).  Emissions trading period 2013–2020 In April, the EU Parliament and Council approved the Commissions` proposal of new emission factors applicable in the EUs Emissions Trading  Scheme for 2013-2020. These emissions factors apply to free allocations of emissions allowances. New allocation rules for free emissions  allowances have been harmonised: country-specific quotas will disappear and free emissions allowances will be based on the same emissions  factors for all taking into account carbon dioxide efficiency. The EU gradually reduce the amount of emissions allowances. Ruukkis works in Raahe and Hmeenlinna applied for emissions allowances in 2011. The allocation of allowances is based on European  benchmarks of steel industry efficiency and efficient use of energy can give entitlement to greater number of allowances. Hmeenlinna works`  share of carbon dioxide emissions under Emissions Trading Scheme will increase in the next trading period, since new emission sources from  combustion plants less than 20 MW will also be taking into account, in addition to the steam boilers.  Final information about free emissions allowances will be known during 2012.

Buildings account for about 40 per cent of energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in EU member states. Under the recast Directive on  the energy performance of buildings, all new buildings should meet nearly zero-energy construction criteria from the end of 2020 onwards. The  regulations apply to public buildings already after 2018. The Directive is applied at the national level by taking into account a countrys outdoor  climatic and local conditions, as well as indoor air climate requirements and cost effectiveness. In addition to these, the Directive lays down  minimum requirements on the energy performance of renovation construction by member state. The zero-energy requirement The zero-energy requirement means that buildings must use a minimum amount of energy which should be covered by renewables. Ruukkis  steel construction solutions take into account stricter requirements for the energy performance of buildings. Spring 2011 saw Ruukki launch air- tight energy panels, which deliver considerable savings in the heating costs of a building. In addition, Ruukki expanded its expertise in energy- efficient construction by being the first company to launch a photovoltaic system integrated into a faade. Working together with Uponor, Ruukki  also utilised the potential of renewable energy by piloting the integration of ground-source heat solutions into steel piles.

The REACH Regulation entered into force on 1 June 2007 in all European Union member states. REACH aims to improve the protection of  human health and the environment against the risks of chemicals and to enhance the competitiveness of the EU chemical industry. The  Regulation overhauled chemical legislation in Europe. The Regulation applies broadly to substances on the market that are either used as such, in preparations or in articles. The Regulation imposes  obligations on the manufacture, import and industrial or professional use of substances. The technical, scientific and administrative aspects  REACH are managed by the European Chemical Agency (ECHA), which is headquartered in Helsinki, Finland. Impacts on Ruukkis operations Ruukki uses a number of different substances and preparations covered by REACH at its production plants. Ruukki imports some of these  substances itself. In addition, iron and various substances and preparations occur as by-products in steel production and upgrading. For these,  we have carried out all necessary pre-registration and registration in accordance with REACH and we also require full REACH compliance from  subcontractors.  In 2011, Ruukki updated the safety data sheets of its own products to bring them into line with the requirements of revised chemical legislation in  Europe. Since late 2011, Ruuki has also brought into use a new chemical safety data sheet management system to support information  exchange and manage information about the use of chemicals. Ruukki actively tracks the progress of REACH in many different forums including Eurofer, the European Steel Association.

In addition to  increasing general environmental awareness, training in 2011 focused, among other things, on the impacts of changes in environmental  legislation on our business. Spring 2011 saw Ruukki launch air-tight energy panels, which deliver considerable savings in the heating costs of a building and also reduce the  carbon dioxide emissions originating from a building. In addition, Ruukki expanded its expertise in energy-efficient construction by being the first  company to launch a photovoltaic system integrated into a faade. Working together with Uponor, Ruukki also utilised the potential of renewable  energy by piloting the integration of ground-source heat solutions into steel piles. March 2011 saw Ruukki publish its revised environmental product declarations and product data safety sheets, which contain information about  the environmental impacts, lifecycle properties and safety aspects of Ruukkis products for product users, designers and builders. Ruukki is working together with research organisations, universities and other businesses in a number of research projects that increase  environmental expertise and awareness.  Read more about research projects Ruukki is committed to energy savings of 9 per cent, compared to 2005 levels, by 2016. We take energy efficiency into account in decisions  concerning investments and production development, product and process design and in the sourcing of equipment using energy. At production sites, energy efficiency management is systematically promoted as part of the ISO 14001 environmental management system. We  assess energy saving potential with the help of energy reviews and analyses. In connection with energy reviews, we chart development points to  improve energy efficiency as cost effectively as possible. In 2011, for example, Ruukki Metals saved energy approximately 1090 GWh, which  equates about 270,000 tonnes of avoided carbon dioxide emissions.  Besides productional processes, energy efficiency is actively monitored and developed in logistics. One energy-efficiency target is for contractual  transportation partners to sign up for energy efficiency agreements in the Finnish transport sector so that by the end of 2016 transport firms who  have signed up for agreements are responsible for 80 per cent of the transportation. Over half of Ruukkis products are currently transported by  transportation companies that have signed up for energy-efficiency agreements. In 2011, Ruukki avoided 600,000 tonnes of global carbon dioxide emissions by recycling steel and mineral products.  During 2011, around 93 per cent of Ruukkis sites in Finland returned their scrap steel and other recyclable material to Raahe for re-use. The  remainder was recycled to external actors. Extensive studies of the materials to be recycled and site-specific material processing instructions and  sorting have resulted in achieving the target of almost full in-house recycling.  During the year, the company pursued new applications for steel slag, one example of which was to utilise the material to retain heavy metals in  water purification. A study was also made to sort and utilise the material remaining outside briquetting and process rejects.

Ruukki supplies metal-based products and solutions for steel construction and engineering.   Of Ruukkis 47 production sites, 25 have operations that require an environmental permit. Violations of permit limits are actively dealt with. Permit  limits were exceeded at 4 (2010: 4) sites. The violations were occasional and caused no significant impacts to health or the environment and the  company received no significant environmental fines. Improvement in the reporting of environmental non-compliances Ruukki wants to be aware of and responsible in our operations for the factors causing environmental damage, and be able to compensate for  situations more effectively. In accordance with environmental legislation and the requirements of the certified ISO 14001 environmental  management system, Ruukki takes care of any risks posed to the environment by reporting and investigating non-compliances. In 2011, Ruukki  overhauled its tool to report and investigate environmental non-compliances. The aim is to strengthen the investigation of non-compliances and  to make it easier to report them. In addition to environmental damage and malfunctions, pro-active maintenance and near-miss situations are  also recorded in the system.  Violations of permit limits in 2011 The largest production units Raahe and Hmeenlinna account for most of the environmental impacts at Ruukki. Steel production at the Raahe  Works accounts for around 99 per cent of the companys emissions and 94 per cent of energy consumption. Raahe Works  The sinter plant at the Raahe Works in Finland exceeded the permit limit for particulate emissions. The sinter plant was closed down at the end of  2011, thus resulting in a significant decrease in particulate emissions. The blast furnaces and power plant also exceeded the permit limits for  particulate emissions. Information flow in connection with the malfunctions has been improved to speed up maintenance measures in future. The  violations at the power plant related to the use of oil as the actual fuel because of a lack of blast furnace gas. In addition, permit limits were  exceeded in the amounts of oil and suspended solids discharged into the sea. Proactive maintenance was improved as a corrective measure. Hmeenlinna Works There were permit limit violations at the Hmeenlinna Works in the chromium concentration of waste water from the colour-coating process and  once in chloride acid emissions at the recovery plant. In addition, the pH value for total waste water was undercut once because of a larger  volume of acidic rinsing water than normal from pickling for wastewater treatment. Corrective actions were in the form of improved technique,  maintenance and monitoring. Kankaanp plant Two non-conformances occurred in the amounts of sulphates in waste water at the Kankaanp plant. However, the annual permit limits were  not exceeded. The pH permit limits were temporarily exceeded because of a malfunction in lime dosage. Corrective action was taken by  changing the process to improve waste water treatment. Perseinjoki plant The VOC emission limit was exceeded by less than 1 per cent at the Perseinjoki paint shop because of the colour-coating systems needed by  customers technical requirements. Better systems are continuously being developed in in-house projects and in cooperation with colour-coating  manufacturers.  The violations were temporary and had no significant impact on health or the environment and the company received no major environmental  fines.

Customer deliveries  began in May. The Hmeenlinna Works have an energy savings target under the energy efficiency agreement and an action programme to achieve these  savings. In 2011, energy savings were achieved by utilising waste process heat and by improving heat recovery in the regeneration plant control  room. The aim is to highlight a product-driven environmental approach in product design and development organisations and to ensure environmental  matters are taken into account in development projects in accordance with the instructions issued. Training in environmental legislation was given to persons working in product design and development organisations in 2011. In addition, persons  in the product development side took part in environmental training held at the works in autumn 2011. The aim is to improve the eco-awareness of the entire personnel at the site and for genuine management and employee commitment to  environmental matters. Eco-awareness was built on and maintained with the help of training in basic environmental protection intended for the  entire personnel and held in autumn 2011. In addition, environmental and energy matters at the works were actively communicated on info  screens, the intranet and in departmental safety sessions.

Blast furnace 2 was modernised in June 2011. At the end of the year, the Raahe Works  switched over to using only iron pellets instead of a mixture of iron ore concentrate and pellets as  a feedstock in the iron-making process. Environmental investments made in conjunction with blast furnace modernisation, together with  the closure of the sinter plant and change in feedstock, will reduce emissions into the air and  energy consumption. Particulate emissions are forecast to decrease by 1,400 tonnes a.k.a over  75 per cent and carbon dioxide emissions by 400,000 tonnes, which equates 10 per cent of total  carbon dioxide emissions. Thanks to these actions, sulphur dioxide emissions will halve and the  malodour caused by hydrogen sulphide will decrease in the surrounding of the Raahe plant.  By investing in environmental technology, we are reducing the environmental impacts of  our production and improving energy efficiency  A new paint shop came on stream at the Jszberny unit in Hungary in early 2011. Serving  engineering customers, the new paint shop is one of the most modern in Europe capable of  processing massive items. Coating capacity at the unit has doubled as a result of the investment.  Modern technology, which ensures high quality and meets the high environmental and quality  requirements of customers and the authorities alike, prevents environmental loading.  Environmental investments By investing in environmental technology, we reduce emissions and waste and improve energy  efficiency. In 2011, Ruukki spent a total of 29 million (2010: 29) on environmental investments. The Raahe Works in Finland is the most significant unit in terms of environmental impacts and  accounts for around 98 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions arising in production at Ruukki. During the  year, around 97 per cent of environmental investments made related to reducing the environmental  impacts of the Raahe Works.

Recycling  saves virgin raw materials and steel-based solutions have good potential for recycling and re-use. A  significant share of the lifecycle energy consumption and emissions of a product is typically caused  during use. We can impact on this impact on this by offering customers recyclable, high-strength,  energy-efficient and lasting products. The most significant environmental impacts at Ruukki arise in steel production and at the start of the  upgrading process. The greatest environmental impacts are the use of raw materials and energy, as  well as carbon dioxide and particulate emissions. We are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by  efficient use of energy and materials and by minimising the amount of waste occurring. Use of recycled  steel reduces carbon dioxide emissions in our steel production process. The mineral products formed in the iron and steel production process and materials generated in the  coking process are used as a raw material. A high percentage of the process dust is returned to the  process, thus considerably reducing amounts of waste.  Read more about our recycling.

Use of raw materials consists mostly of iron ore  concentrates and pellets, coal used as a reducing agent and the use of scrap steel at the Raahe Works. Total energy consumption at production sites in 2011 was 13 terawatt hours* (2010: 13), which equates to about three per cent of Finlands total  energy consumption. Most of this energy is used by the Raahe Works, which accounts for 94 per cent of the companys energy consumption.  We recover process gases and heat arising in iron- and steel-making at the Raahe Works and utilise them in electricity production and as district  heat. The energy utilised accounts for 47 per cent of total energy consumption. Closure of the sinter plant and switching over to the use of iron  pellets at the Raahe Works will reduce energy consumption at the works by around 8 per cent  or 1.16 terawatt hours a year. The amount of  energy saved equates to the annual energy consumption of around 60,000 single-family homes  * 13 TWh is the net energy consumption (does not include energy sold).

By focusing on energy and material efficiency and investing in environmental  technology, we have successfully reduced emissions significantly over the past decades.  The sulphur content of the raw materials used affects the amount of sulphur dioxide emissions. In the  1980s, low-sulphur iron ore concentrate was chosen as a raw material in steel production at Raahe.  The change resulted in a reduction in annual sulphur dioxide emissions from over 50,000 tonnes to  10,000 tonnes. Likewise, sulphur emissions halved in the 1990s when a sulphur scrubber was installed  in the coking plant at the Raahe Works in 1993. In addition, choice of fuels has also led to a fall in  sulphur dioxide emissions.  At the end of 2011, the Raahe Works switched over to using only iron pellets instead of a mixture of  iron ore concentrate and pellets as a feedstock in the iron-making process. Environmental investments  made in conjunction with blast furnace modernisation, together with the closure of the sinter plant and  change in feedstock, will reduce emissions into the air and energy consumption. Thanks to these  actions, sulphur dioxide emissions will halve and the malodour caused by hydrogen sulfide will be  reduced in the surroundings of Raahe plant.  Particulate emissions at the Raahe Works originate from traffic, materials handling and various process  operations. Emissions escape into the air at points, for example, from smoke stacks on the works site  and as fugitive dust from piles of materials and roof openings.  A number of methods - such as electrostatic precipitators, dry filters, cyclones and scrubbers - are  used to capture emissions. To prevent dust, piles of materials are watered and screening plants and  fences are built.

In 2011, Ruukkis carbon dioxide emissions were 4.1 million tonnes (2010: 4.1), which  equated to around six per cent of Finlands greenhouse gas emissions. The main source of carbon dioxide emissions is the raw materials used in  the production of pig iron in the blast furnaces.  Consumption of coal in our steel production process is close to the minimum possible using current technology. Ruukkis steel production  generates around 250,000 tonnes less carbon dioxide emissions each year compared to the European average, for example. The company  seeks to further reduce carbon dioxide emissions, especially by improving energy and material efficiency.  Particulate emissions into the air result from the combustion processes and fine material used in iron and steel production. Sulphur dioxide  emissions originate from the sulphur contained in raw materials. Nitrogen oxides are mainly formed in the combustion processes in the coking  and sinter plants and rolling mills at the Raahe Works. In 2011, particulate emissions were 1500 tonnes, which equates two per cent of Finland`s  emissions. Emissions of nitrogen oxides were 2300 tonnes, a.k.a approximately  one per cent of Finland`s emissions. Sulphur dioxide  emissions (4600 t) share of Finland`s emissions was around seven percent.  Particulate emissions contain small amounts of heavy metals, which originate mainly from the iron ore concentrates used as a raw material.  Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) occur in the use of coatings and protective and profiling oils in the further processing of steel.  Ruukki has made major environmental investments to reduce emissions in recent years and has improved monitoring. Closure of the sinter plant  at the Raahe Works at the end of 2011 will considerably reduce dust, sulphur dioxide and heavy metal emissions at the works. In addition, the  use of iron pellets instead of sinter in production will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by around 10 percent a.k.a 400,000 tonnes a year.  Particulate emissions will decrease approximately by over 75 per cent, which equates to 1400 tonnes a year. Thanks to these actions, sulphur  dioxide emissions will halve and the malodour will decrease in the surroundings of Raahe plant.

Water consumed at production  sites is used mostly in processing, cooling and in scrubbing flue gases at the steel works and rolling mills. Of the water used, 99 per cent (99)  was for cooling. A large share of the water used in production at Ruukki is cleaned and re-used. Actions are taken to prevent the risk of  contamination of local water resources.  The blast furnace slag granulation plant has closed water circulation which will result in a decrease of around 30 per cent in the consumption of  fresh water.

All Rights Reserved.   Ruukki supplies metal-based products and solutions for steel construction and engineering.  The most significant environmental impacts We utilise waste originating in the production process primarily as a material and secondly as energy.  The waste material arising in our own processes is used as feedstock in production. Analyses show sorting of scrap steel enables optimal  efficient utilisation of material and saves the filler materials used in steel manufacturing.  Around 70 per cent of the dust and sludge arising in steel production at the Raahe Works is returned to the production process. Some of the dust  has to be stored at a landfill site on the works site until there is a technically and economically viable solution to recycle it. The amount stored as  dry substances equates to around one per cent of the raw material used by the works. Recent years have seen Ruukki improve the use of  material and reduce the amount of waste arising by studying waste management at the sites and updating instructions on materials processing  and sorting. The sites and the commitment of their personnel to reducing waste are key to sorting.  In 2011, we recycled 49 per cent (2010: 49) of municipal waste. The rolling mills and coating lines produce most of the hazardous waste, which is  mainly oily waste and sludge and sediment from wastewater treatment. This waste is used mostly as material and energy by a partner.  Effective utilisation of by-products improves material efficiency and decreases environmental impact and the use of natural resources. In terms of  volume, the most significant by-products are mineral products, which are used as a substitute for natural stone materials in earthwork  construction, limestone in agriculture and clinker in the cement industry. In 2011, Ruukki produced around 870 000 tonnes of mineral products, of  which 86 per cent is recycled. Use of Ruukki`s mineral products in the cement industry and agriculture reduced global carbon dioxide emissions by a total of 130,000 tonnes  (2010: 180 000). Around 260,000 tonnes (2010: 230 000) of Ruukki`s mineral products were used in earthworks and road construction.

The most significant environmental impacts Transportation at Ruukki consists of transporting both products and raw materials. The iron ore, limestone and iron pellets are imported mainly  from Sweden and the coking coal from North America and Australia. Products are destined for the companys main market areas. In 2011, the  Raahe Steel Works switched over to using pellets instead of iron ore as the main feedstock in steel production.  Most of the transportation is operated by Ruukki Logistics unit. The units environmental objectives are to: lower energy consumption in transportation  minimise shipping risks and  reduce damage sustained during transportation  One energy-efficiency target is for contractual transportation partners to sign up for energy efficiency agreements in the Finnish transport sector  so that by the end of 2016 transport firms who have signed up for agreements are responsible for 80 per cent of the transportation. Over half of  Ruukkis products is currently transported by transportation companies that have signed up for energy-efficiency agreements.  Good progress has already been made with transportation damage for a number of years now. The target for 2011 was for a maximum damage  rate of 1.16 per cent of materials transported. This target was nearly achieved and the transportation damage was 1.17 per cent. Ruukki aims to  minimise shipping risks by chartering seaworthy vessels from reputable companies. Minimizing damages and risks reduces material loss and  needs for additional transportation.

Ruukki sees energy efficiency and sustainability as a business opportunity:  Ruukki is responding to the growing interest of its customers on this front by innovating and producing  energy-efficient technology, especially in the construction and mobile machines.  We take energy efficiency into account in decisions concerning investments and production  development and in product and process design. We use energy-efficient technology and use the  process gases and waste material originating in our own production to replace the consumption of fuel  and raw materials purchased. According to a study by the World Steel Association, steel is the worlds most recycled material. Steel  can be fully recycled indefinitely without weakening its properties. Depending on the grade of steel  being made, Ruukki uses 20-30 per cent of scrap steel as a raw material in steelmaking. During 2011, Ruukki reduced global carbon dioxide emissions by a total of 600,000 tonnes by recycling  steel and mineral products.  Lifecycle inventories show that the recycling of a product plays an important role on the entire lifecycle  environmental impacts of the product.

Lower carbon dioxide emissions by recycling Energy efficient solutions are becoming increasingly important in construction. Energy efficiency in buildings can be achieved in a number of  ways such as utilising renewable energy sources, efficient recovery of ventilation heat, by developing lighting, and the thermal insulation and  airtightness of a buildings wall and roof structures. As a fully recyclable material, steel forms a good base for energy-efficient building solutions. Ruukkis products improve the energy-efficiency of  the built environment because they reduce lifespan energy consumption and environmental impacts during the construction of a building. Ruukki  has ready concept solutions for low and zero energy office building structures and building technology. These solutions combine efficient  industrial construction, energy efficiency and competitive lifecycle costs. Ruukkis exterior wall solutions have been designed to be very energy  efficient. They deliver optimal insulation properties and airtightness is up to four times better than norm requirements. Also prefabrication  technologies improve the environmental efficiency of products because additional transportation is minimised, on-site installation is fast and there  is little waste occurring on site. Ruukki is also committed to the opportunities provided by renewable energy sources in steel construction. Roofs, metal and glass faades are  ideal places to site solar power and heat solutions such as solar panels. In 2011, Ruukki was the first company to launch a photovoltaic system  integrated into a faade to covert the suns rays directly into electricity. During the year, Ruukki worked together with Uponor to innovate a system  whereby the steel piles used in a buildings foundations collect ground-source heat and cooling air. Ruukki energy panels   Launched in spring this year, Ruukki energy panels enable a clear improvement in the energy rating of buildings. Knowledge of clear savings in  heating expenses has fuelled growing interest in Ruukki energy panels. Annual savings of up to 30% in energy costs support the choice of  energy panels. In addition, decrease in carbon footprint encourages to choose Ruukki`s energy panels. Thanks to its airtightness, the energy  panel system considerably reduces the need to heat and cool a building and also cuts carbon dioxide emissions. For example, with Ruukki's  energy panels, a single-storey 10,000 m  logistics centre in the south of Finland produces 2,800 tonnes less carbon dioxide emissions over a  ten-year period. This equates to the same amount of emissions produced by 280 cars driving around the world, or 40,000 kilometres, a year. In spring, Ruukki developed an energy panel calculator for its website to enable interested parties to ascertain the savings in heating costs the  energy panel system could help them achieve.

Actors in the lifting, handling and transportation equipment industry are working hard with global  climate and energy challenges in the wake, among other things, of higher fuel prices in recent years. In the transportation sector, it is important to  find cost-effective solutions that safeguard business conditions  Ruukkis high-strength and wear-resistant special steel products improve the: useful life  energy and material efficiency and  payload  of customers end products Our energy efficiency calculator enables you to calculate how the use of special steel can increase the payload of a vehicle and deliver cost,  carbon dioxide and fuel savings. Lightness of Ruukkis steel products cuts fuel consumption and emissions At its production facilities in Brazil, Librelato makes tipper bodies for agricultural and road transport vehicles from Ruukkis special steel. The  use of Ruukkis special steels - high-strength Optim and wear-resistant Raex - has enabled Librelato to reduce the deadweight of the products it  produces. Ruukkis special steels are ideal for demanding cargo processing equipment and transportation vehicles since they withstand wear  and tear and pressure well. In addition to high-strength and durability, the structures are lightweight, which in turn lowers the customers fuel  costs. With special steels, the weight of a Librelato tipper body could be reduced by 20 per cent, when its lifecycle fuel costs and carbon dioxide  emissions decreased 20 per cent.  Compared to rival products, Ruukkis steels have an important edge: fewer emissions arise in the manufacture of products since less material  than earlier is needed for the end products. Read more about Ruukki`s special steel products Energy production from the heights Ruukki has developed an entirely new type of wind tower solution, which can reach higher to better wind conditions and thus increase energy  yield. The unique tower structure is based on a lattice structure and use of a new type of steel profile. Ruukkis new wind turbine tower solution can increase hub height to up to 160 metres. Compared to traditional wind turbine towers, a higher  tower can reach better wind conditions and thus increase energy yield.  The see-through structure of a lattice tower blends well into the landscape. It requires less raw materials than traditional wind towers and is fully  recyclable. Thanks to its light structure, fuel savings and lower emissions are achieved when transporting the structures.  The German WindEnergy Association (BWE) accepted Ruukki as a member at the Hannover Industrial Fair 2011. BWE is the worlds largest  renewable energy association and its members include turbine manufacturers, operators and their shareholders, design offices, financiers,  scientists and engineers.

Lower carbon dioxide emissions by recycling Steel production at Ruukki ranks among the world's most carbon dioxide efficient, with coal and energy consumption approaching the minimum  possible using current technology. In iron making, coal is used primarily as a reducing agent. Most of the energy used in ore-based production  goes into coal used as a reducing agent. In the use of coal, Ruukkis blast furnaces rank amongst the most efficient in European comparative  studies. Compared to the European average, Ruukkis steel production generates around 250,000 tonnes less carbon dioxide emissions a year.  There are no short-term technical and economic solutions available to considerably decrease the consumption of reducing agents.   Ruukki is signatory to energy agreements for 2008-2016 by the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, Confederation of Finnish Industries EK  and organisations in the sector. Energy efficiency management is systematically promoted at all Ruukkis production sites as part of ISO 14001  environmental management systems. Energy reviews and analyses are the tools used to assess the potential for energy savings and improved  use of energy. In connection with energy reviews, cost-efficient, energy efficiency points for development are identified with the aim of achieving  energy savings of 9%, compared to 2005 levels, by 2016. Read more about energy efficiency at Ruukki`s production Research to reduce carbon dioxide emissions Ruukki is actively involved in developing new ways to reduce emissions in steel production. Any significant emissions reductions in iron and  steel production require the development of production technology and the development of carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies to  a technically and economically viable level. Ruukki has also been a partner in the joint European ULCOS (Ultra Low CO2 Steelmaking) project, which has the long-term aim of halving  carbon dioxide specific emissions.

Just 4 per  cent of the total energy consumed at the works is derived from external fuel. The coke oven gas produced in the coking process is used as a fuel in different processes at the works. In blast furnace based steel production,  the iron contained in the ore is reduced in the blast furnace by means of coke - which is made from coal and oil. The gases arising from the blast  furnaces are utilized as a fuel for preheating the air in blast furnaces as well as to generating electricity at the mills` own power plant and for  district heating purposes. In 2011, use of blast furnace and coke oven gases delivered energy savings of 5.1 TWh, which equates to the annual  amount of energy used by around 250,000 single family homes.  Third process gas is converter gas, which is produced when the carbon in hot metal is burnt with oxygen in converters. The energy contained in  the converter gas generated in the steel plant is partly recovered for use as district heat. The high-pressure steam from the dry quenching of coke is utilized in electricity production. The heat and steam originating in processes at the  Raahe Works are recovered for electricity generation on the works site and as district heat in the neighbouring environment. In 2011, 180 GWh  (2010: 180 GWh) of district heat was produced, almost for the needs of whole Raahe area.  The power plant at the Raahe Works generates around half of the electricity used at the site, which equates to 94 per cent of the total energy  used by the company and three per cent of Finlands energy consumption. Efficient and appropriate use of energy obtained from reducing agents  and purchased fuels is under constant development.

All Rights Reserved.   Ruukki supplies metal-based products and solutions for steel construction and engineering.  Lower carbon dioxide emissions by recycling Steel is made from iron ore. The manufacture of steel products gives rise to waste material such as the pieces at the start and end of a steel coil,  the edge pieces cut away from steel sheets and steel products that are rejected for quality reasons. According to a study by the World Steel Association, steel is the worlds most recycled material. Steel can be fully recycled indefinitely without  weakening its properties. Depending on the grade of steel being made, Ruukki uses 20-30 per cent of scrap steel as a raw material in  steelmaking. Production at Ruukki makes use of the by-products from the companys own production processes and material sourced on the  scrap steel market. The bulk of the waste material is returned to the companys own steel mill as a raw material. In upgrading, 1-15 per cent of  the amount of steel can end up as waste. Development work is being done continually to improve the yield.  Recycling reduces carbon dioxide emissions significantly Recycling significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions in the steel production process because the use of scrap steel replaces raw materials in  iron-making. In 2011, use of scrap steel reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 480,000 tonnes (2010: 520,000 tonnes), equivalent to  around 12 per cent of Ruukkis total carbon emissions. Ruukki aims to reduce the environmental loading of each steel product at each stage of production from production to recycling and at the same  time ensure a sustainable supply chain. Most of the lifecycle energy consumption and emissions usually arise during the use of a steel product.  We can impact on this by offering customers high-strength, energy-efficient and long-lasting products. Steel products can also be reused and  after having been taken out of use, the steel in them is fully recyclable.  * The emissions avoided have been calculated on the basis of recycling volumes in 2011. Examples are based on the Carbon Neutral Companys carbon  footprint calculators.

Lower carbon dioxide emissions by recycling Effective utilisation of by-products improves material efficiency and decreases environmental impact and the use of natural resources. In terms of volume, the most significant by-products are mineral products, which are used as a substitute for:  natural stone material in earthwork construction  limestone in agriculture and  clinker in the cement industry.  Use of Ruukkis mineral products in the cement industry and agriculture reduced global carbon dioxide emissions by a total of 130,000 tonnes  (2010: 180,000). Around 260,000 tonnes (2010: 230,000) of Ruukkis mineral products were used in earthworks and road construction. Use in  this way saves double a similar amount of stone material because the properties of mineral products allow foundations to be made thinner. In  2011, Ruukki produced around 870 000 tonnes of mineral products, of which 86 per cent is recycled. Product development work continued with  regard to earthworks and road construction. The tar, benzene and sulphur generated as by-products in the coking process at the Raahe Works are used as feedstock in the chemical  industry. The zinc slag from galvanising at the Hmeenlinna Works in Finland and at the Virsbo plant in Sweden is recycled to make, for example,  zinc oxide. During 2011, around 93 per cent of Ruukkis sites in Finland returned their scrap steel and other recyclable material to Raahe for re-use. The  remainder was recycled to external actors. Internal recycling has been increased with extensive studies of the materials to be recycled and site- specific material processing instructions and sorting.  New applications for steel slag were pursued, one example of which was to utilise the material in water purification to retain heavy metals. A  study was also made to sort and utilise the material remaining outside briquetting and process rejects. Preparations for closure of the sinter plant  were made by studying the materials which the company will no longer be able to use in its own production. A start was made on marketing these  materials to outside users. Likewise, a start was made on marketing iron oxide at the Hmeenlinna Works to outside customers.

The development discussion practice applies to the entire personnel. In respect of workers,  some of the development discussions are held as group development discussions. The development discussion held during the first quarter of the year focuses on setting the targets for  the forthcoming period and evaluating performance for the previous period.  Personal targets are based on Ruukkis strategy and targets in line with the action plans of the  various units. Target setting forms part of the grounds for performance bonus.  The development discussion held during the third quarter evaluates how a persons competence is  aligned with that required by the job.  A personal competence development plan is made based on competence evaluation. The  competence to be evaluated is revised each year to correspond to the main spheres of competence  necessary to achieve the companys strategy.  In 2011, 92% (80) of salaried personnel had development discussions with their supervisor. Among  other things, the discussions aim to ensure that all Ruukkis people know the targets in their job and  the companys values. In 2011, working practices in line with values featured strongly in development  discussions with each employee.  Ruukki wants to increase the motivation of its people to build on their competence throughout their  work career. This is why the company provides its personnel with a wide range of topical training.  For example, with mentoring, management training based on different evaluations of working practice  and training for leaders of international teams delivered good results during 2011. Competence strength through training Ruukki spent a total of 4.4 million (3.2) on training, excluding pay during training time, in 2011. Each  Ruukki employee participated in an average of 1.76 (1.87) training days.  Ruukkis training programmes in 2011 focused on special steels expertise  the operational excellence programme (OPEX)  supervisory skills  sales management.  Local implementation through trainer training Processing competence in special steels was high on the agenda in a number of Ruukki countries in  summer 2011. At the start of the project, technical experts working in different units across Ruukki  were given material and trainer training in Finland for a week. During the autumn, they applied the  training in special steels at their own sites in Hungary, Russia and Poland.  Use of this model enabled competence in the welding, bending and cutting of special steels to be  efficiently shared among production workers who speak different languages. In the same context,  those participating in trainer training formed a close network of experts within the company.  Special steels expertise also increased by honing product training A bridge was built between the present status and objectives in product training by considering new  business models and tools. As part of this work and to form a basis for further development a new type of product seminar intended for the induction of our own people was piloted,  product and special steels awareness was disseminated across organisational boundaries with the  help of product training recordings and  a new type of e-training material was produced to reinforce the awareness of sales and customers of  applications and product properties.  Coaching approach helps in training of immediate supervisors A revised range of leadership training, focusing on a coaching approach, was rolled out in 2011.  Immediate supervisors and foremen, young managers migrating to more demanding management  positions and managers of production and processing units in particular took part in these training  programmes.

In 2011, Ruukki focused strongly on analysing the expertise of its own people, with a study of  management resources across the entire company. The abilities of young specialists and supervisors  were evaluated in the production and manufacturing organisation, the functions supporting them and in  the companys Russian organisation. This resulted in more precise skills development, more effective  in-house recruiting and the preparation of succession plans for critical roles.  Ruukki launched four training by recruitment programmes in 2011.  Young steel experts training by recruitment programme: in spring 2012 the Raahe and Hmeenlinna  Works will take almost 40 maintenance and metal processing experts who have completed a  vocational qualification and an extensive on-the-job-learning period.  ProjectPro programme: 11 building project management professionals completed the programme in  2011.  SitePro programme: 11 installation managers will complete the programme in spring 2012. In future,  they will work in building projects in Finalnd, Sweden and Norway.  Young Professionals programme: 25 young graduates joined the programme in May 2011 and were  placed in specialist positions in different Ruukki units in Finland.  The tools for personnel learning were renewed in 2011, when a new competence development system  was rolled out across the company. The system includes both an e-learning platform and tools for  managing learning. The system enables employees to check their own training history, complete e- learning modules and learn about Ruukkis training offering. The system is available to all employees  and creates a platform also to manage the competences needed in the production environment. Incentive for self-study In addition to training organised by the company, Ruukki also supports self-motivated study by country.  For example, opportunities to take training leave of various lengths covered 80% (83) of the personnel.  The company also awards grants to Ruukki people who excel in their studies.

Cooperating with the  personnel promotes Ruukkis objective of being a responsible employer, whose culture encourages  succeeding together.  Ruukki respects its employees freedom of association and the companys employees can join trade  unions in compliance with the legislation in each country. In countries where local legislation does not  recognise these rights, Ruukki provides other channels for employees to engage in the companys  activities and express their opinions. The local management in each country is responsible for creating  opportunities for employee engagement.  There is active dialogue between the personnel, supervisory staff and management. Cooperation with  employees takes place at a local level through business-specific joint working groups and at the  corporate level in the international Ruukki Forum, a European works council based on EU acts. Ruukki  Forum meets once a year and in 2011 convened in May in Bolintin, Romania. The themes of the  meeting were Ruukkis values and safety, the practical implementation of which could be seen on a  plant visit. In the new administration representation group, the personnel is represented by five persons and  Ruukki by the President & CEO and SVP, Human Resources. In addition, an invitation to attend the  meeting is sent to the chairman of the Board of Directors and, if required, to other management  representatives. The group meets at least four times a year and considers questions concerning the  companys business, finances and personnel. At the local level, employee participation takes place in, for example Russia, by personnel meetings  held at roughly monthly intervals. At the companys unit in China, participation is through the local HR  Forum. All sites in Finland have an advisory committee or similar, which meets once a month.  Around 83 per cent (79) of Ruukki people were covered by local employee participation procedures. At a joint corporate meeting held on 1 December 2011, the companys management and employee  representatives agreed that the working committee of the corporate meeting will negotiate an  agreement on implementing corporate cooperation in the new company structure. In addition to everyday interaction, Ruukkis intranet and the monthly supervisor letters, which include  all the latest information affecting Ruukkis people, play a key role in communication. The supervisor  letters considered in team meetings serve to ensure the conveyance of information and as a basis for  continuous dialogue between supervisors and their teams. Production sites also have info screens and  local newsletters. Summer 2011 saw the launch of a survey covering all Ruukkis summer workers, almost 1,000, in  Finland to find out their experiences of Ruukki as an employer. The survey will be expanded in 2012 to  cover summer workers in every Ruukki unit. The results of the survey show that Ruukki is remembered as a summer workplace where there are  friendly colleagues and varied jobs. Around 60% of summer workers had earlier worked or trained at  Ruukki. No less than 99% of the respondents said that they would consider applying to Ruukki for a  summer job again or for a permanent job. The results of the survey clearly indicate Ruukkis positive  image as an employer.  In Finland, we use surveys to track the development of employer image. For example, in a student  survey conducted by Universum, Ruukki tops the list of ideal employers for material technology  students and also ranks among the ten top ideal employers among mechanical engineering students.  Recruitment fairs, guest lectures, works visits and research and cooperation in subject organisation are  effective ways raise a companys profile. In 2011, Ruukki participated in 26 recruitment events, most of  which were local. Ruukki also increased its visibility in the social media and, for example, started to  post job vacancies on Facebook and Twitter. The companys research and product development organisations work closely with universities in  arranging research, thesis work and practical training periods. In Poland, for example, Ruukki has  already been recruiting newly-graduated production and quality engineers for years from Wrocaw  University of Technology. Close cooperation with the universitys career services and an ability to offer  training places to dozens of students are also important ways to increase recognition amongst  students. Also in Norway and Sweden, recruitment fairs and articles in trade magazines have helped to  reach out to technology students in different fields.

Ruukki has worked together long-term with the various parties to  identify problem points and especially to roll out solutions to create improved work ability. Human  resources management, occupational healthcare, the occupational health organisation and  outside partners have been involved in promoting projects. Occupational healthcare model honed We overhauled our occupational healthcare model and a systematically created early support  model to prevent sickness absenteeism was in use in 2011. In addition, the monitoring of  sickness absenteeism was improved and various occupational healthcare actions were directed  towards identifying risk groups and supporting the persons belonging to them.  Opportunity to join a fitness class or work ability assessment In 2011, Ruukki renewed its fitness and recreational services, which were available to the  companys entire personnel in Finland. Each Ruukki employee in Finland is offered a chance  every fifth year to take part on full pay in guided training of different lengths. Training is directed  by professional trainers and in 2011, 498 Ruukki people took part.  In Raahe, Ruukkis largest production site, the personnel were offered an opportunity to take part  in a personal assessment of work ability, the results of which pay attention to the critical points in  a persons work ability. Supervisor training highlighted the importance of work ability management  as part of a supervisors everyday work. Promotion of work ability Job motivation and success depend on personal experience of workplace wellbeing. This is why as an  employer, Ruukki wants to put the promotion and maintenance of work ability, occupational health care  and the functioning of workplace communities high on the agenda. The company has defined the  concept of work ability as consisting of competence management, occupational health and retirement  management.  The entire personnel are covered by healthcare arrangements and have access to healthcare facilities  in accordance with national legislation and local practices in each country. The main focus in promoting  the functioning of workplace communities was on implementing the points for development identified in  the employee opinion survey in 2010.  Ruukki offers various possibilities for sabbaticals to balance between work and private life. In 2011, 89  per cent (82) of the personnel worked in countries where paid parental leave was possible. In addition,  Ruukki offers sabbaticals and dependent care possibilities based on legislation or local practice. In  2011, these practices covered 67 per cent (73) of Ruukkis employees.  The sickness absenteeism rate in 2011 was 4.00 per cent (4.46).

Remuneration is based on job demands, performance and competence. At Ruukki,  remuneration is based not just on material pay, but the traditional elements of intangible remuneration  also play an important role. These elements include development and career opportunities, the working  environment, good supervisory work, the balance between work and leisure and an interesting job. Principle of fairness Ruukki complies with the principle of fairness in remuneration, recruitment and employment contracts.  No one is discriminated against on the grounds of gender, religion/beliefs, ethnical background, sexual  orientation or any other personal factor not relating to work. The bases for remuneration are fair taking  into account the job, performance and competence. Ruukki employs a job evaluation approach to  calibrate the basis for remuneration. Ruukki complies with valid minimum wage regulations and minimum pay agreements provided by  collective agreements in all the countries it operates in. In 2011, 68 per cent (69) of Ruukki employees  were covered by collective agreements. Ruukki also requires subcontractors to comply with the same  regulations and agreements. Employees can also earn bonuses when they achieve or exceed their personal targets. Performance  bonuses are an important part of Ruukkis strategic targets at the individual and team level. The same  bonus principles apply to all Ruukkis salaried and senior salaried employees. Performance bonuses  depend on the targets set in conjunction with development discussions. The majority of workers are  covered by locally defined bonus schemes. Ruukki aims to offer competitive pay Competitiveness means actively tracking the external pay market and taking it into account as one of  the criteria for remuneration. By offering competitive pay, Ruukki seeks to ensure it is an attractive  employer and ensure the motivation of its employees. Ruukki also seeks to be competitive as regards  immaterial remuneration and strongly focuses on this by, among other things, supervisor training.  The same definitions apply to the remuneration of management as to others. Ruukki uses a share- based incentive plan valid for 2011-2013 in management remuneration. The plan consists of three one -year earning periods and one three-year earning period. Performance targets are based on return on  capital employed (ROCE), consolidated net sales growth and the achievement of strategic targets.  Around 100 persons are covered by the plan. Key persons who do not belong to the share-based  incentive plan belong to the companys profit sharing scheme.

Ruukkis management and all employees are committed to complying with, maintaining and  developing common safety principles and rules of play. A good safety record is a competitive asset and  also a sign of quality, efficient operations.  Competent, experienced people, safe equipment, processes and working practices, together with high- profile safety management, are key to our safety work. In 2011, we focused especially on proactive  safety work to improve the level of safety.  Safety management principles at Ruukki All accidents and near-misses are reported and investigated.  Corrective and preventative actions are planned, implemented and their effectiveness is monitored.  Working conditions, job dangers and risks are constantly monitored, assessed and managed.  Health and safety matters are openly communicated.  Workplaces are kept in proper order and ways of working have been standardised.  Safety is part of line organisation work Safety at Ruukki is part of strategic planning and targets are set for each strategy period at a time. This  work is the responsibility of the corporate Safety Management Team, which is chaired by the executive  vice president of Ruukki Construction. Practical implementation is the responsibility of the Safety  Steering Group, which, together with the line organisation and safety specialists, is tasked with  preparing and implementing the assignments given by the Safety Management Team.  The line organisation is responsible for safety management and the prevention of accidents in its own  areas of responsibility and works with divisional and unit safety specialists in safety matters. All Ruukki  employees are responsible their own safety and wellbeing and that of their colleagues at their own  workplaces.  Safety progress monitored by corporate-wide indicators and a safety tool All accidents and near-misses are reported, investigated and lessons learnt. Safety information is  managed through a corporate-wide reporting system, which is available in 16 different languages. The  safety level is monitored using two indicators - accident and safety action frequency - at all  organisational levels and reported monthly to top management. The general operating principles and  working practices are described in corporate safety instructions.   Our work on the safety front has delivered results, with a decrease in accident frequency from a level of 32 in  2004 to a current level of 8.

During the autumn, the results  were studied in workshops held at sites where Construction and Engineering have operations.  Site management and workers at different levels in the unit took part in the workshops. A safety  specialist in the business area helped to break down the results. However, the idea was for unit  representatives themselves to analyse the results and to spell out the positive points and the  points for development.  Production manager Yuriy Nikitin who took part in the workshop at Obninsk in Russia thinks that  it was important to discuss about the results of the safety survey and make a list of points for  improvement. We chose the five most important actions to improve safety, Nikitin says. These  include for example more pro-active measures and setting clear roles and responsibilities in  safety. Group work was used to find suggestions as to how the points for development could be  implemented. These suggestions were then presented to the management of Ruukki Russia. Also production worker Marko Hietala from Vimpeli in Finland tells that the workshop generated  new ideas to promote safety and a start will be made on putting these ideas into practice.  After the workshops, each Construction and Engineering site has a list and plan of the actions to  be taken to improve safety in coming years. Once the priority points for development chosen by  each unit are at a good level, other matters needing development that were identified by the  workshops can be considered and practical ways found to improve them.  Progress with safety during 2011 Lost time accident frequency across Ruukki remained at the same level as in 2010. Positive progress  was made in the construction business, which achieved an lost time accident frequency rate of 3.6.  The total number of absences lasting more than one day as the result of an accident was 162 (142) at  Ruukki. More than half of the accidents involved feet, hands and eyes. In 2012, a new safety indicator, total recordable injury frequency, will be adopted and this will change  common accident statistics corporate-wide. It means that statistics will also take into account accidents  that do not result in absence (zero day accidents). This move is being made to increasingly  mainstream actions towards a proactive direction. Accidents to subcontractors will also be monitored  more closely. The positive progress that started during the previous year continued during 2011 and a total of 6.5  (4.5) proactive safety actions were made per employee. In 2011, 67,000 safety actions were taken, of which 40% were safety moments held by teams  38% were workplace safety rounds headed by supervisors  22% were safety observations (near-misses) reported by workers.  There was a particularly great change in the number of safety moments, which increased by almost  40%. In future, the focus will be on quality rather than quantity by developing monitoring of the  implementation and efficiency of the actions. Ruukkis safety training sessions were overhauled during spring 2011. Training focuses on interaction  and an approach based on involvement. The aim is to provide adequate know-how to act in  accordance with Ruukkis safety principles and to manage safety proactively. The key to training is  active safety work and the sharing of best practices within the company. The concept includes training  sessions that can be implemented flexibly taking into account the needs of different units. The idea is to tell about the cornerstones of safety work at Ruukki in an illustrative way. The broad  target group is approached using different language versions and the material can be used both for  self-study and as training material. Safety training has been fully overhauled and applies to both  foremen and supervision alike. Improving safety is based on safety surveys covering all business areas. These surveys were carried  out in the steel business in 2010 and in the construction and engineering business areas in 2011. The  aim is to find ways to achieve the following level on the road to an accident-free Ruukki. Representatives of various employer groups went through the results of the surveys in workshops held  at the sites. Local organisations are responsible for implementing safety actions. Existing ways of working were found to be correct and it is also important to comply with them in the  future. In pursuit of a zero-accident culture, it was noted that the reporting and investigation of incidents  in particular worked well. However, there was still room for improvement in inclusion of the entire  personnel in, for example, reporting safety observations. Each workplace made its own plan of action  to improve the safety failings that had been brought up. Actions implemented in 2011 included unit- specific steering and development teams and a revision of safety round practices.   Read more about new safety round practices New safety targets by business team were set up for the next few years based on the results of the  analyses and work in workshops. It was agreed that one common objective would be to rank among  the top international benchmark companies as regards safety. This will be achieved once each Ruukki  employee and each team chooses to act in compliance with the safety principles. Progress with the  change in safety culture can be tracked by repeating the same survey in a few years time.

Despite this  fine achievement, the eyes are on the future: with safety, the next moment is always in mind. The number of zero-accident days has never been a target. Whether the figure is 1,000 or 2,000 days  is just history. This is why its always the next minute or even second thats important for us, explains  EHSQ manager Darius Kazakevicius. Over the coffee and cakes served to mark the event, there was a good opportunity to exchange  thoughts about the changes and improvements in safety that had been made during the past three  years. The team spirit strengthened over coffee. It was great to see how colleagues congratulated and  thanked each other, Darius says. Production at Gargzdai has grown briskly and this has also challenged safety. Ruukkis people in  Gargzdai think that there has not only been a change for the better in attitude, but also in other safety  improvements at the site: there are regular safety rounds and safety moments at the plant and near- misses are reported. The S+5S programme is being systematically implemented and information about  health and safety is openly shared. Workwear and personal safety equipment have also improved. According to Darius, the most important thing in safety is the responsibility that each and every worker  has to their colleagues and families. The main thing about safety is responsibility and alertness. Each  team member should behave like a driver and take responsibility for his fellow passengers, he sums  up.

Ruukki conforms to at least the minimum product safety requirements provided by local legislation in  each country in respect of those products sold to customers in the countries concerned. In addition,  customers often require products to meet stricter criteria than those provided by law. Compliance with  existing quality management systems ensures these criteria are met.  The company is responsible for the quality assurance of the raw materials and components used in its  own production and makes and tests finished products in accordance with quality requirements,  specifications and standards agreed separately with the customer. Working practices harmonised in  accordance with ISO standards help to ensure the consistent quality of products irrespective of where  they are made.  Read more about our ISO standards Ruukki takes safety into account in the products it designs as required by the product development  process (SPM) already at the design stage of a product concept. We systematically map and analyse  the safety risks relating to products throughout the product development process. A detailed risk  analysis describing project risks, their significance and likelihood is performed in conjunction with the  project plan.  We prepare environmental product and safety declarations for our main steel and construction product  components. These declarations provide, among other things, information about the composition of  products and their safe use. Where required, we contact our customers and suppliers to collect and  pass on the information needed.  More information about the REACH regulation We actively promote safety on those sites where we act as subcontractors and in projects where  Ruukkis products are used. Among other things, we have developed tools for the safe installation of  our products. Various technical solutions and user-friendly auxiliary devices improve the safety of lifting  on construction sites. We have innovated and patented a safety anchor to improve the safety of  persons installing roofs. End-user safety has also been taken into account by selling roof safety  products alongside Ruukkis roofing products. Check out Ruukkis safe installation method Construction products, such as wall, faade and roof elements, made by Ruukki can be easily  installed. This reduces the safety risks associated with the wrong installation of products. Ruukki  provides product and installation instructions, as well as technical product support to ensure installation  people have adequate information about the right way to use and install our products.  During 2011, Ruukki received no significant sanctions for contravening regulations or standards  relating to the marking, marketing, use or safety of products.
