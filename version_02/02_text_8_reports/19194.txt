CSR Digest 2012 CSR Report 2012 Editing Policy Contents 1  2 ITOCHU Corporation CSR Digest 2012 Ever since Chubei Itoh I originally founded ITOCHU, we have  followed the Ohmi merchant philosophy of sampo yoshi  (Good for the seller, Good for the buyer, and Good for society),  and continually apply it in our daily business activities. Busi- nesses that simply pursue their own returns and ignore returns  for society will not last. If returns are generated for both cus- tomers and a company, and people become more af uent and  comfortable, leading to the realization of a sustainable society,  then the company will enjoy stable returns as a natural result.  The ITOCHU Group corporate philosophy of Committed to the  Global Good expresses this sampo yoshi spirit on a large  scale. Currently, we are in an age when the good quality of earn- ings is being required. I believe that it requires our employees  around the world to reevaluate what their work means for  society and to utilize ITOCHUs technologies and  nancial re- sources to address the growing array of social issues. We must  create an environment in which each employee can create  such vision. Further, we need to link that vision to the opening  up of new markets, and to use the resulting superior products  and services as new pro t drivers as we grow and expand. I  believe that is how we need to approach the corporate phi- losophy of Committed to the Global Good. As one facet of  the implementation of this corporate philosophy, ITOCHU has  participated in the United Nations Global Compact since 2009.  As we conduct our daily business activities, we will always keep  uppermost in our minds the spirit of sampo yoshi and the  corporate philosophy of Committed to the Global Good. ITOCHU has successfully overcome a variety of changes in its  operating environment. That success was possible because  we were quick to focus on growth areas and seek out our  foothold in markets where we can Earn. To promptly grasp  growth potential, it is important to keep close to the customer.  This makes it possible to more accurately forecast demand,  which in turn makes it possible to advance into new businesses  while limiting risk. What is important is to continually enhance  the sensitivity needed to perceive change. If we can do that,  then I believe that we will be able to continue opening up new  growth markets, even in the current dif cult business environ- ment. It is on the front lines that the necessary sensitivity is re ned.  And it is also on the front lines that the environment is cultivated  where we establish new businesses, taking into account  the problems faced by society and expectations toward us.  Through internal reforms, we have steadily strengthened our  front-line capabilities, but to create a solid earnings platform it  will be necessary to strengthen them even further. In fact, the  implementation of reforms to strengthen front-line capabilities  is a task that is never completed. ITOCHU has entered a new  growth stage. We will link social issues and social expectations to business development, and strive to achieve dramatic  growth.  President & Chief Executive Of cer Masahiro Okafuji Sampo yoshi and the Corporate Philosophy of Committed to the  Global Good Working toward Further Reform Aimed at Strengthening Our Front-Line Capabilities We will strive to solve social issues and create  new corporate value through CSR rooted in the front lines of business. Presidents Commitment 2  CSR for ITOCHU Corporation ITOCHU Corporation is pursuing multi-facetted corporate activities in various regions of the world and a wide range of  fields, and as such, ITOCHU is well aware of how significant its impact on society is. We believe that corporate social responsibility (CSR) lies in corporate thought and action on the question of how to  play a role in building sustainable societies through business activities. We also believe that our mission is to fulfill our Corporate Social Responsibility as a global enterprise, always working from the viewpoint of whether we are  contributing to the countries of the world and to society.  ITOCHU Mission and Values ITOCHU founder Chubei Itoh first launched a wholesale  linen business in 1858. For more than 150 years since,  ITOCHU has passed down the spirit of sampo yoshi (good  for the buyer, seller and society), a management  philosophy embraced by Ohmi merchants that is the  source of its CSR thinking today. After considering ways to demonstrate its commitment to  society as an international corporation and to put this commitment into practice, in 1992 ITOCHU formulated  Committed to the Global Good as a corporate  philosophy. The conceptual framework for this philosophy was reorganized in 2009. In order for all employees to  properly understand the responsibility that the ITOCHU  Group is charged with fulfilling for society and to make  this philosophy an integral part of actions everyday, its  core element, Committed to the Global Good, was set  as the ITOCHU Mission for the entire ITOCHU Group.  Accompanying this is a new set of five values, called the  ITOCHU Values, considered vital for enabling each  employee to fulfill their role in realizing the ITOCHU  Mission. To embed the ITOCHU Values, ITOCHU has  formulated 5 self-tests that employees can refer to in  order to determine that the five values are present in  their actions. 3  Basic Policy on CSR and Promotion System We at ITOCHU Corporation, in accordance with the ITOCHU Mission Committed to the Global Good, believe that fulfilling our social responsibility through our business activities is important. To make sure that CSR is systematically  implemented involving the whole organization, we established basic policies for CSR promotion as a corporate-wide  policy and drafted CSR action plans in each organization to promote CSR. In addition, we communicate with our various stakeholders to grasp the expectations and demands of society towards  our company and leverage these for the promotion of CSR. 1.Strengthening communication with stakeholders through a front-line approach Strengthening front-line capabilities is one of the basic policies of the medium-term management plan. At the business  front-lines of all division companies, ITOCHU will work to understand the needs of stakeholders through more intensive  communication with them by each and every employee, and take advantage of and reflect those needs in businesses  and operations. 2.Promoting businesses that help solve social issues A sustainable society is essential for ensuring the continuity of businesses. In order to ensure the continuation of one's  businesses, a company must do what it can for society through its businesses to help solve social issues such as  climate change and human rights abuses. ITOCHU aims to help solve social issues through businesses that respond to  social needs. 3.Strengthening supply chain management (Respect for human rights and consideration for the  environment) As a company that develops business around the world, ITOCHU views supply chain management as an important issue to be addressed. Preventing human rights, labor, environmental and other problems, and working for  improvement together with suppliers, ITOCHU in April 2009 formulated ITOCHU Corporation CSR Action Guidelines for  Supply Chains. Based on these action guidelines, ITOCHU conducts annual supplier surveys regarding human rights,  labor, the environment and other matters, and requests suppliers' understanding of ITOCHU's approach and supplier  cooperation in putting it into practice.  4.Promoting education on CSR and environmental conservation The expression of CSR rests in the hands of each individual employee. This is why it is critical that all employees correctly understand the kind of CSR that the ITOCHU Group should engage in. In a bid to have a CSR mindset take  root among all employees, ITOCHU conducts education on CSR and environmental conservation through a wide range  of training and other programs, and all organizations conduct lively discussions about CSR action plans. Approach to CSR Promotion at ITOCHU Corporation Basic Policies for CSR Promotion Alongside the drafting of its management plan, ITOCHU  formulated basic policies for CSR promotion, with the aim  of globally promoting CSR with direct linkages to the management plan. Below are the main points of Basic policies for CSR  promotion during the period of the Brand-new Deal  2012 plan, which covers fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013, 4 CSR for ITOCHU Corporation  5.Involving in and contributing to development of local and global communities ITOCHU is a member of the local communities where it has a business base. At the same time, it is a member of the  global community. Accordingly, in areas even outside the Company's main business, ITOCHU aims to actively  participate in society as a member of the local community and the global community and contribute to development at  both levels.  ITOCHU Corporation conducts various businesses through six Division Companies. To reliably promote CSR in our businesses, each Division Company defines the CSR issues that are important in its business and formulates the CSR  action plans, and execute them based on a PDCA cycle system. In actual practice, the responsible sales divisions draft and execute the CSR action plans under the lead of the general manager of the Planning and Coordination Department and the staff in charge of CSR promotion of each Division  Company. CSR action plans are also formulated and exercised by each organization such as the Headquarters' administrative  divisions, domestic branches and offices as well as overseas bases in line with the respective businesses and functions.  A pillar of our CSR promotion is that every employee understands the plans and steadily executes them in his or her  job. CSR Promotion through CSR Action Plans CSR Promotion System at ITOCHU Corporation CSR promotion system At ITOCHU Corporation, with the aim of enhancing  communication with stakeholders, the CSR Promotion &  Global Environment Department, the Corporate  Communications Division, plans and proposes strategies  for promoting corporate CSR, which are deliberated and discussed by the CSR Committee. ITOCHU also forms a  CSR Taskforce, which is made up of members from each  Division Company and administrative divisions. This taskforce discusses production of the report and CSR  promotion measures. 5 CSR for ITOCHU Corporation  Stakeholder Relations Approaching CSR through dialogue with our stakeholders. In our diverse range of corporate activities conducted worldwide, we place strong emphasis on dialogue with the many stakeholders that surround ITOCHU. Through these efforts, we promote CSR activities to help solve social issues by  comprehending the expectations and concerns that industry and regional society may have regarding ITOCHU and reflecting this understanding in our business activities. Stakeholders of the ITOCHU Group Besides those noted above, the list of our major stakeholders includes many other parties, such as NGOs and NPOs,  financial institutions, government ministries and agencies, mass media, and the coming generations. * 6 CSR for ITOCHU Corporation  The United Nations Global Compact ITOCHU's Participation in the United Nations Global Compact In April 2009, ITOCHU Corporation joined the United Nations Global Compact, a global initiative to achieve sustainable growth of the international Community. In the  compliance of the Global Compact's ten principles in the areas of human rights,  labour, environment and anti-corruption, ITOCHU is striving to fulfill its corporate  mission of Committed to the Global Good. The Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact Human rights Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed  human rights; and  Principle 2 make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Labour Principle 3  Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of  the right to collective bargaining;  Principle 4  the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour;  Principle 5  the effective abolition of child labour; and  Principle 6  the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

Aiming to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society, ITOCHU Corporation has participated in  the United Nations Global Compact since 2009. This report provides information about ITOCHUs CSR  approach and initiatives, arranged by the seven core subjects of ISO 26000, the international standard  for social responsibility that was launched in November 2010 to provide an enhanced response to the  requirements of a wide range of stakeholders in international society based on the Global Compacts  ten principles. With a commitment to the global good of society and individuals alike,  ITOCHU conducts its business activities with respect for human rights  and individuality. In addition, as a company with diverse operations  worldwide, we believe it  is important to implement initiatives with a  focus on human rights in the supply chain. To steadily implement the policy Proactively Seek New Opportunities,  which is a part of the medium-term management plan, ITOCHU is  aggressively advancing efforts to cultivate industry professionals and  strong human resources who can support proactive initiatives and  can play active role in global business. In addition, we are also focusing  on the establishment of a system that enables diverse human resources  to make the most of their capabilities. For ITOCHU, which conducts wide and diverse range of business  activities on a global scale, consideration for the environment is  indispensable. We pay close attention to the infl uence of our business  activities on the environment and we also consider what we can create  to pass on to the next generations. In addition to ensuring that our business activities are in accordance  with laws and international rules, we also have established and  continually improve our compliance system so that individual employees  can sincerely conduct their daily activities from a highly ethical  viewpoint. ITOCHU, which handles a wide variety of goods and services that  support peoples everyday lives, is taking steps to deal with consumer- related issues at every level of the supply chain, such as working to  ensure product safety and quality and developing products that  contribute to environmental conservation. In the regions where ITOCHU conducts business, we consider ourselves  to be members of local communities. Accordingly, we will strive to  participate in local communities in ways that transcend the scope of our  business activities and to contribute to the sustainable development of  those communities. ISO 26000 Core Subjects and ITOCHU's Initiatives 8 CSR for ITOCHU Corporation  Respect for Human Rights The ITOCHU Mission "Committed to the Global Good" stands at the heart of the ITOCHU Group's corporate philosophy.  The Global good refers not only to improved living standards, but also a general sense of well-being. ITOCHU, as a  company with diverse operations worldwide, respect human rights and individuality, and is committed to the global  good of society and individuals alike. Accompanying this corporate philosophy, the ITOCHU Values consist of five values important for fulfilling the ITOCHU  Mission Committed to the Global Good. One of those values is Diversity, under which the Group holds the human  rights and individuality of every person as important. Based on this policy, ITOCHU supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in  1948 as a common standard of achievement for all people and all nations. Furthermore, ITOCHU participated in the  United Nations Global Compact in 2009 which is derived from this Declaration and other international standards. Guided by this approach, we clearly prohibit the violation of human rights and sexual harassment in its employment regulations, and have outlined punitive measures to be taken against those who engage in such conduct. Policy on Respect for Human Rights Excerpt from the ITOCHU Group Philosophy and Code of Conduct Booklet Respecting human rights and individuality We value the rights and individuality of each person. We show respect and are attentive to others regardless of  gender, race, religion, or position. We don't discuss matters that cause discomfort; we don't discriminate or  harass; we respect basic labor rights and eliminate forced labor and child labor.  Excerpt from the United Nations Global Compact Human Rights Principle 1:Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights;  and  Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Raising Awareness Internally of Respect for Human Rights In-House CSR Seminar Held on Human Rights and  Global Business for a General Trading Company On March 6, 2012, the seventh CSR in-house seminar, Human  Rights and Global Business for a General Trading Company, was held  at the company's head office in Tokyo. Mr. Hideki Wakabayashi,  Executive Director of Amnesty International Japan, the international  human rights NGO and public interest group, was invited to speak. As a general trading company that operates around the world and  plays an important role in supply chains, the company held this  seminar to keep up with the latest developments relating to corporate business and human rights, and use this  knowledge for its business. Attending the seminar were 110 employees of Itochu Corporation and its related group  companies. Mr. Wakabayashi spoke on developments in international human rights standards and the relationship between  business and human rights, giving specific examples. Afterward a question-and-answer session was held, where participants discussed the difficulty of addressing human rights issues in the supply chain. Opinions were also actively  exchanged on other issues such as specific effects related to international human rights standards today. Comments from seminar participants included, Human rights abuses are a more common problem than I realized  and [Infringement of human rights] is not just someone else's problem, but could also happen in an environment like Itochu, and we need to be aware of that. 9 CSR for ITOCHU Corporation  Raising awareness through internal training programs We work to extensively embed understanding of human rights through in-house training programs held each year. In  the training program for new recruits, they are instructed to acquire the proper mindset for respecting human rights  that they should have as members of the ITOCHU family. In in-house training for organization heads, sexual harassment and power harassment issues are discussed, and a thorough understanding of human rights is fostered. In  fiscal 2012, 295 people participated in human rights training. Number of employees participated in human rights training programs Establishment of a 24-Hour Employee Consultation Desk System Career Counseling Center ITOCHU was one of the first Japanese companies to establish its own Career Counseling Center, where employees can  consult regarding not only their individual careers, but on workplace culture, interaction with colleagues, remuneration,  harassment, and other issues. Consultations can take place via phone, fax, email, post, or other means, and are dealt  with by expert office staff.  Raising Awareness Through Various Publications In an effort to avoid violations of human rights in the workplace, ITOCHU strives to raise awareness of human rights  through a variety of publications distributed to all employees. ITOCHU's basic stance regarding respect for human rights is conveyed in a booklet explaining the ITOCHU Group's  corporate philosophy and code of conduct to all employees.  The Compliance Handbook has pages on respect for human rights, as well as power and sexual harassment, giving  concrete examples of such conduct in an effort to avoid any violations of human rights in the workplace.  A pocket-sized card on proper workplace etiquette details rules on the strict prohibition of any forms of harassment.  Fair and Honest Recruitment At ITOCHU, recruitment decisions are based solely on an individual's abilities and merits, for fair and honest  recruitment practices without regard for age, sex, or nationality. A watchdog system for ensuring fair and honest  recruitment is also in place, and employees are selected and notified to serve as watchdogs and to promote awareness  of human rights.  Consideration for human rights and labor in the supply chain is an important CSR issue for companies with transactions  that take place on a global scale. At ITOCHU, each Division Company surveys the actual situation in this regard among its suppliers, checking to ensure  that suppliers are not engaged in forced labor, child labor or any other immoral labor practices. P48-49 to read more about surveying actual labor practices in the supply chain. Number of empolyees participated Training for New Recruits 140 people Training for newly-appointed managers 58 people Training for trainers of newly-hired employees 97 people Employee Consultation Desk and Hotline ITOCHU has set up an employee consultation desk to allow employees to discuss  problems they may be individually confronting. A HR Help Guide Book has also been  posted to the ITOCHU intranet, and efforts to broadly raise employee awareness of the  consultation desk are made as part of a structure that allows employees to consult on  issues of concern. An external Hotline System staffed by independent counselors has  also been established.  The HR Help Guide Book  posted on the intranet Human Rights in the Supply Chain 10 CSR for ITOCHU Corporation  Penetration of CSR at ITOCHU Replies to the CSR employee questionnaire 2011 <Questionnaire Results Excerpt> CSR Issues that ITOCHU Corporation should address CSR Employee Questionnaire 2011 We conduct the on-line Employee Questionnaire Survey every year to deepen and  assess CSR awareness among our employees. For the fiscal 2012, as a new initiative, we included a special feature on CSR in our  internal magazine, ITOCHU Monthly, and conducted the questionnaire on this article.  Simultaneously, we have conducted a confirmation test on CSR knowledge such as  ISO26000 and the United Nations Global Compact, which were introduced in the CSR  feature as CSR hot topics every employee must know.  The questionnaire was targeted to the ITOCHU employees around the world, this year,  82.5% of the 7,023 employees responded to the survey, a total of 5,792 respondents. In the questionnaire, as a fixedâ€“point observation, we ask a question of what CSR issues ITOCHU Corporation should  address every year. ITOCHU Corporation employees selected "promoting businesses that help solve social issues" as  the top theme; it was the second-highest theme among employees of overseas blocs. This probably indicates that a  growing number of both employees of ITOCHU Corporation and overseas blocs have come to understand that  promoting businesses that help solve social issues is the Corporate Social Responsibility as stated in the ITOCHU Corporation's Basic policies for CSR promotion in the Brand-new Deal 2012 (*) . ITOCHU will continue to reflect the  opinions of employees in CSR, while promoting CSR through its business activities.

Accordingly, since 2009 ITOCHU has conducted the  Documentary Report Project on Supply Chains, offering a glimpse across the entire  supply chain of individual products that it handles. This report, from Kazuma Yamane, covers the supply chain from the production of  pulp in Brazil to the making of everyday paper tissues. Visited Brazil for the  rst time in 1972, and has done on-site  research in Brazil about 20 times. In 1996 sponsored the Amazons   rst international environmental symposium as representative of  Future Association Amazon, an NGO. In 1997, he received an  award for distinguished service from the Para state legislature. Brazil  and the Amazon are the starting point of his outlook on life and his  environmental awareness. Islands of Green Amidst Treeless Hills Tissue paper is a product that we use everyday. I heard that pulp  from CENIBRA, in Brazil, is the raw material for the well-known  Nepia brand of tissue paper. To see the site where the pulp is  produced, I traveled to Brazil to visit Ipatinga City in the state of  Minas Gerais. Ipatinga, a small city with a population of about 250,000  people, is located about 700 kilometers northeast of So paulo. This was my 20th trip to Brazil since 1972, but my  rst visit to  Minas Gerais. As the plane from So paulo entered Minas Gerais, I  began to see a line of low, gently rolling mountains. On the surface  of the mountains, I was surprised at the conspicuous reddish- brown clear areas. Through the window of the plane, I could see  the western edge of the Atlantic Rainforest. This rainforest used  to cover 1.3 million square kilometers, or about 3.3 times the size  of Japan, but 93% of the rainforest has been lost, and today only  91,000 square kilometers remains. However, as the plane approached Ipatinga, I began to see  many dark green areas in the Rio Doce river basins barren moun- tain surfaces and small  at spaces. I later learned that these were  CENIBRA plantations. Research Period: March 2012 Kazuma Yamane Front-line Report: Non ction writer and Dokkyo University Department of Economics Specially-Appointed Professor In one day, 50,000 eucalyptus logs are fed into the production  line. That means that large quantities of eucalyptus seedlings are necessary for planting, more than 50,000 a day, and  CENIBRA uses its own nursery to produce 100% of the seed- lings it needs. At the nursery, which is like a large test plantation,  highly experienced Japanese specialists from Oji Paper, which  is the lead shareholder, provide enthusiastic guidance about  seedling development. To select rootstocks that are highly  resistant to aridity, changes in temperature, insect pests, and  wind; match the soil; and will grow well, 10,000 seed plants are  created each year by crossbreeding rootstock (100 x 100). After  trial planting, the best rootstocks are selected. The rootstocks  selected in this way are known as clones, and the branches and  leaves of the rootstocks (5 to 8 cm scions) are cut and placed in  a small pot, in which they grow into 20 â€“ 30 cm seedlings in 70  to 80 days. If all goes well, they are then sent on to the plantation  site. At the nursery, 15 million seedlings are produced in a year.  The cost competitiveness of pulp producers is said to be based  on the growth of the eucalyptus trees, which are the raw mate- rial. CENIBRA continually repeats the process of seed improve- ment, patiently taking time and selecting the best seed plants.  Outstanding cost competitiveness is maintained by painstakingly  producing each individual seed stock in-house.

Those were the green areas I saw out of the plane window when  we were nearing Ipatinga. CENIBRAs holdings total 255,000  hectares, about the size of Kanagawa Prefecture.  I was able to visit one of the plantations. First, the employees  open holes in the surface soil with a digging machine. Then other  employees use a metal tube to plant the seedlings in the soil,  and  nally employees with a water supply hose sprinkle water on  the seedlings and apply fertilizer. Each hectare of eucalyptus trees grown in this way yields 41  cubic meters of wood a year, with harvesting conducted after  seven years. The speed of this growth supports the international  competitiveness of CENIBRA. At the harvest site, the arm of the  harvester grabs and cuts the eucalyptus trees, which have grown  to about 30 meters. It takes about 20 seconds to harvest one  tree and turn it into a log. The ef ciency of the process was hard  to believe. A tent where the workers can rest Near the plantation and the harvesting area, there is a temporary  tent that is used for the workers to take breaks and have lunch. I  was surprised at the thorough approach to appropriate working  conditions. The reason is that the industrial use of forest re- sources entails the strict observance of such things as conserva- tion of the natural environment, maintenance of biodiversity, and  contributions to the workers and the local community. We have  reached an age in which the only companies that survive will be  those that market products that have been certi ed as clearing  a management process that meets these social requirements.  In 2005, CENIBRA became the  rst company to simultane- ously receive FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) forest certi ca- tion and CERFLOR (Sistema Brasileiro de Certi cao Florestal)  forest certi cation. In total, the company has received 3,828  environmental licenses. CENIBRAs eucalyptus plantations are not connected in any  way to the harvesting of primary forests. Out of CENIBRAs hold- ings, an area of 103,000 hectares is sustaining the ecosystem as  permanent forest reserve or legal forest reserve. These reserves  account for about 40% of the forest holdings. Just since 2000,  CENIBRA has received 70 awards, which is an indication of their  passionate commitment to the environment. Moving Ahead in Tandem  with Local Communities  and Farmers In harmony with local communities CENIBRA is moving ahead with  contracts under which it consigns the plantations to local farmers and then  purchases the logs that they cultivate. Many of the farming families operate  pastureland, but the eucalyptus plantations turn barren areas into green  areas, and the income is more than from farming, so it is a very attractive  business for the farming households. The contract farmer that I visited was  satis ed with the stable income from eucalyptus plantations. The contract  plantations, which began in 1985, already number 1,200, with total planta- tion area of 25,000 hectares. This is a new business model that helps the  environment through the greening of barren areas and also reduces plantation  costs for CENIBRA. About CENIBRA CENIBRA was established on September 13, 1973, as a  Japanâ€“Brazil joint venture project after a decision by the  Japanese Cabinet. Japan Brazil Paper and Pulp Resources  Development Co., Ltd. (JBP), which was a joint venture  by large Japanese pulp and paper companies, OECF, and  ITOCHU Corporation, owned 48.5% of CENIBRA. The  other 51.5% was owned by Brazils Companhia Vale do  Rio Doce (currently Vale S.A.). CENIBRA began operations  in March 1977. Subsequently, in 2001 JBP acquired  shares in CENIBRA that were owned by Companhia  Vale do Rio Doce, and today CENIBRA is operated with  100% Japanese capital. JBP is owned by 14 companies,  including Oji Paper (48.98%) and ITOCHU (32.11%) (as of  the end of June 2012). It is the seventh largest hardwood  market pulp producer in the world, and sales in  scal 2011  were $728 million. Tree planting / Felling STEP2 14  In the huge log yard at the pulp mill, there were mountains of  eucalyptus logs brought in by truck and rail. Pulp is shipped in  the form of sheets that look much like dried sake lees that are  used as a raw material for amazake. The paper mills that buy   the pulp dissolve the boards with water and use the  ber as raw  material to make paper for speci c needs, such as for tissues or  printing. Pulp plants require large quantities of water and fuel. The  production process also generates substantial amounts of odors  and wastewater. CENIBRA conducts rigorous daily monitoring of  odors outside the plant grounds and of the degree of contamina- tion of wastewater. The environmental facilities here are top level.  In addition, the bark from the logs is used in biomass electric  power generation, and the lignin, an impurity that is generated  during the cooking process, is used as fuel for in-house power  generation. In these ways, a rigorous approach to energy con- servation is implemented. The amount of water consumed in the production process has  been reduced to one- fteenth the level in 1977, and the amount  of bleaching agent has been reduced 32% in comparison with  2006 (available chlorine equivalent units). The amount of electricity  purchased has declined 29%, and boiler fuel is down 82% (both in  comparison with 2011). Everywhere I looked, I saw this type of in- novation and effort in the areas of production and the environment. This progress is the fruit of daily efforts to improve operations and cut costs, on a base of papermaking technology from Japan, which is at the worlds highest level. ISO 9001 and ISO 14001  certi cations have been acquired. Saving Energy and  Handling Wastewater  and Odors Specialized Shipping  Terminal for Pulp Export  (5.5 Million Tons a Year) Sheeted pulp for shipment Annual sales of this pulp total 1.2 million tons, with 90 custom- ers in 25 countries. Sales to the domestic Brazilian market are  handled directly by CENIBRA (5%), while exports are handled  by ITOCHU Corporation. Exports to Asia, including Japan, are  increasing, and now account for 48% of total exports. Exports  to overseas destinations are shipped from Portocel, which is on  the Atlantic Coast about 375 kilometers away from the mill. Each  day, about 3,200 tons are carried to Portocel via the Vitoria a  Minas Railway. Portocel (full company name Terminal Especializado de Barra  do Riacho S.A.) is owned 49% by CENIBRA and 51% by Fibria  S.A. (Brazilian pulp maker). The worlds largest specialized pulp  terminal, it exported 5.5 million tons of pulp in 2011. Brazil is  in the process of establishing its infrastructure. In this setting,  the fact that CENIBRA had, in advance, secured a rail transport  route from the mill to a port, and owned a shipping port, was one  of the sources of CENIBRAs cost competitiveness. Over many years, much forest area has been lost, and CENIBRA  is working to restore natural forests. In an area totaling 300  hectares that constitute natural forest, the company is planting 40  varieties of tree seedlings, a total of 70,000 seedlings a year. A representative example of these efforts to sustain and  restore biodiversity is the Reserva Particular do Patrimnio  Natural (RPPN) Macedonia Farm. I wanted to visit when I heard  that endangered birds are protected and bred here. The forests in this area are the habitat of a pheasant family  bird with the Brazilian name mutum (a type of curassow). The  mutum inhabits only in the Americas, so there are very few  people in Japan who know of it. When I  rst saw it, I was  impressed with the black, rather large bird that  ew slowly  and walked like a chicken. The conservation, breeding, and  release activities, are, in the  nal analysis, Brazils version of the  Japanese programs for the crested ibis and white stork.

It was at just this point when  the theme of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable  Development, known as Rio +20, was released: Green  Economy. The eco business advanced by CENIBRA is  certainly a desirable green economy, I think. CENIBRAs  implementation of environmental measures should be  studied by many other companies. More detailed information on the  progress of the Documentary  Report Project on Supply Chains  to date is presented on the  ITOCHU website. Back issues  are also available for viewing. Concluding the  Observation Kazuma Yamane WEB Documentary Report Project on Supply Chains After I came back to Japan, I visited the Oji Nepia Nagoya Plant  (Kasugai City, Aichi Prefecture), which is a major user of CENIBRA pulp and is the maker of Nepia brand tissue paper. When I observed the  nal production line of the Nagoya Plant,  which has an area equivalent to about two Tokyo Domes, I was  overwhelmed by the scene of high-speed tissue packaging. The  production volume reaches 400 million boxes a year. The process of making tissue paper uses only one gram of  pulp  ber per liter of water, to realize the soft texture that is easy  on the skin. However, the ultra-thin tissue has two-ply construc- tion, with the side that touches the skin using soft  bers and  the back side using slightly stiffer  bers for support. The  bers  that are used on the easy-on-the-skin portion are made from  CENIBRA pulp from Brazil. The CENIBRA pulp is produced with  100% plantation trees, and the raw material eucalyptus trees  are produced and managed by the company from the individual  seedling stage. Today, when environmental problems are the  focus of attention, this traceability gives consumers a sense of  security. Finished product 21 years ago that CENIBRA, with partners Crax NPO and Crax  Internacional, began working to prevent the extinction of these  birds with the conservation, breeding, and release project. The base for those activities is in the forest. There are seven  endangered bird species being raised in cages, awaiting release,  including the mutum and the Black-fronted Piping Guan. I re- ceived a several-hour presentation from a CENIBRA team, and I  was overwhelmed with their enthusiasm. As a result of continued  breeding and release, 20% of the worlds mutum are on the  Macedonia Farm. The curassows have been around since 4,000  to 5,000 years ago, and they are considered to be something  like the coelacanth of birds. As a result, CENIBRAs enthusiastic  activities are well-known in Brazil. Activities to conserve and breed rare endangered species  have a signi cant educational effect. At the Macedonia Farm,  they are also working to welcome ordinary environmental  visitors (6,000 a year) and offer school teacher training (1,760  people). The public school teachers who have received training  here have already gone on to teach 220,000 students. I admired  the manner in which the program to raise local environmental  awareness has been enriched. http://www.itochu.co.jp/ en/csr/supply_chain/ Past Documentary Reports Vol.3 How Chocolate Reaches  Your Doorstep Vol.2 Coffee from Central America Vol.1  From Raw Cotton to T-shirts Remark Processing STEP5 16  Our planet and fashion are linked. We want to be continuously excited by fashion, so  we will now start with what we can do. On the basis of this concept, we launched  the Fashion Earth PROJECT. With the help of many parties, our activities are steadily  expanding. We will work together with participating companies to protect Japans  four seasons and the environment that enable us to enjoy fashion. As global warming intensi es, action to protect the environment  is a major challenge for the apparel industry. However, cost  and design constraints make it dif cult for any single company  to independently develop eco-friendly products and barriers to  entry are seen as high. Under these circumstances, ITOCHU  Corporation, which has its origins in the textile business and  which now holds a powerful network in the apparel industry,  launched an anti-global warming program with the participa- tion of apparel companies. Called Fashion Earth PROJECT  (FEP), this program is being run in collaboration with Hakuhodo  DY Media Partners, Inc., which has a proven track record in  environmental communications.  Under the FEP, participating companies purchase product  tags with the project logo, called FEP tags, from the FEP Of ce  at the price of 10 yen each so that the Of ce can contribute the  amount resulting from deducting operation expenses from FEP  We understand that it is part of our mission as a general trading company to analyze industry-speci c issues and to provide  solutions to them while conducting a broad array of business activities. In 2010, ITOCHU Corporation, originally engaging in  the textile business, launched the Fashion Earth PROJECT to combat global warming with the participation of apparel manu- facturers.  In 2010, the Fashion Earth PROJECT was launched.

Participating  companies are entitled to af x FEP tags to their products to  sell them as carbon offset products. In the  rst year, the project  acquired an emission quota generated from a wind power  generation project in India and other projects recognized by  the United Nations as CO2 reduction projects to grant a right to  emit one kilo of carbon dioxide per single blue FEP tag.  The FEP is open to any company irrespective of size and  allows participants to carry out environmental conservation  activities in combination with consumers through the message  printed on the tags. As of June 2012, the project had the  participation of 15 companies and the FEP tags were intro- duced to more than 50 brands. The project helped reduce CO2  emissions by at least 4,100 tons.

Action for environmental conservation Highlight 17  Why not start with what you can do? We wondered what we could do as a brand for our planet. When seeking any CSR action,  we were fortunate to learn about the Fashion Earth PROJECT led by ITOCHU Corporation  for reducing CO2. Two years have already passed since then. Based on a global and natu- ral concept and featuring the participation of end users, this project is now indispensable  to our SIMPLE LIFE brand. This season, we  will continue to play an active part in this  project on a total of four channels: mens  and ladies items through department  stores and through general merchandise  stores (GMS).  From a modest beginning, we are now  contributing to the environment. Lets take action with the FEP! As a second initiative, the FEP started offering green FEP tags in cooperation with more  trees, a general incorporated association operating forest conservation activities with Ryuichi  Sakamoto as representative. This initiative is aimed at helping to reduce CO2 by encouraging  tree thinning and domestic forest development. Tags printed with a message stressing the  importance of forest conservation are offered to apparel manufacturers and part of the tag  sales will be spent on forest conservation activities. This initiative takes advantage of the offset credit scheme known as J-VER, which was  established by the Ministry of  the Environment in 2008 (VER  stands for veri ed emission  reduction). Under the J-VER  scheme, greenhouse gas emis- sions reduction and absorption  achieved in forest conservation  activity and other projects are  veri ed and J-VER offset credits are issued. Each green FEP tag comes  with an emissions right of 250 grams veri ed and issued as a result of  more trees tree thinning, forest development, and other forest conserva- tion efforts.  In the future, the FEP will introduce this kind of know-how to many  different initiatives in a bid to further expand the platform of environmental  conservation activities in which manufacturers, consumers, non-pro t  organizations, and many different stakeholders are united.  In 2011, CO2 emissions were cut through the activities for saving Japans forests. Forests not only absorb and  xate carbon dioxide; they have many other functions as well,  including reducing  ooding, conserving soil,  and preserving biodiversity. These advan- tages are in fact indispensable to those of us  who live in urban areas, yet we tend to feel  that forests are distant from us. more trees  is working to provide opportunities to link  cities with forests from diverse perspectives.  We hope that the Fashion Earth PROJECT  will further bolster the links with forests  through fashion. If it eventually increases  forest cover, that would be fantastic.

Two projects have been in  progress in Minas Gerais and Tocantins of Brazil, which is  the world's leading producer of bioethanol, providing  about 30% of the world's supply. Bioethanol made from  sugar cane in these projects is more effective in terms of  reducing greenhouse gas emissions than that made from  other materials. It is therefore widely viewed as an  alternative for fossil-based fuel for transportation and  power generation in a tight market environment. It is also expected to become a potential petrochemical feedstock. We are planning to increase production of bioethanol in  the above two projects up to 500,000 kl/year. In addition,  we will develop the business further by extending our business to sugar sales as well as in-house power generation  fueled by bagasse, the pulpy residue of sugar cane, from which the surplus electricity can be sold. Bioethanol production plant in Santa Juliana The Chemicals Division is focusing on lithium-ion batteries, where demand is expected to grow for use in  electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles, with business  advances made to date in the area of component and  materials production. Through Simbol Materials, a U.S. company in which ITOCHU invested in June 2010, ITOCHU participated in  the production of high-purity lithium carbonate for  lithium-ion batteries (LiB). Simbol is developing and promoting operations whereby  lithium compounds are produced by extracting lithium  from used geothermal brine at geothermal power plants. Simbol's manufacturing technology is being further  developed and refined ahead of commercial production. High-purity lithium carbonate is used as a raw material  for electrolyte salts (LiPF6) used in electrolyte solution, one of the main components for LiB. It is used in LiB for  electric cars, for which a demand is expected to grow rapidly in the near future, as well as in stationary rechargeable  batteries and in the clean energy field.

In addition to direct support such as supplying baby food to infants in  neighboring villages and providing scholarships to junior and senior high school students, an agricultural park has been  established within the industrial park with the cooperation of Bogor Agricultural University, with programs conducted to instruct local farmers in the cultivation of high-value-added vegetables and catfish farming, as well as environmental  improvement. In addition, more than 10,000 seedlings that are grown in the agricultural park's nursery and planted in  the grounds of the industrial park or in neighboring villages, and support is also provided for local healthcare facilities.  Furthermore, by providing business opportunities, such as for production of the work clothes of the tenant companies,  we are working to contribute to the development of local small-scale businesses and to operate the industrial park with  close ties to neighboring communities.

LTD. have been supporting the Japan Self- Defense Forces in their peacekeeping activities in the Republic of South Sudan. The Japan Air  Self-Defense Force (JASDF) is conducting this peacekeeping operation under a United Nations Security Council resolution. South Sudan has absolutely no established social infrastructure due to its prolonged civil war.  The Self-Defense Forces are currently engaged in constructing critical infrastructure, including  roads and bridges, mainly in the capital of Juba under the direction of the United Nations. The role of the ITOCHU Group is to provide ground support at overseas airports for JASDFs  aircraft transporting equipment and materials to South Sudan. Since it covers a long distance  flying from Japan to South Sudan, the aircraft needs to make stopovers at several airports on  the way for reasons such as refueling, refilling water, and resupplying in-flight meals for crew members. Dedicated  companies provide these services, and ITOCHU staff visit the airports to coordinate matters with the airport authorities  and supervise service companies, together with the JASDF advance team. On June 11, 2012, a JASDF C-130H transport aircraft landed at its final destination of Juba Airport in South Sudan. I  (Mahmoud Fahmy) am a member of ITOCHUs Cairo Liaison Office, and had the task of looking after support services  at the airport. The aircraft stayed at the airport for just a few hours, but I had to spend a great deal of time in advance  coordinating matters through ITOCHU AVIATION between the airport service company in Juba and the JASDF  headquarters. I had to come to Juba three days prior to the arrival of the C-130H in order to receive the JASDF  advance team that came separately from Japan to prepare for the aircrafts arrival. Immediately after the aircraft  arrived at the airport, we had to check it, unload and load cargo, arrange transportation within the airport for the  crewmembers, and perform many other tasks. The aircraft took off from the airport within the scheduled time thanks  to the crewmembers well-disciplined work. I have learned many things from this experience. I now hope to apply them to my everyday job in Egypt in order to work even more efficiently. I am very proud that I can contribute to the global good through this work in South Sudan work twice a year as one of  the employees of ITOCHU. I would like to continue to support this peacekeeping operation in South Sudan, especially  since their people and I are human beings living on the same African continent.

In this  endeavor, we are conducting a demonstration project combining Smart Homes and Vehicle-to- Grid (V2G) business models as key components. Since the Fukushima nuclear power accident  in Japan, countries in Europe have been re-examining nuclear power generation as a source of  electricity. Along with the expansion of renewable energy, the construction of next-generation  power grids that are safer, more efficient and have a lower environmental impact has been accelerating. We believe that one of the key elements of this will be the construction of a distributed energy  network. Such a network would optimize the economic performance and safety of power grids.  It would use small-scale wind power, solar power and other forms of renewable power generation as the energy  source, as well as using electricity storage systems in homes, housing complexes and elsewhere, and electric vehicles  (EV) for storing power to compensate for the fluctuations in the amount of electricity that is generated via renewable  energy. ITOCHU and E.ON plan to work with EV manufacturers to jointly build an electricity service model for next-generation  power grids and a business model for the reuse of batteries. They will test optimal ways of using batteries and  performance degradation in the UK, Sweden and Germany using lithium-ion batteries produced by companies such as  EnerDel, Inc. in which ITOCHU has an equity interest. The Europe Machinery Group is cooperating broadly with E.ON in business fields related to a low-carbon society,  aiming to help create next-generation power grids with a small environmental footprint. E.ON Smart Homes and EV East Asia Bloc ICN and ILC Plant Trees and Make Donations to Aid a Local Community In the East Asia Bloc, since last year ITOCHU has been engaged in planting trees in Donghongyu Village of Fuping Prefecture, Hebei, some 300 kilometers from Beijing, and in  donating school supplies for local children. This year on April 14, about 80 people comprising employees and their family members from  ITOCHU (CHINA) HOLDING CO., LTD. (ICN) and ITOCHU LOGISTICS (CHINA) CO., LTD.

They knew that as well as providing the benefits of greenery, the walnut  trees will also help the local people in their attempts to pull themselves out of poverty. After theyd finished with the trees, the group visited a nearby elementary school to give the children some new books and 25 sets of stationery.  They were also able to chat with the children, who responded with smiling faces that took away all the accumulated days tiredness of the group. All the participants felt theyd spent a very worthwhile weekend. During a ceremony held for the donations, Shuichi Koseki, CEO of the East Asia Bloc, spoke about ITOCHUs mission,  which the Company has expressed as The ITOCHU Group respects the individual, society, and the future in its  Commitment to the Global Good. He added that he hoped the town would grow more beautiful and prosperous so that  the children could grow up strong and healthy in a good environment. Through these CSR activities, the participants could feel the lifestyles of a deprived local community that hasnt  experienced the abundant resources available in a city like Beijing, and could go on to grasp the reality of how  ITOCHUs mission of being Committed to the global good can benefit society at large. Moreover, the happy faces of  the local children strengthened the resolve of those of us involved with CSR activities to widen our support in the  future. Comment from Stakeholder The ITOCHU Group is both developing business activities in China and working to support the poorer  local regions. By means of these CSR activities,  contributing to tree planting and childrens education,  I can keenly feel that ITOCHU is a global company  making efforts in line with its strong sense of  responsibility.

In accordance with such resolution, in addition to the amounts  paid as shown above, 71 million was paid as retirement bene ts to 2 retired directors in April, 2011. On April 19, 2006, ITOCHUs Board of Directors established the Basic Policy regarding the Internal Control System, which was later  partially revised on May 6, 2011. ITOCHU intends to revise and improve the internal control systems tirelessly in order to build the  systems that are even more appropriate and ef cient. (For ITOCHUs Basic Policy regarding the Internal Control System, please see:  http://www.itochu.co.jp/en/about/governance/control/policy/)   The following highlights some noteworthy initiatives under the Basic Policy regarding the Internal Control System. The compensation paid to all directors of ITOCHU (excluding outside directors) consists of monthly compensation and perfor- mance-linked bonuses. The monthly compensation is determined by the contribution to ITOCHU of each director based on the  base amount set by its position, whereas the total amount of the performance-linked bonuses is determined based on consolidated   net income attributable to ITOCHU. Only monthly compensation is paid to the outside directors and bonuses are not paid thereto. Internal Control System Strengthening Risk Management ITOCHU has established internal committees and responsible  departments in order to address the various risks associated  with its business operations, such as market risk, credit risk,  country risk, and investment risk. At the same time, ITOCHU  has developed the risk management systems and methods to  manage companywide and speci c risks. Those include a  range of management regulations, investment criteria, risk   exposure limits, and transaction limits, as well as reporting and  monitoring systems. Moreover, ITOCHU regularly reviews the  effectiveness of its risk management systems. As part of such  efforts, the ALM Committee protects the ITOCHU Groups   assets through deliberations on balance sheet management  as well as analysis and management of risk. Initiatives to Further Enhance the Reliability of  Financial Reporting In order to further enhance the reliability of our consolidated   nancial reporting, Chief Operating Of cers, etc. are appointed  as Chief Responsible for Internal Control to establish a Group- wide line of responsibility. And the Disclosure Committee is  designated as a steering committee to maintain the internal  control system to comply with the internal control reporting  system.   Furthermore, following the March 2011 revision of the   Standard by the Financial Services Agency, ITOCHU formu- lated policies to streamline internal control designing and test- ing, and has been reinforcing its  devotion to more rational and  effective  designing and testing from the standpoint of risk- based  approach since  scal 2013.   Results of testing conducted by the Internal Control Testing  Department are fed back to each related unit and are used to  develop and maintain the adequate internal control.   This Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle enables ITOCHU to improve  and reinforce the internal control system.

These compliance officers are strengthening compliance by creating systems, conducting education and  training, responding to individual cases, and any other necessary measures based on directives and support from their  respective managers, as well as consideration of local laws, business characteristics, and operational formats. In addition, we conduct simultaneous corporate-wide Monitor & Review surveys every year and compliance attitude  surveys every two years. While checking the progress in implementing compliance measures at all ITOCHU Group  companies through these surveys and other opportunities, the ITOCHU Group is making a concerted effort to find  improvements that will enhance its well-developed systems for advancing compliance. Compliance System In fiscal 2012, On-Site Compliance Training was held for all Headquarters employees. This training, which was  intended to raise compliance awareness and prevent the occurrence of any cases, used actual compliance cases as  teaching materials. In addition, for key organizations, such as overseas offices and Group companies, we are  implementing activities with a focus on system operation such as on-site guidance with the objective of ascertaining  actual front-line compliance conditions and identifying risks. Based on trends in former incidences of compliance  violations and the findings of the Monitor & Review surveys, we are formulating individual compliance reinforcement  measures tailored to each Division Company, and these measures are steadily being implemented. Moreover, drawing  on actual incidents, we implemented meticulous education and training programs geared to employees in different  tiers. Moving forward, we will further advance these policies and measures, and continue to focus on compliance  reinforcement with an emphasis on overseas offices and Group companies. Group Promotion Structure Major Compliance Measures in Fiscal 2012 and Tasks for the Future 45 Corporate Governance and Internal Control/Compliance  Over the years, ITOCHU has sought to fight corruption by drafting regulations that specifically ban bribes and payoffs,  along with related guidelines, with the aim of supporting the broad prohibition of payoffs to public officials and others  in comparable positions worldwide. Anticipating more stringent regulations against bribery and corruption worldwide, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act (U.S. FCPA) and the enforcement of the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 on July 1, 2011, ITOCHU in June revised  its own aforementioned regulations and guidelines as a measure to enhance its own responsiveness in this area. Going forward, we will work to circulate information regarding the aforementioned revisions within ITOCHU and to  overseas blocs. At the same time, steps will be taken to conduct risk assessment and monitoring with respect to  payoffs, bribery and similar impropriety. ITOCHU has set out basic policy to tackle antisocial forces and groups that threaten the order and safety of civic  society, stipulating three basic principles plus one - Don't fear, don't pay, don't use, and don't associate - in its stance  against antisocial forces and 10-point guideline as a manual to disseminate this information among all employees. We  have also established a special department with overall responsibility for countermeasures in relation to antisocial  forces within the Human Resources & General Affairs Division. To prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons, Japan maintains strict trade- security under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act. To observe such laws and regulations, we have  implemented our own internal trade-security control program. Further, to ensure that we do not take part in business  transactions that threaten international peace and security, not only do we meticulously comply with existing  government laws and regulations, but we are voluntarily taking extra measures to ensure that our stakeholders and  corporate reputation are adequately safeguarded through our implementation of a comprehensive global security risk  management program. The potential intersection of corporate operations with global terrorism or the development and proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction can give rise to reputational and financial risks for ITOCHU and other companies with  extensive international business operations. Accordingly ITOCHU recognizes that, as a responsible member of society and the global business community, we need  to manage carefully the potential risks associated with business operations in certain locations. In response to the  growing field of corporate governance termed global security risk, ITOCHU has developed and implemented corporate  policies, procedures, and internal reporting structures to ensure that we perform rigorous, security-minded due  diligence with respect to projects and transactions in which security issues are implicated.

We are striving to practice these actions steadily and incorporated them into our basic policies for CSR promotion as 3.Strengthening supply chain management (Respect for human rights and consideration  for the environment). As part of our efforts to promote supply chain management, we established action guidelines in April 2009 in order to  have this philosophy penetrate the entire company and to clearly communicate ITOCHU's stance to suppliers. It is our  intention to present these action guidelines to our suppliers, to deepen the dialogue on human rights, labor and  environmental conservation, and to ask our suppliers to understand and practice ITOCHU's stance. Basic stance on supply chain management ITOCHU Corporation's CSR Action Guidelines for Supply Chains To fulfill the ITOCHU Credo, Committed to the global good, ITOCHU promotes CSR through its business  activities, with the aim of achieving a sustainable society. Due to the characteristics of its business activities, ITOCHU has to keep working to manage its supply chains,  taking into consideration the social or environmental impact of a variety of products and services handled. ITOCHU has established the CSR Action Guidelines for Supply Chains to explain its position to suppliers, and  expects and encourages their understanding and implementation of every item mentioned below. Suppliers shall respect the human rights of its employees, and shall not treat employees in an inhumane  manner.  1.  Suppliers shall not engage in forced labor or child labor.  2. Suppliers shall not practice discrimination in hiring and employment.  3.  Suppliers shall prevent unfair low-wage labor.  4.  Suppliers shall respect the rights of employees to organize and bargain collectively to promote smooth  negotiation between labor and management.  5.  Suppliers shall ensure that employees' working hours, holidays, and use of leave of absence are properly  managed so as to comply with statutory standards.  6.  Suppliers shall strive to provide employees with a safe and healthy work environment.  7.  In the course of their business activities, suppliers shall duly consider the need to conserve ecosystems as  well as local and global environments, and strive to prevent the occurrence of any environmental pollution.  8.  Suppliers shall observe all related laws and international rules, and ensure fair transactions and prevent corruption.  9.  Suppliers shall disclose information regarding the above items in a timely and appropriate manner.  10. 47  CSR Survey of Supply Chains ITOCHU develops various businesses around the world. In order to check the status of our various suppliers, we  conduct survey with a method suited to the characteristics of the goods of each Division Company, along with  mandatory questions on the ten items in our CSR Action Guidelines for Supply Chains. In addition to the ten items covering human rights, labor, and environmental issues, we added further items specific to  each Division Company. For example, we added check items for forest conservation for the Forest Products & General  Merchandise Division (lumber, pulp & paper); product safety items for the Food Company; and items on protection of intellectual property for our Textile Company. Each Division Company selects target suppliers and creates a survey  plan based on such parameters as high-risk countries, products handled, and transaction amounts by referring to the criteria of the FTSE4Good Index. Sales representatives or locally assigned ITOCHU employees of each Division  Company visit the suppliers, and survey them by means of interviews or questionnaires. In April 2009, ITOCHU established ITOCHU Corporation's CSR Action Guidelines for Supply Chains to clearly communicate its stance to suppliers.(Revised November, 2011) ITOCHU is promoting dialogue on human rights, labor  and environmental protection, as it seeks understanding and implementation of these action guidelines. Moving forward, in addition to conducting surveys of the actual situation and reviewing survey methods, ITOCHU plans  to continue this initiative. Sample checklist for a supply chain survey [Food Company] CSR Survey of Supply Chains 48 CSR in Our Supply Chain  In fiscal 2012, we conducted a survey, targeting not only suppliers of ITOCHU Corporation but also suppliers of overseas offices and Group companies this fiscal year again. As a result, we surveyed 401 companies, including 28  suppliers of overseas offices and 115 suppliers of 16 Group companies. No serious problems requiring immediate response were found in the survey results. We are committed to continually increasing our employees' awareness in our daily business and to improving the CSR  of our suppliers by continuing these surveys and dialogue with suppliers.

To this end, ITOCHU will proactively advance efforts to develop and strengthen human resources as the  management foundation supporting a commitment to taking assertive and forward-looking action. Our longstanding  promotion of a global human resources strategy also remains unchanged.  Policies and Tasks for Fiscal 2013 Fumihiko Kobayashi Executive Officer, General  Manager, Human Resources & General Affairs Division For ITOCHU Corporation, human resources are its greatest management assets as a  general trading company. Brand-new Deal 2012, our medium-term management plan launched from fiscal 2012,  outlines a variety of initiatives pertaining to human resources, such as cultivating  industry professionals and strong human resources. By executing the medium-term  plan and these measures, we intend to further enhance the structure that will support  utilization of our human resources, enabling our employees to demonstrate their skills  and abilities to the fullest.  50  Human Resource Development Supporting the Seeking of New Opportunities Human resources development policy and training details (excerpt) Human Resource Development Supporting the Seeking of New Opportunities Basic Structure of Human Resource Development Human resources are what support the stable, ongoing  growth of ITOCHU Corporation. Our human resource development activities are available  to employees throughout the Group, both domestically  and in overseas blocs. Based on each employee's work  experience and abilities, we strive to help them develop into professionals who play an active role in their business field and to provide them with the skills necessary to  manage business on a global level. Through individual evaluations and feedback, centered on  valuable job experience via on-the-job training (OJT), we  help to cultivate the motivation and willingness of  employees to increase their career opportunities within  the Group. To further support employees' self- development, we not only provide skills and knowledge  through training but also actively support career development. We will continue to invest substantially in  our human resources, while at the same time promoting  human resources development which is proactively led by  the front-lines.  A Variety of Training Schemes ITOCHU conducts a variety of training schemes that include essential training by position  and job class, as well as select and elective training. We have a wide range of programs  for the development of global management human resources, including global  development programs and workshops for managers. In 1999, we instituted a system  for sending new employees overseas as a means of fostering English proficiency and an  international perspective in young employees. In 2010, we launched a new program  designed to dispatch junior staff to China and other emerging markets for overseas  training in Chinese and other languages. Our plan is to develop candidates who will  become specialists in each target market in the future.  We also offer a wide range of training for specific objectives, such as Career vision  support training and distinctive training based on the human resource strategies of  each Division Company and Headquarters' administrative division, with the aim of  developing industry professionals of each business field with diverse values.

In Chun Jie (Chinese New Year), I was invited to a Chinese friend's home, and drank white liquor surrounded by  his entire family and relatives. We cooked dumplings and set off firecrackers at the moment of the New Year.  That was one of the memorable experiences that taught me what it is to be in China. Since returning to Japan, I have found that my experience in China is helping my business especially in  negotiations with Chinese clients, although there are still plenty of challenges. Learning the Chinese language enabled me to feel the momentum of the great country more deeply. I am very  grateful to have experienced this opportunity while I was still young. Junior staff overseas training for English I spent four months in Idaho, USA. In coming into  contact with many people from different cultures and  backgrounds, I felt and learned the importance of  understanding, respecting, and accepting each other's differences. This experience renewed my  determination to expand the realm of my  undertakings to the entire world. I am grateful to have been blessed with this  wonderful opportunity. Akiko Yoshida Corporate IT Architecture  Department IT Planning Division Junior staff overseas training for multi- language I spent half a year in Dalian, a city in Liaoning  Province, China, and learned Chinese. In the morning, I took classes at university, and in  the afternoon, I went to a language school for a one- on-one lesson. I was completely immersed in Chinese  throughout each of my days in China.

By fiscal 2011, we had taken steps to create a platform for promoting the  development and utilization of human resources worldwide, including the  development of a global human resources database and the establishment of  leadership standards for managers. From fiscal 2012, we are strengthening  our human resources strategy in core overseas markets such as China and  Asia. In addition, cooperating with each Division Company, we are implementing a Talent Management Process by preparing individual  development plans for talented personnel who will play key roles in the  expansion of revenues and profits overseas. Through these initiatives, we are  bolstering the recruitment, development, and utilization of personnel who will  contribute to global business development. Specific Initiatives Number of overseas bloc employees by region (As of March 31, 2012) We are inviting employees from our overseas blocs worldwide to come to our headquarters for  approximately two years as a form of HR development through actual operations. These employees are  provided the opportunity to learn business operations, gain a firm understanding of our corporate  philosophy and culture, and build interpersonal networks. At the same time, this initiative encourages our  headquarters to become more global in its outlook. (From April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2011, a cumulative  total of 54 employees have been dispatched.)  1.  We are assigning, promoting, and developing human resources on a global basis regardless of nationality,  using the ITOCHU Global Classification (IGC) as a common measure of job level / level of responsibility for  all jobs and positions worldwide.  2.  ITOCHU Mission and Values, which we have passed down since our founding more than 150 years ago, and  the ITOCHU Values have been incorporated into the human-resource requirements for ITOCHU leaders.  These requirements are reflected in our recruiting standards and our evaluation and human resources development programs and are passed on through in-house instructors. This enables us to hire and develop  human resources around the world who are suited to ITOCHU's values.  3.

To enable them to continue working with peace of mind and demonstrate their fullest  potential, ITOCHU has expanded and upgraded systems to help that are far and above those required by law. These  systems are available to both male and female employees, and provide support to them in their work as well as child  and / or nursing care duties. In 2010, we opened I-Kids, a childcare center for our employees, at a location close to our Tokyo headquarters. This  move was made in light of a widespread social issue where many children are currently waiting for entry to nurseries in  the Tokyo metropolitan area, and female workers face difficulties in planning their return from childcare leave. In  2011, in cooperation with the SECOM Group, we launched the Furusato Care Service to help employees posted abroad care for their elderly relatives (all expenses are paid by the company). As ITOCHU aims to increase overseas  revenues and profits, one of the key strategic approaches in its overseas policy is to increase the number of staff on  overseas assignment. The service helps keep our employees working overseas updated on the lives and health of their  elderly relatives living alone in Japan, helping our middle-aged employees to meet their work and nursing care responsibilities. Through this care service, we are working to establish an environment that enables employees to  concentrate on their overseas assignments.

Unfortunately, our  local day-care center was full, but thanks to I-Kids, I was able to return to work  last April. At first I felt uneasy about leaving my baby, who was less than a year  old. But after seeing how the nurses talk to my son a lot and treat him  affectionately, now I can't be more thankful. I am also happy that my son is  having many different experiences, such as receiving nutritional education.  Seeing my son smiling every day enables me to focus on my work and feel  secure. Comments from a user of childcare leave After consulting with my wife and supervisor, I took childcare leave in 2011, as I  had become interested in broadening my perspective by doing something I  hadn't experienced beforeâ€”raising a child. I am really thankful to the supervisor  and coworkers for their substantial support of my leave. Working with my wife to  raise our son has deepened our family ties. Another valuable asset is the  knowledge I have gained about the potential of childcare products and business.  Gradually, more and more of my male colleagues have begun to take childcare  leave. This should be a positive experience for them, as it will enable them to  gain new insight into their jobs. Acquired Kurumin Mark Certification In 2011, ITOCHU Corporation received approval from the Ministry of Health, Labour and  Welfare (the Tokyo Labour Bureau) to display the Next-Generation Certification Mark (affectionately known as Kurumin) after satisfying the criteria stipulated by the Act on  Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-Generation Children. (*) ITOCHU Corporation will continue its proactive efforts to develop an environment where  employees can stay motivated and find rewarding work. Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-Generation Children  The Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-Generation Children calls on  regional public-sector organizations to formulate and present local action plans to help  reverse Japan's rapidly declining birthrate. Meanwhile companies, based on the number of  employees employed, are mandated to formulate action plans of their own for supporting  employees in balancing work and parental duties, and submit a detailed summary of these  to prefectural labor bureaus. (Excerpt from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japanese only)  *  Birthday party at I-Kids,  nutritional education Human Resources & General  Affairs Division Yoshinori Kanayama  55 Employee Relations  The Career Counseling Center offers a wide range of counseling and support for diverse career stages, ranging from  new recruits to organization managers. Staffed by several employees certified as career counselors, the department  touches on an array of topics with its clients, including relationships with supervisors, junior staff and peers, approaches to work, and considerations about one's own future. A mechanism is in place in which all young employees  go to career counseling at certain milestones after joining ITOCHU as part of their training. A system is in place for all young employees to receive career counseling when they reach certain milestones in their ITOCHU careers, as part of  their training. Counseling is also available to mid-career employees as well as middle-aged employees looking to  continue working. The Career Counseling Center aims to provide ITOCHU employeesâ€”and through them, their  organizationsâ€” with the opportunity to develop their careers, as well as with a safety net. For ITOCHU Corporation, employees are assets, and thus the health management of every single employee is extremely important to ensure that a diversity of employees can freely exert their capabilities. We have developed an in-house system that allows employees to receive counseling on their health at any time. For  example, the Health Administration Center at ITOCHU's Tokyo Headquarters, which also serves as a clinic, has 20  specialist physicians on staff, as well as an X-ray technician and a pharmacist. These health maintenance professionals,  who each act as a health concierge, care for every aspect of health for each employee, providing them with the  support needed to manage their own health.  Where mental health is concerned, we have established a stress management room in-house, and have a system  where employees can talk at any time with a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist.  Regarding time management, we are also taking steps to prevent long working hours, including setting days at each business site for early dismissal from work. More specifically, we are strengthening our system for ensure proper time  management as a company, including utilizing an objective labor time management system based on building entry  and exit records. To ensure that ITOCHU Corporation employees stationed around the world and their families spend a meaningful assignment term in safety and good health, we have built a full system not only for incidents, accidents, disasters and  other emergencies, but also for health management. To prepare for emergencies such as diseases or injuries, including preventive measures for infectious diseases in the  dispatched area, we collaborate with multiple medical emergency service companies for a complete support system. Career Counseling Employee Health Management Employee Safety Measures 56 Employee Relations  Communications with Employees At ITOCHU Corporation, a wide range of issues is discussed with the labor union in order to realize our corporate  mission, Committed to the Global Good. In fiscal 2012, we held six meetings, including management meetings with  the President and similar meetings with Division Companies. Labor and management enter repeated and active  discussions to build up a healthy relationship that enables both sides to recognize and share challenges currently facing  them and to study and implement improvement measures. Dialogue Meetings with the President ITOCHU Corporation is proactive about offering employees opportunities for  two-way discussions with the president. Although Company-wide Employee Meetings have been held since fiscal 2001,  starting from fiscal 2011 these meetings have been divided into three sessions in an effort to deepen dialogue. In these discussions, the president shares  directly with employees the company's management policies and his passion  for their realization, while employees in turn can express their opinions to the  president and ask questions. The meetings therefore provide extremely  valuable opportunities for two-way communication. Recent meetings were  held in a very spirited atmosphere, and touched on everything from  management policies to more personal topics. Along with these domestic meetings, the president also has dialogue meetings  with our staff on overseas assignment, as well as overseas bloc employees  when he visits one of our overseas bloc areas. In fiscal 2011, the president  held meetings at our business locations in the United States, China, Taiwan,  and Australia, directly exchanging opinions with staff on overseas assignment  and overseas bloc employees about our management policies and other  topics. These meetings provide beneficial opportunities for both the president  and employees to deepen their communication.

As a labor union, we hope to contribute to CSR activities through active dialogue with ITOCHU, based on input gathered from a wide array of frontline operations.  Shuhei Kakinaka President, ITOCHU Labor  Union 58 Employee Relations  Promoting Human Resources Diversification in Japan  Promoting efforts to embed and utilize through numerical expansion and systems enhancement Promotion Plan on Human Resources Diversification 2013 (Japan) Since December 2003, ITOCHU has promoted efforts to diversify its workforce in Japan. The motivation here is a  recognized need to respond to changes in the external environment, such as intensifying competition spurred by  economic globalization and the race to secure human resources due to Japan's declining birthrate and aging society.  ITOCHU must also respond to the need to create new businesses, as well as address the disproportionate age makeup  of its workforce. In fiscal 2010, ITOCHU launched Promotion Plan on Human Resources Diversification 2013 (Japan), a new roadmap  aimed at enhancing individual and organizational abilities further by putting an environment in place that leverages  and utilizes the characteristics of each employee without regard to gender, nationality or age.  Under this new plan, we are working to create a more attractive company and corporate culture by supporting the  push to secure, embed and utilize more diverse human resources.  Number of male and female employees Promoting Human Resources Diversification in Japan  In 1987, ITOCHU Corporation established Itochu Uneedus Co., Ltd., as a special subsidiary based on the Disabled  Persons Employment Promotion Act (Law for the Employment Promotion of the Disabled) in order to create work  opportunities for those with disability. As of April 2012, the proportion of our workforce with disabilities is 1.92%, which exceeds the legally stipulated ratio of 1.8%. We will continue to actively support the participation in society by  people with disabilities.

Following our corporate mission Committed to the global good, we have identified five areas of focus in our basic activity guidelines. Basic Activity Guidelines on Social Contribution 1. Action on Global Humanitarian Issues As a globally active enterprise, ITOCHU Corporation shall take proactive approaches to  humanitarian issues around the world and help to build a better, more humane world.  2. Environmental Conservation ITOCHU Corporation shall vigorously pursue activities of environmental conservation and contribute  to sustainable social advancement.  3. Community Contribution As a good corporate citizen, ITOCHU Corporation shall construct favorable relationships, and  harmonize its business, with local communities. 4. Growth of Future Generations ITOCHU Corporation shall conduct activities to support the sound development of youth as  tomorrow's leaders and work for the emergence of fulfilling and vibrant communities.  5. Support for Volunteer Work by our Employees ITOCHU Corporation shall provide positive support for the activities of social contribution by each  and every one of its employees.  60  Social Contribution Activities We undertake long-term support for the reconstruction of areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake that  struck in March 2011. Support for Employees' Volunteer Activities In May 2011, to facilitate employee participation in volunteer activities, ITOCHU started to extend the period of  volunteer leave from three days to five, and introduced a system under which the company pays the actual costs for  participation (transportation, board, and other costs). As of June 30, 2012, a total of 120 employees had used the  system. In February 2012, we adopted an employee's idea and began Valentine fundraising. In March, we implemented  companywide fundraising activities to recognize the first anniversary of the Great East Japan Earthquake. During these  efforts, the current status of affected areas was reported through exhibition of panels, and employees shared an  understanding of the importance of continuing support. Funds raised were combined with the matching donation from  ITOCHU and used for supporting reconstruction of schools via the Nippon International Cooperation for Community  Development, and as grants-in-aid for libraries in affected areas via the ITOCHU Foundation. In January 2012, as a  new form of support, ITOCHU contributed Funds for Supporting Children Orphaned by the Earthquake to the three  prefectures affected by the earthquake via Japan Foreign Trade Council, Inc. The Great East Japan Earthquake Recovery Assistance Site Support for the Great East Japan Earthquake Recovery  Yuichi Yasura, volunteered in February 2012 Temporarily transferred to ITOCHU CHEMICAL FRONTIER Corporation Thanks to everyone's support, there are sufficient supplies of material goods.  However, there is still a lack of volunteers. At first, many people came, but as  time has passed that number has dwindled. At this point it is not possible to  predict how many years it will take. That was the opinion recently voiced by the  people of Rikuzentakata and Kesennuma. Hands are something basic that we  all have, but right now there is a shortage of them. When we work together the  capabilities of the united group are greater than the sum of our individual  capabilities. I would defi nitely like to participate again. With other volunteers In May 2011, ITOCHU launched a new website, the Great East Japan  Earthquake Recovery Assistance Site, on its intranet to share information on  the support activities of ITOCHU employees and the ITOCHU Group itself. Posted on the website are up-to-date information on the Group's assistance  programs and employee volunteers, updates from the Tohoku Branch on local  conditions, reports submitted by volunteers and more. We intend to use this  site to keep employees informed about support activities for fostering  recovery over the long term. 61 Social Contribution  Activities for Supporting Affected Areas Implemented with Shareholders In fiscal 2011, ITOCHU began an initiative to switch from sending out notices of the company's ordinary general meeting of shareholders and other printed matter by post to e-mail delivery for shareholders of ITOCHU who agree to  electronic delivery of shareholder information, and to donate the cost savings in paper and postage, which are combined with a matching donation from ITOCHU, to the ITOCHU Foundation's 100 Children's Books Subsidy project. In fiscal 2011, more than 7,500 shareholders agreed to the initiative (as of March 31, 2012) and ITOCHU donated a  total of 15 sets (one set consists of 100 books for children) to 13 volunteer organizations acting in areas affected by  the Great East Japan Earthquake. Books were donated to 13 volunteer organizations, including Tulip Bunko (Minamisoma-shi, Fukushima), Hoiku Mama  no Kai Grandma (Shiwa-gun, Iwate), and Ehon Yomikikase no Kai "Omusubi Kororin" (Shibata-machi, Miyagi) TOCHU has promoted social contribution activities aiming for the sound development of young people since setting up  the ITOCHU Foundation in 1974. The foundation develops programs that match the needs of the times, such as current  two major projects; subsidizing the development of children's literature collections (including subsidies for library  development at schools and supplementary schools for Japanese nationals overseas), and promoting the development  of an e-book library. Providing Subsidies for Children's Literature Collections Promoting the Use of E-Books In fiscal 2011 the Foundation began to promote the development of an e-book library that utilizes PCs for children with disabilities who are unable to read conventional books. The Foundation has revised the scope of this project, which is  now focused on making it easier to read for more children. The Foundation has provided, at no cost, 38 works to 501 locations throughout the country, such as schools for children with special needs. ITOCHU Foundation In fiscal 2012, children's literature collection subsidy activities included not only  subsidies for the purchase of children's books and the 100 Children's Books Subsidy but  also emergency support for areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake. In addition, the Foundation has aggressively provided subsidies for library development  at Japanese schools and supplementary schools overseas. This support has been provided to 56 schools. Subsidizing the Development of Children's Literature Collections Students at a Japanese  school in Guatemala hold  books sent from the  ITOCHU Foundation Number of subsidies Subsidies for purchase of children's  books 37 (of which, 1 overseas)  Subsidies for purchase of children's  books for hospitals 8                                    100 Children's Books Subsidy 32 (of which, 11 overseas) Subsidies for libraries at Japanese schools / supplementary schools 52 (of which, 52 overseas) Emergency support for areas affected  by the Great East Japan Earthquake 6                                    Total 135 (of which, 64 overseas) 62 Social Contribution  For humanitarian reasons, we donate money and provide supplies for the emergency relief of people affected by  natural disasters. By collaborating with local branch offices and related organizations, we provided the following aid. Recent examples Providing Aid to Areas Affected by Major Natural Disasters Flooding in Thailand 30,000,000 Earthquake in Turkey 5,000,000 Typhoon-Hit Philippines Approx 5,000,000 Support for Manila Hemp Plantation Rehabilitation Project On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the  establishment of our Manila branch in 1912, in June we  signed a project agreement with the Fiber Industry Development Authority of the Department of Agriculture  and the St. Ann's Family Service Cooperative, a local  agricultural cooperative. The project has begun in August  2012, and ITOCHU will donate 2 million, the amount  needed to plant and grow 90 hectares of Manila hemp (about 144,000 plants), which is scheduled to be completed by  March 2014. In addition, the project is expected to absorb approximately 18 tons of CO2 a year. Support the House for Youth in Philippines of NGO Kokkyo naki Kodomotachi (KnK) We support the activities of Kokkyo naki  Kodomotachi (KnK: meaning Children without Borders),  an NGO that supports street children, children who are  victims of major disasters, and other children in  developing countries. On December 11, 2009, renovating  was completed for House for Youth, made possible  through support from ITOCHU. Located in the outskirts of  Manila (Philippines), House for Youth is a home that helps  young people become independent. It was also put to effective use as an emergency evacuation center when  typhoons hit the Philippines in September 2009. Moving  forward, the home will provide a wide range of support to approximately 1,000 young people per year. House for Youth Children participating in the  100th anniversary  celebration of ITOCHU  Corporation's Manila  branch 63 Social Contribution  KnK Reports From the Philippines Our corporate cafeterias in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya are TFT partners. People who order a meal from a TFT Healthy  Menu at these cafeterias can automatically donate 20 yen per meal, which is included in the price. The donated money  is sent to the WFP via the TFT secretariat and used for the WFP's school meal program. KnK's support activities in the Philippines based around House for Youth are  growing. In addition to housing 14 children, House for Youth is also used as a  venue each month for computer skills training, a youth development program  and development seminars for mothers. We aim to continue using House for  Youth as a base for expanding our community activities to support youth and  people living in slums. Together with the staff  members of KnK Support Activities for the World Food Programme (WFP) With the hope of alleviating hunger and poverty worldwide, we have been serving as a council member of the Japan Association for the WFP, a nonprofit organization that  focuses on building support in Japan for the World Food Programme (WFP) and its  hunger relief operations. In May 2012, employees of ITOCHU Corporation and ITOCHU Group companies  participated in End Hunger: Walk the World, held in Yokohama. This is an annual event  to raise money and awareness for the WFP's efforts to fight child hunger and  malnutrition. At its Tokyo Headquarters as well, ITOCHU regularly engages in activities  such as fundraising and holding panel exhibitions for introducing the WFP's activities. Participated in End Hunger:  Walk the World TABLE FOR TWO (TFT) Fighting to Fix the Food Supply Imbalance between Developing and  Developed Countries Opening of Eco Shop Pavilion in KidZania Tokyo In April 2012, ITOCHU opened its Eco Shop environmental pavilion in KidZania Tokyo, a  facility for children to experience diverse types of work, presented from the standpoints  of fostering future generations and environmental conservation. The theme of Eco Shop is the global environmental effort called the MOTTAINAI  Campaign. Visitors to the pavilion can create original products such as a My Furoshiki  Wrapping Cloth, Eco-Bag for Shopping, and My Chopsticks to Carry Along, all using eco- friendly materials. For each child creating an original item at the Eco Shop, an amount equivalent to the  cost of one tree sapling is donated to the Green Belt Movement, a tree-planting activity  in Kenya. The activities seek to help children learn to cherish their possessions and  understand global environmental issues through their fun experience at the Eco Shop. It  also aims to cultivate their awareness of the need to voluntarily participate in activities  for solving these issues.  The amount equivalent to  one tree sapling for  planting will be donated to  the Green Belt Movement  for each child who  participates. 64 Social Contribution  ITOCHU employees take part in community cleanup activities around our Tokyo Headquarters. As members of the local community, they clean up the street and distribute items for raising awareness by cooperating with the local residents'  association and staff of other companies in the area. ITOCHU participates in the Campaign to Deliver Picture Books organized by the Shanti Volunteer Association. Participants in this campaign affix labels showing text translated into local languages, such as Cambodian, on  corresponding pages of Japanese picture books, and send the books to local children as gifts. This campaign allows  participants to engage in volunteer activities while enjoying the books. ITOCHU employees of all ages, both men and  women, are working to produce these books.  Since May 2008, we sell bread from the Swan Bakery every Wednesday in the employee cafeteria at the Tokyo head  office. The Swan Bakery was established by the Yamato Welfare Foundation with the aim of encouraging employment  for people with disabilities at reasonable wages. Extraordinarily popular, the bread baked for the day sells out in an  instant every time. ITOCHU Baseball Class As part of nurturing young people, thinking that we want to give disabled children the  opportunity to challenge themselves in a variety of activities, and that we would like to  help create opportunities for them to explore their own potential, we have sponsored the  classes since 2007. The instructor Kazuya Yano, former pitcher for the Yakult Swallows, covered a lot of  ground, from sportsmanship, basic movements and other fundamentals that are difficult  to master by practicing at home, to catching fly balls and practicing pitching. Expressing  a common sentiment, one child who participated said, I am happy because it was the  first opportunity for me to use some of this gear. From now on I want to practice more.  The event is very popular with everyone including the children, their guardians and the  volunteers.

The new employees cast their votes to choose four proposals that will be presented to a board of  examiners, including our chairman Eizo Kobayashi, for the final decision. Then, ITOCHU Foundation and the new  employees will develop the chosen project into more specific form and finally put it into action as a relief activity. ITOCHU KOREA personnel participate in tree planting for the next generation. Participation of ITOCHU volunteers in a booth at Earth Day 2011 Tokyo. Packing of Uru-Uru Packs for supporting the regions hit by the Great East Japan  Earthquake (Nagoya) April On April 5, packing work for Uru-Uru Packs to be offered  to victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake took place  in Tokyo. An Uru-Uru Pack is a set of relief supplies for  one person, such as cosmetics for women and stationery  items for children, put into a package so that they can be easily distributed in the affected areas. Six staff members  of the ITOCHU Group took part in the work. On April 16, a total of 26 people, including ITOCHU KOREA employees, their family  members, and clients, participated in a voluntary tree-planting activity. Each participant  planted four coastal pine seedlings. Planting of coastal pines helps block wind and dust  from the sea and contributes to local communities and to the environment. All  participants finished the day feeling very fulfilled. On April 23-24, Earth Day 2011 Tokyo took place in and around the Yoyogi Park as an  event for thinking about the global environment. A large number of organizations joined  as exhibitors. From ITOCHU Corporation, four employees staffed the booth of a non- profit organization (NPO) that is calling for action to step global warming, giving visitors  explanations on power saving that can be done in the home and giving away bamboo candles. May On May 7-8, packing work for Uru-Uru Packs to be sent to  victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake took place in  Nagoya. Eight volunteers from the Nagoya Branch,  including family members, volunteered to do the packing.  Containing stationery items and lunch boxes for children, 2,000 Uru-Uru Packs were delivered to the town of  Shichigahama in Miyagi Prefecture. 66 Social Contribution  A Fureai Nature observation meeting at the Institute for Nature Study The First Saitama Farm Volunteer Activity (rice planting) Cooperation with short-term homestay of Chinese university students ITOCHU staff members acting as Business Volunteers after the Great East Japan  Earthquake Extracurricular activity for third graders of Minato Municipal Aoyama Elementary School:  Looking at the local community from a height On May 15, a nature observation meeting took place at  the Institute for Nature Study with the participation of 12  staff members from the ITOCHU Group. After attending  an ecology seminar entitled A Life-or-Death Scramble for  Light, the participants observed nature in the garden of  the Institute. A participant commented that he had not  realized that there was such a rich natural environment in  Meguro. On May 22, the first Farm Volunteer Activity for 2011 took  place with 41 participants from among the ITOCHU Group  employees and their families. The participants planted  rice seedlings. This series of activities has the aim of  making parents and children aware of the challenges involving in growing rice and of the importance of  agriculture through a year-long rice growing experience in  which chemicals are not used. June Twice a year, ITOCHU Corporation cooperates in a short-term homestay program for  groups of Chinese university students visiting Japan. For two days, specifically on June  4-5, one of our staff members accepted one such student at home. As part of its efforts to support employees wishing to  engage in volunteer activities, ITOCHU Corporation  introduced some of its staff members to the Workers'  Volunteer Program organized by the Joint Committee for  Coordinating and Supporting Voluntary Disaster Relief  Activities, offering to subsidize their participation in this  program. In June, the first group of seven staff members  took part in work in Iwate and Fukushima under the program. Each year, we accept third graders from the local Aoyama Elementary School as an  extracurricular activity. This year, 21 schoolchildren visited our office on June 9 to view  their community from the top level of the building. 67 Social Contribution  Disaster relief project led by new employees in fiscal 2011: Offering bookmarks with  messages from all of us Blood donation and marrow donor registration drive at Tokyo Head Office Held on June 28, the blood donation meeting at our Tokyo Head Office attracted 129 applicants. Meanwhile, 14  volunteers signed up with the Japan Marrow Donor Program. The Second Saitama Farm Volunteer Activity (weeding in rice paddies) Donating baseball equipment and holding a baseball coaching session for children  affected by the disaster New employees' participation in the first local cleaning activity From among the four shortlisted proposals made at the  training session for new employees in April, ITOCHU  Corporation chose the Minna Happy Project. For this  project, we prepared bookmarks with messages and pictures and put them in books to be offered to children  in the affected zones. On June 17, the first 50 picture  books with bookmarks carrying messages from our new  employees were delivered to the Tampopo Nursery School in the city of Koriyama in Fukushima Prefecture. July On July 3, the year's second farm volunteer activity took  place in the city of Saitama, with 30 participants  comprising ITOCHU Group and their family members. At  this event, the participants entered the rice paddies  where they had planted rice previously and removed  weeds. Every participating volunteer became covered in  mud. Because herbicides are not used, weeding is  required to ensure that the rice grows well. At the next event, the participants will reap the rice. ITOCHU Corporation's baseball club has been supporting children affected by the Great  East Japan Earthquake by, for example, donating baseball equipment to a boys' baseball  team in the Iwate Prefecture city of Rikuzentakata. On the weekend of July 2-3, some  20 leading members of the baseball league of 10 trading companies, including our own  club, held a baseball coaching session for about 150 elementary and junior high schoolchildren in the city of Iwaki in Fukushima Prefecture. On July 7, the Aoyama 2-chome Community Association  held a cleaning activity with the participation of 25 of our employees who joined us in fiscal 2011. Wearing identical  windbreakers, they worked together with the community  association, the Minato City Government, the Akasaka  Police Station and neighboring businesses in picking up  trash, giving warnings to illegally parked bicycles, and  guiding pedestrians at crosswalks. Our new employees are expected to take part the activities in turns. 68 Social Contribution  ITOCHU Charity Concert for Earthquake Disaster Reconstruction. Continuing to support employees' volunteerism in the wake of the Great East Japan  Earthquake. New employees participating in second local cleaning activity ITOCHU scholarship students workshop and voluntary conservation The 3rd Saitama Farm Volunteer Activity (rice reaping) On July 19, the ITOCHU Charity Concert for Earthquake Disaster Reconstruction was  held at the Denryoku Hall in Sendai. On the day, about 1,000 visitors, including ITOCHU  Group employees, their families, business partners, and victims of the disaster, enjoyed  a performance by the New York Symphonic Ensemble. All proceeds collected from the  audience on the day was donated to the Kiwanis Club of Sendai Children's Fund. In the wake of the Great East Japan Earthquake, ITOCHU  Corporation has been providing support for employees  wishing to take part in volunteer activities, in addition to  corporate aid in the form of relief money and relief  supplies. In July and August, 11 employees in Tokyo took  part in the Workers' Volunteer Program and three others  in a program run by the Kansai Economic Federation. September Nineteen new employees for fiscal 2011 took part in a  cleaning activity on September 1 organized by the  Aoyama 2-chome Community Association. In this event,  participants weeded the sidewalks and issued cautions to  illegally parked bicycles together with the community association, the Minato City Government, the Akasaka  Police Station, and local businesses. Among other tasks,  weeding had to be done in sweltering weather, which left everyone perspiring profusely. The work was done very  efficiently in collaboration with the community association personnel. On September 10, 52 students receiving scholarships  from ITOCHU Corporation to study at universities in Japan  visited our Tokyo Head Office for a workshop and a social  gathering with our staff members. On the following day,  September 11, they engaged in voluntary activities for  environmental conservation at the Tokyo Port Wild Bird  Park. In the very hot late-summer weather, they picked  up trash and helped improve the tidelands together with park volunteers. The event helped deepen exchange among scholarship students and provided a good opportunity to make our CSR activities known to them. On September 11, the third farm volunteer activities in  2011 took place in the city of Saitama. A total of 53 participants, comprising our staff's family members and  group companies' staff members, first listened to famers  about the significance of organic farming, then actually  cut rice ears. After realizing how tough farming was,  everyone made sure to leave no leftovers at lunch. 69 Social Contribution  Workshop for infant safety by the Japanese Red Cross Society New employees participating in 3rd, 4th, and 5th local cleaning activities The 3rd Borneo Tree-Planting Tour Cleaning activities On Thursday, November 10, some of our new employees took part in cleaning activities around the Tokyo Head Office.  These constitute part of the new employees' activities for maintaining good relations with local communities, launched  in fiscal 2011. This 6th event in the series involved 21 new employees. Sixth graders from Aoyama Elementary School visit ITOCHU for extracurricular activities. On September 28, the Japanese Red Cross Society held  an infant safety workshop at our Tokyo Head Office. The  attendees learned how to deal with accidents that can  occur in everyday life amid infant growth, how to use the  automated external defibrillator (AED), and how to deal with infants in the event of disaster. October On October 6, 17 and 18, a total of 32 new employees who joined us in fiscal 2011 took  part in cleaning activities organized by the Aoyama 2-chome Community Association and  the Akasaka Regional City Office. Specific activities varied depending on the day,  ranging from picking up trash to issuing cautions to unlawfully parked bicycles, but the basic principle was to clean the district in collaboration with the community association,  the regional city office, the Akasaka Police Station, and participants from local  businesses. As many of our staff members take part in the activities, we earn both high  expectation and appreciation from the community association and the regional city office. November On November 2 to 7, 14 staff members of the ITOCHU Group held a tree-planting  experience on the island of Borneo. This program takes place every year as part of  Activities to Restore the Tropical Rainforests and Conserve Borneo's Ecosystem launched  as a 150th anniversary commemoration program. The participants had the opportunity  to plant trees on site and observed the steady growth of trees planted in the past two years. On November 25, 28 sixth graders from Minato Municipal Aoyama Elementary School  near our Tokyo Head Office visited ITOCHU as part of their extracurricular activities.  They listened to explanations on solar power generation that we were promoting while  visiting the solar power station on the rooftop. They also heard about our activities for  restoring tropical rainforests on the island of Borneo and learned ways to combat global warming. 70 Social Contribution  The 5th ITOCHU Baseball Workshop Cooperation in homestay of Chinese university students participating in the 9th THE  CHINESE STUDENTS VISIT JAPANESE ENTERPRISES and FEEL JAPAN Project Post-earthquake voluntary aid activities by ITOCHU staff Visit by sixth graders from Aoyama Elementary School for extracurricular activities Blood donation through the Japanese Red Cross Society On Monday, December 19, a blood donation session took place with the Japanese Red Cross Society. Eighty-nine  volunteers donated blood and two registered as marrow donors. Taking place twice a year, these sessions will be  continued in the future. December We organized another baseball workshop for children with disabilities at the Meiji Jingu  Gaien Indoor Ball Park on Saturday, December 3. We organize one such workshop every  year to encourage the sound development of local youth and good relations with local  communities. The children were delighted to be in an indoor ballpark that is normally  used by professional baseball players. They had fun running, defending, and hitting the ball. A program that invites Chinese university students to Japan and lets them stay a night  with Japanese company employees was held for the ninth time. Five ITOCHU  Corporation employees accepted Chinese students and their families enjoyed an  exchange with the students on December 3-4. Twice in December, a total of 25 employees in the  ITOCHU Group participated in voluntary activities for  earthquake disaster relief operations in the city of  Rikuzentakata. Nine months after the massive earthquake, demand for volunteers was shifting to  reconstruction purposes, but volunteers are still needed.  All participants met with local residents and engaged  enthusiastically in collaborative work. On December 16, sixth-grade schoolchildren from Aoyama Elementary School visited  our Tokyo Head Office. In late November, their teacher asked them what they would like  to do if they became managers in the future. The children thought carefully about it and  presented their results. Their presentations were on five points: changing the world,  environmentally friendly recycling, new technologies for reducing CO2, helping the Earth  and humanity with local consumption of locally produced energy and electric power storage as a means of reducing CO2. All showed very adult thinking, even though they  had the voices of children. 71 Social Contribution  Reports on Social Contribution Activities (From January to March, 2012) Community Cleanup of Aoyama-dori Taiwan Business Partner Donates Blankets to Ogatsu-cho District of Ishinomaki City in  Miyagi Prefecture Fund-Raising Campaign on St. Valentines Day January On January 19, first-year employees of ITOCHU Corporation participated in a community service cleaning  up a segment of Aoyama-dori (a major thoroughfare) in  the vicinity of the Tokyo Head Office. This was the ninth  time the first-year employees cleaned the sidewalk and  gutter as part of the social contribution activities they  launched for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012. On  this occasion, despite the cold weather, a group of sixteen young women from ITOCHU joined neighborhood  organizers, local police and volunteers from other companies in the area to clear the street of debris and hand no- littering reminder leaflets out to passersby. A troop of thirteen volunteers from ITOCHU Group company CI Shopping  Service Co., Ltd. also lent a hand to participate in the social contribution activity. In all, more than 30 volunteers from  the ITOCHU Group showed up, including the organizers, much to the gratitude of the other participants. They were  offered warm words of praise for a job well done from the passersby and the police on guard at the Crown Princes  palace. It was a cold day out, but we were all warmed by the sense of com-munity we felt as we participated in the  cleanup. Soon after the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred last  March, Eastern Microelectric Lab Inc., an ITOCHU  business partner in Taiwan, donated about 1,500 blankets  to ITOCHU as emergency relief supplies. Although this  was a warmhearted act of support, a huge amount of  blankets had already been given by bodies in Japan and  overseas, and at the time it wasnt possible for us to  deliver this donation immediately to the stricken area. However, the first winter since the earthquake came round. On  the two days this year of January 21 and 28, we delivered these warm blankets directly into the hands of local people  with the help of an NPO active in the area called Sweet Treat 311. The blankets were given to people living as  evacuees in their homes and the residents of temporary housing complexes at nine locations centered on the district of  Ogatsu-cho in Ishinomaki City in Miyagi Prefecture. On these two days, some ITOCHU employees volunteered to join in  and give out the blankets. ITOCHU continues to sincerely hope that this region can fully recover as quickly as possible. February A fund-raising campaign titled Lets Send Love to  Devastated Parts of the Tohoku Region by Donating Our  Money took place at ITOCHU Corporations Tokyo Head  Office and Osaka Head Office on February 14, which was  St. Valentines Day. This campaign started with the idea  of sending money kept for buying gifts for St. Valentines  Day and the so-called White Day (a Japanese invention  for returning St. Valentines gifts) to people in affected areas, conceived by volunteers among ITOCHU employees,  and spread from them to people in the entire company. At the Osaka Head Office, volunteer ITOCHU employees collected goodwill donations energetically in elevator halls and  at their respective places of work in the morning and at lunch time. At the Tokyo Head Office, many ITOCHU  72 Social Contribution  Employees Volunteer Activities for Supporting Areas Devastated by the Earthquake and  Tsunami  Miyagi Prefecture Thanks ITOCHU for Its Post-Earthquake Support with a Letter of  Appreciation In-House Fund-Raising Campaign on the First Anniversary of the Great East Japan  Earthquake employees began donating their pocket money to the fund-raising campaign during their lunch break, spurred by the  first donation President and C. E. O. Masahiro Okafuji made as the first thing in the morning. ITOCHU will donate  378,817 yen raised through this campaign to a public service corporation called Nippon International Cooperation for  Community Development (NICCO), which has been undertaking reconstruction support activities in Miyagi and Iwate  prefectures since the period immediately after the earthquake and tsunami, requesting the aid-supplying corporation  to apply the donations to programs for supporting schools in devastated areas. ITOCHU Group employees engaged in volunteer work for supporting areas devastated  by the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami from February 16 to 19. It was the  third round of such support activities the ITOCHU Group had launched last December. On this occasion again, a group of 10 ITOCHU employees worked hard at a support site  in Rikuzen Takata City, Iwate Prefecture, during the daytime, undaunted by a low  February temperature. They assisted reconstruction by eating and drinking at a  restaurant in Kesennuma City, Miyagi Prefecture, at night. All participants in this third round of support activities were ITOCHU Group employees, but most of them met others in the volunteer group for the  first time. The 10 volunteers became one team from the first day and kept working as hard as they could for three days. ITOCHU will continue these support activities by volunteer employees. On February 21, Vice Governor Masahiro Wako of Miyagi Prefecture visited ITOCHU  Corporations Tokyo Head Office to hand a letter of appreciation for support ITOCHU had  provided to the prefecture since the period immediately after the Great East Japan  Earthquake. Representatives from Yayoi Foods Co., Ltd., an ITOCHU Group company  continuing to support manufacturing activities in Kesennuma City, Miyagi Prefecture,  also came to the Tokyo Head Office on this day. Concerned ITOCHU officials and the  Yayoi Foods representatives listened to various topics Vice Governor Wako covered in  his speech, including on-site progress toward reconstruction and the need for sustained assistance. On the occasion,  Vice Governor Wako also thanked the ITOCHU Group for its continuing practice of sending volunteer employees to a support location within Miyagi Prefecture on a regular basis. March On March 12 and 13, one year and one day and one year and two days after the Great  East Japan Earthquake, ITOCHU Corporation organized an in-house fund-raising  campaign based on its policy of sustaining support for areas devastated by the giant  earthquake and tsunami. The campaign raised 638,171 yen (including donations made  at ITOCHUs Tokyo Head Office and Osaka Head Office), thanks to a high level of  interest employees expressed. One ITOCHU employee who cooperated in this campaign said, One year has passed  since the earthquake, but news programs I saw gave me the feeling that we must support affected areas much longer.  Ill keep doing what I can. ITOCHU plans to add the same amount to the final campaign result and donate their sum to programs for supporting  the affected areas. 73 Social Contribution  Employees Volunteer Activities for Supporting Areas Devastated by the Earthquake and  Tsunami  ITOCHU Group employees engaged in volunteer work for  supporting areas devastated by the Great East Japan  Earthquake and tsunami twice this month, first from  March 15 to March 18 and second from March 22 and  March 25. A total of 25 ITOCHU Group employees took  part in these two rounds. The two work occasions  represented the fourth and fifth rounds of such support  activities by ITOCHU volunteers. Poor weather restricted their activities at times, but the ITOCHU Group employees  who took part in the two rounds worked together to carry out their activities, such as scooping rubble from gutters. 74 Social Contribution  Social Contribution Programs to  Commemorate the 150th Anniversary Activities to Restore the Tropical Rainforests and Conserve  Borneo's Ecosystem A worldwide issue, the striking decline and deterioration  of tropical rainforests and the accompanying collapse of ecosystems was pointed out at the United Nations  Conference on Environment and Development (UN Earth  Summit) held in Brazil in 1992, but even today it has not stopped. In addition, it is also said that the destruction of  forests is a source of the increase in CO2 that is a cause  of global warming. A worldwide issue, the striking decline and deterioration  of tropical rainforests and the accompanying collapse of ecosystems was pointed out at the United Nations  Conference on Environment and Development (UN Earth  Summit) held in Brazil in 1992, but even today it has not stopped. In addition, it is also said that the destruction of  forests is a source of the increase in CO2 that is a cause  of global warming. The island of Borneo (Kalimantan) is a tropical rainforest region extending across the three nations of Malaysia,  Indonesia and Brunei. With a surface area that is approximately 1.9 times that of Japan, it is the third largest island in  the world. Ranked with the Amazon, the island of Borneo is considered a treasure house of biodiversity, but recently development 75  has made headway and some of the tropical rainforests have been damaged to the degree that it is not possible to  preserve the ecosystem with natural regenerative power alone. This program is designed to assist with the regeneration of these damaged rainforests. In the northeast of Borneo, at North Ulu Segama in the state of Sabah in  Malaysia, where ITOCHU supports an area for rainforest regeneration, WWF, the international conservation  organization, is collaborating with the Forestry Department of the State Government of Sabah, to carry out  reforestation of an area of approximately 2,400 hectares. Within the area, the ITOCHU Group is supporting the  regeneration of 967 hectares. The land in question is also a habitat for orangutans, an endangered species. The reforestation not only protects the orangutans ; it is linked to the protection of many living creatures whose habitat is  here. Reforestation of 432 hectares had been completed as of the end of December 2011, and reforestation of all the 967  hectares are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2012. It takes a long time to regenerate a tropical rainforest. Five years alone is not enough. However, taking this  opportunity, both employees and Group companies are cooperating, aiming to regenerate a forest where the animals  can live in peace. Program Description Recipient Japan Term From FY2010 to FY2014 (five years) Location Borneo (North Ulu Segama, Sabah, Malaysia) Area 967 hectares (approximately half the size of Minato Ward in Tokyo) Contribution A total of 250 million yen (including donations from Group companies) Tree-planting We will plant species of trees that are appropriate to local conditions with the focus on  the local Dipterocarpaceae species. We will plant trees and undertake maintenance for  a period of five years. Employee  volunteering We are involved in local forestation activities (tree-planting, cutting undergrowth),  wildlife observation, and other activities by employee volunteers, including those from  Group companies.

The Forest of the  Orang-utan, an Endangered Species WWF Program Outline Objective To undertake reforestation of an area of 2,400 hectares with high  conservation priority and requiring human intervention due to severe deterioration in the state of Sabah, Malaysia. The Significance of the Location A diversity of plants and indigenous species, including the orang-utan, inhabit  the island of Borneo, which is a treasure house of biodiversity. To cite one  example, the orang-utan, the mammal that is the symbol of Borneo, is an  endangered species of primate that only survives on Borneo and Sumatra. In  2005, WWF established areas of particularly high priority as habitats for the  orang-utan on Borneo: three areas on Indonesian territory and in Sabah,  Malaysia. The five areas listed below (in order of importance), in Sabah, are of  particular significance. The decline in the headcount for native orang-utans is caused by the overall  decline of forested areas as well as the splitting off of forested areas. Securing  the habitat is directly linked to the preservation of the forest ecosystem on Borneo. Orang-utan habitat  WWF Japan All Rights Reserved. Region area (km2) headcount Ulu Segama Malua 3,000 5,000 Kinabatangan north 1,400 1,700 Tabin Wildlife Reserve 1,200 1,400 Kinabatangan lower reaches 400 1,100 Kulamba Wildlife Reserve 210 500 Significance of the Activities In the most important area of Ulu Segama Malua (USM), logging for timber started in the early 1960s but was  stopped as of January 2008 with the State Government of  Sabah inviting WWF Malaysia to join the team that will  produce a ten-year plan for USM forest management. In  this way, the opportunity for protection is increased and  the work can go ahead in an environment where it is easy  to promote conservation activities to achieve the following  four goals. To protect the biodiversity and genotype by restoring  the Dipterocarpaceae forests in the lowlands where  many species survive.  1.  To secure for the long term a habitat for large  primates and endangered species.  2.  To save indigenous species from the crisis of extinction.  3.  To secure for the long term an environment where  the separated forests are linked together to allow wild  animals to move over a wider range and to secure  food.  4.  Ulu Segama-Malua  WWF Japan All Rights Reserved. 77 Social Contribution Programs to Commemorate the 150th Anniversary  Tree species Below is a list of some of the common tree species being planted. Location In Ulu Segama, and particularly in North Ulu Segama  where deforestation is severe, there are approximately 90  orang-utans, but, since the deterioration is too severe,  there is no prospect for forest regeneration without  human intervention such as planting trees and clearing  the undergrowth. It has been decided to restore 2,400  hectares of forest in this area. The Ulu Segama area is a  forest reserve where commercial use is allowed and, as is  the case with other forest reserves, the Sabah Forestry  Department (SFD) owns the land. WWF has already  established a local officer here and have a team in place  to monitor the orang-utans.

We introduce here the fascinating natural environment the participants encountered and their thoughts about the tour. The gateway to tours of Borneo, Kota Kinabalu is a growing commercial  center with a population of approximately 300,000. The tour starts from  this city. WWF-Malaysia also has an office here. Comments from participants For the first time, I realized that tree-planting is not just about planting  something in a place where there are few trees, but you have to consider  the species of trees to plant, and calculate the ratios and spaces between  them before planting. Also, if you don't do a good job of covering the  area around the roots with soil when you plant a tree, water will collect  there and cause the roots to rot and wither. Even if the tree takes root  safely, I learnt that it needs continued maintenance, and once again I became aware of the hard work of all the staff involved in this work, and  that reforestation is not easy. Kota Kinabalu 79 Social Contribution Programs to Commemorate the 150th Anniversary  This is the reforestation area for this project. We are supporting 967  hectares (approx. 207 times the size of the Tokyo Dome) for forest  regeneration. By the end of September 2011, approximately 424.19  hectares (approx. 44%) of forest had been planted. Comments from participants On the journey to the reforestation area, plantations for the palm oil  industry extended endlessly all the way to the entrance to the managed  area, and even the managed area for reforestation was second and third generation forest where raw wood had been logged and left unattended.  We cannot use the pretext of forest protection to apply unilateral  pressure on the industry that has brought economic growth to Malaysia,  but I felt that we could perhaps propose different methods of protection.  It takes a long time to regenerate a forest, but the shortest way is  precisely when more people empathize with these feelings. I hope that  these tours will continue and that more people will feel empathy. Comments from participants I was a little doubtful about how to go about tree-planting. I imagined  that we would dig the holes ourselves, but in fact the local WWF staff dug  the holes for us ahead of time, and we only had to plant the saplings that  were ready for us. However, planting the trees on slopes where the  foothold was bad after the rain, and crouching in very little space to tamp  down the clay-like soil was certainly not easy work. It took me 45  minutes to plant eight trees. As I planted, I wished for each of the trees to grow large and give food to the orangutans. Perhaps as a token of  gratitude for my wish, on the way back, we had an encounter with a  family of wild orangutans. This is a popular location for cruises on the Kinabatangan River, and a  place where you can come across many wild animals such as crocodiles  and proboscis monkeys. Comments from participants We were lucky to have encounters with a family of wild orangutans and  the adorable Borneo's pygmy elephants. On Borneo, there are a lot of  animals and plants that we cannot see in Japan, birdcalls I have never heard before, and an abundance of insect sounds, and I had a strong  impression of a place that is actually rich in biodiversity. To have been  able to share in activities to protect this rich natural environment  together with the other participants is a precious memory. Sandakan is the second city after Kota Kinabalu. It flourished as trading  post and as the heart of British North Borneo until 1947 when the capital  was moved to Kota Kinabalu. Comments from participants With our own eyes, we saw water villages and other lifestyles you never  see in Japan as we traveled by bus to a temple on a hill for the views  over the beautiful ocean. There, we could see the scenery of old houses  densely packed on the boundary between ocean and land. Looking into  the distance, we saw nothing but the dark green of tangled jungle. Words  are not adequate to describe the calm of that place.  North Ulu Segama Sukau Sandakan 80 Social Contribution Programs to Commemorate the 150th Anniversary  As of the middle of December 2011, 432.13 hectares (approx. 45%) of forest  had been planted. At present, the remaining areas are in the process of  reforestation, and the expectation is to have completed the tree-planting by the  end of 2012. After that, maintenance work at the site will continue until July  2014, and from then on, the site will be left to grow naturally. Tree-Planting Tour Itinerary Day 1 11/3 Haneda (departed previous day on late night flight) â€“ Kota Kinabalu (Borneo) (WWF  office) â€“ Lahad Datu Day 2 11/4 Lahad Datu â€“ Ulu Segama (planting site) â€“ Sukau Day 3 11/5 Sukau â€“ Sandakan â€“ Sepilok Day 4 11/6 Sepilok (Rehabilitation Center) Day 5 11/7 Sepilok â€“ Sandakan â€“ Kota Kinabalu â€“ Haneda Reforestation Status as of December 2011 The Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre, which returns orangutans on the  verge of extinction to the wild, is located here. Comments from participants We visited the Rehabilitation Center where I learned that orangutans  share 96.4 per cent of their DNA with human beings. Once again, I had a  solid sense of how very similar and close orangutans are to human  beings. However, orangutans do not have the power to regenerate the  forests. The ITOCHU reforestation program is a very important activity to  help with that, and once again I experienced the significance of the  program. I look forward to the day when orangutans living in the wild will  sleep and eat in the tops of the trees that we planted. Sepilok 81 Social Contribution Programs to Commemorate the 150th Anniversary  After arriving at Kota Kinabalu,  we visited the water village We stopped off in a bird  sanctuary Bird-watching Lecture at the local WWF office To Lahad Datu by propeller plane Tension in the air at the meeting before  leaving for the tree-planting site We are off to the tree-planting site Tree-planting Report Day 1 (November 3) After a late night flight from Haneda, we arrived in Kota Kinabalu early in the morning. We visited a nearby bird  sanctuary, and then at 9:00 a.m. we headed for the WWF-Malaysia office where we heard a lecture about forest  protection techniques, its importance, current progress status, and methods for surveying the orangutans,  followed by a lively question and answer session. After that, we transferred by propeller plane to Lahad Datu. Day 2 (November 4) Last night there was a tropical squall typical of the rain forest climate and we were worried about being able to  do the tree-planting for the day. By the morning, the rain had more or less stopped, but everyone was looking a  little tense until the last meeting at the hotel had finished, and we finally got underway. We left the town and  passed through the palm tree plantations until we finally arrived at the tree-planting site. 82 Social Contribution Programs to Commemorate the 150th Anniversary  Listening to the explanations by  local WWF staff  The planting site We put our hearts into planting Working on the steep slope Lots of smiles despite the hard  work Underneath a sapling planted  last year Commemorative photo shoot  in front of the signboard After planting, we were lucky to have  an encounter with a wild orangutan At the reforestation site that ITOCHU supports, we were all able to verify the growth of the saplings planted by ITOCHU employees last year and the year before. This time, the area for planting was divided into five sections,  and we planted 20 saplings in each section. Everyone worked hard on the steep slope to plant the saplings, one  by one and eight meters apart, carefully covering them with soil. 83 Social Contribution Programs to Commemorate the 150th Anniversary  A tree planted in November 2010 Had grown this tall by November 2011 Looking for animals along the  river on a morning cruise A morning cruise on the big  river Discovering wild lizards Cruising through the jungle Encountering a wild pygmy  elephant A wild proboscis monkey in a  tree Arriving at Sandakan View of Sandakan from the hilltop Growth Status of Planted Trees Day 3 (November 5) Once the tree-planting was completed, we transferred by bus to Sukau where we stayed the night at a lodge  along the Kinabatangan River. We went on a river cruise where we saw a lot of wild animals. (We had a warm welcome from orangutans, proboscis monkeys, pygmy elephants and lizards) 84 Social Contribution Programs to Commemorate the 150th Anniversary  At the orangutan Rehabilitation Center We encountered orangutans Megumi Kosaka Corporates & Partners,  Fundraising & Marketing  Division, WWF Japan The third tour has finished without any difficulties thanks to the participants as  well as everyone involved at the office. Once again, I would like to thank you for  your support. This year, I accompanied the tour and through exchanges with the participants, I was surprised at how everyone in the ITOCHU Group has a high level of awareness of wildlife protection and the preservation of the global environment, and as a participant I listened to the conversations with a great sense of appreciation. Despite being tired after traveling overnight, everyone listened enthusiastically when local WWF staff explained the project, and I was impressed by the numerous questions after the presentation. With the active attitudes of the employees of the ITOCHU Group, a leader in global business development, I felt confident that we were in good hands. On the night before tree-planting, there was a violent thunderstorm, and we worried about being able to do the tree planting, but perhaps because everyone's enthusiasm was sky- high, we were blessed with good weather on the day, and were able to finish all  the planned tree-planting work. In the hot and humid environment, planting even  a few saplings was hard work, and it was really impressive to see how everyone maintained very serious expressions as they carefully planted one tree after another. We might even say that having the good fortune to see a mother and child orangutan appear at the tree-planting site was nature's way of saying thank  you, and perhaps a miracle that everyone performed together. Day 4 (November 6) After walking through a rainforest facility run by the Forestry Department of Malaysia in the morning, we visited  the orangutan Rehabilitation Center at Sepilok for a video presentation and to watch the orangutans feeding. A passion that performs miracles 85 Social Contribution Programs to Commemorate the 150th Anniversary  Establishing the ITOCHU Scholarship Fund Assisting Non-Japanese Students to Lead the Next Generation To celebrate the 150th anniversary of its founding, ITOCHU Corporation  established the ITOCHU Scholarship Fund in 2009 in order to reduce the  financial burden during their study in Japan for foreign students in Japanese  universities. This support will enable them to better focus on their academic  work, while encouraging these students to contribute to the development and  strengthening future ties between Japan and their home countries. Each year the scholarship will be awarded to 20-30 foreign students in their  third and fourth year, who are currently enrolled in Japanese universities.  Each student will receive 1.5 million per year (3 million per student over 2  years). As part of this program, students are not only provided financial assistance via  the scholarships, but are also given an opportunity to gain a deeper  knowledge about ITOCHU Corporation by taking part in our Company's CSR activities, including volunteer work, and attending lectures on ITOCHU's businesses and international operations. These and other steps are part of the Company's plans to proactively encourage interaction with these students  from abroad. On September 10, 2011, the Company had the opportunity of gathering 52 of  those students at the Tokyo Head Office to teach them about the Group's  various CSR initiatives, including in relation to the environment. The next day,  on September 11, ITOCHU employees and these students joined forces at the  Tokyo Bay Wild Bird Park to pick up trash along the beach and build bamboo  tidal barriers for maintaining the mudflats comprising this wild life preserve.  The work took place amid very hot weather, but provided an excellent  opportunity for the scholarship students to develop an appreciation for  ITOCHU's CSR activities while socializing among one another. Through these activities supporting foreign students, whom will one day be  leaders, ITOCHU is helping to develop and strengthen ties between Japan and  their home countries in the future. At the same time, this scholarship fund serves as one of ITOCHU's international social contributions as a truly global enterprise.

In addition, to fulfill our corporate philosophy Committed to the Global Good, we have  established the ITOCHU Group Environmental Policy. Now, we advance our corporate management and activities on a  global scale under this policy, not only to contribute to the prosperity of the present generation, but also from the view  point of what we can create to pass on to the next generation, while keeping a strong awareness of global environmental problems. I . Basic Philosophy Global warming and other environmental issues are affecting the future of mankind. As a global enterprise,  ITOCHU Group is positioning these issues as one of the most important management policies. ITOCHU Group  contributes to the realization of a sustainable society by promoting Actively addressing the better global  environment based on The ITOCHU Group Corporate Code of Conduct, in order to achieve the goals of The ITOCHU Group Corporate Philosophy, Committed to the Global Good. II . Activity Guidelines In keeping with the basic philosophy presented above, ITOCHU Group pursues a continual improvement of its environmental management system and defines the following guidelines concerning activities of environmental  conservation. The ITOCHU Group Environmental Policy (1) Prevention of environmental pollution In all business activities, duly consider the need to conserve ecosystems  and biodiversity, as well as local and global environments, and strive to prevent the occurrence of any environmental pollution. (2) Observance of laws and regulations Observe all domestic and foreign laws and regulations related to  environmental conservation, along with other requirements to which we  have subscribed. (3) Promotion of  environmental conservation  activities Besides promoting activities for conservation of energy and resources as  well as reduction and recycling of waste as needed to establish the recycling-oriented society, endeavor to develop and supply products and services that help to conserve the environment. 87  May 2010 Masahiro Okafuji President & Chief Executive Officer ITOCHU Corporation is active in Japan and internationally, offering a wide range of products and services, developing  resources, and investing in businesses. Our activities are closely related to global environment problems. We believe that a company cannot grow sustainably without awareness of these problems. In 1990, we created a  Global Environment Department, and in April 1993, we documented our environmental activity guidelines in the  ITOCHU's Activity Guidelines on the Environment (the predecessor of our Environmental Policy). In 1997, these guidelines were revised to the ITOCHU Corporation Environmental Policy and we have subsequently revised this  policy several times, in order to keep up with changing demands over time and reflect them in the Policy's expression.  We also made the following two revisions in May 2010. (4) Harmonious coexistence  with society As a good corporate citizen, aspiring for the prosperity of succeeding  generations and positive contribution to society in general, support local  communities for environmental education and assist in basic research  pertaining to conservation of the global environment. (5) Promotion of educational activities Educate both our own employees and those of Group companies in order  to raise their awareness of environmental conservation and improve the  quality and effectiveness of associated activities. ITOCHU Corporation's Stance on the Environment We changed the name from the ITOCHU Corporation's Environmental Policy to The ITOCHU Group Environmental  Policy, in order to express clearly that our commitment to environmental issues is shared throughout the ITOCHU  Group, rather than just by ITOCHU Corporation.  1. We revised the Activity Guidelines in our current Environmental Policy, in order to make it clear that our commitment goes a step beyond conserving ecosystems, to conserving biodiversity as well. The expression was  thus changed from conserve ecosystems to conserve ecosystems and biodiversity.  2.  88 Our Initiatives for the Environment  Environmental Management ITOCHU Corporation has formulated an Environmental Policy covering the entire ITOCHU Group. ITOCHU is aware of  the impact that its business activities may have on the global environment. We have thus built a framework for  assessing the impact of the products we handle, and in particular before making new investment, in order to prevent  environmental risk. In 1997, ITOCHU Corporation became the first trading company to establish an environmental management system  (EMS) based on ISO 14001, and we continue to work to improve our EMS. The system's aim is to comply with  environmental laws and regulations, and take precautionary approaches to environmental risks. Specifically, the  system controls and manages targets through a yearly PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycle of setting targets for preventing environmental risk; evaluating and analyzing progress; and acting to achieve our targets. Our president has the ultimate responsibility for ITOCHU Corporation's environmental management organization. The  president appoints a CAO & CCO who has complete authority for the environmental management system. Concrete  management work is carried out by the CSR Committee, established to review environmental policies and perform  Environmental Management System ITOCHU Corporation's Environmental Management Organization 89 Our Initiatives for the Environment  annual reviews of corporate-wide activities. The CSR Promotion & Global Environment Department of the Corporate  Communications Division serves as the CSR Committee's secretariat. Environmental managers, assigned to each division that is subject to environmental audits (59 total in fiscal 2013), and assisted by eco-leaders (260 total as of  June 18, 2012), are responsible for promoting environmental conservation in their respective divisions. In fiscal 2012, In-house environmental audits based on ISO 14001 were carried out in 64departments. Findings from  the audits, conducted over roughly six months, are instrumental in taking precautionary approach on the  environmental risks. Audit teams are comprised of members of the CSR Promotion & Global Environment Department  and employees qualified to serve as In-house environmental auditors (423 registered individuals), and carried out their  work with an emphasis on auditing legal compliance. We have applied a new auditing approach - a combined format in  which two or three departments were audited at once. This approach not only boosted audit efficiency but heightened  audit effectiveness by encouraging mutual understanding of other departments. Each year, ITOCHU is inspected by the Japan Audit and Certification Organization for Environment and Quality (JACO)  in connection to ISO 14001 certification. The fiscal 2011 inspection was to retain certification, and is performed in the  first and second years of certification. Inspections in the third year are to renew certification, after which the cycle  repeats itself each year. The outcome of the inspection was an overall improvement grade and continued  certification, based on an acknowledgement of ongoing system improvement efforts by ITOCHU. Internal Environmental Audits Results of External Inspections 90 Our Initiatives for the Environment  Precautionary Approach to Environmental Risks In addition to evaluating environmental risks of the products we handle, we are committed to taking a precautionary approach to environmental risks. This commitment also extends to ITOCHU Group companies, reflecting the need to  identify the impact on the global environment of the business activities of the Group as a whole. We handle a wide and diverse range of products on a global scale. We thus carry out our own original environmental impact evaluations based on our belief that it is vital to evaluate the relationship of these products to the global  environment. We use a so-called LCA (*) -based analysis method at all stage of product life cycle from procurement of  raw materials, production, and use, through disposal of products. If the evaluation shows that the impact on the global environment by particular products exceeds predetermined benchmarks, then we create manuals and the concrete  procedures to manage transactions of these product. ITOCHU Corporation and its subsidiaries in Japan employ a CSR and environmental checklist for investments to  evaluate in advance the market, social and environmental impact of business investment projects entered via M&A in  Japan and overseas. When specialist insight is needed, ITOCHU calls on specialized external bodies to render an  advance inspection of the project. Action on the project then moves forward once inspection results and the presence  of no major problems are confirmed.  Evaluating Environmental Risks Posed by Products Handled LCA (life-cycle assessment) is a method that evaluates the environmental impact of products at all stages of their life cycle,  from manufacturing, transport and use through to disposal and recycling or reuse.  *  Fact-finding Investigations of Group Companies Inspecting the  management of parts  containing regulated substances, at our Auto  Parts Distribution Center in  the United States We began fact-finding investigations of our Group companies after several of them received complaints about environmental pollution from their surrounding neighborhoods in 2001. We analyze about 200 of our 393 Group companies (as of March  31, 2012) with relatively higher levels of impact on the global environment, and conduct  investigations of about 20 of them per year. Over the 11 years to the end of March  2012, we did on-site investigation at 164 companies (230 worksites). The evaluation is  made using Q&As between auditors and management, inspections of plants,  warehouses, and other facilities, surveys of wastewater released into rivers, and  assessments of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Evaluating the Environmental Impact of New Investment Projects 91 Our Initiatives for the Environment  In the year ended March 31, 2011, we received a total of 21inquiries from outside the Company, which were broken  down as follows: environmental groups (3), industry (10), government (3), ratings and evaluation agencies (3), and  media (2). The inquiries are mainly about the Company's measures to address environmental problems. There were no  environment-related incidents, problems, lawsuits or complaints against the Company. Meanwhile, the number of  consultations from within the Company and ITOCHU Group companies has increased. Various environmental education  programs have led to greater environmental awareness among employees. We fielded 144 inquiries regarding Japan's  Waste Management and Public Cleaning Law, and 9 inquiries regarding business investments.  Environmental-Related Consultations (Year Ended March 31, 2012) 92 Our Initiatives for the Environment  Promotion of Environmental Education and Awareness We are committed to improving the environmental awareness of the entire ITOCHU Group. To encourage  environmental conservation efforts among our employees we offer a wide range of education programs, as well as  seminars on environmental law, and seminars to raise awareness of global environmental issues, which also target  Group employees. We actively hold seminars in order to ensure that all employees of the ITOCHU Group are aware of and comply with  the requirements of environmental laws and regulations, and in order to raise environmental awareness. Internal seminars (fiscal 2012 results) Seminars (Number of people) Legal seminars Times held Total participants Seminars on Waste Management and Public Cleansing Law 13 1,527 Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act 2 271 Global Environmental Management Seminar In January 2012, ITOCHU sponsored a seminar on global environment-oriented business management at the Tokyo Head Office. The seminar was led by invited speaker Hiroshi  Komiyama, Chairman of the Mitsubishi Research Institute and advisor to the president of  the University of Tokyo. Mr. Komiyama gave a speech titled Recreating Japan: Toward  the Realization of a Platinum Society. The seminar was attended by 250 employees of  ITOCHU Corporation and its affiliates. Mr. Komiyama spoke from many different perspectives about the need for a new industry and social system for monozukuri, an area where Japan is very strong, as a  solution to the problems that Japan and the rest of the world currently face or will face  in the future, including environmental issues, energy and resource problems, the aging  of the population, food self-sufficiency, and other concerns. He also spoke about the  roles that general trading companies are expected to play, as well as the functions these  companies can fulfill. The seminar was aimed at helping the ITOCHU Group strategically  facilitate its business activities related to environmental conservation. More than half of participants said that the seminar gave them many ideas that could lead to business  opportunities. The stimulating speech certainly provided a lot of food for thought. Mr. Hiroshi Komiyama,  Chairman of the Mitsubishi  Research Institute and  advisor to the president of  the University of Tokyo 93 Our Initiatives for the Environment  Co-existence with Society As a good corporate citizen, aspiring for the prosperity of succeeding generations and positive contribution to society in general, support local communities for environmental education and assist in basic research pertaining to conservation  of the global environment. ITOCHU has supported basic research by the University of Tokyo's Center for Climate System Research (reorganized as  the University of Tokyo Climate System Research System from fiscal 2010) since 1991, and holds an annual ITOCHU  Symposium as a forum for publicizing the center's research findings. The symposium, which marked its 20th anniversary in fiscal 2011, was held at the Osaka Head Office in March 2012 and was attended by 52 people. Professor  Masahide Kimoto gave a speech titled Has Climate Information Reached a Useful Level? This was a good opportunity  for our colleagues to consider the many different factors in global warming and their consequences. Summer School Programs on the Environment Every year since 1992, we have been organizing Summer School Programs on the Environment at the  Tokyo Head office, mainly targeting elementary school  students of Minato Ward, Tokyo. The aim of these programs is to promote environmental education among  Japan's next generation and coexistence with society. On November 25, 2011, an environment class was held at  the Tokyo Head Office for 28 sixth-year students from  Aoyama Elementary School. The visitors headed up to the  roof of the Head Office building to see our solar panel,  which was a newly included program, then listened to a discussion on topics such as tree-planting activities on the island of Borneo. The students were interested in our  power-generating equipment-something they rarely see up close-and in the report about the rapid tropical  deforestation on Borneo. After their visit, the students gave an environmental presentation on December 16 attended  by around 20 ITOCHU employees, who listened avidly to the elementary schoolchildren's suggestions. We plan to  continue and improve our community-oriented programs, such as this environment class for local elementary schoolchildren.

In addition, since fiscal 2012, it has expanded the scope of the collection  of environmental performance data to understand the actual environmental situation and improve its environmental  conservation activities in the future. Scope of the Data Participation in Challenge 25 Campaign ITOCHU Corporation is a participant in the national Challenge 25 Campaign (*)  to mitigate global warming. This campaign includes such initiatives as  adjusting the air conditioning temperatures during the summer and winter,  turning off lights when they are not needed, and setting computers to a  "hibernation" mode when away from the desk for extended periods. It also  encourages the separation of trash inside the office and promotes recycling.  As a result, all employees act to protect the environment starting with the  little things around them every day.

The change on amount of securing gray water may be caused by the rainfall every year so that city water usage tends  to increase when the rainfall is a little. Therefore, we take care of saving water to install the devise for economize hand washing water and flushing in toilets. Tokyo Metropolitan Government Program to prevent Global Warming ITOCHU Corporation submitted the Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Plan for FY2006 to 2010 to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, in accordance with their Ordinance on Environmental conservation. In the plan, we  committed to reduce CO2 emissions in the Tokyo Headquarters by 4.1%, compared to the benchmark (the average of  annual CO2 emissions from FY2003 to 2005), during the period between FY2006 and FY2010 ITOCHU emitted 7,549  tons of CO2 in FY2010 with the reduction rate 18%, compared to the amount of the benchmark. (Data for FY2011 will  be reported to Tokyo Metropolitan Government in November 2012 after they are complied.) Those below submitted to Tokyo Metropolitan Government are available in Japanese.

As a general trading company, ITOCHU Corporation consists of a diverse range of business fields, such as textiles,  food, and energy, and each industry has very different sustainability issues. In keeping with this business structure,  ITOCHU is implementing different action plans for each Division Company, by setting different CSR targets for each  Division Company. This can be evaluated as a realistic approach with substantial benefits. On the other hand, standards such as the United Nations Global Compact and ISO 26000 look for initiatives to tackle  universal issues facing modern societies, such as human rights and labor practices. These initiatives are reflected in  the corporate policies (page 4), as well as in the correspondences with each of the themes in ISO 26000 (page 8), and  these policies encompass all of the action plans for each individual company. This seems to be an excellent and  realistic measure, but in future if any of these universal issues might be better pursued laterally throughout  ITOCHUthen we would like to see ITOCHU consider incorporating these into a corporate-wide action plan. We also sense a huge future for the action plans for the business activities of each Division Company. We would like to  see ITOCHU further enhance this initiative through dialogue, by organizing information (such as the expected positive  and negative impacts on society following from the business strategies of each Division Company) in a way that is easy  for stakeholders to understand the key points. ITOCHU Corporation is engaged in various kinds of business projects around the world, and has considerable influence.  This makes it extremely important for ITOCHU to keep track of the impact that it is having on society, and to take  concrete steps to address these issues as necessary (due diligence). It would appear that there is due diligence that  can and should be done precisely because ITOCHU is a global trading company. In developing due diligence policies,  perhaps ITOCHU could start by clarifying the stance and concept that ITOCHU is attempting to integrate CSR into its  business management. ITOCHU Corporation has adopted the United Nations Global Compact and ISO 26000 as basic indicators of CSR, and  has indicated this on page 8 of the CSR Report, Core Subjects of ISO 26000 and Our Initiatives. Looking at this  section, it would appear that further improvements are expected, including an explanation of organizational  governance, but this message demonstrates an understanding of the trend in international corporate social responsibility, and is a good guidepost for promoting CSR. CSR reports have started to change from being reports mainly focusing on the strong points of the company, and are  gradually becoming reports that also touch upon the negative aspects of the impact that the company's business has  on society, and how the company is working to solve these problems. Here negative aspects does not refer to so- called scandals but rather to the negative aspects that accompany corporate business activities. As the reporting stance changes in this way, this sincerity is conveyed to society, and the dialogue between the  company and society becomes steadily ever deeper. The CSR Review Forum-Japan suggests that ITOCHU Corporation  take steps in this direction. 1. ITOCHU Corporation's CSR Promotion 2. Basic stance towards reporting 99  1. Supply chain management  Supply chain management is a major problem that is common to the CSR of modern international corporations.  ITOCHU Corporation selects suppliers based on important indicators (such as whether they are located in high-risk  countries, the products they handle, and the value of the transactions), and then conduct investigations as well as  indicating supply chain principles and checklists, and the results of the investigations. This is an advanced example of  supply chain management for a general trading company. We propose the following measures in order to increase the effectiveness of these investigations.  The report indicates that no serious problems were found in the factual investigation but if the circumstances  of the factual investigations in a few countries were to be shown in addition to disclosing the data then readers would be able to catch a glimpse of whether the responses to the questionnaires were simply going through the  motions, or whether concern for day-to-day business is given too much precedence, for example.   The overall picture would be easier to understand if it were indicated (using tables, for example) that business  investment recipients are also subject to supplier investigations as well as product vendors, and if information  such as the different results for vendors and investment recipients were also included in the report.   In the future, ITOCHU could consider creating organizational structures where by either someone responsible  for CSR or a third party conducts on-site inspections to hear feedback from the local community, NGOs, labor  unions, and so on.  If progress can be made in these areas we believe that this will probably lead to the creation of the kind of due  diligence befitting a company such as ITOCHU, as discussed in Part 1. above. 2. Human rights In the international community, human rights are becoming mainstream as an issue of corporate social responsibility. ITOCHU Corporation is aware of this point, and describes its respect for human rights on pages 9 and 10, where its  policy in relation to human rights is indicated. In order to put this concern for human rights, labor and so on into effect, it is necessary to incorporate it into the mechanisms of business activities. For example, we recommend a policy  of creating mechanisms whereby questions such as whether human rights have been taken into account, or whether plans are based on human rights due diligence can be checked using checklists at the planning stages of various  business projects. At the same time, what is demanded is an intrinsic understanding rather than just standards for appearance's sake, and it is important to continuously enhance human rights education and training. Furthermore, it is also important for corporations to think about structural human rights violations against employees  and others that may result from organizational structures and business operations. We would like to see ITOCHU  create organizational structures that can objectively check whether human rights are being violated at the  organizational level when decisions are made in relation to whether or not go ahead with organizational changes or  business projects. 3. Labor practices 1) Labor environment Everyone knows that the people working for general trading companies find themselves in a challenging business  environment, but if ITOCHU can demonstrate a stance of earnestly working to improve the environment for the people  working in this difficult environment then these efforts will almost certainly be well-received by society. From this perspective, we would like to see ITOCHU develop more concrete initiatives in relation to issues such as the  status of local employees in countries and non-permanent employees that provide labor for the ITOCHU Group and the  consideration given to such employees, the advancement and treatment of women, and health and safety (including  mental health). On the other hand, initiatives such as career counseling are positive examples, and we would like to  have seen more specific information presented. Moreover, given that relations between labor and management are a key aspect of labor practices, it would be  desirable for these relations to be treated independently rather than being simply included in a general report about  communication with employees. In connection to this issue, it is highly significant that head of the labor union has  been introduced and given an opportunity to make comments. 3. Particulars 100 Third- Party Opinion  2) Diversification of human resources In contrast the clear policies and measures for diversifying human resources globally, it was not clear from the report  what ITOCHU is trying to do about diversity in Japan (page 54). A good way to do this might be to indicate the goals in  the Promotion Plan on Human Resources Diversification 2013, and to compare actual achievements to these goals. Moreover, aid and recruitment of minorities and the socially vulnerable is the key to diversity. Creating an environment  where employees can be themselves, and an environment that provides them with opportunities to participate actively  and show their full potential would appear to be important both in terms of business strategy as well as in terms of  corporate responsibility. 4. Environment Previously environmental impacts were only tracked for the headquarters, but the scope of tracking has now been extended to cover the group companies, and this step forward deserves a special mention even if it is somewhat  mundane. By tracking the entire group, it will become possible to focus effort on those individual businesses where it is  most needed. In the future we would like to ask for the scope of data collection to be expanded even further, and for  efforts to be made to minimize the environmental impact at those workplaces with the greatest footprints.  In addition, the information relating to the environment are scattered throughout the report, which leave a weak  impression. It would be good to see innovations such as giving a broad treatment in a preceding paragraph of the main  sentence and then presenting a diagram showing the full picture. We hope to see ITOCHU demonstrate its awareness  of the latest important issues (such as measures to address biodiversity in business operations) from a due diligence perspective. 5. Coexistence with society Promoting businesses that help solve social issues (part of the basic policies for CSR promotion) is the thing that is  most demanded when working in each country. The report on the pulp business in Brazil traces the full lifecycle from  tree planting through to processing and retail, so that it was easy to understand the nature of the coexistence with the  local community. Nevertheless, most of the information on coexistence with society was scattered throughout the report, which leaves a poor impression. It would probably be easier to understand the full situation if these scattered piece of information  could be integrated and organized.

In promoting CSR, since  2006 we have asked each business division and region to identify the material  issues and establish CSR action plans, which are then carried out in accordance  with PDCA cycles. While humbly accepting that these activities have received a  certain degree of positive evaluation from the Review Forum, we will continue to  make the promotion of CSR for the entire company even more sophisticated, by  ascertaining the challenges for our company for each of the core subjects of ISO  26000, which was released in November 2010. In relation to reporting practices, we will focus on new trends such as integrated reporting while also aiming for  information disclosure that leads to dialogue with stakeholders. Since the company was first founded, ITOCHU Corporation has been based on the spirit of sampo yoshi (Good  for the seller, Good for the buyer, and Good for society), a management philosophy embraced by Ohmi  merchants. This spirit has remained unchanged for more than 150 years until the present, and continues in the  form of our corporate philosophy of being Committed to the Global Good. As a global company, we will work  towards strategies for further growth by creating shared value with society and contributing to the realization of  a sustainable society through our business activities. We will continue to make efforts to further enhance our CSR activities in the light of the feedback that we have  received as part of this review.
