During the year, the group  adopted a new strategic direction that involves the  repositioning of the group for the future.  Challenging market conditions  After the start of 2011, which was economically strong in  Sweden though weaker in Denmark, it gradually became  evident that the debt crises in the euro zone and the  problems in the US were so extensive that global growth  would be impaired.   For PostNord, the 2011 trend was also marked by structural  changes with decreasing mail volumes. Mail volumes fell a full  12 percent in Denmark during the year, mainly as a result of  competition from digital communication alternatives. In  Sweden, mail volumes fell over 3 percent.    A paradigm shift is ongoing that we must respond to, just  as all other postal companies throughout the world must do.  Due to the growing number of available forms of  communication and the prevalence of digitization, we expect  mail volumes to continue their sharp decline in coming years.    The new corporate strategy involves the  repositioning of PostNord to meet  communication market demands and to  grow in the Nordic logistics market.  Our societies will always have significant needs for physical  distribution, though the level of long-term, sustainable  demand remains to be seen. We predict that 2012 mail  volumes will fall approximately 5 percent in Sweden and that  mail volumes in Denmark will follow the 2011 trend – that is,  fall approximately 12 percent.    The volume trend represents a significant change of  conditions for our business. The changes that will be needed  to adapt the operations to market trends will impact many  people. But they will also open up new structures as well as  business and growth opportunities.      Improved results  PostNord reported satisfactory results for 2011 given the  market trend. Net sales were down 5 percent. The market  trend was met with continued and successful cost  adjustments and ongoing streamlining activities. We reduced  our operating expenses by a total of 2.2 billion kronor during  the year.   The average number of employees was reduced by 2,300  during the year.         During the fall, PostNord adopted a cost reduction program  that will reduce the groups central administrative expenses  by one billion kronor, over and above cost cuts that will be  made in the business operations. The cost reduction program  is aimed at streamlining administrative processes and  reducing the cost of administrative resources within group  functions, business operations, IT and purchasing.   We reduced the groups carbon dioxide emissions by 7  percent during the year. This represents another big step  forward in our ambitious goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 40  percent between 2009 and 2020.    Although the operating margin increased somewhat during  the year, underlying profitability is under intense pressure  and there is a great need to adapt PostNords operations in  coming years. Economic development for 2012 is also highly  uncertain.  New direction for PostNord  PostNord adopted a new corporate strategy for group  development for the period up to 2015. The new corporate  strategy involves the repositioning of PostNord to meet  communication market demands and to grow in the Nordic  logistics market.     MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO     <.    POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  7    We will make major changes to and significant investments in  mail business production facilities to improve flexibility,  efficiency and profitability, thereby improving our ability to  deliver service and quality in accordance with the  requirements under which we operate. It is also essential for  us to maintain a dialogue with the community and legislators  regarding ways in which these requirements should be  designed in the future in order to promote efficient, profitable  future mail businesses that provide good service.    In the logistics market, we will expand the business  profitably – organically and through potential acquisition – to  further broaden our offer and take the position as the Nordic  market leader.   Growth and profitability  The objectives of the strategy are, firstly, to facilitate  PostNords continued compliance with the rationale of the  merger between the Swedish Posten AB and the Danish Post  Danmark A/S. The second objective is to generate increased  value within the group through growth, improved profitability  and the more efficient utilization of capital. Thirdly, the group  will lay the groundwork for an IPO and prepare for possible  owner decisions in this regard. This involves factors such as  improving the profitability of the mail businesses and  establishing a clear growth agenda for the logistics business,  as well as good future distribution capacity and a well- adapted capital structure. Finally, PostNord will create a more  closely connected, coordinated and efficient group which,  through improved operational management and  governance, is able to take full advantage of its size and  market position.    We are proud of being the mail operator for all of Denmark  and all of Sweden. We have deep roots in these societies, and  it is essential that we maintain our ability to deliver high  quality universal postal services to customers and mail  recipients.  2012 – a year of change  The strategy involves major changes to and restructuring of  our operations, the majority of which will be implemented in  2012 and 2013. These efforts will entail large-scale  investments as well as significant non-recurring restructuring  costs that will burden the groups 2012 and 2013 results. The  changes also give rise to capital requirements for  investments and growth measures that will be partially met  by altering the capital structure through increased  indebtedness.   A fundamentally strong business  The changes we are implementing are being made from a  relatively strong position. The mail business is essentially  attractive in terms of cash flows. Although we are faced with  tough competition, we are experienced in cost management  and have been able to successfully meet market trends. We  hold a favorable position in the Nordic logistics market and  have an attractive offer that presents excellent opportunities  for further growth in a growing market. PostNord also has a  strong financial position, and this enables us to implement  crucial changes to our operations.    Delivery quality is a key competitive factor in our industry.  PostNord holds an extremely strong position in this regard,  both domestically and internationally. The same applies to  the accessibility of our services.    As a result of the changes we implement within the group  based on our new strategic direction, we will become a  stronger company with a more balanced business portfolio –  a company that has successfully adapted and developed its  operations before the rest of the industry has managed to  work out the necessary changes. PostNord will emerge as a  more flexible and innovative company, one that continues to  delivery world-class service and quality.

Income, including internal transactions, totals SEK 11,032m  (12,698).    Expenses fell 12% to SEK 10,670m (12,057).

Mail volumes were negatively impacted  by competition from digital alternatives and fell over 3%  during the year. The advertising market in Sweden was  relatively strong during 2011. UDM volumes were on par with  last year. The business area continued its efforts to promote  physical mail as a communication channel and is also  developing new digital interfaces towards customers and  further developing its partner outlet network. Income,  including internal transactions, totaled SEK 15,951m (16,265).    Expenses were down 2% to SEK 15,061m (15,386). The  reduction in expenses was primarily attributable to reversed  restructuring provisions of SEK 114m net. Last years  restructuring expenses totaled SEK 94m. Personnel expenses  were down 2% due to adjustments to reduced volumes and  ongoing streamlining activities. The average number of  employees fell 4% during the year.

The liquidity effect as regards pensions totaled  SEK -1,170m (-1,036). Postens Pension Fund administers  pension commitments for Posten AB, Posten Meddelande AB  and Posten Logistik AB. The company safeguards new  pension commitments in the fund  and receives  compensation for pension payments. Transfer for  safeguarding of SEK -366m (-854) occurred during the period  and compensation of SEK 251m (871) was received. There is a  continued risk that there will be low or no compensation  from the Pension Fund in 2012 due to uncertainties in the  financial markets. PostNord received a SEK 114m premium  discount from Posterns insurance association.   Cash flows from investing activities totaled SEK -1,813m  (-1,199). Investments in tangible fixed assets totaled SEK  1,670m (1,050). Investments were primarily made in  production vehicles, transport and sorting equipment and  facilities in connection with the establishment of the new  terminals in Hallsberg and Rosersberg in Sweden.  Investments were made in, among other things, adapting  Swedish mail operations to reduced mail volumes.  Investments in intangible fixed assets totaled SEK 276m (222)  and were primarily attributable to the capitalization of  development expenditures in integrated joint IT solutions.   The net liquidity effect of acquisitions of subsidiaries and  associated companies totaled SEK -352m (0). The acquisitions  were primarily of land and buildings for new terminals and  acquisitions to strengthen market position within logistics  services. The liquidity effect of divestment of subsidiaries  totaled SEK 185m (0).    Cash flows from financing activities totaled SEK -1,353m  (-1,782).

As of December 31, 2011, the group had an unutilized tax  loss in remaining companies of approximately SEK 1,000m.  This may improve cash flows in coming periods.   Stable cash flows  Despite declining volumes and a weak market trend, the  group shows a generally strong underlying cash flow.  Structural investments in the mail operations will also affect  cash flows going forward. The logistics operations will grow  organically and through potential acquisitions, leading to an  increase in capital requirements. Underlying cash flows,  however, are expected to remain stable.

Other targets  When Posten AB and Post Danmark A/S merged, it was  estimated that the new group would be capable of  generating synergies of approximately SEK 1 billion in areas  including purchasing, administration and IT. The realization of  synergies proceeded according to plan in 2011.   PostNords goal was also that the logistics business would  grow faster than the market in the Nordic region. PostNords  assessment as of the Annual Reports publication date is that  Nordic logistics market sales have risen on par with 2011 GDP  trends in the region. 2011 net sales for PostNords logistics  business remained unchanged.   PostNord adopted a new strategy for the period through  2015.

Increased digitization and  liberalization have impacted postal companies throughout  the world.     Few other companies in our industry have gone through  changes as powerful as those experienced by Posten AB and  Post Danmark A/S during this period – evolving from two  national postal operators in monopolized markets into one  international company that offers communication and  logistics solutions on a heavily competitive market.   With a smaller workforce today than before the merger, but  with quality levels that remain among the best in the world,  PostNord is now a more efficient, more competitive and  better managed company. The business has moved closer to  the great majority of our customers and recipients and our  services have become tremendously more accessible.   This is a continuing journey for our group. PostNord is  impacted by a paradigm shift involving increasing levels of  international trade and transport of goods, while mail  volumes are falling due to the growing number of  communication alternatives. This structural shift has radically  changed the foundation of the groups business, and this will  hold true in the future as well. It is a change that presents  challenges for PostNord, but one that also presents new  opportunities for the group.    Regions, rather than nations, are gaining importance within  commerce and industry. This is particularly true in the Nordic  region – an attractive market and commercial center – and  PostNord holds a strong position as regional leader in its  areas. With a focus on a growing and competitive logistics  business, and with strengths such as reliability, business  mindedness and by being the environmentally sound choice,  PostNord will always be the first choice for sending things to,  from and within the Nordic region.     POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  19    Nordic industry leader with Europes most  accessible postal service  PostNord delivers world-class communication and logistics  solutions to companies, organizations and individuals in the  Nordic region.

PostNord also has  logistics infrastructure in Germany and a partnership with  Europes largest parcel network, DPD, to assist customers  with logistics flows to and from the Nordic region.

OUR BUSINESS   >   POSTNORDS BUSINESSES     <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  21        Sales channels A key sales channel for communication services is Postens  network of partner and stamp outlets in Sweden and Post  Danmarks Post Offices, partner outlets and stamp outlets. In- house sales teams are the most important sales channels in  relation to customers among companies and organizations.  The Internet is increasingly significant as a sales channel for  various mail-related products. In Denmark, the group sells for  example postage via mobile solutions. E-commerce sites are  also important sales channels for the mail business.    The most important sales channel for the logistics business  is its own sales force. Partner outlets and the groups own  service points are also key channels for the sale of parcel  services. On their websites, some e-commerce companies  offer consumers the option of selecting distributor, making e- commerce sites significant sales channels for PostNords  services.    >     OUR BUSINESS   >   MARKET AND TRENDS  22  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    Structural market changes   create new conditions  The communication market is undergoing a structural  transformation towards more digitization, causing a  dramatic drop in letter volumes. The logistics market is  marked by growth and a low consolidation ratio.  The  market trend gives rise to new and altered business  opportunities. Market structure and trends  Communication market  Size  Annual sales for the overall market for communication  services in Sweden and Denmark, where the group conducts  the majority of this business, are estimated at approximately  SEK 290 billion. Of this market, the areas most relevant to our  business are physical and electronic distribution, adverting  (UDM, ADM) and print services. Aggregate sales in these  areas are estimated at approximately SEK 120 billion per year.   In terms of the mail businesses, PostNord holds the leading  position in Sweden and Denmark. Through Strlfors,  PostNord is also a leading operator in information logistics  and print services in the Nordic region.  Market trends  The communication market is characterized by tough  competition. Digital alternatives serve as substitutes for  physical mail, and represent the largest single competitive  factor for the mail businesses. Most postal operators are  subject to the same type of competition from digital  alternatives, and this is reflected by falling letter volumes  throughout the world. The International Post Corporation  (IPC) trade association has estimated that overall letter  volumes throughout the world will fall 43% between 2009  and 2020.    Letter volumes have fallen sharply in Denmark in recent  years, a reflection of far-reaching, coordinated public sector  and financial service company initiatives to establish digital  infrastructure and new e-services for communication with  citizens and customers. The Danish economy has also  developed much more poorly than the Swedish economy in  recent years, and this has had a negative impact on volumes.   Volumes also fells significantly in Sweden in recent years,  though the Swedish market has yet to see the type of  coordinated digitization strategies that are driving  substitution in Denmark. To date, demand for mail as a strong  communication channel has been more robust in Sweden  than in Denmark.

Source: IPC    The letter is, on the other hand, still important as information  carrier and will do so well into the future. PostNords annual  survey of mail habits shows, for instance, that nearly 7 in 10  Swedes prefer to receive their bills directly in their home  mailboxes as opposed to receiving them digitally. Nearly 5 in  10 Danes have the same preference.    The continuous need for physical distribution in society and  the business world signifies continued, albeit altered and in  many cases new, business opportunities.     Sweden and Denmark are two of the most advertising- dense countries in the world. The IRM Institute estimates that  per capita advertising investments in Sweden and Denmark  totaled EUR 189 and 187 (respectively) during the first half of  2011. This places Sweden and Denmark among the top in the  world in terms of the amount of resources invested in  advertising per resident. Ad market sales in Sweden  increased 4% in 2011. In Denmark, the market grew 5% during  the first half of 2011. (Source: IRM).   OUR BUSINESS   >   MARKET AND TRENDS    <.

Competition from more traditional operators comes from  state-owned Posten Norge through Bring Citymail for letters  and a number of large and small direct marketing operators  in Sweden and Denmark. Strlfors competes with, among  other, Itella in Finland, KMD in Denmark and Logica in the UK.  Logistics market  Size  The Nordic region is heavily dependent on exports, with a  large share of exports staying within the Nordic region or  going to other European countries. Having a strong regional  base with international scope is essential for both PostNord  and its customers.     PostNord is primarily active in the logistics markets in  Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland in the following  submarkets:   B2B parcel   B2C parcel   Pallet (groupage)   Express   InNight   Third-party logistics   Air & Ocean   Courier   Mixed cargo (part loads)    The group holds a leading position in parcel and pallet  shipments for both B2B and B2C, and a strong position within  InNight and courier services in the Nordic region.    The total Nordic logistics services market is estimated at  approximately SEK 700 billion per year. The portion of the  logistics market served by PostNord has estimated annual  sales of approximately SEK 135 billion.  Market trends  The logistics market is driven by global growth and rising  levels of international trade. The Nordic logistics market is  highly correlated to GNP. PostNords assessment as of the  publication date of this report is that Nordic logistic market  sales rose in line with GNP trends in the region in 2011. The  group anticipates a continued growth for the Nordic logistics  market to equal or exceed GDP.  Competition  The Nordic region as a whole is characterized by low  population densities and great distances. This presents clear  economies of scope and scale for the logistics business.  Despite this, the Nordic logistics market is characterized by a  low consolidation ratio, intensive competition and price  pressure. Our main competitors are global logistics company  DB Schenker, the German Post through DHL and the Dutch  TNT. There are also a host of smaller operators that hold  major or minor positions in various service areas. The other  Nordic postal companies are strong in their respective  markets in Norway and Finland.   PostNord expects that the logistics market will continue to  be characterized by tough competition, chiefly from global  and other international operators with ambitions in the  Nordic region. This places demands on PostNord for cost  efficiency and customer focus.    >     OUR BUSINESS   >   MARKET AND TRENDS    24  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    E-commerce market  Services for e-commerce are a market segment in both the  communication and logistics markets. PostNord estimates  that this part of the e-commerce market is currently growing  at least 10% per year. Based on market researched conducted  by PostNord in cooperation with   the Swedish Retail and Wholesale Trade Research Institute,  Swedish Distance Sellers and the Danish Industry Association  for E-Commerce, PostNord estimates that 2011 sales for  Nordic e-commerce in physical goods were approximately  SEK 100 billion. Services for this part of the e-commerce  market, which is relevant to the groups operations, are  estimated to correspond to around one-quarter of this  amount.   C2C trade – such as Internet auction sites – is also growing  and is important for the group.    Mobile e-commerce for products is on the rise, although  the increasing prevalence of Smartphones hasnt yet led to a  widespread breakthrough in this area. According to a 2011  PostNord study, for instance, 5% of e-commerce consumers  in Sweden purchased products using their mobile phones  during the past three months.      Driving forces  Factors impacting trends in the communication market  include the following:   Digitization  Technological developments in IT infrastructure and mobile  communication are driving an increased need for  information, changing the structural consumption of  information and media and increasing competition. The  need for physical messaging is falling to new standard  levels.   Customer behaviour  Demand is controlled by the recipient to an increasing  extent. Great demand for accessibility, simplicity and high  delivery precision. Companies need for individualized  communication and method of receipt is on the rise.    Regulation  The EUs Third Postal Directive is driving deregulation in  Europe. National legislation and concession terms are being  finalized.     Environmental requirements  Demand from society and customers for reduced the  environmental impact of transports to help achieve climate  goals.  Factors impacting trends in the logistics market include the  following:   Global growth and growth of international trade  General economic growth and rising levels of international  trade drive demand for logistics services.   Digitization  Increasing amount of communication options have a  positive impact on international trade and facilitate growth  of e-commerce.    Customer behaviour  Demand is controlled by the recipient to an increasing  extent. Growing demand for flexibility and precision in  terms of time and place of delivery, growing demand for  information on logistics flows and security, more focus on  cost-efficiency.    Internationalization  Globalization is driving a rising need for complex cross- border logistics solutions. Imposes requirements for  international scope and efficient information management  systems within logistics.   Regionalization  With international trade on the rise and borders opening  up, regional capacity has greater significance for logistics  businesses than capacity in individual countries.    Environmental requirements  Demand from society and customers for reduced the  environmental impact of transports to help achieve climate  goals.   OUR BUSINESS   >   MARKET AND TRENDS    <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  25    Regulation in the communication  market  The Swedish and Danish postal markets have been liberalized  but are still regulated, though to differing degrees. A new  Postal Act came into effect in Sweden on September 1, 2010.  Denmark enacted a new Postal Act on January 1, 2011. Postal  legislation in both countries is based on the EUs Third Postal  Directive, which is aimed at ensuring good postal service  within member states. One of the effects of the Third Postal  Directive is that previously regulated EU postal markets have  been opened to competition.     The new Danish Postal Act involves liberalization of the  market and the securing of universal postal service  obligations by Post Danmark A/S. The law also establishes  conditions that enable Post Danmark to continue its  commercial operations as supplier of the universal mail  service. Post Danmark was designated in the new Postal Act  to fulfill the distribution obligation in Denmark.    The Swedish postal market was liberalized back in 1993. A  new Swedish Postal Act was enacted in 2010 following the  EUs Third Postal Directive. The new law includes far-reaching  regulations and is not adapted to the market and volume  changes that are taking place.    Posten AB was designated by the Post and Telecom  Agency (PTS) to provide universal postal services in Sweden.  Letter pricing  Letter pricing in Sweden is regulated by postal statutes and  the Postal Act. Pricing of the universal postal service must be  transparent, non-discriminatory and cost-oriented. The postal  operator that provides universal postal service may not raise  the price on priority mail weighing up to 500 grams by more  than the consumer price index. The price of stamped postage  for single 20-gram letters was changed on January 1, 2009  from SEK 5.50 to SEK 6. Prior to that, the postage rate for 20  gram letters had not been changed since 2003.    In Denmark, Post Danmark sets mail prices under the new  Postal Act. However, prices for domestic non-priority letters  weighing up to 50 grams and sent as single mail items must  be approved by the Transport Authority. Due to the new law,  Post Danmark introduced a market-oriented and  differentiated pricing system for various types of stamped  letters as of April 1, 2011. The new pricing structure increases  the price/cost correlation for different types of stamped  letters.  Delivery quality  PostNords quality levels are regulated in both Sweden and  Denmark. Under Swedish postal statutes, at least 85% of mail  items stamped for overnight delivery (first-class mail) must be  delivered on the following business day. At least 97% of all  mail must be delivered within three business days.   In Denmark, delivery conditions for both letters and parcels  are subject to a 93% quality requirement.  Events outside Sweden and Denmark  The liberalization and opening to competition of the  European postal markets continued in 2011, as several EU  member states enacted the Third Postal Directive as national  legislation. However, interpretation of the EU directive varies  between national markets. USOs (universal service  obligations) are essentially defined in a similar way, but  provisions for carrying out these services vary.     In connection with implementation of the EU directive,  several member states revised their postal legislation and the  design of their universal postal service. Such revisions  resulted in, among other things, regulatory relief for postal  operators in Denmark, Finland and Great Britain. Changes  include more flexible pricing and reduced scope of what is  covered by the universal postal service. The changes aim to  ensure the long-term financial sustainability of universal  service obligations on each national market.    Major changes are underway in Great Britain. Oversight has  been moved to the Ofcom authority. Under newly enacted  postal legislation, large volumes of presorted mail are now  outside the purview of the universal postal service. Ofcom  also suggested that Royal Mail be allowed to set its own  prices for all products except single non-priority letters. Large  volumes of presorted mail was also removed from the  purview of the universal postal service in Finland.    In Norway, Posten Norge retains its monopoly on  addressed mail items weighing up to 50 grams. The  Norwegian government has announced that it does not  intend to follow the EUs Third Postal Directive, the result of  which may be that the monopoly will continue to shield this  market from competition.    Alongside the EUs Postal Directive, the revision and  application of two other directives has great significance for  European postal companies. First, revision is currently  underway of legislation on public procurement in the areas of  water, energy, transport and postal services (the Supply  Directive). Second, the EUs VAT Directive is of great  importance to many companies within the industry, since  implementation of the directive may involve VAT repayment  requirements.    >     OUR BUSINESS   >   STRATEGY AND TARGETS  26  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    New strategic direction for PostNord  During 2011, PostNord adopted a new strategy for the  period through 2015. The strategy is focused on  repositioning PostNord in relation to current market  trends and securing a profitable mail business and  continued growth within logistics.  Core values  PostNords business is based on the following core values:   Reliable – PostNord keeps its promises and delivers mail  everywhere securely, on time and to the right place    Accessible – PostNord has the markets best accessibility  and listens to customer views    Business partner – PostNord is a professional business  partner to its customers, helping them meet their  communication and logistics challenges    Environmentally friendly – PostNord is dedicated to  reducing its climate impact   Group strategy  The structural market change that is taking place in the mail  market, challenges the groups ability to run a profitable mail  business. Meanwhile, the logistics market is growing and  holds potential for a strong regional operator like PostNord to  further increase its Nordic presence. A strengthened market  position in logistics is also important in terms of meeting  competition in the logistics industry.    PostNords strategy is therefore focused on repositioning  the groups operations in keeping with market changes.  Target picture   PostNord will continue to fulfill the rationale of the Posten  AB-Post Danmark A/S merger by taking a position as a  leading operator on the Nordic logistics market and by  meeting the groups USOs in Sweden and Denmark, in view  of the ongoing structural changes in the market.   PostNord will increase value for its owners by creating  growth, improving profitability and utilizing the groups  capital resources more efficiently.    PostNord will lay the groundwork for an IPO. This choice of  direction involves factors such as focus on the growth of  the logistics business, profitability of the mail businesses,  returns for our owners and optimization of our capital  structure all key to PostNords development, regardless of  form of ownership.    Changes being implemented within the group in areas  such as organization, management and governance of  operations are aimed at improving coordination and  efficiency and creating a more cohesive and strategically  run group.  Strategies and activities  1. Invest in adaptation of mail business to meet  anticipated decline in mail volumes  PostNord will make vigorous efforts to reorganize its mail  businesses. The aim is to secure profitable mail operations  based on a lower, but more sustainable demand for physical  mail.   PostNord intends to make substantial investments within  the framework of the new production strategy that was  initiated in 2010 and continued during 2011. The new  production structure includes reinvestments in the entire mail  business, chiefly in vehicles and equipment. It also includes  the establishment of a new terminal structure for the Swedish  mail business, with associated investments in equipment. A  similar terminal structure streamlining has already been  carried out within the Danish operations.    Change efforts also include a reduction of the cost base  and adjustment of the workforce to lower volumes.    A key element of the change efforts is maintaining a  dialogue with the community and legislators regarding ways  in which future USOs and regulations should be designed in  Sweden and Denmark to promote efficient, profitable future  mail businesses that provide good service.  2. Expand within logistics to develop position as  Nordic regions leading logistics company  PostNord will expand its logistics business and establish itself  as the market-leading logistics operator in the Nordic region.    The group will take action and make investments to meet  business community demands for end-to-end solutions and  cross-border capacity. This involves broadening the groups  product offer and market coverage in the Nordic region. This  growth will take place:   Organically within existing structures through additional  sales and partnerships     Through potential add-on acquisitions  With a broader logistics offer and added strength in  submarkets where PostNord currently holds a weaker  position and a wider geographic coverage, the group will be  better able to meet customer demand for services spanning  the entire spectrum of logistics services and to create  additional opportunities for organic growth.   OUR BUSINESS   >   STRATEGY AND TARGETS    <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  27    3. Establish and develop new businesses that  support the mail operations, where synergies can  be identified and where there is clear potential for  profitability  Examples of such businesses are complementary digital  services that offer the potential for synergies with existing  services, or services involving new fields of application for  existing production resources (e.g., within facility services).  4. Value maximization of Strlfors  Services within information logistics are a key part of the  groups digital communication offer. Strlfors therefore plays  an important role in the group. Strlfors has reported  negative profitability for several years and has been gradually  streamlined to include only information logistics operations.  Strlfors will implement measures that include the  improvement of profitability and growth by increasing the  sale of services in the areas of data management, marketing  communication and fulfillment.    Strategy through 2015    Investments  The groups investment requirements for production facilities  total SEK 7-8 billion through 2015. The largest investments are  needed in:   Reinvestments in the mail businesses, chiefly vehicles and  equipment.    Establishment of a new terminal structure for the Swedish  mail business and associated investments in equipment  (including establishment of new terminals in Hallsberg and  Rosersberg).   Investments in a new terminal structure for the logistics  business in Sweden and investments to increase capacity  in the logistics business in Norway.  Cost management  The groups cost-cutting initiatives have been gathered into  one action program with two parts:     Action programs within the business operations – reduction  of costs chiefly within production as part of the groups  production strategy and other adaptation measures   Streamlining within administration – reduce administration  costs by SEK 1 billion by the end of 2012.   The action program to capture synergies, announced in  conjunction with the Posten AB-Post Danmark A/S merger,  has been incorporated in the two subprograms referenced  above.    >     OUR BUSINESS   >   STRATEGY AND TARGETS  28  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    Financial strategy  The strategy for the period through 2015 gives rise to  significant financing requirements for restructuring measures,  investments and acquisitions. These requirements will be  financed through:   Improved cash flows from operating activities through  increased profitability   Release of capital through improved capital efficiency and  utilization of invested capital    Optimized capital structure through increased  indebtedness  Financial targets   Equity-Assets ratio of at least 35%   Return on equity exceeding 10% over one business cycle  Dividend policy  PostNords intention is to distribute 40% of net profit to the  owners, taking into account the implementation of group  strategy and the groups financial position and targets.    PostNords targets    Target area  Target  Capital structure and returns   Equity-Assets ratio of at least 35%.  Return on equity exceeding 10% over one business cycle.  Customer value  Improve customer value index (Index >70).  Corporate image  Improve corporate image, TRIM index (Index >34).  CO2 emissions  Reduce emissions by 40%, 2009–2020.  Delivery quality, Sweden  Meet Swedish states requirement that at least 85% of 1st-class letters are delivered on following  business day and 97% within three days.    Delivery quality, Denmark  Meet Danish states 93% quality requirement for all services falling under the delivery obligation. Employee commitment  Improve employee index, MIX (Index >57).  Leadership  Improve leadership index, LIX (Index >59).  Sick leave  Reduce sick leave levels (<5.0%).    2012 outlook  PostNord anticipates a continued dramatic decline in letter  volumes in Denmark and Sweden due to competition from  digital alternatives. PostNord projects that letter volumes in  Sweden may fall 5% and that volumes in Denmark will follow  the 2011 trend, i.e., fall 12%. Economic development for the  coming year is highly uncertain. The group anticipates  continued growth in the Nordic logistic market.    Due to implementation of the strategy, group operating  profit will be charged with significant non-recurring  restructuring costs in 2012.   OUR BUSINESS   >   BUSINESS OPERATIONS    <.

Breve Danmark offers physical and digital mail, direct mail  and newspaper services, facility services as well as services  for drop-off and collection of parcels. Each business day,  Breve Danmark delivers more than 7 million mail items to  2.6 million Danish households and to all businesses in  Denmark. Breve Danmark also offers high-quality global  reach through international collaborations. Breve Danmark  operates primarily under the brand name Post Danmark.  Market trends  The Danish economy remained weak in 2011. The  international debt crisis exacerbated the economic outlook  during the year, which had an impact on demand for the  business areas services.    Breve Danmarks market situation in 2011 was characterized  primarily by a dramatic impact on mail volumes due to  ongoing digitization in Denmark. The digitization of communi- cation in Denmark is driven chiefly by the digital communi- cation strategies of Danish companies and authorities. The  selection of infrastructure and new e-services supporting this  trend has increased in recent years. PostNord is part of this  transition and its offer includes a digital mailbox service  (eBoks). Mail volumes for the business area have fallen 45%  over the past ten years and 21% over the past two years.  Denmark is at the global forefront when it comes to the  digitization of society. PostNord predicts the continued  dramatic decline in mail volumes going forward. PostNord  predicts that Breve Danmarks 2012 mail volumes will fall to  the same extent as they did in 2011 trend; that is,  approximately 12%.    Breve Danmark is one of Denmarks largest advertising  operators. During the first half of 2011, total Danish ad market  sales rose 5% (Source: IRM). Competition within direct  marketing and newspaper distribution increased in Denmark  during the year.    The Danish market was liberalized following the enactment  of new Danish postal legislation as of January 1, 2011. The new  law contains provisions for free competition and the securing  of universal postal obligations by Post Danmark A/S. The law  also established conditions that allow Post Danmark to  continue its commercial operations as supplier of the  universal mail service by reliefs within selected high-cost  areas.

POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  31    2011 net sales and profit  Net sales for business area Breve Danmark fell 14% to SEK  9,347m (10,882). The business area was affected by the weak  Danish economy and the extensive ongoing digitization of  the Danish market. Letter volumes fell a total of 12% during  the year. Price increases implemented during the year by  Breve Danmark had a positive impact on revenue of slightly  less than 3%. Volumes for UDM, magazine mail and  newspapers also fell during the quarter, due chiefly to  increased competition for these services. Breve Danmark  aims at strengthening sales to small and medium-sized  corporate customers and developing profitable new business  within facility services. Income was SEK 11,032m (12,698),  including internal transactions.  Expenses fell 12% to SEK 10,670m (12,057). The decrease was  primarily attributable to the adjustments made to reduced  volumes through streamlining activities within production  and administration. The average number of employees fell  9% during the year.    Operating profit fell to SEK 355m (641) and the operating  margin to 3.2 (5.0)%.    Investments in tangible fixed assets within Breve Danmark  totaled SEK 519m (519) during the period. Investments were  primarily made in vehicles, sorting equipment, transport  control systems, postal vending machines and electric  bicycles.    Breve Danmarks delivery quality for 1st-class mail rose  during the year to 94.0 (93.3)%.        Activities during 2011    Streamlining and adaptation of operations  In 2011, Breve Danmark devoted considerable energy to  adapting its operations to dramatically reduced volumes. The  business area made efforts to adjust its workforce, expenses  and capacity to demand. To safeguard the position of the  physical letter, Breve Danmark worked with customer  activities aimed at increasing sales to small and medium-sized  companies and to selected industries. Several efforts and  campaigns were also implemented to raise awareness in the  market of the value of physical mail.    The Postal Act enacted at the beginning of the year served  to further improve the groups ability to adapt operations to  new market conditions while maintaining high-quality service.  Breve Danmark therefore adjusted the prices of services  during the year, in order to more closely link prices and costs  for services performed. The new law also stipulates that by  2011 all Danish households must place their mailboxes at the  property boundary in order to make mail delivery more  efficient.    Over the past several years, Breve Danmark has invested  heavily in advanced production and distribution systems.  Today, Breve Danmark operates one of the worlds most  modern automated mail businesses.  Business development  Efforts to develop and implement new distribution services  have continued. These efforts cover both complementary  digital services that offer synergy potential with existing  services and facility services where Breve Danmark can  establish new areas of application for existing production  resources.    2011 introductions to the Danish market include mobile  postage and solutions that allow mail customers to purchase  postage via text message. Post Danmark also launched  Smartphone apps this year to improve accessibility to  services. For Breve Danmark, digital services are especially  important as support services for physical volumes.  Environmental initiatives  Of all PostNord business operations, Breve Danmark utilized  the groups Climate Fund to the greatest extent in 2011.

An increased share of electric vehicles was  put into service within Danish production during 2011.  eBoks  The group is joint-owner of the Danish company eBoks, an  efficient, secure e-service for companies looking to make  large mail deliveries to individuals more efficient. The service  is the most used of its kind in the Nordic region, and was also  launched in Norway in 2011.      Over 163,000 companies and organizations and 3.5 million  individuals in Denmark are connected to this service, which  distributed just over 185 (160) million mail items in 2011. The  group owns eBoks together with Nets, a leading player within  payment solutions and information services in the Nordic  region.   As of 2012, eBoks is included in Breve Danmarks results.

Meddelande Sveriges offer includes physical and digital mail,  direct marketing and newspaper services, facility services as  well as services for drop-off and collection of parcels. Through  international partnerships, the business area also offers high- quality global reach. Meddelande Sverige operates primarily  under the brand name Posten, and delivers around 20 million  mail items to 4.5 million Swedish households and to all  businesses in Sweden, every business day.  Market trends  The Swedish economy experienced strong growth in 2011.  The economic outlook deteriorated somewhat during the  latter part of the year due to the international debt crisis.    Demand for Meddelande Sveriges services was  characterized mainly by the structural change currently  underway in the communication solutions market. Relatively  speaking, demand for the letter as a form of communication  is currently more robust in Sweden than in Denmark. This is  due partly to differences between the countries in terms of  economic trends, customer structure, digital infrastructure  and the scope of decisions on digitization taken by the  business community and society. Even so, the business areas  letter volumes have fallen 22% over the past ten years and  4% over the past two years, primarily as a result of  substitution from digital alternatives. PostNord predicts a  decline in letter volumes going forward. The group predicts  that Meddelande Sveriges 2012 letter volumes will fall  approximately 5%.    Meddelande Sverige is one of Swedens largest advertising  operators. During the first half of 2011, total ad market sales  rose 7% (Source: IRM).    Although the Swedish postal market was liberalized in 1993,  Meddelande Sveriges operations remain tightly regulated,  particularly in terms pricing and transparency vis--vis  competitors. The prevailing regulatory situation currently  serves as a constraint on Meddelande Sveriges commercial  opportunities to meet market trends in Sweden.     Read more about the universal service obligation in  Sweden in the Corporate Governance Report.  2011 net sales and profit  Net sales for business area Meddelande Sverige fell 2% to  SEK 15,220m (15,554). Letter volumes were negatively  impacted by competition from digital alternatives and  declined by just over 3% during the year. The Swedish  advertising market was relatively strong in 2011. UDM  volumes were on par with last year. The business area  continued its efforts to promote the letter as a  communication channel. Meddelande Sverige is also  developing new digital interfaces towards customers and  further developing its partner outlet network. Income was  SEK 15,951m (16,265), including internal transactions.    >     OUR BUSINESS   >   BUSINESS OPERATIONS  34  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    Expenses fell 2% to SEK 15,061m (15,386). The decrease was  primarily attributable to reversed restructuring provisions of  SEK 114m net. Last years restructuring expenses totaled SEK  94m. Personnel expenses were down 2% due to adjustments  to reduced volumes and ongoing streamlining activities. The  average number of employees fell 4% during the year.  Transport expenses increased due to higher fuel prices.    Operating profit rose to SEK 890m (879) and the operating  margin to 5.6 (5.4)%.   Investments in Meddelande Sverige totaled SEK 273m (122)  and were primarily attributable to investments in the partner  outlet network (premises and equipment), machinery and  adaptation of premises.    Meddelande Sveriges delivery quality for 1st-class mail rose  during the year to 94.7 (93.1)%.    During 2011, the Swedish Quality Index conducted a  qualitative survey that included Meddelande Sveriges  services (Posten). The study showed an increase in the  percentage of satisfied customers in Sweden, for both  business mail and private mail.        Activities in 2011    Streamlining and adaptation of operations  Due to variations in mail volumes, major changes are needed  to adapt the business operations and adjust to demand for  staffing, expenses and capacity. In 2011, Meddelande Sverige  continued its efforts to create an optimal production  structure for the future, in which a new terminal structure and  an increased share of rail transports are key elements. The  establishment of a new mail terminal in Hallsberg was begun  during the year, where a high degree of automation will  improve both capacity utilization and transport optimization.    Meddelande Sverige also implemented production  changes in its mail carrier operations, including the  consolidation of production units, increased use of  mechanical processing, modified times of distribution and  optimization of distribution routes. These changes caused  temporary disruptions in mail delivery in a few places but,  overall, the business area successfully implemented the  changes with improved quality levels.  Business development  Digital interfaces are essential for supporting physical  volumes. Meddelande Sveriges Real Postcard Smartphone  application was one of the most downloaded applications of  2011 in Sweden. As one of Swedens largest advertising  operators, the group has developed new digital interface  services for companies and individuals. One example is the  development of new services in partnership with Google,  which is in line with the goal of growing through new direct  marketing applications where profitable.   Meddelande Sverige also pursued initiatives to establish  new fields of application for existing production resources,  chiefly within facility services.    Meddelande Sveriges partner outlet network is a key sales  channel. Following the conclusion of new agreements with  Swedens largest supermarket chains in 2010, the business  area reorganized its partner outlet network to produce a  more effective market presence. Meddelande Sverige is  working with the supermarket chains on joint marketing  efforts and is taking steps to further improve the  effectiveness of partner outlet support.  Environmental initiatives  As part of its efforts to reduce the climate impact of the  business, Meddelande Sverige implemented several initiatives   OUR BUSINESS   >   BUSINESS OPERATIONS    <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  35    to reduce its dependence on fossil energy, switch to diesel- powered cars and improve environmental performance.  Meddelande Sverige continued its optimization of distribution  routes to reduce fuel consumption and conducted several  energy audits at several mail carrier offices. In the mail  delivery area, the business area tested new types of electric  vehicles in order to further expand its already large electric  vehicle fleet.    Strategic priorities   Implement structural changes and process improvements  to adjust costs and capacity to lower mail volumes and  ensure profitability while preserving high quality levels    Continue implementation of production strategy, including  new terminal structure, for more efficient processes and  reduced environmental impact    Develop market presence through market expansion,  increased use of the Internet as a channel for meeting  customers and development of partner outlet network     Develop profitable new operations within facility services  and distribution    Reduce administrative expenses   Continued dialogue with the community and legislators on  the design and regulation of tomorrows universal service  obligation.

With  PostNords logistics services, 25 million individuals and  two million companies can be reached every day.          Every business day, PostNord delivers nearly 400,000  parcels and 11,000 pallets to satisfied business and private  customers throughout the Nordic region. PostNord also  ensures secure, rapid transports for its customers by offering  a range of other logistics solutions within mixed cargo  groupage, delivery, express, third-party logistics, in-night  freight forwarding and consignment freight. Business area  Logistics has the Nordic regions largest, most coordinated  distribution network – no one else has as many terminals or  service points in this part of the world. Logistics also has a  partnership with Europes largest parcel network, DPD, to help  its customers with flows to and from the Nordic region.    Market trends during the year  The Nordic logistics market is highly correlated with  economic trends. The Norwegian logistics market in  particular, as well as the Swedish market, developed positively  during the year, while the Danish logistics market was  impacted by the weak Danish economy combined with  continued strong competition and price pressure. The long- range growth trend for the Nordic logistics market is deemed  to be positive and to equal or exceed GDP over the next few  years.   The regional Nordic logistics market is characterized by  intense competition, primarily from international operators.  Due to overcapacity, price pressure and clear economies of  scale, increased consolidation in the industry is likely.  Logistics has strengthened and developed its position in the  Nordic region through organic growth and acquisitions.     The Nordic region is heavily dependent on exports, with a  large share of exports staying within the Nordic region or  going to other European countries. Nordic logistics  customers demand a combination of logistics services from a  partner that has a strong regional base and international  scope.    The rapidly growing e-commerce industry is of great  significance to several PostNord businesses, particularly  Logistics and its parcel distribution operations. More and  more e-commerce companies demand start-to-finish  solutions, covering everything from customized freight and  inventory management to distribution to end consumers and  handling complaints.  2011 net sales and profit  Net sales for business area Logistics rose somewhat to SEK  12,450m (12,423). Sales within the Norwegian logistics  operations increased, and sales for the Swedish operations   OUR BUSINESS   >   BUSINESS OPERATIONS    <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  37    were on par with last year. The Danish logistics market  continues to be characterized by tough competition, price  pressure and the weak economic trend in Denmark, which  resulted in reduced business volumes for the Danish logistics  operations. Income was SEK 13,767m (13,722), including  internal transactions.   Expenses were down 1%, to SEK 13,498m (13,583). Reversed  restructuring costs reduced operating expenses by SEK 15m.  Last year was burdened with restructuring costs of SEK 70m.    Operating profit increased to SEK 269m (139) and the  operating margin to 2.0 (1.0)%.     Logistics invested SEK 368m (183) in fixed assets during  the period, chiefly in vehicles, containers, a new Nordic  mobile platform, handheld computer solutions and  establishment expenses for the new terminal structure in  Norrland.     Delivery quality was 97.5 (96.6)% for parcels in Sweden and  97.9 (97.1)% for parcels in Denmark.    During 2011, the Swedish Quality Index conducted a survey  of parcel services, which showed that customers are  increasingly satisfied with PostNords logistics operations in  Sweden (Posten), while customer satisfaction in the market as  a whole has decreased in Sweden.  Activities during 2011  Business development  Logistics currently offers a wide range of logistics services,  and the group holds a strong position within parcel, pallet,  mixed cargo groupage and in-night solutions in the Nordic  market. With a broader, more standardized logistics offer,  added strength in submarkets where Logistics currently  holds a weaker position and wider geographic coverage, the  business area is better able to meet customer demand for  services and end-to-end solutions and to create additional  growth.    Logisticss continued development and standardization of  Nordic products in 2011 included the launch of the markets  first pan-Nordic parcel and pallet services. The launch was an  important step in strengthening the logistics offer, and means  that business customers can now send parcels and pallets  within the entire Nordic region as easily as they can do  domestically.    Acquisitions made by Logistics in 2011 complement the  business with leading expertise in pallet, mixed cargo  groupage and vehicle-based shipping, serving to further  strengthen Logisticss position in the Nordic region.    New partnerships were commenced in 2010 throughout  the Nordic region (with, e.g., supermarket chains) which  further strengthen the distribution network. These  partnerships worked well in 2011 and have been instrumental  in consolidating PostNords position ad accessibility.  Streamlining of operations  Work proceeded in 2011 to streamline production to create  capacity for growth in volume, to reduce unit costs and to  improve competitiveness. An important feature of this work is  the terminal change currently underway in Sweden. During  the year, Logistics signed a rental agreement for a new  combined parcel and pallet terminal in northern Stockholm.  Additional investments are being made in Norway to further  increase Tollposts capacity in the Norwegian market.    Volume growth to, from and within the Nordic  region  Large volumes increase opportunities for standardization and  optimization on unit costs. During the year, Logistics strove to  develop its attractiveness and position as the natural partner  for logistics flows to, from and within the Nordic region.  Alongside a strong Nordic base, there is potential for  additional development through, for example, strategic  alliances. Through PostNords current partnership with one of  Europes leading parcel networks, DPD, Nordic corporate  customers can reach all of Europe with high quality deliveries  at competitive prices.  Environmental initiatives  One of the prerequisites for being regarded as a leading  logistics operator is the practical, determined pursuit of an  environmental agenda. Nordic logistics purchasers have  heightened their environmental requirements in recent years.  As a major industry operator, Logistics actively participates in  the development of alternative fuels and new vehicle  technology. This year, the business area tested a new truck  fuel in cooperation with Volvo Trucks. Logistics has also  upgraded its vehicle fleet more rapidly than was originally  planned. The investments made by the group in logistics  terminals will further increase capacity allowing the business  area to utilize capacity more efficiently, which will help reduce  carbon dioxide emissions.

POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  39    Strlfors  Through Strlfors, PostNord offers information logistics  services to companies and helps them communicate  effectively with their customers.      Strlfors receives information, processes it and sends it out to  its customers clientele through channels or by the method  that achieves the best effect. These services include data  management, printing and response management. The core  business is business communication in the form of invoices,  customer data, etc. Strlfors operates businesses in the  Nordic countries and the UK, France and Poland. In 2011,  Strlfors handled 928 million invoices, account and salary  statements and other physical or digital mail items.  Market trends  Demand for information logistics services stabilized during  the year, partly due to the relatively strong economic trends  in Sweden, Norway and Finland. However, the weak Danish  economy and general deterioration of Europes economic  outlook had a negative impact on the development of  business volumes. During the year Strlforss business  developed in line with the market as a whole, and its position  is stable in key markets.    The structural adaptation of the communication market  produces competition from digital alternatives in all  geographic markets and continued price pressure, chiefly in  terms of physical services within business communication.  Competition is particularly evident in Denmark, a result of  digitization in which companies and organizations  increasingly direct their communication with customers and  citizens towards electronic infrastructure.   Despite increasing and more wide-ranging competition,  services within information logistics have long-term growth  potential. It is increasingly important for companies and  organizations with large addressed customer mailings to be  highly effective with their communication. Possibilities for  clarifying, personalizing and following up customer  communication are greater than ever before, which means  that there are also opportunities to make an impact with  communication.  2011 net sales and profit  Net sales for Strlfors fell 10% to SEK 3,048m (3,391). The  change was attributable to the divestment of the Strlfors  Identification Solutions division. Excluding structural and  currency changes, net sales fell 1% due to the effects of  increased digitization. Income was SEK 3,066m (3,419),  including internal transactions.   Expenses fell 12% to SEK 3,147m (3,595). The decrease was  primarily attributable to the divestment of the Strlfors  Identification Solutions division. Last year was also burdened  with restructuring costs of SEK 77m. Excluding structural and  currency changes, costs fell 2% due to ongoing streamlining  activities.   Operating profit improved to SEK -76m (-170).    >     OUR BUSINESS   >   BUSINESS OPERATIONS  40  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    Investments in Strlfors during the year totaled SEK 156m  (169) and were primarily attributable to normal replacement  investments, capitalized expenditures and acquisition of  customer base.  Activities during 2011  In order to realign the operations for increased growth and  improved profitability, Strlfors initiated several projects this  year and expanded projects already underway.  Streamlining and adaptation of operations  Strlforss business has gradually been refined to cover  information logistics services. This year, a further step was  taken in this effort through the divestment of the Strlfors  Identification Solutions division.    Strlforss implementation of efficiency measures includes  the restructuring of operations by concentrating production  in fewer units, mostly in France, Denmark and Norway. Cost- reducing measures chiefly covered business communication  operations.      Business development  The business communication market is a mature one.  Strlfors set up a new organization in late 2011 in order to  concentrate sales within four areas:   Business Communication    Data Management (maintenance and development of  databases)   Marketing Communication    Fulfillment (serving customers with information and  logistics)  Growth efforts are concentrated in the latter three areas.  Environmental initiatives  In 2011, Strlfors carried out energy-saving measures by  moving to more modern, better-adapted facilities and by  implementing cost reduction projects at existing premises.  The use of solvents was reduced during the year and  continuous efforts are made to minimize the amount of  paper waste from production. During the year, Strlfors also  certified its Danish and French businesses in accordance with  ISO 14001; the entire business operation is now certified. In  addition to ISO 14001 certification.

POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  41    Risks and risk management  PostNords risk management is a continuous group-wide  process and an integrated part of our operating control  and follow-up.  The ability to manage risks is crucial for the governance and  control of PostNords business and taking controllable risks is  a prerequisite for the attainment of the groups goals.  PostNord works purposefully with risk management in the  groups strategy process and operating activities.  Risk management  PostNords risikostyring udgr en integreret del af PostNords  risk management constitutes an integrated part of the  groups operating control. The group works continuously to  identify, evaluate and manage risks in the groups business  operations and units based on accepted methods and  principles. The overall objective is to ensure that risks linked  to the groups strategy and its implementation (strategic  risks) and to the business (operational risks) are identified and  managed in an effective, systematic and proper manner.   PostNords Board of Directors and management team have  overall responsibility for the groups risk management. The  Audit Committee is tasked with supervising the efficacy of the  companys internal governance and control as well as  systems and processes for risk management with reference  to the groups financial reporting.   Risks to the group are identified in the groups annual  business planning process. In 2011, PostNord prioritized a  more goal-oriented method to identify risks in its risk  management efforts. Risk areas were reclassified and risk  maps for strategic and operational risks were introduced to  enable the effective identification of prioritized risk areas for  the group. These risk areas were included in the new group  strategy for the period through 2015 adopted by the Board of  Directors.    Risk management work is conducted on a central level. The  management teams of PostNords business operations and  local units are responsible for identifying and reporting  operational risks, which are then consolidated at the central  level with the groups strategic risks. A risk strategy is  determined depending on the nature of the risk. The business  is systematically monitored through regular reports in which  business operation management teams update identified  risks.  Risk areas  Like all companies, PostNord is affected by a number of risks  that influence the groups future development. Since 2011, the  most significant risks areas are divided into two categories  comprised of several subcategories. This classification helps  PostNord focus its risk management activities and obtain an  overview in conjunction with internal reporting.  Strategic risks are linked to PostNords development. The  most significant risks to the group are associated with the  groups adaptation of the business to changes in the  economy, adaptation of the mail businesses to meet reduced  mail volumes and a profitable expansion of the logistics  business.    Operational risks are linked to operational activities.  Operational risks include, for instance, regulatory risks,  security and continuity risks, environmental risks and financial  risks. Operational risks are often managed with guidelines  and instructions that aim to provide a uniform, effective level  of certainty throughout the entire group.  Strategic risks  PostNords business volumes are closely linked to  macroeconomic trends. 2011 was characterized by continued  weak economic development in many countries, including  Nordic countries. The economic trend has a significant effect  on PostNords earning capacity.   The communication market is characterized by major  changes, due primarily to substation from increased  digitization and liberalization. In Denmark, coordinated public  initiatives to increase the level of digitization are extremely  widespread and this trend is expected to continue in coming  years. A similar development is also predicted in Sweden.  Substitution imposes additional demands on PostNords  ability to adapt production and administration to market  demand.    PostNord has adopted a new strategy for the period  through 2015, aimed at repositioning the groups business in  relation to current market changes, creating growth and  improving profitability for the group. The strategy includes  investments to adapt the mail businesses to meet the  anticipated drop in mail volumes, expansion within Logistics  to enlarge the offer and increase market presence, and  development of a position as the leading logistics company in  the Nordic region. Meanwhile, extensive work is being done  to reduce costs in the business operations and within  administration.    The repositioning will involve significant investments and  major non-recurring restructuring costs that will burden the  groups earnings trend in 2012. These efforts will give rise to  capital requirements for investments and growth measures  that will be partially met through changes in the capital  structure by increasing indebtedness.     >     OUR BUSINESS   >   RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT  42  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    The repositioning itself presents a strategic risk to the group,  and commands the full attention of the Board of Directors  and group management. Its implementation sets high  standards for leadership and governance of the business.  Changes have been made to the groups management and  governance structure in order to improve controllability and  performance focus.

Key risk areas and risk management    Risk area  Risk description  Risk management  Identified risks  Each risk area includes a number of concrete  risks.  Risks are managed through one or more  activities.   Strategic risks  Weak economy and increased level of  digitization. Adaptation of production and  administration to market demands.   Implementation of adaptation of mail  businesses, ensure profitable growth of  logistics business, implementation of  administrative restructuring.   Operational risks    Regulatory risks  Changes to regulatory provisions (pricing,  service levels, etc.).   Implementation of activities to highlight the  importance of harmonizing the regulatory  framework with market trends.    Security and continuity risks  Deterioration of quality resulting from  disruptions to distribution and production  networks.   Continuity plans and risk-based security  standards that take into consideration  customer demands and other global factors.    Environmental risks  Climate impact.  Adaptation of transports and establishment of  new terminal structure. Investments through  Climate Fund.   Financial risks  Refinancing risks, customer credit, changes in  interest rates, exchange rate fluctuations.   Establishment of payment readiness including  planning, systematic customer and partner  credit evaluation, limitation of translation  exposure.     Operational risks  Regulatory risks  Provision of the universal postal service obligation is  regulated in Sweden and Denmark, though to differing  degrees. PostNord subsidiaries Posten AB and Post Danmark  A/S are obliged to provide universal postal service in Sweden  and Denmark, respectively. National legislation is based on  the EU directive regulating postal services within the EU and  the Universal Postal Union treaty regulating international  service. The terms of Posten and Post Danmarks  concessions and the postal legislation in those countries  include provisions for pricing, service levels, quality,  distribution networks, complaint management and  supervision. Changes on the European or national level to  regulations concerning the universal postal service obligation  can therefore have a significant impact on the group.    The communication market is undergoing a structural  change and is characterized by intense competition. Market  conditions deteriorated in 2011, partly due to a dramatic drop  in mail volumes. It is essential that the regulatory framework  remain abreast of this development. PostNord will work to  maintain a good dialogue with society, its owners (the  Swedish and Danish states) and the supervisory authorities in  each country in terms of how tomorrows universal service  obligation should be designed in both Sweden and Denmark  to best promote the continued operation of efficient,  profitable mail operations that offer good service.  Security and continuity risks  PostNords goal is that security and continuity characterize  the groups services and delivery. These attributes are  essential to our efforts aimed at protecting employees,  customer property and our own assets against damage and  loss.   PostNords production facilities and distribution network are  protected by physical security measures and through  continuity plans. PostNord has established a group-wide  security standard and a group-wide continuity program, both  of which strengthen resilience and robustness and adapt  protection to various customer-driven and international  security standards. International IT and information security  standards apply throughout the entire group, and results are  measured through an international comparison of  information security.   OUR BUSINESS   >   RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT    <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  43    Environmental risks  PostNords operations require transports and an extensive  infrastructure of terminals, production facilities and other  buildings. PostNord works purposefully and in cooperation  with various stakeholders to adjust its operations to reduce  environmental impact. The group shall be able to offer  communication and logistics services that have a limited  environmental impact. These efforts also involve the  management of certain market risks, since lowering energy  consumption levels serves to reduce vulnerability to fees and  rising energy prices.   Within the framework of the groups production strategy,  PostNord is working to set up a new terminal structure in  Sweden with fewer – though larger and better-situated –  terminals. This project supports PostNord in its efforts to  reduce the groups environmental impact.   The groups Climate Fund – which earmarks budget  resources for environmental investments – is a key  component of the groups environmental improvement work.    Read more about our work in the environmental area in  PostNords Sustainability Report.  Financial risks  The groups business includes financial risks that may affect  its financial position. These risks, including the management  of payment readiness and credit and market risks, are  managed centrally based on the financial policy adopted by  the Board of Directors.    In short, the group has limited exposure to financial risks.  Refinancing risks  Financial readiness, which is monitored on an ongoing basis,  is comprised of binding loan commitments and liquidity  reserves. Financial readiness at year-end 2011/12 totaled SEK  4.1 billion. With continuous planning of payment readiness  and refinancing, the groups financial readiness is deemed to  be stable.  Credit risks  PostNord is exposed to credit risk through customer credit,  the investment of cash and cash equivalents and  counterparty risk in financial instruments. PostNord limits risk  arising from credit sales to customers through systematic  credit evaluations and monitoring of all customers and by  diversifying its credit exposure. Credit losses have historically  been low.    PostNord hedges credit risk on the central level by only  working with financial partners who have high credit standing  and by broadly diversifying its activities. PostNords credit risk  is therefore deemed to be extremely limited.  Market risks  There are two types of market risks: currency risks and  interest rate risks.    Due to PostNords international presence and business  operations, the group is exposed to exchange rate  fluctuations. The groups currency exposure is primarily  related to the net profit of foreign subsidiaries and changes in  the value of subsidiaries net assets (translation exposure). In  accordance with the groups financial policy, risk exposure is  not hedged against net profit. However, an annual review of  all group companies is conducted to ensure optimal solvency  levels and thereby limit the groups translation exposure.  Currency exposure in receivables and short-term promissory  notes is hedged with financial instruments (derivatives) at the  time they arise.    PostNords interest rate risk refers to interest-bearing assets  and long-term liabilities. The groups interest rate risk is  managed in relation to the market value of financial  instruments and net interest income.  Postens Pension Fund  Postens Pension Fund manages assets for pension  commitments for Posten AB, Posten Meddelande AB and  Posten Logistik AB. The companies capitalize new pension  commitments in the fund and receive compensation for  pensions paid. Company assets are allocated into multiple  asset classes with a good diversification factor. However, a  low consolidation ratio in the Pension Fund may negatively  impact the groups cash flows if reimbursement for pensions  paid is not received.

Being the environmentally correct  choice for our customers is part of our vision.  As a major carrier in the Nordic region, PostNords business  has a significant environmental impact. To run its operations,  PostNord utilizes virtually all modes of transportation.  PostNords goal is to fulfill its obligations and customer  commitments in the most eco-efficient manner possible,  thereby creating added value for both society and customers  while being more economical with its own resources. The  groups commitment to the environment is integrated into  the business, and environmental efforts are managed like all  other corporate operations.  Improved energy efficiency  A key element of PostNords environmental work is the  utilization of capacity. The group strives to coordinate  transports and load vehicles to the maximum possible fill rate  in its daily production activities.    Economies of scale and large volume capacity are  important reasons behind the groups decision to transport a  high percentage of mail items by rail. 65% of mail volumes  between sorting terminals are transported by rail in Sweden.  In Norway, the vast majority of the groups total pallet and  parcel volumes are transported by rail.  Climate Fund  The group invests significant resources in reducing the  environmental impact of the business. Part of these  investments are made within the framework of the Climate  Fund, which was established in 2009 and in which funds are  earmarked for environmental investments. The Climate Fund  has enabled the group to step up the pace of its environ- mental efforts, and several investments have been made in  energy-efficient transports and premises. SEK 100m was  earmarked in 2011 and investments included the expansion of  the electric vehicle fleet and the implementation of several  energy efficiency measures at premises and buildings.    The climate-efficient offer has been expanded through  initiatives including eco-efficient service alternatives for  varubrev and periodicals in Sweden. The group has also  participated in several sustainable development  collaborations, including a fuel test of BioDME along with  Volvo Trucks and the Swedish Energy Agency.  Environmental goals and results  PostNords goal is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by  40% by 2020 based on 2009 levels. This goal is in line with  the owners environmental targets.

Environmentally licensed operations  PostNord runs operations requiring registration under  national legislation in Sweden, Denmark, France and Poland.  These operations constitute a limited portion of the groups  net sales. In Sweden Strlfors runs facilities in Ljungby that  require registration under the Swedish Environmental Code.  Corresponding registrations are made with the applicable  authorities for Strlfors facilities in France and Poland. These  environmentally licensed operations deal with graphic  production and impact the external environment through  emissions to air.    Other environmentally licensed operations subject to  Environmental Code provisions are a number of cleaning  bays used in PostNords Swedish operations. No significant  environmental incidents occurred during the year. A minor  environmental issue concerning the close-down of Strlforss  operation in Gothenburg is currently underway.   No environmentally licensed operations required renewal  in 2011.     Read more about PostNords environmental efforts in the  Sustainability Report.   OUR BUSINESS   >   EMPLOYEES    <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  45    Working for us  PostNord is one of the largest employers in the Nordic  region. We strive to be an attractive, stimulating workplace  for committed managers and employees.  The groups success is founded on having excellent  managers and employees with the right skills. PostNords  wants to recruit, develop and retain the best talent within  various functions and professional categories. There are  many career paths within PostNord and within business  operations and countries. In order for PostNord to meet and  exceed customer demands and expectation, the groups  employees must be motivated to constantly innovate and  improve.  How PostNord works  The groups HR work focuses on primarily three areas:   Employeeship. The employee behavior – what each  employee does and the responsibility each employee has  for achieving their own goals and the goals of the business.     Leadership. PostNord seeks out leaders who thrive by  leading through others and generating commitment.    Health. With many employees having physically  demanding jobs, the group highly prioritizes work  environment and health  Development, 2011 and beyond  In 2011, the group had an average of 41,714 employees at over  2,000 workplaces. The total number of employees at year- end 2011 was 48,568. Personnel turnover was 10.6 (10.7) % in  2011.    Employees in the Nordic countries give their views on the  group and its operations in annual surveys, which are  compiled in indices of employee commitment (MIX) and  leadership quality (LIX). In 2011, the employee index was 57  and the leadership index was 59. 2011 results are not  comparable to previous years due to changes made to the  surveys, but index results indicate potential for improvement.  The fact that the group is making major changes and  adjustments to its operations is expected to affect results.  PostNords goal is to improve both key ratios in the period  through 2015. Essential elements in this effort include  increasing awareness of the groups future development,  increasing focus on customers in all parts of business and  working harder to develop managers and leaders.  Workplace equality and diversity  PostNord is an equal opportunity employer and opposes  inequitable pay differentials. The groups goal is a 40%  proportion of female managers within the group by 2015. In  2011, the proportion of female managers was 29 (29)%  (adjusted from previously published data). The female/male  breakdown for the group was 35/65 (36/64)%.   PostNord has a group-wide zero tolerance policy with  regard to discrimination. During 2011, 5.4 (4.8)% of employees  in the Swedish operations reported that they had been  subject to discrimination or harassment at work.   The group is supported in its anti-discrimination efforts by  tools including codes of conduct. Discrimination issues are  actively addressed by the groups HR function.  Health and safe work environment  The group invests significant resources and energy in work  environment and health issues. Sick leave in the group was  5.0 (5.1)% in 2011.

One  prerequisite for this is well-functioning corporate  governance.  Characteristics of good corporate governance include a clear  ownership structure and well-appointed Board of Directors as  well as efficient processes and carefully prepared risk  management. This Corporate Governance Report describes  PostNords corporate governance from this perspective, and  has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act,  the Annual Reports Act and the Swedish Code of Corporate  Governance.  Ownership structure  PostNord AB (publ), corporate identity number 556771-2640,  is a Swedish corporation owned 40% by the Danish state and  60% by the Swedish state. PostNord AB is the parent  company of the PostNord Group. Votes are allocated 50/50  between the Danish and Swedish states.    Ownership structure    Governance structure  The highest decision-making bodies within PostNord are:   The Annual General Meeting   The Board of Directors   The President and Group CEO assisted by group and  executive management    The owners jointly nominate the Chairman of the Board and  other Board members, propose directors fees and nominate  the AGM chairman and external auditors. The AGM is  PostNords highest decision-making body.   The Board of Directors holds overall responsibility for  organization and administration of the company, through  continuous monitoring and control of the operations. The  Chairman of the Board leads the Boards work. The Audit and  Compensation Committees assist the Board in these efforts.     PostNords President and CEO is responsible for and  manages the day-to-day management of the group based on  the Boards guidelines and instructions. The President and  CEO is assisted by group management and by an executive  management team comprised of members of group  management.   The companys auditor is selected by the AGM and  examines the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial  Statements, the Boards and CEOs administration and the  annual reports of subsidiaries, and produces an auditors  report. PostNords internal audit function evaluates the  companys internal governance and control.  Corporate governance principles  As per agreement of PostNords owners, PostNords  corporate governance is governed by Swedish law.    In addition to the below-referenced laws and statutes, the  following corporate governance principles are applied  (available at www.regeringen.se and www.fm.dk):   Swedish states ownership policy  The ownership policy includes guidelines for external  reporting and guidelines for terms of employment for  executives. The ownership policy specifies that the Swedish  Code of Corporate Governance (the Code) shall be  applied. PostNord shares are not listed on the stock  exchange. According to the ownership policy, PostNords  Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that the  company produces annual, interim and year-end reports in  accordance with the OMX Nordic Exchange listing  agreement rules, and in accordance with applicable  accounting legislation and generally accepted accounting  practices. This also means that PostNord shall produce a  corporate governance report that includes a report on the  internal governance and control of financial reporting.

PostNord does not have a nominating committee, as the  nomination and appointment of Board members is  performed in accordance with the principles agreed upon  by the owners. Nominations are made in cooperation with  the owners.   Chapter 4.5 requirement for board members  independence from owners. Protection for minority owners  is not relevant to the governance of PostNord, which has  only two owners. The reporting of board members  independence is therefore not relevant.   Chapter 9.7 requirement for AGM resolution on share- and  share price-related incentive programs. The rules  concerning share-related incentive programs are not  applicable, as the Danish and Swedish states together own  100% of the companys shares.

The  auditors meet with the Board at least once per year and also  participate in a number of Audit Committee meetings. In 2011,  the Board met with the auditors during one board meeting,  during which Board members were able to present questions  to the auditors.

POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  59    Internal governance and control  of financial reporting    The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that  internal governance and control is regulated primarily by the  Swedish Companies Act. This responsibility is specified by  PostNord in the rules of procedure, where internal  governance and control is defined as a process by which the  Board, the CEO and employees provide a reasonable level of  assurance for the reliability of financial reports. Financial  reporting includes interim reports, year-end reports and the  major portion of annual reports.  Framework  PostNords framework for internal governance and control is  based on the framework developed by the Committee of  Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission  (COSO). Internal governance and control constitute an  integrated part of the business and is divided into a number  of control areas based on targets for the groups operations.   The group utilizes a three lines of defense model to  illustrate the way in which responsibility for internal  governance and control has been organized. The first line of     defense is the management of PostNords four business  operations, which are responsible for identifying and  managing operational risks within their own areas of  responsibility.    The second line of defense – several governance and  control functions that make up PostNords group functions   has the task of supporting the first line of defense. Group  functions are also authorized to issue group-wide rules and  guidelines within their own functional areas of responsibility  and are responsible for monitoring compliance thereto.  These rules and guidelines are meant to ensure that  applicable laws and regulations are observed and that the  business is managed in such a way as to achieve established  goals. The second line of defense may also conduct its own  inspections and take steps to identify and manage any risks  and errors that may have gotten by the first line of defense.     The third line of defense is the independent review and  control function comprised of the groups internal audit,  tasked with examining the effectiveness and reliability of the  groups internal governance and control.  Internal governance and control at PostNord      Control environment  A good control environment is ensured by, among other  things, clearly defining and communicating details about the  organization, decision-making paths and allocation of  authority within the group.    The Boards work and responsibilities are governed by the  Boards rules of procedure. The Audit Committee is  responsible for preparing the Board to monitor and assure  the quality of the groups financial statements. The  Committee oversees the effectiveness of the companys  internal governance and control as well as risk management  systems and processes concerning financial reporting. The  Committees work helps ensure that reporting is     >     CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT   >   INTERNAL GOVERNANCE AND CONTROL OF FINANCIAL REPORTING  60  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    accurate and reliable through measures including regular  discussions with PostNords management and external  auditors and the examination of accounting principles  applied and accounting issues that are brought to the  Committees attention.   The duties and powers of the President and CEO are  governed by instructions established by the Board of  Directors. Decision-making authority within the group is  governed by delegated authorities, which is based on the  delegation of responsibilities established by the Board in  its rules of procedure. The delegated authorities set forth  the decision-making authority delegated by the CEO to the  managers who report to him. These managers may then  further delegate their decision-making authority within  their respective areas of responsibility.     Documents of importance are jointly signed by  authorized signatories designated by the Board. PostNord  has an internal audit function tasked with examining the  effectiveness of internal governance and control. This is  performed regularly in accordance with an annual audit  plan adopted by the Audit Committee. The function  reports to the Board and to the CEO.    PostNord applies the ownership policy of the Swedish  state, and this constitutes a major portion of the control  environment. In addition, the group has a Code of  Conduct and various policy documents that are also part  of the control environment.  Identification and management  of risks  In 2011 PostNords operations were guided by a target  picture covering four target areas: employees, processes,  customers and owners. Internal governance and control is  based on analyses conducted by group companies and  units of risks that the companys established targets will  not be attainable. Risk analysis results are dealt with on a  regular basis by the Audit Committee and the Board,  which evaluate and monitor financial reporting risks.    See also the Risk and Risk Management section.  Control activities  The group conducts control activities to eliminate or limit  the occurrence or effects of identified risks.    These activities include rules covering decision-making  and authorization, verification, compliance, manual and  programmed controls, and the effective division of duties  and responsibilities in processes and routines. Governing  documents and processes concerning accounting and  financial reporting provide additional assurance of  accurate and reliable reporting. These documents and  processes are updated by the groups finance and  treasury function when amendments are made to  legislation, accounting rules, reporting requirements,  et cetera.    The Shared Service unit delivers accounting, finance  administration, customer invoicing, supplier payments and  payroll services to the groups central operations. In  Sweden, these services are delivered via partners. Shared  Service ensures that outsourced services are delivered  with high quality to the consuming units. Delivery quality is  ensured through the monitoring of partners internal  control activities and reporting on the achievement of  agreed service levels and quality criteria to the  cooperation forum.   The groups finance and treasury function is responsible  for group accounts and consolidated financial statements  and for the groups common business system, SAP. This  responsibility includes regular analyses of the financial  results of the business operations and group functions.  The financial statement and reporting processes include  controls for reporting, valuation, disclosure requirements  and application of accounting principles.    Information and communication  The Swedish states ownership policy specifies guidelines,  which PostNord follows, for external reporting applicable  to state-owned companies.     The groups Financial Accounting manual and  supplementary internal guidelines for accounting and  closing procedures are regularly updated and are  communicated to relevant employees via the groups  intranet and other channels.    The Board and the Audit Committee receive financial  reports on the groups position and earnings trends on a  regular basis, and examine all quarterly accounts and  group annual reports before they are published.   Information to the groups external stakeholders is  communicated on an ongoing basis through press  releases and PostNords website. Financial reporting is also  made directly to the Danish and Swedish owners.  Governance and monitoring  PostNords business activities are reported and evaluated  monthly based on business objectives. PostNords financial  situation is discussed at each board meeting. Board  committees play important roles in terms of  compensation, financial reporting and internal governance  and control.    The Audit Committee receives regular reports from the  groups external and internal auditors. The Audit  Committee monitors that action is taken to improve  internal governance and control in view of the auditors  observations and recommendations.    All companies and group functions conduct annual  assessments of the internal governance and control of  financial reporting. A selection of companies and units are  visited annually in order to verify the reliability of the sell- assessments. Results are compiled by PostNords unit for  internal governance and control and self-assessment  results are presented to the Audit Committee, the Board,  business operations and group functions.    Based on the self-assessment responses received for  2011, the internal governance and control of financial  reporting is deemed to function satisfactorily within the  group.   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RERPOT   >  UNIVERSAL SERVICE OBLIGATIONS     <.    POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  61    Universal service obligations  PostNords subsidiaries, Post Danmark A/S and Posten AB,  are commissioned to provide universal postal services in  Denmark and Sweden, respectively. National legislation is  based on the EU directive regulating postal services within  the EU and on the Universal Postal Union treaty that  regulates international mail.  Deregulation within the EU  European Parliament and Council of Ministers Directive  2008/6/EG (the Third Postal Directive) concerning the  complete implementation of the communitys inner market  for postal services includes provisions for the deregulation of  EU postal markets by December 31, 2010, with the exception  of 11 countries which are exempted until December 31, 2012.  Provisions in Denmark  The EU directive was enacted in a new Danish Postal Act,  which took effect on January 1, 2011 and now regulates postal  services in Denmark. The law includes provisions stipulating  that universal services will be ensured on a deregulated  postal market. Under the Postal Act, the Ministry of Transport  has the authority to designate Post Danmark to fulfill the  delivery obligation during the 2011-13 period. Commercial  postal operations must be licensed and all postal operators  that distribute mail or parcels may be required to contribute  funding to the postal operation that holds the distribution  obligation.    Nationwide postal services and associated rights and  obligations are also set forth in the Special License for Post  Danmark A/S. The special license includes provisions for  service level, quality, price, etcetera and specifies that Post  Danmark shall distribute products covered by the delivery  obligation on every Danish weekday (Monday – Saturday,  although parcels are not distributed on Saturdays). Such  products include addressed letters; daily, weekly and monthly  periodicals; addressed mail items with standardized printed  content (e.g., catalogs) weighing up to 2 kilos; addressed  parcels weighing up to 20 kilos (with the exception of B2B  parcels governed by contractual terms); and Braille material  weighing up to 7 kilos. Addressed priority mail is delivered  overnight and non-priority mail within 2-3 business days. Post  Danmark sets the service requirement for C-mail (currently  four business days). The quality requirement for letters and  parcels is set at 93%.    Prices for services provided under the delivery obligation  shall be cost-based, transparent and non-discriminatory. Only  single mail items are required to be offered at uniform prices  throughout the country. Single mail items include stamped  letters and parcels not covered by agreement with Post  Danmark. The Transport Ministry approves the price for  domestic non-priority mail weighing up to 50 grams sent as  single mail items. Post Danmark sets the price of other mail  items. In order to improve the price-cost correlation, Post  Danmark increased the price variance between services in  the product range during 2011.     Post Danmark shall maintain a nationwide service network  of postal service points able to perform all services covered  by the delivery obligation.    The law also specifies that mailboxes for all Danish  households must be located on the property line before  January 1, 2012. Post Danmark worked on implementing this  change during 2011.  Provisions in Sweden  Universal postal services in Sweden are regulated by the  Swedish Postal Services Act, postal statutes and concession  terms issued by the Swedish Post and Telecom Agency (PTS).  The Third Postal Directive has been enacted in Sweden  through a new Postal Services Act which came into effect on  September 1, 2010. The Postal Services Act mandates the  provision of nationwide postal services that enable all  residents of Sweden to receive letters and other addressed  mail items weighing up to 20 kilos (universal postal service).    Postal services must be of good quality, and it must be  possible for everyone to receive such mailings delivered at  reasonable prices. Pricing for universal postal services shall  be transparent, non-discriminatory and cost-oriented. Single  mail items shall be delivered at uniform prices.   The states service objectives for mail weighing up to 20  kilos are that mail must be collected and delivered on every  weekday and at least five days a week nationwide. The postal  statutes specify that at least 85% of the mail posted before a  specified time and stamped for overnight delivery must be  delivered on the following business day, nationwide  (overnight delivery). At least 97% of that mail shall be  delivered within three business days. For overnight mail, a  price limit applies to single mail items weighing up to 500  grams, so that their price may be raised no faster than the  consumer price index.    According to the legislative history of the Postal Services  Act, the substance of the universal postal service shall remain  unchanged, although this substance was not clear. To a  certain degree, the new law imposes more stringent  requirements on the operator appointed to provide universal  postal services (Posten AB), including new requirements for    >     CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RERPOT   >  UNIVERSAL SERVICE OBLIGATIONS  62  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    pricing transparency and reporting and non-discrimination.  The new law also includes regulations that exceed those in  the EUs Postal Directive, including a price ceiling. At the same  time, PostNords main competitor, Bring – owned by the state- owned Norwegian Post – is not subject to these special  regulations or the more stringent requirements.     Under the new law, the market is also allowed to provide  necessary universal postal services, meaning that no specific  postal operator needs to be appointed. Nevertheless, PTS  appointed Posten to provide universal postal services as part  of Posten ABs licensing terms. This increases opportunities  for PTS to impose requirements on Posten, requirements that  are not imposed on Postens competitors.    PTS announced its decision on new licensing terms for  Posten AB in October 2011. The new terms, effective as of  October 15, 2011, involve increased regulation. Among other  things, Posten is required to publish on its website complete  price lists for mail deliveries. Annual volume size and  customer-specific discounts must be reported.    Regulation in Sweden and various interpretations as to  what it entails have given rise to a number of lawsuits. During  2011, the Administrative Court in Stockholm rendered several  judgments on Posten ABs 2010 licensing terms, the  calculation model (SAC) and Postens pricing in low- and  normal-price zones (zone pricing). Posten appealed the  decisions on the 2010 licensing terms and SAC to the  Administrative Court of Appeal. In the first case, the Court of  Appeal granted a stay of enforcement (i.e., the lower courts  ruling does not apply while the appellate court has the matter  under advisement) and leave to appeal. A decision is  expected in 2012. In terms of the SAC case, the Administrative  Court of Appeal granted a stay pending resolution of the  licensing term case. Also in 2011, Posten appealed the PTS  decision regarding 2011 licensing terms to the Administrative  Court in Stockholm; a stay was granted in this case pending  the appellate courts resolution of the 2010 licensing terms  case.     In the area of competition law, the Market Court enjoined  Posten from applying the sortation discount introduced on  January 1, 2009 for special sorting. Also in 2011, Posten  Meddelande AB was subject to a dawn raid by the Swedish  Competition Authority; the agencys inquiry is still underway.  Supervision in Denmark and Sweden  In Denmark, the Traffic Board (Trafikstyrelsen) regulates  postal services on the national level. The Traffic Board  supervises Post Danmark and all private postal companies  operating in the Danish market. There are a great many  postal operators in Denmark, a result of the previous ease of  registration for individual carriers that transported mail items  for a postal operator. The number of registered postal  operators is expected to be drastically reduced due to the  clarification of registration requirements in the postal statutes.  Under Danish postal legislation, postal operator is defined as  a business that provides commercial postal services for  addressed mail items weighing up to 20 kilos. Upon request,  postal operators must provide the Traffic Board with a  number of details and must submit an audited statement of  delivered postal volume quantity on an annual basis.   In Sweden, PTS supervises postal operations to ensure that  Posten complies with postal legislation and fulfills  government requirements for universal postal services. PTS  has granted licenses to conduct postal operations in Sweden  to approximately 30 companies.   According to the PTS report Service and Competition 2011,  PostNord Group fulfills government requirements in terms of  service quality. In terms of the percentage of mail distributed  on the following day, the group continues to exceed by a  wide margin the minimum requirements stipulated by the  terms of its license.  Special provisions — including  provisions for sparsely populated areas  In Denmark, postal operator and service ordinances set forth  regulations for the installation of mailboxes and apartment  mailboxes. Under the new law, mailboxes for all households  must be located on the property line (in rural areas, no farther  than 50 meters from the house). All multi-storey buildings  must install apartment mailboxes in the entrance area or  outside the main entrance. People who are unable to collect  their mail are entitled to have mail delivered to their door. The  Ministry of Transport may limit mail distribution in fringe  areas, such as particularly remote areas and islands lacking  ferry service. An extra day is added to the delivery time for  parcels from Bornholm addressed nationwide.   In Sweden, PTS has issued general suggestions concerning  the delivery of mail in the provision of the universal postal  service. Among other things, the general guidelines state that,  outside urban areas, mail should be delivered to mailbox  clusters along the mail carriers route. Mail items addressed to  mail recipients living less than 200 meters down a side road  should be delivered to the mailbox cluster on the main route.  If there are at least two mail recipients who reside or work  permanently for every kilometer of the side road, mail should  be delivered along that road. However, elderly and physically  handicapped people are entitled to have their mail delivered  to their property line, as opposed to the mailbox cluster, upon  request. The PTS licensing terms state that mailing and drop- off points shall be located close enough to each other as to  take users needs into account. This provision particularly  affects Posten ABs partner outlet network in Sweden.

The Swedish Annual Accounts Act and  the Swedish Financial Reporting Boards rule RFR 1,  Supplemental Financial Statements for Groups, have also  been applied.   The parent company applies the same accounting  principles as the group, with exceptions specified in Note 1,  Accounting Principles for the parent company. The  differences between the parent companys and the groups  accounting principles result from the parent companys  limitations in applying IFRS as a consequence of the Swedish  Accounts Act and the Act of Safeguarding of Pension  Commitments, and are to some extent based on tax  considerations.  Basis of preparation  The parent companys functional currency is SEK, which is  also the reporting currency for the consolidated and parent  company accounts. This means that all financial reports are  presented in SEK. Unless otherwise specified, all figures are  rounded to the nearest million. Assets and liabilities are  primarily carried at acquisition cost, with the exception of  certain financial assets and liabilities that are reported at fair  value. These financial assets and liabilities reported at fair  value consist of derivatives as well as financial assets  classified either as financial assets reported at fair value in  the income statement or as available-for-sale financial  assets. (See the description of categories in the Financial  instruments section). Available-for-sale fixed assets and  disposable items held for trading are reported at the lower of  their fair value less the cost of sale or the value at which they  were previously reported.   The reporting under IRFS requires the executive  management to make assessments, estimates and  assumptions that affect the application of the accounting  principles and the reported values of assets, liabilities, income  and costs. These estimates and assumptions are based on  historical experience and a number of other factors  considered reasonable under prevailing circumstances. The  results of these estimates and assumptions are used to  assess the reported values of assets and liabilities whose  values cannot be clearly determined using other sources.  Actual future values may differ from these estimates and  assessments.   The estimates and assumptions used are reviewed  regularly. Changes in estimates or valuations are reported in  the period when the change is made, if the change only  affects that period, or are reported in future periods as well, if  the change affects the original as well as subsequent periods.   Assessments made by executive management in the  application of IFRS that have a material effect on the financial  reports as well as estimates that can lead to significant  adjustments in subsequent fiscal years financial reports are  described in further detail in Note 2, Estimates and  Assessments, and in relevant notes where estimates have  been used.   The consolidated accounting principles have been applied  consistently during all periods in the groups financial  statements and in the consolidation of subsidiaries,  associated companies and joint ventures.  Changes in accounting principles  Accounting principles that came into effect in 2011   IAS 24, Related Party Disclosures. The amendment  stipulates that transactions between state-owned  companies are not automatically considered to be related  party transactions. To be applied from January 1, 2011. The  companys disclosures to date concerning transactions  with the government are limited to reports of a non- commercial nature, meaning that related party transactions  have been applied to specific mandates from the state and  licenses from authorities. The amendments to the standard  have not had any bearing on the companys related party  disclosure.   IFRIC 14 IAS 19, Limits on a Defined Benefit Asset,  Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.  Under the change, surplus for covering minimum pension  funding requirements may be recognized as assets. The  majority of defined benefit pension plans in Sweden are  safeguarded by a pension fund. Payments are not normally  made to the pension fund to cover minimum funding  requirements. Rather, other methods such as pension  liability insurance are used to safeguard benefits. The  change therefore has had no effect on the companys  reporting.   IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements. The  amendment allows the specification of Other  Comprehensive Income items in the notes to the  Statement of Changes in Equity, rather than as changes in  reserves in the statement. The company has elected to  specify these items as equity.    Changes in other standards have not been applicable to the  companys or the groups reporting.  Future changes in accounting principles that take effect in  2012 or later, following EU approval   IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The corridor method will be  removed under the amendment. Actuarial gains and losses  that are currently not reported to the extent that they are  not amortized during the coming year will be reported in  other comprehensive income. The new regulations also  stipulate that reporting of plan assets for pension benefits  shall be based on the discount rate used to calculate  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES      <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  69   pension commitments. The difference between actual return  and estimated return shall be reported in other  comprehensive income. The change affects the groups  operating profit (EBIT), as amortization of actuarial gains and  losses will no longer be reported as part of personnel  expenses. In the current situation, with unreported actuarial  losses, the change will have a positive effect on operating  profit. Net financial items will be adversely affected as  compared to current reporting, as the presumed return is  and has been 1 percentage point over the discount rate. The  impact on equity and other comprehensive income will  produce major fluctuations due primarily to varying discount  rates between reporting periods. The change will apply as of  January 1, 2013.   IFRS 9, Financial Instruments will replace the current IAS  39. To be applied no later than January 1, 2015. Under the  changes, current valuation categories will be replaced by  two valuation principles: fair value and amortized cost.  Classification and valuation principle will be determined by  the companys objectives and conditions. The changes also  mean that impairment of receivables will be based on  anticipated losses and collectability, and that the amortized  costs of such financial assets will be directly reduced.  Changes with regard to hedge accounting have been so  amended that the criteria for applying hedge accounting  are eased somewhat and clarify that net accounting of  financial assets and liabilities can be done as prescribed by  law.   IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements is a new  standard for consolidated financial statements to be  applied as of January 1, 2013.   IFRS 12, Disclosure of interests in other Entities is a new  standard for information on investments in subsidiaries,  joint ventures and associated companies to be applied as  of January 1, 2013. The standard includes increased  requirements for information concerning risks associated  with investments in the above, as well as description of the  consequences of changes of ownership and degree of  control.   IFRS 13, Fair value measurements is a new standard to  establish uniform principles for ways in which fair value  measurements should be conducted. It clarifies and  describes the valuation methods precedence and validity  for fair value and shall be applied as of January 1, 2013.   IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements. Amended so  that other comprehensive income items are divided into  two categories: items that will be reclassified as net profit  and items that will not be classified. Items to be reclassified  include translation differences and gains and losses for  cash flow hedges, while items such as actuarial gains and  losses and application of revaluation methods for intangible  and tangible assets will not be reclassified. The amendment  shall be applied to the financial year beginning July 1, 2012,  which is January 1, 2013 for PostNord.    Changes in other forthcoming standards have not been  applicable to the companys or the groups reporting.  The company has elected not to apply new and future  changes to accounting principles, interpretations or  improvements (Improvements to IFRS) in advance.  Segment reporting  A segment is a component of the group that can be  distinguished for financial reporting purposes, comprising  operational divisions or geographical areas. A segment is  identified by the fact that its divisions offer similar products  and services and that it is exposed to different risks and  opportunities from those of other segments. Segment  accounting is based on managements segment reporting.  PostNords segment grouping is based on its universal  service obligation for mail and parcel services in Sweden and  Denmark, and on its mission to offer information logistics and  logistics services in the Nordic region.   Information on segments is available only for the group.  Classification, etc.  Fixed assets and long-term liabilities essentially comprise  amounts expected to be recovered or paid more than 12  months from the close of the accounting period. Current  assets and current liabilities essentially comprise amounts  expected to be recovered or paid within 12 months from the  close of the accounting period.  Basis of consolidation  The Swedish Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and  Communications and the Danish Ministry of Transport  announced on February 2, 2009 that Posten AB and Posten  Danmark A/S had signed an agreement to merge the  companies through a joint venture between the Swedish and  Danish states. The owners founded a new company,  PostNord AB, which became the parent company of the joint  group as of June 24, 2009. The Posten AB and Post Danmark  A/S groups were consolidated as of July 1, 2009.   The merger has been reported in accordance with the  carry-over method, meaning that consolidated net assets  are reported at the reported values in the accounts of Posten  AB and Post Danmark A/S respectively at the time of the  merger. For reported values as of December 31, 2009, this  means that PostNords consolidated balance sheet comprises  the book values that the two companies would have had if  each were reported individually. The groups opening  balances are the book values of each companys balance  sheet at the time of the merger. Therefore, pension liabilities  were not recalculated actuarially as of the merger date and  no revaluation of assets was performed. In compiling the  groups Notes, opening balances (as required and not  reported at time of merger) were calculated based on   12-31-09 balances and reported changes and income items.  Subsidiaries  Subsidiaries are companies in which PostNord exercises a  controlling influence. This implies directly or indirectly holding  the right to set the companies financial and operational  strategies with the aim of attaining financial benefits. Voting  rights that can be exercised or immediately converted are  considered when determining the existence of a controlling  influence.    >     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES     70  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    Subsidiaries are reported in accordance with acquisition  method. Under this method, an acquisition is treated as a  transaction in which the group indirectly acquires the assets  and assumes the actual and contingent liabilities of the  subsidiary. The consolidated acquisition cost is calculated  using an acquisition analysis performed upon acquisition. The  analysis determines the acquisition cost of the shares or  operations as well as the fair value of the assets acquired and  the actual and contingent liabilities assumed at the  acquisition date. The acquisition cost of a subsidiarys shares  or its operations consists of the fair value on the acquisition  date of assets, realized or assumed liabilities and equity  instruments issued in exchange for the net assets acquired.  Acquisition costs attributable to the acquisition are only  capitalized for legal entities in line with local accounting and  taxation regulations, and are expensed in the consolidated  financial statements. Conditional purchase consideration is  fixed at fair value at acquisition date. Adjustments made to  the related liability for the conditional purchase consideration  through the settlement date are reported in other  comprehensive income. The difference between the  acquisition cost for subsidiary shares and the fair value of  acquired assets, assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities  comprise consolidated goodwill. Ownership changes are  reported as equity transactions as long as control is  maintained. When controlling influence ceases, gains and  losses are reported in net profit; the remainder is revalued in  income.   Subsidiaries accounts are included in the consolidated  statements from the date of acquisition until the date on  which the controlling influence ceases to exist.  Associated companies  Associated companies are companies in which the group has  a significant, but not controlling, influence on operational and  financial management, normally between 20 and 50% of the  voting rights. Participations in associated companies are  reported in the consolidated statements using the equity  method from the date on which the significant influence is  established. Under the equity method, the consolidated book  value of a participation in an associated company  corresponds to the groups share of that companys equity as  well as consolidated goodwill and any residual value of  consolidated surplus and deficit values. The groups share of  associated companies operating earnings, financial income,  taxes and minority interests is reported after being adjusted  for any depreciation, impairments or dissolution of acquired  surplus or deficit values. Dividends received from an  associated company are deducted from the reported value of  that investment. The groups acquisition cost, goodwill and  any deficit values are determined in the same way as for  subsidiaries, using an acquisition analysis (see the  Subsidiaries section above), except that acquisition costs are  capitalized in the group. Losses are allocated to non- controlling interests even in cases where the proportion of  equity becomes negative.   The equity method is applied until the date on which the  significant influence ceases to exist.  Joint ventures  For reporting purposes, a joint venture is a company in which  the group exercises a significant influence on operational and  financial management decisions jointly with one or more  partners based on an agreement. Joint ventures are  consolidated in the accounts using the proportional method.  Under the proportional method, the groups stake in each  joint ventures income and costs as well as assets and  liabilities are consolidated in the groups income statement  and balance sheet. This is done by combining, item by item,  the joint venture partners stake in assets and liabilities and  income and costs with the corresponding items in the  partners consolidated accounts. Only equity earned after the  acquisition is reported in consolidated equity. The  proportional method is applied from the date on which the  joint controlling influence is established, until the date on  which that influence ceases.  Transactions eliminated on consolidation  Intra-group receivables and liabilities, income and costs, and  gains or losses arising from intercompany transactions are  eliminated in their entirety upon consolidation. Intra-group  losses that indicate impairment are included in the  consolidated accounts.   Gains and losses resulting from transactions with  associated companies or joint ventures are eliminated in  proportion to the groups stake in those businesses. Losses  are recognized to the extent they indicate impairment.  Foreign currency  Foreign currency transactions  A groups functional currency is the currency of the primary  economies in which the companies in that group operate.  The group consists of the parent company and its  subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures.   Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the  functional currency at the rate prevailing on the transaction  date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies are translated into the functional currency at the  exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange  differences arising from these translations are reported in the  income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities  denominated in foreign currencies and reported at their  acquisition costs are translated at the rate prevailing on the  transaction date. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities  denominated in foreign currencies and reported at fair value  are translated into the functional currency using the  exchange rate on the date of valuation. Changes in exchange  rates are then reported in the same way as other changes in  the value of assets or liabilities.  Foreign entities financial statements  Assets and liabilities held by foreign entities, including  goodwill and other consolidated surplus and deficit values,  are translated into SEK at the exchange rate prevailing on the  balance sheet date. Income and costs in foreign entities are  translated into SEK using an average exchange rate,  approximately equal to the exchange rates prevailing on the  transaction date. Translation differences arising from the   CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES      <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  71   translation of foreign entities are recognized directly in equity  as a translation reserve.  Income  Income from services is reported in the income statement  based on the stage of completion at the balance sheet date.  The Letter and Messaging and Logistics business segments  recognize income when a physical mail piece has been  collected for physical transportation. Income related to  services featuring an electronic component (hybrid service) is  recognized once the object has been converted into a  physical format and been received for physical transportation  in the form of a mail piece. Mail processing facility fees relate  to the handling period; that is, the period in which the mail  piece was received from abroad. Distribution income is  recognized in the period in which the service is performed.  Income from post office boxes is accrued over the contract  duration. Services in Strlfors are generally performed over a  short period of time, the income recognized when the service  has been delivered.   The sale of goods is recognized upon delivery in  accordance with the terms and conditions of sale, such that  income is reported when the risks and rewards associated  with the goods are transferred to the counterparty.   Income is not recognized if the financial rewards are  unlikely to befall the group. Net sales are reported excluding  value-added tax, discounts provided and similar income  reductions.  Expenses and financial income and expenses  Expenses  Personnel expenses are attributed to the period in which  duties are performed. Changes in vacation and wage liabilities  are reported on an ongoing basis, as employee entitlements  accrue. Thus, periods during which large numbers of  employees are on vacation usually feature below-average  personnel expenses. Other expenses are reported in the  period during which the goods or services have been  delivered or utilized (e.g. rental costs).  Payments for assets leased under operational leases  Payments for operational leases are reported in the income  statement on a straight-line basis over the leasing period.  Rewards received upon signing a leasing contract are  reported as part of the total leasing cost in the income  statement on a straight-line basis over the leasing period.  Variable costs are expensed in the period in which they arise.  Payments for assets leased under finance leases  Minimum lease payments are divided between interest and  amortization of the remaining liability. Interest expenses are  distributed over the leasing period so that each reporting  period is charged with a payment corresponding to a fixed  interest rate for the liability reported in that period. Variable  costs are expensed in the period in which they arise.   Financial income and expenses  Financial income and expenses consist of interest income  from bank deposits, receivables and interest-bearing  securities; interest paid on loans; dividend income; foreign  exchange differences; unrealized and realized gains and  losses on financial investments; and derivatives used in  financial operations.   Interest income on receivables and interest expense on  liabilities are calculated using the effective interest method.  When the effective interest rate is used, the present value of  all receipts and disbursements during the fixed-interest term  equals the reported value of the receivable or liability. The  interest component of a finance lease payment is reported in  the income statement using the effective interest method.  Interest income and expense include accrued transaction  costs and any discounts, premiums or other differences  between the original reported value of the receivable or  liability and the amount settled at maturity.   Issue expenses and similar direct transaction costs related  to raising loans are included in the calculation of effective  interest.   Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive  dividends has been confirmed.  Financial instruments  Financial instruments reported on the assets side of the  balance sheet include cash and cash equivalents, accounts  receivable, shares, loan receivables, bond premiums and  derivatives. Reported on the equity and liabilities side are  accounts payable, debt and equity instruments issued, loans  and derivatives.   Financial instruments are initially recognized at acquisition  cost, equivalent to the instruments fair value plus transaction  costs, for all financial instruments except those classified as  financial assets. Financial assets are reported at fair value in  the income statement. Subsequent accounting differs,  depending on how the financial instrument is classified, as  detailed below.   A financial asset or liability is entered on the balance sheet  when the company becomes a party to the instruments  terms and conditions. Accounts receivable are recognized on  the balance sheet once the invoice has been sent. Liabilities  are recognized when a counterparty has rendered services  and payment as due under the terms of the contract, even if  an invoice has yet to be received. Accounts payable are  recognized when an invoice is received.   Financial assets are taken off the balance sheet when the  rights of the contract have been realized, when they mature  or when they are no longer controlled by the company. The  same applies to portions of financial assets. Financial liabilities  are taken off the balance sheet when contractual obligations  are fulfilled or otherwise cease. The same applies to portions  of financial liabilities.   Acquisitions and disposals of financial assets are recorded  on the date of transaction, which is the day on which the  company becomes legally bound to acquire or dispose of the  financial assets. This does not apply to the acquisition or  disposal of listed securities, which are recorded on the  settlement date.   The fair value of a listed financial asset corresponds to the  assets bid rate in the market on the balance sheet date. The  fair value of unlisted financial assets, consisting of  endowment insurance policies and cash, is ascertained  through various valuation methods such as the use of recent   >     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES     72  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    transactions, the price of comparable instruments and  discounted cash flows.   The values of financial assets and groups of financial assets  are assessed in every reporting period to discern any  objective impairment. The criteria for determining the need  for any impairment is primarily based on the counterpartys  officially communicated inability to meet its obligations or on  its ability to pay demonstrated by experience in the financial  markets.   Financial instruments are classified into categories,  depending on the purpose for which each instrument was  acquired. The classification is determined at the time of  acquisition. The categories are as follows:  Financial assets reported at fair value in the income  statement  This category contains two subgroups: financial assets held  for trading and other financial assets that the company has  initially chosen to place in this category. A financial asset is  classified as held for trading if acquired for the purpose of  resale in the short term. Derivatives are classified as held for  trading unless they are used for hedge accounting. Assets in  this category are carried at their fair value, with changes in  value recognized in the income statement.  Loan receivables and accounts receivable  Loan receivables and accounts receivable are financial assets  that are not derivatives but have fixed payments or  determinable payments and are not listed in an active  market. They are created by the company when providing  money, goods or services directly to the debtor, not for the  purpose of trading in the right to recover the debt. This  category includes acquired receivables. Assets in this  category are valued at their amortized cost. The amortized  cost is determined based on the effective interest rate  calculated at the acquisition date.  Held-to-maturity investments  Held-to-maturity investments are financial assets with fixed or  predeterminable payments and fixed maturity, and which the  company has the express intent and ability to hold to  maturity. Assets in this category are valued at their amortized  cost. The amortized cost is determined based on the effective  interest rate calculated at the acquisition date. Thus, surplus  and deficit values as well as direct transaction costs are  distributed over the instruments duration.  Available-for-sale financial assets  Available-for-sale assets are those financial assets that are not  required to be classified in any other category, or financial  assets which the company has initially chosen to place in this  category. Assets in this category are carried at their fair value,  with changes in value recognized in equity, except those  attributable to impairments. When the assets are disposed of  and removed from the balance sheet, unrealized gains and  losses in the equity are reversed to the income statement.  Interest measured with the effective interest rate method is  recognized in the income statement.  Financial liabilities held for trading and other financial assets  Financial liabilities held for trading consist of interest-bearing  liabilities and derivatives not used for hedge accounting.  Liabilities in this category are reported at fair value, with  changes in value recognized in the income statement.  Other financial liabilities  Financial liabilities not held for trading are valued at  amortized cost. The amortized cost is determined based on  the effective interest rate calculated at the acquisition date.  Thus surplus and deficit values as well as direct issue  expenses are distributed over the liabilitys duration.  Borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition, construction  or production of assets that take a significant time to  complete will be capitalized.  Cash and cash equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money in demand  deposits at banks and similar institutions, and short-term  liquid investments with maturities shorter than three months  from the date of acquisition that are exposed to minimal risk  of fluctuation in value. Funds in transfer on the statement of  cash flows are not treated as cash and cash equivalents. They  are accounting items that PostNord transfers on behalf of  customers. These funds are therefore unavailable to  PostNord and may not be used by its business operations.  The Funds in Transfer item fluctuates independently of  operating earnings, investments and other payment streams  in the business operations.  Financial investments  Financial investments are classified either as financial fixed  assets or short-term investments, depending on the purpose  of the investment. If the maturity or expected investment  period is longer than one year, they are classified as financial  fixed assets; if shorter than one year but longer than three  months, they are short-term investments.   Interest-bearing securities acquired with the aim of being  held to maturity belong to the category financial investments  held to maturity and are valued at amortized cost. Interest- bearing securities that the company does not intend to hold  to maturity are classified as financial assets recognized at fair  value in the income statement or available-for-sale financial  assets.   When assets are reported at fair value in the income  statement, changes in value are recognized under net  financial items.  Long-term receivables and other short-term  receivables  Long-term receivables and other short-term receivables are  receivables created by the company when providing money  not for the purpose of trading in the right to recover the debt.  Those with an expected holding period longer than one year  are classified as long-term receivables, those less than one  year as other short-term receivables. These receivables  belong to the category Loans Receivable and Accounts  Receivable.    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES      <.    POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  73   Accounts receivable  Accounts receivable are classified under Loans Receivable  and Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are reported  at the amount expected to be received less doubtful  receivables, assessed on an individual basis. Accounts  receivable are written down when considered doubtful; that  is, if more than 90 days past due or due from a customer  with a history of payment difficulties. Accounts receivable  from customers recognized as solvent and with good  payment histories are not considered doubtful even if more  than 90 days past due as long as the customer can be  expected to pay appropriate interest. The expected maturity  of accounts receivable is short, so they are reported at their  non-discounted nominal value. Impairments on accounts  receivable are reported under expenses.  Liabilities  Liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities and are  thus initially reported at the amounts received less  transaction costs. After its acquisition date, a loan is valued at  its amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.  Those with an expected maturity of more than one year are  classified as long-term liabilities, and those of less than one  year as short-term liabilities.  Accounts payable  Accounts payable are classified under other financial  liabilities. The expected maturity of accounts payable is short,  so they are valued at their non-discounted nominal value.  Derivatives and hedge accounting  Derivatives held by the group are in the form of forward  contracts used to minimize the groups exposure to  fluctuations in exchange rates, electricity rates and fuel prices.  Changes in the values of derivatives are recognized in the  income statement, based on the purpose of the holding.  Foreign currency receivables and liabilities  Forward contracts are used to hedge assets and liabilities  against foreign exchange risk. Hedge accounting is  unnecessary for matching, as the hedged item is translated at  the exchange rate on the balance sheet date and the hedge  instrument is measured at fair value with changes in value  recognized in the income statement under foreign exchange  differences. PostNord thereby achieves essentially the same  matching of income and expenses as through hedge  accounting. Changes in value related to operating receivables  and liabilities are recognized under operating earnings, while  changes in value related to financial receivables and liabilities  are recognized under net financial items.  Transaction exposure – cash-flow hedges  Forward contracts are used to hedge exposure to  fluctuations in exchange rates related to cash flows under  contractual agreements. Value changes are recognized in the  income statement.  Net investments  Investments in foreign subsidiaries (net assets including  goodwill) are not hedged. At year-end they are translated at  the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Foreign  exchange differences recognized in the parent companys  income statement are eliminated in the consolidated  accounts through revaluation of the net assets in the  subsidiary included in equity.  Tangible fixed assets  Owned assets  Tangible fixed assets are entered as assets on the balance  sheet when it is likely that the future financial rewards of  ownership will befall the company, and if the acquisition cost  of the asset can be reliably determined.    Tangible fixed assets are reported at acquisition cost less  accumulated depreciation and impairments. The acquisition  cost consists of the purchase price as well as costs directly  related to bringing the asset to the necessary place and  condition for its use in accordance with the purpose of the  acquisition. Examples of directly related costs included in  acquisition cost are delivery and handling, installation,  registration of title, consulting fees and legal fees. Loan  expenses are not included in the acquisition cost of fixed  assets produced by the company. Accounting principles for  depreciations are described below.   Tangible fixed assets consisting of parts with different  useful lives are treated as separate components of tangible  fixed assets.    The reported value of a tangible fixed asset is taken off the  balance sheet when the asset is discarded or disposed of, or  when no further financial rewards are expected to be gained  from the use. Gains or losses arising from the discarding or  disposal of an asset are calculated as the difference between  the sale price and the assets carrying value, less expenses  directly related to the sale. Gains and losses are reported  under other income/expenses.  Leased assets  Leases are classified in the consolidated financial statements  as either finance or operational leases. Under finance leases,  the economic risks and rewards associated with ownership  are essentially transferred to the lessee. If such is not the case,  the agreement is deemed an operational lease.   Assets leased through finance lease agreements are  reported as assets in the consolidated balance sheets.  Obligations to pay leasing payments in the future are  reported as current and long-term liabilities. Leased assets  are depreciated according to plan, while lease payments are  reported as interest and amortization of the liability.   For operational leases, leasing fees are expensed during the  term based on usage and thus may differ from the leasing  fees actually paid during the year.  Additional costs  Additional costs related to tangible assets are added to the  acquisition cost only when it is likely that the future financial  rewards of the asset will befall the company and the  acquisition cost can be determined reliably. All other  additional costs are reported as expenses in the period in  which they were incurred.   Critical to the determination of whether additional costs  should be added to the acquisition cost is whether or not the  charge is related to exchanges of identifiable components or   >     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES   74  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    subcomponents; if so, such charges are capitalized. The cost  of creating a new component is also added to the acquisition  cost. Any reported value of an exchanged component or  subcomponent not already depreciated is discarded and  recognized as an expense at the date of exchange. Repairs  are expensed as they arise.  Depreciation principles  Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis  over the estimated useful life of the asset. Land is not  depreciated. The group applies component depreciation,  such that the estimated useful lives of material  subcomponents are a basis for depreciation.    The depreciation periods are as follows:    Buildings, land improvements and improvements to leased  properties  20–50 years  Equipment and installations for leased premises  5–10 years  Sorting equipment  5–10 years  Vehicles  4–10 years  Computer equipment  3–7 years  Other machinery and equipment  3–10 years    The residual values and estimated useful lives of assets are  evaluated annually.  Intangible assets  Goodwill  Goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition  cost of a subsidiary and the fair value of the acquired assets  and assumed and contingent liabilities.   The group has not applied IFRS retroactively to goodwill  arising from business combinations occurring prior to  January 1, 2004; rather, the reported value at that date has  been taken as the consolidated acquisition cost, after  impairment testing.   Goodwill is measured at acquisition cost less any  accumulated impairments. Goodwill is allocated to cash- generating units and is no longer amortized but is tested for  impairment annually. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of  an associated company is included in the reported value of  the holding in that associated company.   Goodwill relates mainly to the acquisition in 2001 of  Postens parcel distribution services, the 2006 acquisition of  Strlfors and the acquisition of Tollpost AS. Goodwill from  these acquisitions is denominated in SEK, NOK, EUR, GBP and  DKK.  Capitalized development expenditures  Development-related expenditures are capitalized whenever  it is deemed they will provide future financial benefits. The  reported value includes direct expenses for services and  materials. Other development expenditures are expensed in  the income statement as they arise. Capitalized development  expenditures are reported on the balance sheet at acquisition  cost less accumulated amortization and impairments.  PostNord defines development expenditures as costs related  to the development of commercially viable services and  products that can be incorporated into PostNords offering.  These costs include costs that are directly related to the  newly developed offering. Development expenditures are  capitalized when they satisfy IAS 38 criteria and are estimated  to amount to a material sum for the overall development  project. Other development expenditures are expensed as  normal expenses.   The main criteria for capitalization are that the  development efforts will lead to proven future rewards and  cash flows and that the necessary technical and financial  conditions exist for completing the development work once it  has been commenced.   Other development projects, such as projects related to  essential ERP systems, are capitalized when they amount to  or are estimated to amount to a material sum for the overall  project. Otherwise, such charges are expensed.  Other intangible fixed assets  Other intangible fixed assets comprise acquired brands and  other rights, which are reported at the acquisition cost less  accumulated amortization and impairments. Straight-line  depreciation is used for the term of such rights, usually 5-10  years.  Additional costs  Additional costs related to capitalized intangible assets are  recognized as assets on the balance sheet only when they  enhance the future financial benefits that exceed the original  assessments. All other payments are expensed as they arise.  Amortization principles  Amortization is reported in the income statement on a  straight-line basis over each intangible assets estimated  useful life, where this can be ascertained. Goodwill and  intangible assets with indeterminate useful lives are tested for  impairment annually or as soon as there is an indication of  impairment of the asset in question. Intangible assets are  amortized from the date on which they were made available  for use.    The following amortization periods are applied:    Capitalized, completed development efforts  5–10 years  Brands, customer relations, licenses and other rights  5–10 years  Inventory  Inventory is valued at the lower of acquisition value,  determined using the first-in/first-out (FIFO) method, and net  realizable value.  Impairments  The reported values of consolidated assets – with the  exception of available-for-sale assets and disposal items  reported in accordance with IFRS 5, investment properties,  inventories, assets under management used to meet pension  commitments, and deferred tax credit – are tested at each  balance sheet date to discern impairment. If such indications  exist, the assets recoverable value is calculated. The assets  listed as exceptions above are tested to applicable standards.   The recoverable value of goodwill, other intangible assets  with indeterminate useful lives and intangible assets not yet  ready for use is calculated annually.   For impairment of financial assets, see the Financial  Instruments section.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES      <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  75   An impairment loss is reported when the reported value of an  asset of a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable value.  Impairment losses are reported in the income statement.   Impairments on assets related to cash-generating units are  primarily allocated to goodwill. Proportional impairments are  subsequently charged to all other assets in the unit.  Calculation of recoverable amount  The reported values of the groups assets are tested at each  balance sheet date to discern indications of impairment. If  such indications exist, the recoverable value of individual or  naturally affiliated assets is measured as the higher of the fair  value less selling expenses and the useful value. The  measurement of useful values is based on PostNords  assessment of future cash flows. In the measurement of  useful values, future cash flows are discounted using a  discount rate that takes into account risk-free interest and the  risk linked to each specific asset. The assessments are based  on the corporate business plans and are augmented by other  relevant information, used to enhance accuracy.  Reversal of impairment  Impairment losses on goodwill are never reversed.  Impairment of other assets is reversed if there is both an  indication that the impairment no longer exists and a change  in the assumptions used as a basis for measuring such assets  recoverable values.   Impairment is reversed only to the extent that the reported  value of an asset, after reversal, does not exceed the reported  value that the asset would have had if no impairment had  been recognized, taking into account the amortization that  would have been charged.  Dividends paid  Dividends are reported as liabilities after they have been  approved for payment by the AGM.  Employee benefits  Pension commitments  The PostNord Groups pension commitments are met in part  through defined benefit plans featuring a contractually  binding promise regarding a given future pension level for  employees, and in part through defined contribution plans for  which premiums have been set aside and for which the  employee assumes the risk as regards the future pension  level. The Groups obligations with respect to defined  contribution plans are reported as personnel expenses in the  income statement as they accrue through the employees  performance of their work duties. Most of the defined benefit  plans consist of a pension plan set up for PostNord AB (publ)  in Sweden and some smaller plans in Norway and France.  Actuarial calculations are prepared for all defined benefit  plans in accordance with the projected unit credit method in  an effort to establish the present value of commitments  concerning benefits for current and former employees.  Actuarial calculations are prepared annually and are based on  actuarial assumptions, which are made at the end of the fiscal  year. These assumptions cover inflation, changes in the  income base amount, personnel turnover, discount rates,  rates of return and life expectancy.  The groups net commitments consist of the present value of  pension commitments less the fair value of assets under  management. Changes in the present value of commitments  owing to changed actuarial assumptions are treated as  actuarial gains or losses. Actuarial gains and losses are  recognized in the income statement over the employees  average remaining period of employment in cases where  they exceed the corridor threshold for each plan. The  corridor threshold equals 10% of the higher of the value of  the pension commitment and the fair value of assets under  management. Pension provisions and similar commitments  appearing on PostNord Groups balance sheet equal the  commitments present value at fiscal year-end, less the fair  value of assets under management, unreported actuarial  gains or losses and unreported costs related to employment  from earlier periods. If this calculation leads to an asset for the  group, the reported value of the asset is limited to the sum of  the reported actuarial losses plus the value that the company  can be expected to attain in the future from the surplus in  funded assets. If the pension cost and pension provision set  for Swedish plans deviate from the corresponding amount in  accordance with RedR 4, the difference is reported for special  payroll tax in accordance with UFR 4 (originally published as  URA 43). For pensions and similar benefits financed through  defined contribution plans, amounts corresponding to  PostNords annual fees for the plans are expensed.  Severance pay  Provisions for severance pay are made only if PostNord can  be proven to have committed to terminate an employment  contract before its expiration, without a reasonable possibility  of withdrawal. If compensation is paid for voluntary  termination, a provision is reported when the offer has at  least been accepted by the concerned parties representative  and when the number of employees that will accept the offer  can be reliably calculated. When PostNord terminates  employee contracts, a detailed plan is prepared covering  workplaces, positions and the estimated number of  employees affected, as well as compensation paid to each  personnel group or position and the period of  implementation of the plan.  Provisions  Provisions are made for commitments resulting from an  event and for binding loss contracts, in which it is probable  that an outflow of resources will be needed to settle the  commitment. Provisions are reported on the balance sheet  when there is a legal or informal obligation to do so and  when the amount can be determined reliably. Provisions for  restructuring are made when an adequately detailed plan is  in place and has been communicated in a fashion that  creates firm expectations among stakeholders, or their  representatives, who will be affected by the measures.   Taxes  Tax on net earnings is comprised of current tax and deferred  tax. Taxes are recognized in the income statement except  when the underlying transaction is recognized directly in  equity, provided that the subsequent tax effect is also  reported in equity. Current tax is the tax calculated on the    >     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES   76  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    years taxable income. Adjustments of current tax attributable  to earlier periods are also included.   Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the balance  sheet method, based on the temporary differences between  the reported and taxable values of assets and liabilities. The  amounts are calculated based on how temporary differences  are expected to be equalized, and by applying the tax rates  and tax regulations that have been decided or announced as  of fiscal year-end. Temporary differences are not treated in  consolidated goodwill. Legal entities report untaxed reserves  including the deferred tax liability. In the consolidated  financial statements, however, untaxed reserves are divided  into deferred tax liability and restricted equity. Tax credits in  deductible temporary differences and loss carry-forwards are  reported only to the extent that it is probable that they will  lead to lower tax disbursements in the future. This probability  is based on data contained in PostNords business plans.  Assets pledge and contingent liabilities  Contingent liabilities are reported when there is a possible  commitment arising from an event, the fulfillment of which  can only be confirmed by one or more uncertain future  events. Contingent liabilities are also reported when there is a  commitment that is not reported as a liability or provision  because an outflow of resources is not likely to be required.  Pledged assets are reported for given guarantees and assets  pledged as securities.  Note 2  Estimates and assessments  In making these financial reports, group management has  made assessments, estimates and assumptions that affect  the groups reported accounts. These estimates and  assumptions are based on what is known at the time the  financial reports are presented, as well as historical  experience and assumptions that the group management  considers reasonable under the current circumstances. The  conclusions drawn by group management form the basis for  the reported values in the accounts. Actual future values,  estimates and assessments in future financial reports during  the coming financial year may differ from those in this report,  due to changing environmental factors and new knowledge  and experience.   The most significant estimates and assessments for  PostNord have been made in the areas described below.  Postal obligation  PostNords postal obligation is calculated for stamps which  have been sold but not used. Assumptions used in calculating  the postal obligation affect the size of the obligation.  Assumptions are based on the number of stamps sold but  not used in Sweden and Denmark. Investigations are  conducted in Sweden and Denmark to ensure that the  assumptions are reasonable. The size of the obligation may  be affected in cases where investigations show changes in  the behavior of the population or where a sample group is  not representative of the population.  Intangible assets  Assumptions are made about future conditions in order to  calculate future cash flows that determine the recoverable  value of goodwill, brand and customer relations. The  recoverable value is compared with the reported value for  these assets and forms the basis for possible impairment or  reversals. The assumptions that affect the recoverable value  most are future volume development, profit margin  development, the discount rate and estimated useful life of  the asset. If future environmental factors and circumstances  change, these assumptions may be affected so that the  reported values of intangible assets are changed.  Pension commitments  In order to arrive at a reasonable estimate for PostNords  defined pension commitments, the actuarial valuation of such  commitments is based on a number of assumptions. These  assumptions include discount rate, expected rate of return on  plan assets, future annual pay increases, and inflation.  Changes in pension commitments due to changed external  factors may influence PostNords income statement and  balance sheet if the net value of such changes falls outside  the corridor. Changed commitments affect the forecast for  the next years costs. Note 23 includes the sensitivity of  assumptions to changes and how changes impact operating  profit.  Provisions  As a consequence of Posten AB becoming a Swedish  corporate entity in 1994, PostNord assumed a contingent  liability (transition regulations) such that certain categories of  the workforce may choose to retire early, at the age of 60 or  63. The contingent liability is reported as a provision in the  balance sheet and is calculated based on previous  experience of the proportion of persons who have chosen to  exercise their right to early retirement in accordance with  these provisions. If the number of those who choose this  option should change, the liability will change accordingly. A  change in the utilization rate of 5 percentage points impacts  operating profit by SEK 15–23m.  Taxes  The capitalization of tax loss carry-forwards has been  assessed based on business plans and estimates of future  taxable profits that can utilize tax loss carry-forwards.  Estimates have been made of non-deductible costs and non- taxable income in accordance with current tax regulations.  Furthermore, consideration has been taken of the next six  years financial results in order to evaluate the reported tax  claim at the currently applicable tax rate. Changes to tax  legislation in Sweden and other countries where PostNord  operates and changes in interpretation and application of  applicable legislation may influence the size of the reported  tax assets and liabilities. Changed circumstances that impact  the assumptions will also influence financial results for the  year.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES      <.

Internally generated intangible assets are reported as  capitalized development expenditures, which were chiefly  attributable to integration of shared IT solutions. Other  intangible fixed assets were chiefly attributable to brands and  customer relations.    For information about assets resulting from acquisitions of  affiliated companies, see Note 31, Acquisitions and  Divestments of Operations, page 96.   Impairments on other intangible fixed assets totaled  SEK -0m (-77) based on structural changes within Strlfors  operations. The Strlfors Identification Solution (SIS) labeling  business was divested in 2011.  Impairment test on intangible fixed assets  Goodwill is the only intangible assets with an indeterminate  period useful life. It is difficult to determine the residual value  of cash-generated segments that are part of the strategic  operations.    A value assessment was conducted on all cash-generating  segments with a discount factor of 8.5% after tax.    The SEK 2,830m (2,806) carrying amount of goodwill arose  in the following cash-generating units: SEK 1,513m (1,517) for  international parcel and pallet operations (DPD and Tollpost  Globe AS), SEK 697m (753) for Stralfors, SEK 312m (313) for  Post Danmark A/S and SEK 308m (223) for other businesses  (relates mainly to Data Scanning A/S, Transportgruppen A/S,  Budstikken Transport A/S, Eek Transport AS, Hils Hansson  Logistics AB, HIT, Direct Link and Addresspoint). The  recoverable value of each of these cash-generating units was  based on their value in use. The calculations were based on  three-year business plans and forecasts adopted and    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES      <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  83   formulated based on analyses of the external business  environment and planned marketing and production  activities. The assessments made in the business plans are  based on group managements knowledge and experience.   The most significant amounts of goodwill lie in three cash- generating units: SEK 1,513m (1,517) for international parcel and  pallet operations, SEK 312m (313) for Post Danmark A/S and  SEK 697m (753) for Strlfors. The assumptions with the  greatest impact on the impairment assessments are volume  growth, profit margins and useful life. Calculations were made  with assumptions about changed operating profit and  discount rate to evaluate the effects on earnings.   Tollpost Globe AS is part of the international parcel and  pallet operation and is considered integrated with DPD in the  impairment test performed. For international parcel and pallet  operations, average annual growth of 3% is forecast for the  business plan period. The test did not show any impairment  requirement.   Goodwill in Post Danmark A/S is attributable to the 1995  conversion into a corporation. The cash-generating units  recoverable amount is based on value in use. Average annual  growth of 2% is forecast for Post Danmark A/S for the  business plan period. Recoverable value exceeds book value.  The test did not show any impairment requirement.   With respect to Strlfors, the entire operation (that existed  as of the 2006 acquisition) is viewed as a cash-generating  unit at the time of testing. For Strlfors, average annual  growth of 2% is forecast for the business plan period.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES      <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  87   Provisions, estimated future conditional pensions  PostNord Group is responsible for future conditional pension  benefits under the transition regulations for Swedish  companies. The transition regulations apply to certain  employees who are entitled to retire at the age of 60 or 63.  To qualify, employees must have reached 28 years of age by  January 1, 1992 and have held the same position since then.  Commitments, calculated according to the Act on  Safeguarding of Pension Commitments, totaled SEK 2,771m  (2,892) as of December 31, 2011. Experience demonstrates  that an average of 25% utilizes the transition regulations, and  the provision is determined at that percentage of this  commitment. Special payroll tax is taken into consideration.  The liability totals SEK 861m (898) including special payroll  tax. For accounting in accordance with IAS 19 see unfunded  pension plans, future conditional pension benefits in the  tables in this Note, and future conditional pension benefits in  Note 24, Other Provisions (page 89).  Final responsibility provision  The PostNord Group assumed final responsibility for an  obligation assumed in connection with its conversion into a  corporation. Previously, this commitment was reported as a  contingent liability. Provisions were made for the  commitment in conjunction with the adoption of IAS 19.  Based on available information, the commitment has been  estimated at SEK 107m (103) as of December 31, 2011, and  includes a provision for special payroll tax. This commitment  is included in the balance for unfunded pension plans, future  conditional pension benefits in the table in this Note, and  future conditional pension benefits in Note 24, Other  Provisions (page 89).  Index-linked responsibility  In 2000, pension commitments previously safeguarded by  Postens Pension Fund were redeemed through the  acquisition of insurance policies. As of December 31, 2011 the  net present value of these was SEK 65m (77). PostNord  Group bears index-linking and gross coordination  responsibility for these pension commitments.

These assumptions are provided  as a total average value for each pension plan. A change in  any of these key assumptions may have a significant impact  on the projected benefit commitments, funding requirements  and periodic pension cost.    Actuarial assumptions, %  Dec 31, 2011  Dec 31, 2010 Dec 31, 2009 Discount rate  3.90  4.50 4.10 Expected return on plan assets  4.90  5.50 5.10 Future annual wage increases  2.60  2.80 2.80 Change in income base amount  3.00  3.00 3.00 Inflation  2.00  2.00 2.00 Life expectancy  FFFS 2007:31  FFFS 2007:31 FFFS 2007:31 Personnel turnover  4.50  5.00 5.00 Average remaining employment service, years  10  10 10   The costs for 2011 are based on actuarial assumptions  adopted at the beginning of 2011. At the end of 2011, PostNord  Group adopted assumptions applicable to calculation of the  results as of December 31, 2011. These actuarial assumptions  are also used in the forecast for 2012 costs. In setting the  assumptions the long-term, mutual compatibility of all  assumptions used in the appraisal has been taken into  account.   >     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES    88  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    The discount rate is determined in accordance with IAS 19  with reference to prime corporate bonds traded in a  functioning corporate bond market as per IFRSs view by  referring to the Swedish mortgage bond market. Group  management thus takes the view that the discount rate  applied reflects the time value of the money and provides a  reasonable present value of Postens pension commitments.  Expected return on plan assets corresponds to the expected  average return on current (or future) investments in the  Pension Fund, after all costs (including tax). With respect to  interest-bearing assets, the expected return is based on risk- free market rates of interest; in terms of other assets,  expected return is based on assumptions of risk premiums in  excess of risk-free interest rates. The risk premiums are based  on long-term, historical risk premiums with consideration  taken of the assets relative risk and covariance. The risk  premiums vary between 2% and 5% (2–6%), depending on  the type of asset. Future annual pay increases reflect  expected future salary increases as a compound of inflation,  seniority and promotion. The income base amount is set  annually by the Swedish government and is used, among  other things, to set a cap on pensionable income in the social  security system. With respect to inflation, the Group has  chosen to use the Swedish Central Banks inflation targets as  a basis. Personnel turnover is an aggregate of expected  future business development, increases in real wages and  productivity growth needed to maintain profitability, as well  as consideration of actual personnel turnover in recent years.  The average remaining employment service factor is  estimated based on employees current age breakdown. Life  expectancy assumptions are based on the Swedish  Supervisory Authoritys guidelines FFFS 2007:31 (FFFS  2007:31).  Alecta  Retirement and family pension plans for salaried employees  in Sweden can be insured by Alecta. Only a few companies  within the PostNord group utilize insurance as a safeguarding  solution. According to a pronouncement by the Swedish  Financial Reporting Board, UFR 3, defined benefit pension  commitments secured by Alecta insurance are considered to  be a single pension plan that encompasses several  employers. For fiscal year 2011, the company has not had  access to information enabling the reporting of this plan as a  defined benefit pension plan. The ITP pension plan insured by  Alecta is therefore reported as a defined contribution plan.  Pension insurance fees related to Alecta totaled SEK 4.4m  (4.6). Anticipated fees for 2012 total SEK 4.1m (4.8). Alectas  surplus can be distributed to policy-holders and/or the  insured. As of December 2011, Alectas surplus in the form of  the collective consolidation level was 113% (146%). The  collective consolidation level equals the market value of  Alectas assets divided by total insurance commitments and  calculated in accordance with Alectas actuarial assumptions,  which do not comply with IAS 19.  Plan assets  The greatest portion of plan assets is included in Postens  Pension Fund.

The  overriding objective of the Fund is to manage the assets so  as to best serve the PostNord Groups pension commitments,  the funds for which have been entrusted to the Fund. The  composition of and return on the assets should serve as  reassurance that the Group can meet the pension  commitments safeguarded by the Fund.  Sensitivity analysis  At year-end 2011, PostNord Group had pension commitments  of SEK 15,843m (14,533) and plan assets of SEK 15,967m  (15,808). In addition to funded pension commitments, pension  provisions are allocated as future unconditional pension  commitments of SEK 1,587m (1,437) and future conditional  pension commitments of SEK 807m (848). The Groups  pension commitments are valued based on the above- referenced actuarial assumptions; plan assets are assessed at  fair value.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES      <.  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  89   Actuarial assumptions  Changes in pension commitments due to changed actuarial  commitments are treated as actuarial gains or losses. These  gains or losses have no effect on the income statement or  balance sheet unless and until the net value exceeds the  corridor. The corridors limits are 10% of the pension  commitment or the fair value of plan assets, whichever is  greater. To the extent that the changes cause effects  exceeding the corridor, the excess values are reported as  income or cost. However, in these cases the impact on the  income statement first appears in the entry of forecasted  costs/income pursuant to IAS 19 the following year. See also  the table below for the impact on earnings of changed  actuarial commitments.  Exercise of rights under the transition regulations  A provision of 25% of total commitments is made pursuant to  the transition regulations. This number is based on the  historical degree to which rights under the regulations are  exercised. The special payroll tax has also been taken into  account. Change in the commitments pursuant to the  transition regulations and due to different levels of exercise of  rights is reported as income or cost. See the table below for  the effect on earnings of changed levels of exercise of rights  under the transition regulations.

The  change in the spread between these rates affects net financial items. The interest margin for pension liabilities is the difference between the assumed discount rate on pension  liabilities and the yield assumption for plan assets in percentage points.

Provisions for restructuring measures  Restructuring provisions include costs that are estimated to  arise during the coming year as a consequence of the  groups decision to streamline production and reduce staff.  Restructuring provisions are made when PostNord Group  has an established, explicit restructuring plan and has created  a valid expectation among affected parties.   Amounts are calculated based on corporate managements  best estimates. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting  period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is  no longer probable that an outflow of resources will be  required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.    In 2011, provisions for restructuring measures were  primarily made for early retirement pensions and for  admittance to agencies that handle redundant personnel.  Reversal of provisions occurred in 2011 primarily as a result of  changed direction regarding adaptation of the Meddelande  Sverige service network.   New provisions and reversals are reported in the business  operation that makes the decision about closure.  Provisions, estimated future conditional pensions  Posten is responsible for future conditional pension benefits  under the transition regulations. The transition regulations  apply to certain employees who are entitled to retire at the  age of 60 or 63. Consideration has also been taken of special  payroll tax.    See Provisions for estimated future conditional pensions,  and the Final Responsibility Provision, Note 23, Pensions,  page 86 for further information.  Other provisions  Provisions for job-related injuries refer to the payment of  annuities in accordance with the Industrial Injuries Insurance  Act, and to occupational injury annuities.   The pension settlement in relation to the Danish state refers  to future commitments regarding a specific group of  employees within the Post Danmark group.   Provisions for commemorative awards refer to anticipated  commemorative awards in the form of extra salary and  vacation received after 25 or 40 years of employment within  the Post Danmark group.  Present value  Provisions with payment periods longer than one year are  discounted to the present value. Discount effects included in  changes for the year are shown separately where significant.  Provisions for future conditional pension benefits have  payment periods longer than one year. Present value  calculations are not shown separately for this provision item,  as it is included under IAS 19. See also Note 23, Pensions,  page 86.  Expected payments for provisions  Stated amounts correspond to the estimated result that  forms the basis for calculating the size of the provision but  cannot be deemed to reflect real, total payment flows, as  certain costs do not correspond to any payments. Such costs  include some costs related to personnel cutbacks.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES      <.

Disputes  PostNord operates extensive national and international  businesses and is involved in disputes and lawsuits from time  to time arising from its business operations. Except as set  forth below, it is not anticipated that these disputes and  lawsuits, either individually or collectively, will have a  materially adverse effect on PostNords earnings, profitability  or financial position.  Lawsuit brought by competitor  A lawsuit alleging abuse of dominant position was brought  against Post Danmark A/S by a competitor during the year.  Following Post Danmark A/S appeal to the Danish  Competition Appeals Tribunal, the Danish Competition  Council is readdressing the matter.   Discriminatory pricing  stre Landsret ruled against Post Danmark A/S in a case  concerning discriminatory pricing. Post Danmark A/S  appealed the decision to Hjesteret. In connection with this  matter, a competitor filed a claim against Post Danmark A/S.  The claim for compensation of DKK 90m is contested in its  entirety by Post Danmark A/S.   Note 27  Investment commitments  As of December 31, 2011, PostNord Group had committed to  acquire tangible fixed assets. These commitments total  SEK 379m (356) and related primarily to sorting equipment  and vehicles.  Note 28  Statement of cash flows  Cash flows from operating activities include interest received  totaling SEK 59m (63) and interest paid totaling SEK 57m (98).    Note 29  Financial risk management and financial  instruments  PostNords Treasury Policy, adopted by the Board of  Directors, governs PostNords financial risk management  activities. The Treasury Policy includes guidelines for liquidity  management, financing and financial risk management. The  management of financial risks is centralized with the groups  Treasury management.  Objectives and applied principles for the groups  financial risk management  The objectives for financial risk management are to maintain  appropriate payment readiness and an efficient use of capital  and to guarantee the supply of capital. The basic principles  applied to manage financial risk are as follows:   Coordinate financing, liquidity management and payment  transactions under central Treasury management to  ensure good risk control and preserve coordination gains   The business operations and parent company strive for the  efficient use of operating and fixed capital, guaranteeing  the basis for a secure supply of capital and thus freedom of  action for the group   The groups extension of credit is based on commercial  considerations and risk assessments, ensuring a balancing  of credit risk.    PostNords financial risks are divided into the categories  refinancing risk, credit risk and market risk.  Refinancing risk  Refinancing risk refers to the risk that cash and cash  equivalents will not be available and that financing will be  partly or wholly unobtainable or obtainable only at  substantially increased cost. PostNords refinancing risk is  limited through the maintenance of payment readiness  above a fixed minimum level and by diversifying the maturity  structure of its financing portfolio. Treasury management  shall at all times maintain payment readiness to manage  operating activities and provide favorable conditions for  managing risks and pursuing offensive strategies.    Payment readiness is defined the sum of cash and cash  equivalents, investments in liquid instruments, unutilized  committed loan facilities and estimated cash flows less  maturing loans. Treasury management shall ensure access to  payment readiness amounting to SEK 1,500m for the coming  360 days. Unutilized committed loan facilities totaled SEK  2,000m (0) at the close of the fiscal year. As of December 31,  2011, PostNords liquidity totaled SEK 2,107m (3,640), of which  SEK 299m (898) was invested in treasury bills, SEK 298m  (828) in commercial paper and the remainder in bank  deposits and balances.   Credit risk  The groups business activities give rise to credit risk  exposure in relation to counterparties. Credit risk and  counterparty risk refer to the risk of loss if the counterparty  fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk arises  partly through sales to customers, extending advances to  suppliers or accepting guarantees, and partly through  Treasurys liquidity management or use of derivative  contracts.    >     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES    92  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    Credit risk from accounts receivable  Credit risk in connection with credit sales to customers is  limited by spreading the risk across numerous customers in  various industries. All customers undergo a credit check in  which data on a customers financial position is obtained from  a credit-rating agency. The groups aggregate accounts  receivable totaled SEK 4,370m (4,262). The groups reported  losses on accounts receivable totaled SEK 33m (21) in 2011.

All counterparties must  undergo a credit check before qualifying as a debtor.  Market risk  The risk that changes in market prices will affect the fair value  or cash flows of a financial instrument. PostNord is exposed  to two types of market risks: currency risk and interest rate  risk.  Currency risk  PostNord has exposure to transaction risks and translation  risks. Transaction exposure consists of loans and investments  and foreign exchange flows with suppliers and customers.  Transaction exposure is limited through use of derivative  instruments, and may not exceed the equivalent of SEK  450m. Translation exposure is defined as net assets in the  groups foreign subsidiaries. Due to exchange rate  fluctuations, a change in the groups equity arises through the  translation of foreign net assets. The greatest exposure arises  in DKK, NOK and EUR. Treasury management does not  hedge translation exposure, but limits it by adjusting the  capitalization of group companies to a prudent commercial  level.

Interest rate risk  Interest rate refers to the risk that the value of interest- bearing assets and liabilities will change following fluctuations  in the market interest rate. Interest rate risk is controlled by  limiting price risk and duration. Price risk is the risk that the  market value of interest-related financial instruments will  change following fluctuations in the general interest rate level.  Duration is a time measurement and refers to the effective  payback period taking into consideration the investments  final maturity date and the interest rates and amortizations  that may be relevant during the period remaining. The  duration of the facilities portfolio may not exceed 2 years.     Interest rate risk is measured in the Treasury Policy as the  change in value of all interest-bearing assets and liabilities if  the market interest rate for all relevant maturities changes +/-  1 %. Interest rate risk in the groups interest-bearing  receivables and liabilities was SEK 3m (2) as of December 31,  2011. A change of +/- 1% in the market rate as of December 31,  2011 causes an effect on earnings totaling SEK 17m (26) over  the next twelve months. The groups price risk, if greater than  SEK 25m, shall not exceed 1% of the portfolios total value (net  debt expressed in SEK) or a maximum of SEK 50m. The  interest amount refers to interest expense for the entire  duration.  Market risk in asset management  Asset management is carried out in the groups affiliated  agencies Postens Pension Fund and Postens insurance  association. The agencies manage assets that safeguard  payments of certain of the groups commitments such as  future pensions, sickness benefits and family pensions. Asset  management includes the investment of capital in various  markets and instruments. Through board representation,  PostNord advocates a prudently managed diversification  between asset classes in Postens Pension Fund and Postens  insurance association in relation to PostNords underlying  commitment and expected returns.

Value is discounted to actual lending rate.   For accounts receivable and accounts payable with a  remaining credit period of less than one year, the book value  is considered to constitute fair value. Accounts receivable and  accounts payable with a remaining useful life of more than  one year are discounted when the fair value is ascertained.   Some of the groups financial instruments are reported at  fair value and valuation is determined in accordance with the  three levels set forth in IFRS 7, described below.   Level 1  The fair value of financial instruments is determined based on  listed market prices on balance sheet date without deducting  transaction costs. Level 1 essentially includes treasury bills  and standardized derivatives for which the listed price is use  in valuation. PostNord Group currently has no financial assets  or liabilities based on this valuation level.   Level 2  The fair value of financial instruments is determined based on  valuation models that are based on other observable market  data. Examples of level 2 observable data are market rates of  interest and yield curves. In cases where listed price is  unavailable, straight interpolation is applied.  Level 3  The fair value of financial instruments is determined based on  valuation models under which considerable input is derived  from non-observable market data. PostNord Group currently  has no financial assets of liabilities based on this valuation  level.          >     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES    94  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    Reported and fair value of instruments  valued at fair value,   SEKm  Dec 31 2011    Dec 31 2010  Reported value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3   Reported value  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Financial assets reported at fair value  in Income Statement                   Prepaid expenses and accrued income  1,205         1,266        Of which: Forward currency contracts  14    14    4    4    Terminal fees  3    3    4    4    Other receivables  544         452        Of which: Terminal fees  2    2    2    2    Cash and cash equivalents1)  2,107         3,640        Of which: Commercial paper  298    298    828    828    Treasury bills  299    299    898    898      Loans and accounts receivable                   Long-term receivables 2)  3,990         2,996        Accounts receivable  4,370         4,262        Cash and cash equivalents1)  2,107         3,640        Of which: Cash  1,508        1,431          Held-to-maturity investments                   Financial investments  182         155        Of which: Endowment insurance  134        136        Other  48        19          Available-for-sale financial assets                   Cash and cash equivalents1)  2,107         3,640        Of which: Deposits  8    8    490    490    Total assets    8,408    624     9,775    2,226    Financial liabilities reported at fair  value in Income Statement                   Accrued expenses and prepaid income  4,079         4,288        Of which: Forward currency contracts  16    16    23    23    Terminal fees  3    3    3    3      Other liabilities                   Long-term interest-bearing liabilities  985         1,047        Of which: Finance leasing  52        108        Debt to credit institutions  799        802        Short-term interest-bearing liabilities  113         407        Of which: Debt to credit institutions  7        321        Finance leasing  56        47        Other liabilities                   Of which: Terminal fees  3    3    3    3    Accounts payable  2,130        1,992        Total liabilities  7,307    22     7,734    29    1)  "Cash and cash equivalents" are investments that normally mature in less than 3 months.  2)  Specification of Long-term receivables, see note 16, page 84.

Intra-group sales totaled SEK  816m (650). For a list of the parent companys holdings in  affiliated companies, associated companies and joint  ventures, see Note 9 to the parent companys financial  statements (page 104).  Swedish state  Posten Norden has been mandated by the Swedish state to  provide universal mail services in accordance with the Postal  Services Act. Like other postal operators in Sweden, PostNord  requires a permit to provide postal services. During the  period, the National Post and Telecom Agency (PTS) received  SEK 12m (12) from PostNord as payment for this permit.  Posten Norden paid SEK 9m (8) to PTS for handling dead  letters.   The PTS appropriated SEK 24m (25) to Posten Norden, as  compensation in agreements for procured postal services for  disabled persons1).  Danish state  During the period, Post Danmark A/S paid the Danish state  pension premiums of SEK 233m (241) for the group of civil  servants employed prior to the corporatization date. A further  SEK 4m (18) is reserved in the Statement of Financial Position  for any additional obligations to the same group.  Other organizations in Sweden  Postens insurance association is a PostNord group  freestanding fund monitored by the Swedish Financial  Supervisory Authority. The association insures PostNords  commitments regarding employee disability and family  pensions in accordance with ITP-P. During the period,  PostNord paid premiums of SEK 0m (154) for disability  pensions and SEK 17m (18) for family pensions, and received  compensation totaling SEK 9m (10). Due to its well- consolidated position, the association did not charge any  premiums in 2012.   Postens Pension Fund manages pension commitments for  Posten AB, Posten Meddelande AB and Posten Logistik AB.  The companies capitalize new pension commitments in the  fund and receive compensation for pensions paid.  Capitalization of SEK 366m (854) occurred during the period  and compensation totaling SEK 251m (871) was received  (related to pension payments made during 2010).  Executives  For information on compensation and benefits paid to  executives and Board directors, see Note 5, Employees,  Personnel Expenses and Executive Compensation (page 79).    All members of the group Board of Directors and group  management were asked to provide written notification of  any business relations they may have with PostNord and  whether these occurred on a commercial basis. Only one  such business relation was reported: Viveca Bergstedt Sten  was a member of PostNords group management until  September 30, 2011, and her husband is CEO of the property  management company GE Real Estate. During the period,  PostNord Group rented premises from GE Real Estate on a  purely commercial basis for a value of SEK 4m (4).    1)  Previously reported values have been adjusted.    >     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   CONSOLIDATED NOTES    96  POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011    Note 31  Acquisitions and divestments  Acquisitions and divestments had the following effects  on PostNord Group's assets and liabilities, SEKm  2011    2010  Acquisition  Divestment  Total    Acquisition  Divestment  Total  Goodwill  79  -78  1    2    2  Customer relationships  92  -20  72          Other intangible fixed assets  1    1          Other fixed assets  233  -79  154          Total fixed assets  405  -177  228          Current assets  119  -269  -150          TOTAL ASSETS  524  -446  78    2    2  TOTAL LIABILITIES  -171  363  192          NET ASSETS    353  -83  270    2    2  Capital gain, divested operations/group companies    -80  -80          Other items affecting cash flow    -9  -22  -31          Purchase price paid/received  -344  219  -125    -2    -2  Cash and cash equivalents (acquired/divested)    -34  -34          Net effect on cash and cash equivalents  -344  185  -159    -2    -2    Divestments  PostNord continues to streamline operations within business  area Strlfors. The SIS Identification Solution labeling  operation was divested as of August 1. The conditional  purchase consideration of SEK 155m was valued at fair value  with account taken of the divested operations estimated  development through 2014. In addition to the Swedish  company Strlfors Identification Solution AB, SIS is comprised  of Strlfors A/S, Stralfors AG and Stralfors Schweiz AG. The  transaction included the November 1, 2011 sale of the assets  and liabilities of the Norwegian company Strlfors AS  following review by the Competition Authority. The impact on  group profit is SEK -2m. Businesses within SIS have been  transferred to EsonPac Group AB, in which Strlfors AB will  own 20% of the shares through 2014 for a purchase price of  SEK 155m. The holding is reported as an asset for sale.

PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   >   PARENT COMPANY NOTES     <.    POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  103   Parent Company notes  Note 1   Accounting principles  The parent company essentially applies the same accounting  principles as the group does, and thus applies RFR 2,  Reporting of Legal Entities. The differences between the  parent companys and the groups accounting principles  result from the parent companys limitations in applying  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as a  consequence of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the  Law on Safeguarding of Pension Commitments, and are to  some extent also based on tax considerations.  Participations in subsidiaries, associated companies  and joint ventures  Participations in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint  ventures are reported in the parent company using the  acquisition cost method.   Dividends  Dividends from subsidiaries, associated companies and joint  ventures are reported as income when the right to receive  such dividend is established.   Anticipated dividends from subsidiaries are reported in  cases where the parent company has the exclusive right to  determine the size of the dividend and has made a decision  on the size of the dividend prior to publication of the parent  companys financial statements.   If the carrying amount of the parent companys holding in  the subsidiary, associated company or joint venture exceeds  the carrying amount reported in the financial statements, this  is considered an indication of an impairment requirement  and an impairment test shall be performed.  Employee benefits  Pension commitments for civil servants covered by pension  insurance plans are reported in the parent company as  defined contribution plans. Other pension costs are included  under operating profit.  Financial guarantees  The parent companys financial guarantees consist mainly of  guarantees for the benefit of subsidiaries and joint ventures.  Financial guarantees entail the company pledging to  compensate the owner of a debt instrument for losses incurred  in the event a debtor does not complete payment on the due  date specified in the contract. To report financial guarantee  agreements, the parent company applies RFR 2, which is  somewhat more lenient than the rules in IAS 39 regarding  financial guarantee contracts for the benefit of subsidiaries,  associated companies and joint ventures. The parent company  reports financial guarantee agreements as provisions on the  balance sheet when PostNord has a commitment for which  payment is likely to be required to settle the commitment.  Taxes  The parent company reports untaxed reserves, including its  deferred tax liability.  Segment reporting  The parent companys business activities consist of a sole  operation, group functions.  Note 2  Estimates and assessments  In making these financial reports, group management has  made assessments, estimates and assumptions that affect  the groups reported accounts. These estimates and  assumptions are based on what is known at the time the  financial reports are presented, as well as on historical  experience and assumptions that group management  considers reasonable under the current circumstances. The  conclusions drawn by group management form the basis for  the values reported in these accounts. Actual future values,  estimates and assessments in future financial reports during  the coming year may differ from those in this report, due to  changing environmental factors and new knowledge and  experience.   No significant estimates or assessments were made in the  annual statements as of December 31, 2011 for PostNord AB.

Nothing of a significant nature that could affect the representation of the  company as described has been omitted. The consolidated financial review provides a fair and accurate overview of the  development of the groups and parent companys operations, position and financial results, and describes significant risks and  uncertainty factors facing group companies. The annual report and consolidated financial statements were approved for  publication by the board of directors and the CEO on February 22, 2012.

POSTNORD ANNUAL REPORT 2011  107   Auditors report  To the annual meeting of the shareholders of PostNord AB (publ), corporate identity number 556771-2640    Report on the annual accounts and consolidated  accounts  We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated  accounts of PostNord AB (publ) for the the financial year  1 January 2011–31 December 2011. The annual accounts and  consolidated accounts of the company are included in the  printed version of this document on pages 2–5 and 8–107.  Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing  Director for the annual accounts and consolidated accounts  The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are  responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these  annual accounts and consolidated accounts in accordance  with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted  by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act, and for such internal  control as the Board of Directors and the Managing Director  determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual  accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  Auditors responsibility  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these annual  accounts and consolidated accounts based on our audit. We  conducted our audit in accordance with International  Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing  standards in Sweden. Those standards require that we  comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  annual accounts and consolidated accounts are free from  material misstatement.   An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the annual  accounts and consolidated accounts. The procedures  selected depend on the auditors judgement, including the  assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the  annual accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to  fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor  considers internal control relevant to the companys  preparation and fair presentation of the annual accounts and  consolidated accounts in order to design audit procedures  that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the  purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the  companys internal control. An audit also includes evaluating  the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the  reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Board  of Directors and the Managing Director, as well as evaluating  the overall presentation of the annual accounts and  consolidated accounts.   We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  Opinions  In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in  accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly,  in all material respects, the financial position of the parent  company as of 31 December 2011 and of its financial  performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in  accordance with the Annual Accounts Act, and the  consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance  with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material  respects, the financial position of the group as of 31  December 2011 and of their financial performance and cash  flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting  Standards, as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts  Act. A corporate governance statement has been prepared.  The statutory administration report and the corporate  governance statement are consistent with the other parts of  the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.   We therefore recommend that the annual meeting of  shareholders adopt the income statement and balance sheet  for the parent company and the group.  Report on other legal and regulatory requirements  In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and  consolidated accounts, we have examined the proposed  appropriations of the companys profit or loss and the  administration of the Board of Directors and the Managing  Director of PostNord AB (publ) for the financial year 1 January  2011–31 December 2011.  Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing  Director  The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for  appropriations of the companys profit or loss, and the Board  of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for  administration under the Companies Act.  Auditors responsibility  Our responsibility is to express an opinion with reasonable  assurance on the proposed appropriations of the companys  profit or loss and on the administration based on our audit.  We conducted the audit in accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards in Sweden.   As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors  proposed appropriations of the companys profit, we  examined the Board of Directors reasoned statement and a  selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess  whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies  Act.    As a basis for our opinion concerning discharge from  liability, in addition to our audit of the annual accounts and  consolidated accounts, we examined significant decisions,  actions taken and circumstances of the company in order to  determine whether any member of the Board of Directors or  the Managing Director is liable to the company. We also  examined whether any member of the Board of Directors or  the Managing Director has, in any other way, acted in  contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts  Act or the Articles of Association.    We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  Opinions  We recommend to the annual meeting of shareholders that  the profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in  the statutory administration report and that the members of  the Board of Directors and the Managing Director be  discharged from liability for the financial year.

Through dialogue with  various stakeholders, the group is also better positioned to  understand markets and trends, manage risks and meet  customers and employees' expectations, which are crucial to  PostNords competitiveness and the achievement of its goals.  Regular dialogue is conducted in various forums, networks  and periodic meetings. Regular evaluation of the views of  several key stakeholder groups about the companys  operations are carried out and results are followed up.  PostNords key stakeholders  PostNords key stakeholders are its owners, society,  customers, employees, suppliers and various partners. These  interest groups are deemed to have the greatest impact on,  or are most dependent on, PostNords activities. Below is a  brief description of our key stakeholders.  Owners  PostNord AB is a Swedish public company owned 40% by  the Danish state and 60% by the Swedish state. The states  are represented by the Swedish Ministry of Finance and the  Danish Ministry of Transport. Votes are allocated 50/50.  PostNord AB is the parent company of the group. Read more  in the Corporate Governance Report on page 47-62.  Society  PostNords subsidiaries Post Danmark A/S and Posten AB  have been appointed to provide the universal postal services  in Sweden and Denmark. Read more about the universal  service obligations in the Corporate Governance Report on  page 61-62.   National postal legislation is based on the EU directive that  regulates postal services in the EU, and on the Universal  Postal Union treaty that regulates international postal  services.    We also collaborate with other authorities and with industry  organizations such as the Universal Postal Union (UPU),  PostEurop and the International Post Corporation (IPC).  PostNord also has many collaborations and dialogues in  sport, cultural organizations, associations for local and  sustainable development and social responsibility.       Improved complaints management   PostNord constantly strives to improve its dialogue with  customers and their recipients. In early 2011, PostNord  introduced a customer ombudsman in Sweden and an  appeals board in Denmark, partly to improve the treatment  of small businesses and individuals who are unhappy with  earlier meetings with, or decisions of, the group. These  panels can also take advantage of the valuable flow of  information from customers. Inquiries from large corporate  customers are handled by key account managers, who also  hold regular quality control meetings with their customers.    Customers  Most of PostNords revenue comes from businesses and  organizations. A large proportion of recipients are consumers.  It is important that customers experience PostNord as a  trusted and accessible business partner, because this is  essential for the group to conduct successful business.  Employees  PostNord is one of the largest employers in the Nordic area.  Employees with the right skills and commitment are crucial to  customer satisfaction and business success. As one of the  largest employers, PostNord has a great social responsibility.  Suppliers  PostNord makes annual purchases worth billions from a large  number of suppliers. The majority of PostNords purchasing is  for transportation and services. The group's suppliers  undertake to live up to the company's code of conduct for  suppliers.  Partners  As one of the largest Nordic companies, PostNord cooperates  with numerous companies, organizations and associations in  various contexts and regarding different issues related to its  business. Among the group's most important partners are its  partner outlets in the retail sector in the Nordic countries  since they have an important role in making PostNords offer  accessible to private individuals and companies.      >     SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   >   STAKEHOLDER DIALOG AND MATERIALITY ANALYSIS      114  POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011    What matters to PostNords stakeholders?  PostNords dialogue with its various stakeholder groups  provides valuable information leading to increased  awareness, participation and better-informed decision  making. Responsibility for dialogue is allocated to different  parts of PostNords operations, depending on the nature of  the matter. Listed below are selected aspects that some key  stakeholders perceive as most important and that were  identified in surveys and dialogues conducted by PostNord in  2011.

Key events for stakeholders  Through stakeholder dialogue, PostNord is able to better  understand and appreciate what is important for each key  stakeholder and use that knowledge as a basis for decisions  about activities. In 2011, a number of activities and events took  place related to various stakeholders, of which some  examples are:    In April, the annual general meeting adopted the owners  targets for PostNord. Later in the year the group adopted a  new corporate strategy for the period through 2015, with a  view to repositioning the company in relation to ongoing  market developments.    The Swedish Post and Telecom Authoritys decision on new  license conditions for postal services in Sweden and the  introduction of a new postal law in Denmark are examples of  decisions taken by society stakeholders that affect PostNords  activities.   PostNord constantly works on to develop its services. In 2011  the group further strengthened its distribution network,  improving accessibility for many customers. PostNord also  established a pan-Nordic parcel and pallet service to  strengthen PostNords offer to logistics customers. This  service allows corporate customers to send parcels and  pallets within the Nordic countries as if they were domestic  deliveries. The group also improved its procedures for  handling complaints in Denmark and Sweden in 2011.  Furthermore, the new postal law in Denmark has opened the  possibility of price changes in the Danish market.   PostNord has worked with cost adjustments and staff  changes to meet the lower demand in its letter businesses.  This work will continue in 2012.   On the purchasing side, a large purchase of 175 heavy  trucks from Volvo was made during the year.     SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   >   ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY     <.    POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  115     Economic responsibility  Economic value creation  Environmental and social issues are linked to PostNords  economic responsibility. A long-term, stable and profitable  business creates the environment for meeting and  exceeding requirements for environmental compatibility  and social responsibility. Conversely, environmentally  compatible and socially responsible business strengthens  our competitiveness.  PostNords business success requires a responsible approach  to the group's stakeholders. Its economic responsibility  extends beyond the group. Creating profitability, growth and  value for the owners secures the outlook of a long-term  business for the benefit of several of its other stakeholders.  PostNords mandate to maintain the universal postal services  in Denmark and Sweden makes it even more important that  the group conducts efficient, profitable and sustainable  business.   Sustainability includes conserving resources. The group  creates value partly through optimizing the use and  management of company resources and assets. Reduced  fuel use, employee satisfaction and low absenteeism provide  both economic benefits and environmental and social  benefits. This approach gives the right incentive to see the  big picture and act accordingly.   Similarly, high customer satisfaction, high quality and a  good reputation in the community are very important to the  company's ability to generate returns, and operations are  therefore partly governed by these goals.    The merger between Posten AB and Post Danmark A/S  implemented in 2009 has helped to strengthen  competitiveness and the prospects of a long-term, stable and  profitable business.    >     SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   >   FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY    116  POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011    New strategy for repositioning  PostNord  The structural changes taking place in the communication  market are altering the conditions for PostNords business.  PostNord estimates that letter volumes will continue to  decline sharply in coming years. Meanwhile the logistics  market will grow, providing opportunities to develop our  already strong Nordic position.    In 2011, PostNord adopted a new strategy for the period  through 2015. It aims to reposition the group in relation to  current market trends and ultimately create northern  Europe's leading communication and logistics company. This  entails securing a lucrative mail business and increasing  market share for the logistics business.   PostNord will make significant investments in adjusting the  production structure of its mail businesses to market trends.  The group will also make significant cost reductions, including  adaptation of the workforce to lower volumes.   The change efforts that have been initiated and that will  continue in the years to come will be implemented effectively  and responsibly for the environment, society and, not the  least, for the employees.    Read more about the group's strategy and objectives in the  Annual Report on page 26-28.  Sustainable investment  The group has adopted a new production strategy that  includes investments in production to meet declining  volumes and to achieve the group's environmental  objectives. A key part of these investments is the previously  adopted establishment of a new terminal structure in Sweden  to increase production flexibility and, among other things,  allow for more coordinated rail transport resulting in reduced  carbon dioxide emissions.    Implementation of the production strategy involves new  establishments in certain towns and closures in others.  PostNord is acting together and cooperating with regional  and local communities affected by the changes.   The funds earmarked for environmental investments  through the Climate Fund have contributed to both an  increased pace of environmental initiatives and more energy- efficient transports and premises.  Objectives of economic responsibility  The objectives of the group's economic responsibility are  synonymous with a number of the group's targets and are  related to financial goals and targets for delivery performance,  customer and employee satisfaction and the group's image.    Read about the group's objectives in the Annual Report on  page 26-28.  Focus on customer satisfaction  The way in which customers perceive and value our service,  quality and offer forms the foundation for how the company's  business will develop.   Customer satisfaction is monitored through a group-wide  survey of corporate and private customers in the Nordic  countries. The group measures customer value, which in 2011  was 70 (70).   Since customers recipients are often consumers,  PostNords image among the public is also an important  prerequisite for conducting successful business. The image of  PostNord improved during 2011 in the corporate image  surveys carried out among the public in Sweden and  Denmark. In Sweden, the positive trend that started after a  poor rating in 2003 continued, while the good performance  of recent years in the Danish operations has been  maintained.   Factors such as quality and accessibility are highly valued  by the groups customers and are also deemed crucial in  public attitude towards the business. Changes in the  company's service organization, changes in pricing and in the  placement of mailboxes are examples of questions that  would normally give clear readings in surveys and in dialogue  with stakeholders. Big and important changes in operations  are challenging to implement without the public initially  perceiving them as negative. PostNord strives to create  knowledge and understanding among both customers and  the public about why changes are being implemented and  how continued good service will be assured.  World-class delivery quality  High quality at every level is a guiding principle in the  companys operations and a hallmark of PostNord.  Internationally, PostNords delivery performance is of world- class quality in the industry. The requirement for delivery  level is high, and the company's own performance targets for  mail exceed the quality requirements set by its owners, the  Swedish and Danish states.    In both Sweden and Denmark, PostNords performance  levels are regulated. According to postal regulation in Sweden  at least 85% of first-class letters must be distributed  throughout the country the next business day (overnight  delivery). At least 97% of letters must be delivered within  three business days. In Denmark, the performance  requirement for letters and parcels is 93% relative to the  terms of each service.   PostNord uses quality weighted for first-class letters in the  group as its target. For first-class letters in the group, parcels  in Sweden and parcels in Denmark, performance was 94.5%,  97.5% and 97.9% respectively.  Generated and distributed value  In 2011, PostNord generated a total value of SEK 39,838m, a  5% decrease from the previous year. The total distributed  value to suppliers, employees and the community was SEK  36,940m, 8% lower than the previous year. The distributed  value to the community was SEK 439m, and consisted of tax  payments and dividend. In addition, the group distributes  value through sponsorship and charitable collaborations; see  also Partners on page 127.   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  >   ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY    <.    POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  117       Environmental responsibility  Targeted environmental initiatives  Environmental initiatives are important for PostNord.  Reducing our environmental impact is a key element in  our long-term ambition to build northern Europe's leading  communication and logistics company. Our  environmental commitment is integrated into the business  and is part of the group's operational governance model.  As a major carrier in the Nordic countries, PostNords  activities have significant environmental impact. In order to  perform its tasks, the business uses most forms of  transportation. The group's objective, however, is to carry out  its assignments and commitments to customers in the most  environmentally efficient manner possible.   PostNord has worked purposefully and over many years to  reduce its environmental impact. A high percentage of  Swedish mail flows are transported by rail, and PostNord has  one of Europes largest electric vehicle fleets in the industry.    The group also prioritizes efforts to increase energy  efficiency in its premises. The group's Climate Fund and the  new production strategy implemented in the group are  important components of its environmental work.    Long-term environmental ambitions  Being the environmentally sound choice for customers is part  of PostNords vision. The long term goal is to reduce the  group's carbon dioxide emissions by 40% by 2020, from  2009 levels. This goal is in line with the owners  environmental targets. Linked to this long-term goal are a  number of key figures such as measuring environmental  performance per service. Some key indicators are monitored  quarterly and others monthly. Achieving the long-term goal  will require significant changes and investment in both  transportation and energy use.   In 2011, the group's carbon dioxide emissions totaled  340,187 (364,161) tons, a decrease of approximately 7%    >     SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  >   ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY     118  POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011    These changes are attributable to greater efficiency of  transport arrangements and a switch to vehicles with lower  fuel consumption. In Denmark, biofuels are now blended with  diesel and gasoline, which also contributes to reducing fossil  carbon dioxide emissions. With regard to premises, increased  energy efficiency and increased procurement of green  electricity helped in to reduce CO2 emissions. Altogether, the  group's emissions are now down by 7% compared to 2009.  Total CO2 emissions 1)  0 100,000 200,000 300,000 400,000 2009 2010 2011 Tons   1) Nordic plus Strlfors operations outside Nordic area.    How PostNord is reducing its environmental impact        The Climate Fund – a tool for  environmental improvement  The Climate Fund, introduced in 2009, is an important  component in PostNords efforts to achieve its environmental  objectives. The size of the Climate Fund is equivalent to what  it would cost to offset carbon emissions for the entire group,  but PostNord prefers to primarily create real change in its  business. For 2011, SEK 100m was earmarked for investments  and other environmental improvements.    The Climate Fund is structured so that employees  contribute proposals for environmental and climate  improvement measures in their own operations. In 2011 the  organization contributed 17 proposals, some of which are  described in the Sustainability Report. All proposals affect the  two areas that have the greatest effect on reducing  environmental impact: transports, and energy use in  premises and buildings.  Group production strategy  The group's new production strategy is to adjust the  production structure to declining letter volumes and to  further improve our prospects for achieving our  environmental objective. The new terminal structure  established in the Swedish market creates opportunities for  more integrated transport of letters, parcels and other goods  by rail, with reduced carbon emissions as a result. About 65%  of Swedish letter volumes are today transported by train  between sorting terminals.    In Norway, the vast majority of the group's total pallet and  parcel volumes are also transported by rail..    SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  >   ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY    <.    POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  119   Environmentally licensed operations  PostNord runs operations requiring registration under  national legislation in Sweden, France and Poland.   Read more in the Environment section of the Annual  Report on page 44.  Waste management  Waste generated by the group's operations consists primarily  of paper, cardboard and wood. The group works actively to  minimize waste and increase recycling.    In 2011, 73% of waste was recycled and 26% went to energy  recovery.    Waste distribution, % of waste mass  Paper, 59% Cardboard/paperboard, 8% Plastic, 2% Metals/iron, 23% Wood, 7% Combustible, 20% Other, 1%   Noise pollution  Respect for our neighbors and noise reduction are high  priorities. Despite this, people are sometimes disturbed by  noise from PostNords activities. Complaints to municipalities  can result in orders to conduct noise measurements and  possibly take other action. During the year the group worked  to reduce noise disturbance for local residents from the  business in Huddinge, Sweden.  Chemicals  The Strlfors graphics business conducts ongoing reviews of  ways in which the operation can reduce its use of chemicals  and solvents. During the year, the Polish operations  intensified efforts to reduce the use of the solvent  isopropanol. Replacing isopropanol in the dampening  solution with chemicals that have lower solvent  concentrations reduces emissions of volatile organic  compounds (VOCs). By working closely with its supplier in  2011, Strlfors was able to reduce VOC emissions in the Polish  printing plant by 8% per unit produced compared to 2010.  Systematic efforts to reduce  environmental impact  The effort to reduce PostNords impact on the climate is a  strategic project that includes planning of the business and  investments. It is also an ongoing daily task. During the year,  several concrete initiatives were taken to transform the  business in order to achieve our long- term environmental  objective. Some examples:  Reduced fuel consumption  Green Routes for mail carriers and garbage collectors   PostNord worked with Skellefte, stersund and Pite  municipalities in Sweden in a number of successful Green  Route projects. By moving mailboxes and garbage cans to  the same side of the street, routes can be shortened for both  mail carriers and garbage collectors. In addition to benefitting  the environment, these measures improve safety for  residents and the work environment for drivers. Our aim is to  spread the initiative to more municipalities.  Continued energy efficiency  Danish campaign for improved environmental  awareness  In parts of the Breve Danmark business area, PostNord has  conducted a campaign that includes energy conservation  measures in premises and buildings aimed at promoting  environmental awareness. As a consequence, electricity  consumption in homes has also been set in focus since the  improved knowledge of energy conservation in the  workplace has also been translated into the home. Funding  from the Climate Fund was used for the campaign.  Energy surveys reduced energy use  Energy surveys were conducted in several places in the  Danish and Swedish operations, resulting in reduced energy  use. In the Malm region of Sweden, for example, we were  able to reduce energy use in certain mail carrier offices by up  to 20%, with relatively little effort.  Solar panels on the head office  PostNord signed a green lease with landlord Vasakronan for  its head office in Solna, Sweden. As part of this agreement,  350 square meters of solar panels were installed on the roof  of the head office in late 2011. The solar plant should produce  up to 40,000 kWh of electricity per year, equivalent to  heating two normal-sized houses. The investment is shared  between PostNord and the landlord and co-funded by Energi  Frsljning Sverige and the Swedish Society for Nature  Conservations eco-labelled environmental fund.  Increased share of electric vehicles  Distribution trucks charged using wind power  Breve Danmark participated in a project together with Edison  (Electric vehicles in a Distributed and Integrated market using  Sustainable energy and Open Networks), which aims at  harnessing energy from wind turbines by recharging electric  vehicles at night, energy that would otherwise be wasted. In  this project, Breve Danmark is conducting trials with three full- sized electric delivery vans. Funding from the Climate Fund  was used in the project.  350 electric bicycles in danish mail carrying  300 two-wheel and 50 three-wheel electric bikes were  delivered during the year and used in Danish mail carrying.  One advantage of the new bikes is that it is easier on the  body to ride an electric bike than a regular bike. In addition,  the electric bikes are faster and can take larger loads. Next  year another 360 bikes of each sort will be delivered.     >    SUSTAINABILITY REPORT  >   ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY    120  POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011    Testing new technologies and fuels  Testing new biofuel  PostNord participated in tests of a new fuel – BioDME, a waste  product from the forestry industry that has low climate  impact. The tests are being conducted by Volvo Trucks with  support from the EU and the Swedish Energy Agency. Two  trucks were tested in PostNords logistics business and have  entered into regular service on the Stockholm–Jnkping– Gothenburg route in Sweden. Funds from the Climate Fund  were used in the project.  Test of new electric vehicles with higher load capacity  and range  Breve Danmark tested new electric cars for distribution, with  successful results. The group has now decided to use funds  from the Climate Fund to test three new types of electric  vehicles in Meddelande Sveriges mail carrying since, in the  future, many mail carrier routes will be longer and will require  greater load capacity and range. The cars currently being  tested are larger and have longer operating times than the  club cars that have been used for the past several years.   SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   >   SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY     <.  POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  121     Social responsibility: employees  Committed and healthy employees  As one of the largest Nordic employers, PostNord has a  responsibility to develop employee commitment and  safeguard their health. Customer satisfaction and the  groups success are founded on having excellent  managers and employees with the right skills.  The success of the group is dependent on its ability to recruit,  develop and retain the best talent in various functions in a  variety of different professions. PostNord therefore strives to  be an attractive and stimulating employer with skilled  managers and dedicated employees.  Responsible change  PostNord endeavors to act effectively and responsibly in all  group change processes. The group's strategy involves  significant restructuring efforts to adapt the workforce to  lower volumes. PostNord always strives to act responsibly as  an employer when making personnel changes.   In 2011, the largest staff reductions occurred in business  area Breve Danmark following the large drop in letter  volumes in the Danish market during the year. In connection  with closures and changes, PostNord is offering employees a  variety of support measures aimed at assisting employees in  moving to a new job. This support may include training and  courses, relocation assistance, coaching and career guidance.   PostNords management and the trade unions agreed in  2011 to further strengthen their cooperation in order to best  identify solutions to the challenges ahead.    Comanagement rights for PostNord employees are based  on each country's labor market legislation and are regulated  at the national level. Employers interact and negotiate with  the trade unions in all businesses and at group level.  Collective agreements are signed locally in each country. All  employees are covered by collective agreements. The  Collaboration and Employee Participation Agreement states  that unions shall receive information at an early stage and  have the opportunity to influence the negotiations and  collaborations in order to increase understanding of and   >     SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   >   SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY    122  POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011    involvement in the changes taking place in the group's  operations.    Examples of new employee benefits include a new system  for managing working time. The system was introduced from  January 2012 for all employees in the group's Swedish  operations. The working-hours bank gives employees greater  opportunities to manage their leave and creates better  conditions for business planning. Another example is that  mail carriers in Sweden are offered the opportunity to apply  for funding for their drivers license as part of the group's  work on skills exchange.  Focus on employees  Employeeship at PostNord is based on each individual taking  responsibility for their work, delivering on promises, creating  good relations and thinking about the business. In order to  stimulate employees' desire to constantly innovate and  improve to meet customer requirements, PostNord strives to  achieve a team-based organization. Employees are involved  in planning and control of their own tasks and the tasks of  their team. PostNords managers must create the right  conditions for the team, creating participation and allowing  employees to take responsibility for their work.   For many years, the group has conducted systematic  surveys of employee commitment. In 2011 the group  conducted a group-wide survey (FOCUS) for the first time.  With a response rate of 86%, employees expressed their  views on their own employeeship and the management –  from group management down to their own line managers.  During the year, 74% of group employees also state that they  had a career development discussion during the year.   The results of the FOCUS survey are used to calculate the  groups employee index (MIX) and leadership index (LIX). The  outcome for 2011 is not comparable with previous employee  surveys due to changes made in the measurements, but it  can still be noted that the index results in the survey have  deteriorated over the previous year. The study suggests,  among other things, that employees want more and clearer  information about the group's new strategy and future.  Overall, the survey shows that the group's employees are  satisfied with their daily work and their immediate supervisor.    Each unit is developing action plans based on the FOCUS  results, and subsequent discussions and dialogue sessions  between managers and employees will contribute to the  further involvement of employees. A high LIX index is closely  correlated with a high MIX index, and managers are therefore  important in future work to increase employees' commitment  to the group's development. It is essential to recruit, develop  and retain the best talent – a prerequisite for the successful  strategic repositioning of PostNord as northern Europe's  leading communication and logistics company.

POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  123     The importance of leadership to the  business  Good leadership is essential for employees involvement in  and commitment to joint efforts to achieve the groups and  the unit's goals.    During the year, PostNord introduced a shared platform for  the development of leadership in the group, with four  leadership criteria that support the developments taking  place inside and outside PostNord. The criteria describe the  behaviors that the group wishes all managers and leaders to  demonstrate in their daily leadership:   The manager delivers value by understanding and reacting  to customer needs, setting priorities and taking  responsibility for the overall picture.   The manager generates involvement by showing trust,  delegating and creating the conditions for good results.   The manager takes responsibility by developing the  business, taking full ownership and implementing  continuous improvement.   The manager is clear in his or her expectations, feedback  and communication.    All management teams met during the fall to reflect on the  criteria and how they can be used in day-to-day operations.    An example of how PostNord stimulates good leadership is  the Marianne Nivert scholarship, a scholarship intended to  promote both good management and more women in  leadership positions. The scholarship was established in 2009  and is awarded annually during 2010-2014. In 2011, it was  awarded to Annica Axelsson, president of Strlfors Sweden,  and Elise Jensen, production manager at business area Breve  Danmark.   The group's employee survey, in which questions are based  on the leadership criteria, analyzes and evaluates the  management. For PostNord to succeed in repositioning the  company, it is important to strive to improve understanding  of the group's new strategy and its implications for different  parts of the business. PostNords managers and leaders play  a key role in this.  Systematic work on leadership  development  The group has established a group-wide Management  Planning Process to develop and provide further training for  managers. The process is based on the businesss strategy  and objectives and ensures all managers are evaluated the  same way. Systematic work with executive development,  development of talent and more effective succession  planning are other advantages.    During the year, a number of concrete initiatives were  taken with the aim to developing PostNords managers,  including the following:  Coaching in all operational businesses  PostNord works with coaching in different parts of the  business. For example, business area Breve Danmark offers  the support of an internal group of mentors and coaches.  This years focus was on efficient resource management  aimed at developing the business in a responsible manner.  Business areas Meddelande Sverige and Logistics  implemented programs with external coaches during the  year.  Group-wide development programs  During the year, the group realized the third round of the  group's development program for middle managers, 60% of  whom were women. The Young Professionals initiative was  started during the year, a development program for young  specialists in Denmark and Sweden identified as talents. With  participants from different countries, the programs provide a  platform for increased knowledge of the group's country- specific conditions.  Senior management meeting  Senior Management Meeting is a forum for the group's senior  managers, about 200 people. This is where the CEO,  executive management and managers discuss issues  concerning PostNords strategy, objectives and direction. Two  meetings were held in 2011 and more are planned for 2012.  Equality and diversity  Equality and diversity are strategic issues for PostNord. The  group believes that peoples differences are enriching, and  that differences contribute to a more attractive and dynamic  workplace.    Gender distribution  Women, 35% Men, 65%   The equal value of all should characterize PostNords  workplaces and there is zero tolerance for discrimination.  With nearly 70 nationalities, some 50 languages and  numerous cultures and religions represented among our  employees, challenges sometimes emerge. They also provide  a huge opportunity that can strengthen us all, from the  individual and the business to our offer to society as a whole.    Having a diverse workforce is something I  see as a major benefit for the company. It  creates an amazing energy and provides a  lot of different nuances.  Jakob Manori, head of Copenhagen and Taulov parcel centers  PostNord has codes of conduct in place to support our zero  tolerance philosophy. Managers play a key role in  implementation and compliance. Each workplace must work  to ensure that employees are aware of and familiar with    >     SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   >   SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY    124  POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011    these documents. Compliance is also monitored in employee  surveys, performance appraisals and health and safety  surveys.    The group had one discrimination case in 2011. A woman  reported gender-based discrimination when a post was filled  at Post Danmark. The parties settled during the year and the  woman received compensation equivalent to three months'  salary.   PostNord must offer men and women equal opportunities  at work and avoid unfair differences in pay. Equality between  men and women is the diversity variable that the group  focuses on. In 2011, the difference between mens and  women's wages was 3.9 (3.7) %. To accelerate the promotion  of gender equality, management has decided on the group- wide target of 40% female managers and supervisors by  2015. In 2011, the proportion of female managers was 29 (29) 1)  %. The female/male gender distribution in the group was  35/65 (36/64) %.  1)  Adjusted from previously published information.  Health and safe work environment  PostNord has worked systematically with health and safe  work environment efforts for many years. This has resulted in  a reduction in sick leave and a focus on lowering the risk of  illness and injuries. Physical strength and good health are  essential at many PostNork workplaces where physically  demanding jobs are performed. Mail carriers and drivers, for  instance, perform jobs that require physical health. PostNord  has come a long way in lowering sick leave levels, but more  remains to be done. There are wide variations in sick leave  levels across the group, and this calls for focused efforts to  further reduce sick leave. In 2012, for example, stress will be  an area of focus for increasing comfort and well-being at  work.   In June 2011, group management adopted a group-wide  policy for health and safety. A working group with  representatives from all operational areas is working on how  to improve the health ratio (i.e., ratio of employees with no  more than five days' sick leave in a year). The ambition is that  health-promoting measures will increase this figure. In 2011,  sick leave absenteeism was 5%, which represents a slight  decrease compared to the previous year. This is a good result  given the employee cutbacks that have been made,  particularly in the Danish operations. Long-term sick leave  was at the lowest since measurements began, while short- term sick leave increased slightly.   One of PostNords strengths in working with health is its  use of health promotion efforts at an early stage, such as  health profile assessments, health schools or exercise on  prescription. Several initiatives were taken during the year to  improve the working environment, increase awareness and  use of health promotion initiatives and reduce sick leave  levels.   Health promotion activities   Approximately 4,600 employees in Denmark participated  in a pilot project with "health checks aimed at helath- promoting training activities.   Health ambassadors were introduced in Denmark,  inspired by the Swedish model of health motivators. Two  seminars for "health motivators were conducted during  the year in Sweden.  Work environment   This years work environment prize in the Swedish  operations went to the rebro region. The region has  worked systematically and in close cooperation with  unions to improve the work environment and motivate  employees to participate in healthy activities. Health  motivators have played an important role.   In business area Meddelande Sverige, a broad effort was  made to improve the ergonomic situation for processing  facility workers. This is a group that often suffer from neck,  shoulders and back pain due to physically demanding jobs.   After two cold and snowy winters with many slip and fall  injuries, a new non-slip sole, mounted directly on mail  carriers shoes, was developed in business area Breve  Danmark. The project was successful and resulted in fewer  injuries caused by slippery surfaces.       Responsible drivers   The majority of PostNords employees are out in traffic  every day. To ensure that drivers are responsible and  dependable, business area Logistics established a new  policy on alcohol and drugs. This policy has been linked  with alcohol and drug training targeting employees who  are on the road.   In 2011, alcohol interlock modules were introduced in all  workplaces for mail carrying in Sweden. With this  investment, PostNord is taking responsibility for both its  own employees and other people on the road.         Job exchange and futurum   PostNord uses a variety of reorganization programs when  operations are closed or in cases of long-term sick leave.  These include Job Exchange in Denmark and Futurum and  Omstart in Sweden. Affected employees receive support in  moving on to new jobs, including guidance on applying for  jobs, studying or starting a business. Under Omstart,  employees who for medical reasons cannot continue to  work with the same tasks, are offered extra assistance in  finding new jobs outside PostNords operations.       SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   >   SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY     <.    POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  125    Social responsibility: Suppliers and partners  Responsible procurement  Each year PostNord purchases goods and services worth  billions from a large number of suppliers. The majority of  purchases relate to transport and services. Central  procurement procedures are essential to capture  synergies within the group.  PostNords purchases are increasingly centralized under a  group-wide procurement process to utilize the potential for  economies of scale that the group's size brings. However, a  number of agreements are still local and transportation  purchases are managed by procurement officers within the  business operations.   Since transportation accounts for a large share of group  purchasing and also has a big environmental impact,  PostNord places particular demands on transport suppliers  with regard to oils, tires and green cars. EU standards are met  with regard to machinery and specific noise requirements are  imposed before machinery is approved.    The group monitors purchasing process efficiency by  setting targets for and measuring contractual performance.  This approach ensures that the group meets regulatory  requirements and that purchases are made from those  suppliers that have signed agreements. To further ensure  this, a Nordic contracts database was established in 2011 with  the intention of, over time, including all contracts.    PostNord sets requirements regarding the environment  and working conditions throughout the supply chain. In each  contract the group requires that suppliers and their  subcontractors comply with a set of criteria for environment,  quality and security. Since 2009, contracts are signed  whereby suppliers agree to comply with PostNords code for  suppliers.   The code for suppliers includes requirement for wage  levels, social security and tax registration. Suppliers must also,  via their subcontractors, ensure that the goods and services  bought by PostNord are manufactured under conditions that  are consistent with the principles of responsible business  under the UN Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines for  Multinational Enterprises.    During the year PostNord signed up to the Swedish  Environmental Management Councils guidelines for buying  clothing in developing countries. The clothing procurement  that has been initiated is based on the requirements of these  guidelines. PostNord buys promotional clothing through  agents in Sweden, which in turn make their purchases from  contracted production facilities, primarily in Asia and Eastern  Europe..  Monitoring and compliance  Monitoring of suppliers' compliance occurs in several ways.  As part of the procurement, all suppliers conduct a self-audit  of quality, environment and security in which they rate  themselves. Supplier suitability is then judged by the  supervising purchaser.    With the help of new tools and guidelines, the purchasing  process will be further streamlined. This means that PostNord  will be able to concentrate procurement volumes with fewer  suppliers, ensuring better control of suppliers and achieving  greater cost efficiency.

An ongoing dialogue ensures  that PostNords service and offer are constantly improving.  PostNord has a unique distribution network which covers  Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. The group works  primarily with well-established retail chains that have national  coverage, long opening hours and are in places where other  errands can be performed.    In Sweden, Posten AB launched its first partner outlet, "post- i-butik in the 1980s. Some ten years ago the traditional post  offices in the country were closed and replaced by partner  outlets in grocery stores and gas stations to improve  accessibility and to provide a more efficient service.   In Denmark, the distribution network consists of both post  offices and unmanned delivery stations (Dgnsposten) that  are run independently. It also consists of partner outlets,  which in many respects correspond to the Swedish partner  outlet network. In Denmark, the group has gradually  increased the number of partner outlets in order to increase  accessibility for customers and recipients. In Denmark,  customers are able to choose to have parcels delivered to  their door or to collect from a service outlet (flexleverering).   The construction of a partner outlet network, and  subsequent changes, has been and is an important issue in  dialogue with several stakeholder groups. For example, in  Sweden, where PostNord closed its post offices many years  ago in favor of the outlet network, the changes have  sometimes been met with criticism. It may be noted,  however, that the changes have in general increased  accessibility for the vast majority of Swedes and provided a  more efficient service. The group's surveys also show that  most customers and recipients appreciate the outlet network.    Effective relationships with partners who act as partner  outlets are an important success factor for PostNord.  PostNord imposes high quality standards on partners and the  group conducts an ongoing dialogue with them to ensure  that customers are satisfied. In Sweden, a certification test has  been launched that all outlets must undergo annually to  show that they have the right skills to assist customers. About  95% of the outlets completed certification in 2011. In Norway,  agreements were signed with Coop and Norgesgruppen in  2011, which means that 200 new distribution points have  been established or are being established. These agreements,  together with the existing agreement with ICA, give PostNord  access to of supermarkets in Norway and allow PostNord to  reach 87% of all Norwegian households.    Monitoring of relationships with these partners is done  through annual measurements of partner and customer  satisfaction indices as well as mystery shopper programs.

POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  127    Partnerships and initiatives  As part of its responsible work towards a long-term sustainable  society, PostNord collaborates with and supports businesses,  organizations and associations. This is valuable in shaping and  developing PostNords own operations and the industry and  the communities in which it operates.  During the year, PostNord participated in several regional,  national and international initiatives on sustainable  development, climate issues and service and accessibility  issues. Charity and sponsorship are other ways to operate.  Examples of collaboration   Cooperation for sustainable development:  PostNord is involved in several initiatives on sustainable  development to both learn from others and to contribute  to the industrys approach to environmental and social  responsibility. Examples of initiatives are the Danish Council  for Sustainable Business Development, Climate Neutral  Freight Transportation (KNEG) and the Network for  Transport and Environment (NTM).    Industry initiatives to reduce carbon dioxide emissions:   Within the framework of international trade associations  IPC and PostEurop, PostNord participates in climate  initiatives that aim to reduce the industry's carbon dioxide  emissions.   Social responsibility:   As a member of the Danish Business Forum for Social  Responsibility (VFSA), for which group HR director Palle  Juliussen has been appointed representative, PostNord  participated in a campaign focusing on measures for  disabled people.    Accessibility and services in rural areas:   As a co-funder of the national Swedish Village Action  Movement organization, we are conducting a dialogue on  how PostNords business can contribute to the continued  development of all regions in Sweden.    Police collaboration against fraud:   An initiative was taken during the year focused on  information exchange between PostNord, the police and  PostNords customers with regard to security and new  forms of fraud.      Examples of PostNords charitable and  sponsorship activities     Sponsorship activities in cycling and soccer in Sweden and  Denmark.   Partner to Swedish non-profit Mentor organization since  2005 and general partner since 2010, to support young  people through helpful relationships with adults in the  business community.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   >   ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES      <.  POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  131   Accounting principles  PostNord AB is the parent company of the group formed  through the June 24, 2009 merger of Post Danmark A/S and  Posten AB. This is the groups third Sustainability Report.  Previously, Posten AB and Post Danmark A/S published  sustainability reports for their respective operations.  PostNord has chosen to publish its Sustainability Report  together with its Annual Report to provide PostNords  stakeholders with an overview of the groups operations and  to clarify the groups long-term efforts towards sustainable  development and sustained value creation.   The Sustainability Report is prepared in accordance with the  Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Report Guidelines,  Version 3.0, Application Level C+. The choice of GRI indicators is  based on PostNords stakeholders desire for information and the  groups assessment of what is most relevant to report given the  groups business. The cross-reference table for GRI indicators can  be found on PostNords website.    Financial data and the average number of employees are  reported on the same principles as in PostNords Annual Report  and therefore include the entire group. Data on employees and  the environment include, unless otherwise indicated, the Nordic  operations. Environmental data includes the non-Nordic  operations of Strlfors. In case of deviation, the scope is shown  next to the specific information. The Nordic operations made up  97% of consolidated net sales and approximately 98% of the  groups average number employees in 2011.    Logistics enterprises Eek Transport AS, Nils Hansson  Logistics AB and Mereco Transport AS have not been  included in the reporting of environmental and employee  data, even though they were acquired during 2011. These  companies will be included in the Sustainability Report for  2012. Neither are Svensk Adressndring AB and  Tidningstorget AB included in the environmental data, as  these operations do not have a significant environmental  impact. Otherwise, the consolidation principles are the same  for financial data and environmental data.  Changed accounting principles  PostNords 2011 Sustainability Report applies the same  accounting principles as in the previous year, with a few  exceptions.    In reporting indicators of working conditions and terms of  employment (LA), PostNord also reports from 2011 the total  number of employees at year-end as a complement to the  average number of employees.   In 2011, environmental data for Danish logistics companies  Budstikken Transport A/S, Transportgruppen A/S, DPD  Danmark A/S and HIT Danmark A/S has been obtained for  the first time. Historical data has therefore been restated for  comparison. Harmonized measurement methods for  Logistics operations in Norway and Finland have also meant  that historical data has been changed. For this reason, the  values of all environmental data except waste have been  adjusted compared with previously published information.  Methods of measurement, environment  Transportation  Road transport: In Sweden and Denmark transport is carried out  with PostNords own vehicles and through contractors. Contractors  are used for all transports in Finland and Norway. Emissions to air  are calculated based on the amount of fuel purchased and type of  vehicle used, as well as the road system. Calculations based on  subcontractor costs are also used in some divisions. Factors used  to calculate emissions to air are nationally recognized factors in the  Nordic region; for example, from the Network for Transport and  Environment (NTM), the Swedish Environmental Protection  Agency and the Danish Energy Agency.   Air: PostNord purchases air freight externally for operations  in Sweden and Danmark. PostNord did not use any air  transport in Finland or Norway during the year. The Swedish  operation receives data from suppliers on amount of fuel and  distances. The Danish operation registers executed transport  in a transport administration system and emissions are  calculated based on ton-km. The emission factors used are  nationally recognized factors for each country.    Rail: Only the Swedish and Norwegian operations use rail  transport to any great extent. All rail transport in Sweden is  purchased from Green Cargo which is eco-labeled as a Good  Environmental Choice. Rail transport in Norway uses fossil- free electricity.   Ferry: Only the Danish operation uses ferry transport to any  great extent. Information on executed transport is registered in  the transport administration system and emissions are calculated  in ton-km. The emission factors used are nationally recognized.    Electricity and heat  Electricity: Electricity consumption data is obtained chiefly from  electricity suppliers or by reading meters. Electricity purchased in  Sweden is eco-labeled as Good Environmental Choice. In  Denmark, Copenhagens Postcenter used wind-generated  electricity. This electricity is assumed to generate no carbon  dioxide emissions. In cases where electricity is included in the  rent, or is otherwise not received directly from the supplier or  cannot be determined through meter reading, consumption is  estimated based on size of premises (applies to certain parts of  the Swedish operation). For this electricity, carbon dioxide  emissions are calculated based on Nordic electricity mixes.   Heat: Offices and sorting facilities are primarily heated by  district heating or natural gas. Heat consumption is  monitored by meter readings or invoice records. In certain  cases, heat consumption is estimated based on size of  premises. The emission factors used are nationally  recognized. Premises that are heated by electricity are  calculated in accordance with the above.   >     SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   >   ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES    132  POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011    Business travel  Reported emissions from business travel refer to air, rail and car  travel. Records are received from the travel agencies that  PostNord has contracts with. For car travel, emissions are  calculated based on fuel consumption and generally recognized  emission factors.  Waste  Reported waste amounts are received from PostNords waste  management contractors.  Methods of measurement, customers  Customer value  With the formation of the new joint group, PostNord has new  group-wide key data and monitoring tools for developing  customer capital.    The KVI (customer value index) is PostNords monitoring tool  for regularly following up customer satisfaction and customers'  perception of the business. It replaces the various customer  satisfaction surveys that previously existed in the organization.  Measurements are made twice a year and include all PostNord  business areas and Strlfors, with a focus on the Nordic countries.   The key ratio consists of three overall satisfaction questions.  The three questions have previously existed in both the KTA  and the NKI and are also used in several external metrics  such as Svenskt Kvalitetsindex (SKI), Danskt Kvalitetsindex  (DKI) and the European Performance Satisfaction Index  (EPSI), which also allows for external benchmarking.   Quality, first-class mail  Swedish External Monitoring (SWEX) and Danish External  Monitoring (DEX) are independent external quality metrics  that continuously measure the number of first-class letters  that are delivered on time from customer to customer.  Measurements are conducted by means of a statistically  assured test letter activity which fulfills the requirements set  forth in the EN standard 13850. These measurements were  conducted in 2011 by TNS-SIFO and Quotas QmbH in Sweden  and Denmark, respectively. The results of the two  measurements are weighted together into a group-wide  outcome based on letter volume in each country.  Quality, parcels  The production systems in Sweden (LUPP) and Denmark  (GTT) are two independent systems that measure the  proportion of parcels that are delivered on time from first  production scanning to the customer. Test products are  weighted according to 19 (MyPack), 25 (Postpaket) and 15  (DPD Fretagspaket 16:00) for Sweden and Erhvervspakker,  PrivatPakker and Postpakker for Denmark.    Since the two measurements are not directly comparable,  this is done in two separate measurements. During 2012, the  measurement will take place in a harmonized way via a  system called CEM. PostNord will then have a joint Nordic  report on delivery quality for parcels based on the MyPack,  PallEtt and DPD products.  Methods of measurement, employees  Average number of employees  Calculated by dividing the total number of paid hours by the  standard number of hours for a full-time employee.  Total number of employees  The total number of employees at the end of the period.  Divided into basic staff and temporary staff.  Basic staff  Refers to all full and part-time monthly salaried employees. The  definition of basic staff is that it shall cover the basic requirements  of a normal production flow. Temporary staff cover peaks in  production; for example, during Christmas or holidays.  Personnel turnover  Number of people ending their employment in 2011 in  relation to basic staff at the end of the year.  Sick leave  Sick leave in relation to the regular, contracted working time,  reported as a percentage.   Sick leave comprises absence due to illness when the  employee himself/herself is sick.   Regular, contracted working time in hours includes both  hourly paid employees and temporary workers time,  overtime, sick leave, vacation, parental leave and care for sick  children and other paid leave.  Occupational injuries  Registered industrial injuries in relation to hours worked  (does not include injuries incurred during work-related travel).  Even minor injuries (first aid level) have been included in the  report. Calculations are based on total hours worked,  irrespective of type of employment. The injury ratio is  calculated as the total number of injuries per 1 million hours  worked. Occupational injuries are reported to the line  manager in Sweden and Denmark. Registration takes place in  the C2 system in Sweden, the Skadesanmeldesessystemet  (SKA) in Denmark and in a ledelses- och informationssystem  (LIS) in Norway. Statistics on reported occupational injuries  can be retrieved from the systems and sorted into various  categories such as falls, crushing and traffic injuries. The duty  to record occupational injuries is made very clear.   MIX  Measures levels of employee commitment. Surveys are  conducted in conjunction with an external party, are anonymous  and are analyzed by a partner independent from the group.  LIX  Measures levels of employee satisfaction with line managers,  to what degree employees believe their line manager lives up  to PostNords leadership criteria: deliver, involve, take  responsibility and clarity.  Methods of measurement, society  Corporate Image  Corporate image is a study conducted by external company TNS  SIFO. The study is based on a weekly survey of approximately  400 people (200 in Sweden and 200 in Denmark) who answer  questions on their perceptions of Posten Sverige and Post  Danmark, respectively. Another study methodology was used in  previous years, so previously published figures are not directly  comparable. The survey consists of five key questions that make  up an index. The 2010 survey was conducted during a limited  time period and based on answers from over 600 Danish and  600 Swedish respondents. Identical questions and survey  methodology were used in 2010 and 2011.     SUSTAINABILITY REPORT   >   ATTESTATION REPORT     <.    POSTNORD SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2011  133    Attestation Report  Limited attestation report for PostNord ABs Sustainability Report  To the readers of PostNord ABs Sustainability Report Introduction  We have been engaged by the board of directors of  PostNord AB to perform an assurance engagement related to  PostNord ABs Sustainability Report for the financial year 2011.  The board of directors and the senior management are  responsible for the ongoing activities regarding environment,  work environment, quality, social responsibility and  sustainable development, and for the preparation and  presentation of the Sustainability Report in accordance with  the applicable criteria. Our responsibility is to express a  conclusion on the Sustainability Report based on our review.  The scope of the review  We conducted our review in accordance with RevR 6,  Assurance of Sustainability Reports, issued by FAR SRS. A  review consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons  responsible for preparing the Sustainability Report, and  applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is  substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in  accordance with the IAASBs standards on auditing and  quality control and other generally accepted auditing  standards. The procedures performed in a review do not  enable us to obtain an assurance that would make us aware  of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  The stated conclusion based on a review therefore does not  have the level of certainty as a conclusion based on an audit.   The criteria that our procedures are based on are the  applicable parts of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G3,  published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which are  relevant to sustainability reporting, as well as the accounting  and calculation principles that the company has developed  and identified. We believe that these criteria are suitable for  the preparation of the Sustainability Report.   Our limited assurance review encompasses the indicators  presented in the GRI Cross-Reference Table, which can be  found on PostNord ABs website, www.postnord.com, as well  as in the pages of this Sustainability Report and in the Annual  Report as indicated in the table of contents.    The main procedures of our review, based on our  assessment of relevance and risk, have included the  following:    a.  update of our knowledge and understanding for  PostNord ABs organization and activities  b.  assessment of suitability and application of criteria in  respect to stakeholders need of information  c.  assessment of the result of the companys stakeholder  dialogue  d.  interviews with responsible management at selected  units with the aim to assess whether the qualitative and  quantitative information stated in the Sustainability  Report is complete, accurate and adequate  e.  obtain internal and external documents to assess  whether the information stated is complete, accurate and  adequate  f.   evaluation of the systems and processes used to obtain,  manage and validate sustainability information  g.  evaluation of the model used to calculate carbon dioxide  emissions  h.  analytical review of reported information  i.   reconciliation of financial information against companys  2011 Annual Report  j.   assessment of the companys declared application level  according to GRI guidelines  k.  assessment of the overall impression of the Sustainability  Report and format, taking consideration of the internal  consistency of information with relevant criteria  l.   reconciliation of the reviewed information against the  sustainability information in the companys 2011 Annual  Report.  Conclusion  Based on our review procedures, nothing has come to our  attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability  Report has not, in all material respects, been prepared in  accordance with the above-stated criteria.
