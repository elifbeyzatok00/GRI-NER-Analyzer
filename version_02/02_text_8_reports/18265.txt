KTO  publishes sustainability reports every year in order to grow into a leader that pioneers the growth of  the Korean tourism industry and ensures proactive communication with its stakeholders.  Reporting Standards and the G3.1 Guideline Application Level  KTOs Sustainability Report 2011 was prepared in accordance with the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative)  G3.1 guidelines and ISO 26000. This report was produced in a way that satisfied all requirements for  the GRI G3.1 guideline Application Level A+, which was then directly confirmed by an independent  assurance provider and GRI.  Reporting Period, Scope and Boundary  This report spans the period between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011 and also contains data  from KTOs 2009 and 2010 sustainability reports for time-series comparison. In addition, the report  partially includes achievements in the first half of 2011 if deemed necessary. This report presents  KTOs economic, social and environmental performance. The boundary of this report is defined as the  major initiatives and achievements made by the KTO main office, domestic and overseas offices, and  five regional promotional offices. The companies that KTO invested in were not included in this report.

The disposal of our equities invested  in such subsidiaries as Kyongbuk Tourism Development  Corporation and Jeju International Convention Center, as well  as Jeju and Haenam Tourism Complexes, was underway and  sector-specific financial structures were improved. These  endeavors enabled us to establish a safer and healthier  financial structure through reduced loans and debt ratios and  increased liquidity ratios. Attainment of Common Goals through the Declaration  of Labor-Management Cooperation in 2011  In 2011, labor-management cooperation projects were  undertaken at KTO under the common goals of increasing  the number of in-bound tourists, strengthening the corporate  competitive edge, and implementing family-friendly  management practices. They enabled us to exceed our  original target in attracting in-bound tourists and to be chosen  as a leading family-friendly company. At KTO, we have high  expectations that the Declaration of Labor-Management  Cooperation will continue to serve as the driver behind  the strong foundation for labor-management harmony and  sustainable development.   No. 2 in Total Integrity and No. 1 in the Level of  Improvement Made among Public Enterprises In 2011, all KTO employees were united on a company- wide level to establish a culture of ethics and integrity. The  development of ethical master plans, GoDami, KTOs unique  character for ethics management and ethical catch phrases  assisted us in creating our own ethical identity. Sustained  training and infrastructure improvement also helped KTO  place second rank in total integrity and first in ranking for  the level of improvement made in the same evaluation group  consisting of public enterprises. Promotion of Domestic Tourism through the  Use of SNS and Smartphone Apps  At KTO, we provide customized customer services through  our IT-enabled tourism marketing capabilities that cover  smartphones and social networks. Three smartphone apps  were developed to suit different consumer needs and were  used for integrated marketing and promotional activities  in conjunction with regional tourism agencies. Continued  improvements were also made through multi-channel  monitoring, which allowed us to be awarded with the App of  the Year award and the Internet Communication Grand Prix  Award in 2011. Endeavors to Attract 10 Million In-bound  Tourists  The global economic crisis, the disastrous earthquake in  Japan, the growing anti-Korean sentiment in Taiwan and the  heavy flood in Thailand posed the greatest-ever challenge  to the Korean tourism market in 2011. KTO responded to  these crises by creating swift response strategies, proactively  developing tourism products and by creating promotional  initiatives. As a result, 9.8 million in-bound tourists (the  highest-ever in the nations history) visited Korea, generating  $ 12.3 billion in tourism revenues. KTOs Unique Way of Creating Jobs KTO is committed to creating jobs in order to fulfill its social  responsibility as a public enterprise. In 2011, we assisted  32 North Korean defectors, who were challenged to find  employment, in landing decent jobs through systemized  counseling and customized training. We also worked with the  Korean government and the industry as a whole, in order to  develop a support system to lay the foundation for the tourism  venture promotion project, taking the lead in creating jobs  through our unique capabilities at KTO.  Bring Group Tourists from Baojian Group under  the Incentive Tour Program KTOs efforts to promote Korea as a favored tourism  destination through the incentive group tour program bore  fruits in 2011 by successfully attracting employees of Baojian (a  Chinese company) to visit Korea. This constituted the highest  number of tourists (10,860 people) coming to Korea from a  single nation and a single company. They spent KRW 28.6  billion (KRW 51.6 billion in induced production) during their  15-day stay in Korea and also set a new record in the number  of in-bound tourists attending corporate meetings (137,887  people).

Reaching Partners & Community CONTENTS  CEO MESSAGE Dear Stakeholders,  In addition to operating a sustainable tourism industry, the Korea Tourism Orga- nization was created with the mission of becoming a Total Service Provider in the  national tourism industry by attracting in-bound tourists, stimulating the domestic  tourism market and promoting national economic growth. It is with this mission  that KTO is committed to sustainable and balanced growth, as well as a sustain- able future from the three perspective of : economic profitability, social responsi- bility and environmental health.    The rapidly-changing conditions that surround the tourism industry and related  businesses prompt us to shift to a new business paradigm. We initiate this shift  through a relentless pioneering spirit and a sense for innovation. Fulfilling social  responsibility in consideration of both economic growth and environmental protec- tion in conjunction with stakeholders is likewise emerging as a critical requirement  for corporate sustainability.   To respond to such advancements and promote the development of KTO through  sustainability management, the CSR Center was lately established in 2011 as a  dedicated unit in charge of undertaking company-wide management initiatives for  sustainable growth. To ensure that these initiatives are systematically and proac- tively executed, our Vision 2020, mid/long-term management strategies, the KTO  sustainability management vision of Global Leader (No. 1) that Leads a Sustainable  Tourism Industry, that reflected the social responsibility issue emphasized by ISO  26000 as well as the five strategic directions, were defined. This was also followed  by the selection of detailed action tasks, which are currently in operation at KTO.  Not even the numerous challenges that hit the tourism industry in 2011 (such as  the global economic crisis, the great flood in Thailand and the great earthquake in  Japan) could hamper our progress. In fact, for the first time in the history of KTO,  we surpassed the 9 million mark in the number of in-bound tourists. This was  a remarkable feat that positioned us one step closer to developing ourselves  into an advanced tourism nation that hosts 10 million in-bound tourists. On  top of all this, Korean tourism revenues exceeded KRW 10 billion for the  first time in history. Yet, even with all this progress, we have never fallen  into the complacency that so often accompanies success. Instead, we  have whole-heartedly set our eyes on our new paradigm of pursuing  internal strength and quality improvement, and left the conventional  approach of simply focusing on increasing the numbers well behind  us. Our tourism infrastructure expansion and diverse tourism con- tent development, serve to further reflect KTOs steadfast commit- ment to strengthen the edge of the Korean tourism industry over  the long haul.  Companies that fail to put their customers at the center of their business opera- tions or fall short of fulfilling their social responsibilities, can never guarantee a  sustainable future. This is why KTO is consistently taking initiatives for customer- driven management and corporate philanthropy that is based on the management  philosophy of RIO CHARM. Especially notable is the fact that in 2011, everyone at  KTO was fully dedicated to establishing our own unique corporate philanthropic  culture. The blueprint for social contribution initiatives was drawn up in consid- eration of inherent characteristics of the tourism industry, the business trip for  volunteer work scheme was introduced to encourage voluntary employee partici- pation and the Green Mileage scheme was improved. All of these efforts greatly  contributed to strengthening the foundation for corporate philanthropy at KTO. Our  sincere endeavors in keeping our promise to practice the spirit of sharing in every  corner of Korea (Guseok Guseok) allowed us to be honored with the Grand Prix at  the Social Contribution for a Happier Society Awards for two consecutive years.   2012 marks the 50th anniversary of KTOs establishment. A half-century later, we  will continue to dedicate our endeavors to raising the awareness of what the true  identity of a new tourism culture really means. We will be covering green tourism,  fair tourism and refresh holidays, while ushering in a sustainable world where  humanity and nature can harmoniously co-exist. We will do our utmost so that the  creation of value for stakeholders always comes first in everything that we do. We  will make their voices heard and grow into a company that is a household name,  a name trusted by society and the public, through the fulfillment of our social re- sponsibility.  As a member of the UN Global Compact, we are in full compliance with the ten  principles of the UNGC as well as ISO 26000, the international standard on corpo- rate social responsibility.  Your continued interest in and encouragement for KTOs never-ending journey to- wards a sustainable future and a harmonious,, contented organization, enjoyed by  all, will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.   CEO of KTO, Charm Lee  CEO MESSAGE 2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 003  2011 Korea Tourism Organization Sustainability Report Making Korea an Attractive Tourist Destination   In 1962, when tourism was hardly recognized as an industry in its own right, the Korean Tourism  Organization emerged with a critical mission to explore this unchartered, yet promising, Korean  territory.

Moreover, core values of KTOs corporate culture are shared and practiced continuously, under the  leadership of the company CEO, so that high-quality growth is attained in the Korean tourism industry and so  that KTO employees are united as one.  KTO is determined to evolve into a global sustainable tourism service provider that assists the balanced develop- ment of the tourism by reinforcing core business, based on the analysis of global tourism trends.

The Korean government owns 55.2% of KTO, more than half of  the total shares, and the rest are owned by respective shareholders such as the ones below. At KTO, our executives (including the CEO), auditors and executive/non-executive directors are appointed through  the Executive Recommendation Committee. This committee aims to improve the transparency and fairness  in appointing executives and to normalize the internal check system by strengthening the role of executives in  charge of the system. The committee consists of non-executive directors and private-sector members who are  recommended both internally and externally and then appointed by the BOD. In accordance with internal regula- tions, one non-executive director in the committee serves as a chair. The committee determines recommenda- tion methods and appointment procedures and also makes final recommendations for executive candidates to  the Public Institution Steering Committee (or to the person with the appointive power).     The performance pay of the KTO CEO is determined from the results of the annual governmental management  evaluations conducted by the Ministry of Strategy and Finance in accordance with the Act on the Management of  Public Institutions. The evaluation categories include: the three areas of leadership/responsible management,  management efficiency and major business as well as sustainable business stipulated in the CEO management  plan drawn at the beginning of each year. Aside from the company CEO, all executives are subject to internal  management assessments made in their respective divisions, governmental management evaluations and top- down assessments made by the CEO. This helps enhance their management accountability. Performance pay  for the CEO and executives is made transparently, in accordance with the compensation guidelines determined  by the Minister of Strategy and Finance. In 2011, individual performance assessments (which were previously  covered only for executives above class 1) were extended to those in class 2 and above, in order to ensure appro- priate alignment and feedback between performance assessment outcomes and compensation. To address fast-changing business environments and improve management transparency, we at KTO are com- mitted to establishing a BOD-centered management system and an advanced corporate governance system. As  KTOs top decision-making body in business operations, our board of directors (BOD) consists of nine members:  four executive directors and five non-executive directors, including the company CEO, who serves as the BOD  Chairman. Presently, there are no female BOD members. The CEO serves three years while directors serve two  years and their tenure may extend on a yearly basis. We comply with relevant laws, the KTO article of incorpora- tion and the Regulation on the Operation of the BOD, in relation to composition and the tenure of office. The board of directors (BOD) deliberates and decides on major management issues regarding basic manage- ment policies. The BOD meeting minutes are disclosed on the KTO website and on ALIO (a management infor- mation disclosure system for public institutions). In 2011, the BOD met 14 times: 12 monthly regular meetings  Equity Ownership  Composition of the BOD  Shareholders and Their Equity Ownership   Endeavors to Facilitate the Operation of the BOD BOD Members (As of June 2012)  Operation of the BOD    2009 2010 2011 Corporate Governance  Executive Directors  Non-executive Directors   Strengthen BODs checks  and supervision over the  top management Newly establish a dedicated BOD team and a preliminary consultative body   Strengthen BODs participation in business operation and proactively incorporate directors man agement advice   Prohibit the exercise of discretion by proxy and restrict the voting right on matters where BOD members  have special interest Strengthen and utilize  non-executive directors  expertise Appoint non-executive directors from diverse fields that suit the needs of business environments   Provide work manuals for non-executive directors and allow non-executive directors to perform  on-site inspections  Proposals made by  non-executive directors  (22 proposals in total) KTOs response to the devastating earthquake that hit Japan Status of the Korea Pass project Status of the development of special products and promotional projects for 2011 mega events  Revision of executive remuneration regulations 2,823,500shares Korea Finance Corporation  43.59% 3,575,764shares 6,478,191shares Ministry of Strategy and Finance (Government) 55.20% 56,377shares Korea Railroad Corporation 0.87% Financial Supervisory Service 11,275shares 0.17% 11,275shares Korean Reinsurance Company Total 0.17% 14 13 15 64 22 64 17 61 15 Chun-Gyu Kim  (Society) Chairman at the Forum of  Korea Future  Il-Seop Baek  (Culture) Entertainer  Hwa-Bok Lee  (Media) Director at the National  Vision Federation  Woo-Sik Chung  (Tourism) CEO of Korea Travel Co., Ltd.

Ad-hoc meetings were convened to discuss a performance-based salary system and  organizational regulations. Our non-executive directors are experts with abundant expertise and experience in  their respective specialty areas covering: culture, media, society and tourism. Their expert advice assists KTO  in improving management efficiency and providing checks and balances to the top management. Moreover,  the overseas marketing subcommittee and the tourism competitiveness reinforcement subcommittee are  in operation within the BOD so that their professional managerial advice helps KTO take stronger initiatives in  business conduct. These two subcommittees met twice and three times respectively in 2011, in order to monitor  relevant issues and reflect the outcomes.  Introducing KTO 2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 014 015 Market risks  Financial Risks  Regional Promotional Office  Overseas Office Risk Management Process Internal Audit   Management of Tourism Industry Risks  Risk management constitutes a key factor in enabling sustainable management of a company. Therefore, KTO  swiftly responds to risks across the whole spectrum of business operation and strengthens its risk management  capability on a strategic level. At KTO, we classify risks into financial risks and non-financial risks. Non-finan- cial risks are further categorized into business management risks and tourism industry risks, in consideration  of the inherent characteristics of our operations. These risks are systemically managed through the integrated  risk management system (RMS, non-financial risk management).  At KTO, a highly stringent internal control system is up and running, in addition to a year-round monitoring  system for risk diagnosis and prevention, through risk assessment-based auditing. Our prevention and manage- ment system uses a pool of 107 risk factors (including 32 key factors) to conduct monitoring. The elimination of  risk factors and the prevention of their re-occurrence are also institutionalized through audit consulting, which  helps strengthen internal auditing and operational control.   In 2011, our control self-assessment (CSA) system was dualized into standardized common and specialized  individual segments. This resulted in the addition of non-regular worker management, HR & compensation and  duty-free business as high-risk areas. Such endeavors assisted us in strengthening risk-based self-initiated  inspections in working-level departments and in expanding the responsible management system through a  specialized sector-specific inspection scheme.   Risks in the tourism industry may start small but they can gradually spread to hit the entire industry with grave  consequences. In turn, these small risks, have the potential to inflict severe damages, loss of property and dev- astating impacts on the tourism industry. Therefore, we at KTO chose 25 risk factors in four tourism sectors and  designated responsible units in each phase, in order to manage a well-functioning risk management process.  The Creative Management Office, under the direct leadership of the company CEO, is in charge of risk manage- ment, which ensures that decisions are made quickly and issues are addressed with immediate responses.

Moreover, strategic tasks and management indicators were chosen in alignment with the material issues identified.  Stakeholder Communication  Media Analysis  A total of 44,127 media articles spanning three years between January  2009 and December 2011 were analyzed, in order to understand how  major issues, regarding KTOs sustainability management were covered  by media outlets. This also helped us to identify relevant issues.  Trend & Impact Analysis KTO employees were surveyed on major trending sustainability issues  and on impact and internal capacity levels, in order to identify issues  where KTO impacts others or is impacted by internal capacity issues.  Specifically, internal capacity issues were utilized in identifying the sus- tainability management action framework that appears on page 25 of  this report. Industry Peer Analysis  The sustainability management reports of five Korean and overseas  companies, whose main business concerns the promotion of national  tourism and targeted industries, were analyzed by specific issues under  the ISO 26000 core subjects and the GRI performance indicators, in order  to identify issues relevant to KTO.  Diagnosis of KTOs Compliance with ISO 26000 The level of KTOs performance in meeting its social responsibility was  diagnosed in accordance with the ISO 26000 diagnostic tool that was  developed under the supervision of the Ministry of Knowledge and Econ- omy. This led to the identification of relevant issues with an emphasis on  vulnerable areas. 1. Recognition of Social Responsibility 3. Identification of Material Issues  2. Stakeholder Engagement Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Channels Stakeholder Interview We pursue positive synergistic relationships with our stakeholders through the  use of wide-ranging communication channels that suit the specific needs of each  stakeholder group. This is further complemented by in-depth interviews that  are conducted on experts who represent respective core stakeholder groups, in  order to identify additional potential issues to address. Moreover, 176 Korean and  overseas stakeholders in each stakeholder group were surveyed on KTOs sus- tainability management, so that the outcomes may be used as the foundation for  the materiality test. The operation of group-specific communication channels is  adjusted by the level of significance and influence that stakeholders exert on KTO s business operations and on the development of Koreas tourism industry. Their  feedback and requirements are reflected in developing sustainability manage- ment policies and strategies at KTO.

The materiality test was performed in accordance to the two distinct steps of relevance and significance testing, as suggested by ISO 26000. The relevance test was conduct- ed of the first 102 sustainability issues identified and they were narrowed down to 53 issues. These issues were then re-evaluated for their level of significance through inter- nal and external surveys. As a result, 31 trend and impact issues, that scored higher than 3.7 points on a scale of one to five, were finalized as material issues to be reported.  This sustainability report outlines KTOs activities on these material issues that were chosen through the materiality test process.  At KTO, our stakeholders are at the core of every action that we take in sustain- ability management and we are fully committed to fulfilling our economic, social  and environmental responsibilities with stakeholders. Our definition of core stake- holders includes: the six groups of customers, policy partners, delivery partners,  suppliers, and local communities and employees (depending on whether they are  influenced or influence our organizational performance as suggested by ISO 26000  and whether they bear any legal, financial or operational responsibilities).

Introducing KTO 2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 020 021 Yong-Su Oh, Executive Director at the Tourism  Marketing Department, Gyeonggi Tourism Organization The dissemination of the five-day workweek system caused growth in short-term trips, family trips and other  forms of domestic tourism. This prompts KTO to pay closer attention to the needs for and interest in domestic  tourism, which is gradually increasing. From the viewpoint of a local tourism corporation, our major issues  include the facilitation of the local economy through tourism and the operation of various communication  channels. The promotion of domestic tourism is directly related with growing incomes in local communities  and this is why the voice of local communities must be considered in developing tourism complexes. For KTO  to become a sustainable organization, it needs to find ways to ensure its co-existence with external stakehold- ers and build trust with them.  Chul-Won Kim, Professor and Dean at the College of Hotel &  Tourism Science, Kyung Hee University KTO is fully serving its role in promoting Korean tourism in the domestic tourism market, which is poised to  record 10 million in-bound tourists in the near future. I hope that KTO will continue to keep its eye on invest- ments in the tourism infrastructure, improve its readiness for tourists and develop policies for small and  medium-sized tourism companies. Human resources are at the center of any organization and this implies  that KTO needs to consider professionalism, loyalty and motivation at the workplace in managing its human  resources. Given that KTO is positioned to generate profits under its unique business mindset as a public  enterprise, it would be beneficial to re-define its corporate structure in consideration of the public nature of its  operations. This in turn, will assist KTO in ensuring sustainability and accountability in its business conduct.   Scott Kwon, Director at the Hong Kong Tourism Board Holiday Planners Dae-Hong Kim, CEO at Holiday Planners KTO has played an essential role in developing the Korean tourism industry to what it is today. Nevertheless,  KTO needs to be aware that there are numerous private sector companies in the tourism industry nowa- days and this inevitably raises doubts over the necessity, credibility and professionalism of KTO. Therefore,  KTO should promote solidarity with the tourism industry as a whole and gain trust and legitimacy from  the outside so that it may find ways to share value and seek mutual benefits. In addition, KTOs overseas  promotional activities need to be further localized to facilitate in-bound tourism and its operational profes- sionalism and employee competency should be enhanced, which will develop KTO into a high-performing  organization with a global competitive edge. ALIBABA, Managing Director at Hua Bang Travel Service Co., Ltd. With rapid growth in the tourism industry, the tourism market has reached a saturation point. The hotel oc- cupancy rate is over 90% and employment rates are increasing in related sectors. I hope that KTO will work  harder to expand the overall tourism market further, as it has already been saturated and that it secures  professionalism. The tourism industry is a service-oriented one that interfaces with people and this is why  it is highly critical to improve customer satisfaction. For KTO to grow into a sustainable company that rep- resents Korean tourism, each and every KTO employee should develop their competitive edge and profes- sionalism with a deep affection for tourism and the nation and strive to establish a healthy tourism market,  while enhancing Koreas positive national image.  In addition to the recent PR activities undertaken in the nearby markets of Southeast Asia, there need to be  stronger PR initiatives for the Korean tourism market in such distant markets as Europe and the Americas.  KTO needs to take the lead in expanding information channels to provide diverse and accurate information  to potential in-bound tourists and promoting a sustainable tourism culture in Korea. KTO should always be  aware of its role as a representative organization that shapes the image of Korea as a tourist destination  and serve as an agent to promote Korean tourism.  Jung-Jae Han, Secretary Director at Able Welfare Foundation Our perception of tourism, travel and leisure is changing and these cultural activities are considered as uni- versal rights for everyone nowadays. While there is a growing interest in and demand for welfare tourism,  this is not yet duly recognized and tourism themes and readiness are insufficient for vulnerable populations  within our society. Therefore, the overall recognition of and conditions for welfare tourism and tourism for  the elderly should transform and KTO should pioneer such a transformation. I hope that tourism will be  freely enjoyed by the socially underprivileged populations, as well as by in-bound and out-bound tourists.  This can be realized through the development of customized services and through the recognition of diver- sity and human rights as a core value to be respected.   Interview Stakeholder Interview   Sang-Ug Kim, Director at the Tourism Policy Division, Ministry of Culture,  Sports and Tourism Koreas domestic tourism market is improving both qualitatively and quantitatively. The spread of the five- day workweek system and the improved quality of life are also changing the way we enjoy tourism. For KTO  to lead sustainable tourism and development, it needs to recognize such changing trends in its internal and  external environments and address them proactively. KTO would benefit from continuously learning new  theories and trends in the tourism industry and broadening its perspectives as well. This will prevent KTO  from falling into any kind of despondency. I believe that KTO should move quickly and take the initiative in  dealing with problems by directly soliciting feedback from stakeholders and strengthening the manage- ment of customer contact points.    Management Principle At KTO, we respond to tourism demands both nationally and overseas by proactively promoting  Korean tourism to in-bound tourists and developing differentiated products. We are also boosting  the competitive edge of the tourism industry by managing both financial and non-financial risks.  Moreover, green tourism products were created and a dedicated GHG emissions and energy  management unit was established in order to ensure the sustainable growth of our ecosystem. In  so doing, we contribute to the initiative to mitigate climate change and increase our eco-friendly  competitive edge.

In addition, the sustainability management action roadmap was created in order to undertake  systemized follow-up measures on the action framework and chosen tasks. The CS Management Center was  also reorganized into the CSR Center in 2011. We will be fully committed to sustainability management in the  upcoming years to grow into a leader with a global competitive edge in the tourism industry.

This is up by 11.3% from the previous year and we have been marking two-digit growth rates for three consecu- tive years, outperforming our competitors in Taiwan, China and Japan. Moreover, our tourism revenues set a  new record in the nations history with $ 12.3 billion. Such a feat is attributable to the improvement of sales and  conveniences for Chinese shoppers and the development of high value-added products covering: weddings, cui- sine, medical treatments and the incentive tour programs. To establish a sustainable and healthy financial structure through the financial budget management system,  KTO strives to secure financial stability and manage resources reasonably. As part of our efforts to maintain  financial stability and health, our credit rating has remained at AAA, the highest level, for three consecutive years  and our debt ratio declined by 1.26% from the previous year. Included in our achievements in improving financial  health significantly from the previous year, are a 28.3% and an 8.35% increase in current net incomes and op- erating profits from duty-free shops, in addition to the turnaround of the Jungmun Beach Golf Club from a state  of deficit to a condition of surplus. We will continue to be committed to independently securing a sustainable  engine of growth through the development of a mid/long-term financing strategy. At KTO, we classify our business into public interest business and profit-making business. Public interest business is un- dertaken in Korea and overseas to promote tourism with the profits generated through the operation of duty-free shops,  the Jungmun Beach Golf Club & other facilities, as well as the Tourism Promotion Fund. The organizational restructur- ing and improved management efficiency allowed us to post KRW 2.1 billion in surplus in 2010 from KRW 53 billion in  deficit in operating profit. Our operating profit and current net income amounted to KRW 97.4 billion and KRW 32.8 billion  respectively in accordance with the IFRS accounting standards modified in 2011.  In a move to privatize subsidiaries under the Korean governments policy to advance public enterprises, we  disposed of an additional 19% in equity of Grand Korea Leisure, one of our subsidiaries, which increased the  amount of our equity sold in the company to 49% by December 2010. In September 2011, a provisional transfer/ acquisition contract was signed with North Gyeongsang Province in order to sell Kyongbuk Tourism Develop- ment Corporation and the disposal was completed in June 2012. In addition, we commissioned the Korea As- set Management Corporation to dispose of the International Convention Center Jeju (ICC Jeju) in August 2011,  under the privatization plan of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. Samil Pricewaterhouse Coopers was also  chosen as an underwriter to work on the on-going project to sell the Jungmun Resort Complex (including the  Jungmun Beach Golf Course). (The third bidding failed as of June 2012 and the fourth bidding will be announced  in September). These endeavors demonstrate that KTO is fully dedicated to securing liquid assets to improve the  health of its assets and undertake new emerging ventures by selling non-core assets. The consulting project to develop the K-IFRS (Korean International Financial Reporting Standards) system was  initiated in 2009 to respond to the introduction of K-IFRS to public enterprises. This led to the completion of our  own IFRS financial accounting system within the existing Strategic Management System (SMS) in May 2011.  Our K-IFRS accounting policies were set in 2011 and KTOs financial information is disclosed both internally and  externally. Before the first IFRS disclosure in 2011, we commissioned an external professional organization to  perform preliminary audits in relation to the introduction of IFRS, in order to lay the stable foundation for our ac- counting policies. Our accounting system was also aligned with that of Grand Korea Leisure, a subsidiary, and a  close disclosure cooperation system was built with the government (Ministry of Strategy and Finance), the larg- est shareholder of KTO, in order to provide swift and accurate financial information to stakeholders. The phased-in withdrawal from the duty-free shop business aims to advance KTO as an organization and to  improve its management efficiency. KTO duty-free shops at Mokpo Harbor (Dec. 2008), Sokcho Harbor (Jan.  2009) and Muan International Airport (Aug. 2009) were closed first, followed by Cheongju Airport (Jun. 2010).  The closures will begin at Incheon Port, Busan, Port, Pyeongtaek Port, Gunsan Port and Geumgangsan Office  in December 2012 and at the Incheon International Airport in February 2013. This change in business will not  however hamper our sustained endeavors in innovating the operation of our duty-free shop business and rein- forcing marketing partnerships with the related industry, which resulted in KRW 205.3 billion in sales and KRW  13.8 billion in current net incomes in 2011. In so doing, resources were secured to undertake purpose business,  which assists us in actively addressing internal/external environmental changes and threats and in strengthen- ing sustained growth potential.

This is a self-initiated review evaluation program that  generates sector/individual/department-specific index scores and total index scores by assessing performance  in such areas of: practice of ethics management, employees social contribution activities, and CS/Integrity  Mileage.  The outcomes are disclosed to employees through KEDEX (KTO Ethics Index) and index scores can be  verified on an individual/departmental/company-wide level. The self-review system enables both KTO and its  employees to build stronger capacities to practice sustainability management and this will be further comple- mented in the upcoming years by managing performance indicators in alignment with the strategies set in 2012.

Creating Customer Value  2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 030 031   Introduction of the Integrity Angel and Mileage Program Building Stronger Ethical Mindset At KTO, we introduced the Integrity Angel program to serve as a working-level unit for ethics management on a team  level. The program aims to encourage employees to practice integrity and disseminate a culture of integrity in order to  strengthen the implementation of ethics management. The Integrity Mileage program, which outcomes are reflected  in determining employee incentives, was also introduced as part of the compensation scheme. Outstanding employ- ees at ethical training sessions are additionally awarded and encourage others to attend ethical training. Our feedback system was strengthened through continued monitoring, self-initiated diagnosis and external as- sessments. Internal and external evaluations are made to review the level of ethics management at KTO and  the outcomes are incorporated in undertaking ethics management action plans. Moreover, in-house ethics  awareness surveys are conducted, which produced highly excellent results for two consecutive years in 2010  and 2011. It was also discovered through the surveys and evaluations led by the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights  Commission, that KTOs status improved from substandard in 2010 to excellent in 2011, with both internal/ex- ternal integrity improving as well. There was no single legal action taken against us for the violation of anti-trust  regulations or regulations concerning unfair competition. To build a stronger integrity and ethics mindset, all KTO employees signed the ethical pledge and courtesy train- ing and role training was offered to team managers in September 2011. For 31 weeks between May and De- cember, weekly three-question ethical quiz contests and amusing ethical dramas were staged along with other  ethical training programs. This improved employee satisfaction regarding training to more than 80% against  the conventional lecture-based training. Training hours per employee also rose from 6.24 hours in 2010 to 8.10  hours in 2011. The in-house contest attended by all employees was also held to create GoDami, KTOs ethics  management character, and to raise awareness for ethics management. The chosen catchphrase and char- acter were printed on employee business cards and document formats, to further enhance ethics awareness.  Moreover, we continue to learn relevant global trends by signing the CEO ethical pledge, attending the ethics  management SM forum and serving as a member of the UN Global Compact.

Under the vision of  Low Carbon & Green Tourism Platform, three strategic indicators of: practice low carbon green management,  develop green tourism products and develop eco-friendly tourism resources were set and phase-specific  implementation tasks are being undertaken. Green Management Action Framework Creation of Eco-friendly Value  Organizational Structure for Green Management Energy-Saving Committee The Energy-Saving Committee serves as a decision-making body to ensure reason- able energy management in accordance with the guidelines on the reasonable energy use at public enterprises.  The committee deliberates and decides on matters regarding energy management and execution. Chaired by  the Senior Vice President, the committee reports its outcomes quarterly, more often that the semi-annual re- porting guideline set by the government. The committee is responsible for setting the total energy consumption  targets and for guiding subordinate units to save in energy consumption.   Green Tourism Center The Green Tourism Center was launched in January 2011. The center is in charge of the  company-wide operation that relates to the systemized undertaking of green tourism projects. To ensure the  eco-friendly and efficient development of our natural tourism resources of mountainous and coastal areas, the  center provides tourism development consulting, discovers government-led projects and undertakes develop- ment projects in conjunction with local governments.

The built-in energy-saving  system was introduced to the whole building and sustained savings in electricity consumption were made by cut- ting down on the power supply needed for bidets, suspending elevator services, turning off neon signboards and  turning lights off on all floors during lunchtime. Moreover, a total of 812 light bulbs (412 in 2010 and 400 in 2011)  were replaced with energy-saving LED lamps. The current replacement ratio is 11% and we aim to increase this  to 30% by the end of 2012. Our power factor remains above 90% through the centralized monitoring and control  of electricity consumption and 22 facility managers received energy manager training 12 times a year. These are  just a few of the continued initiatives and training undertaken at KTO to reduce energy consumption.

The 2010 deci- sion to include KTO under the governments GHG and energy target management system in the public sector  prompted us to develop a comprehensive GHG information system, in accordance with governmental policies  and set the goal of reducing GHG emissions by 20% by 2015. The Jungmun Resort Complex follows the low car- bon green tourism resource development guideline proposed by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and  worked continuously to reduce carbon emissions by introducing eco-friendly modes of transportation, including  40 electric bikes and five electric vehicles. At KTO, energy keepers were designated on each floor of the Main Office building to supervise the inspection  of the status of energy consumption at the office and to make recommendations to save energy by banning the  use of personal electric heaters, cutting power supply for unused electric devices and encouraging the use of  scrap paper. They are also responsible for reporting the outcomes of their activities to the General Affairs Team  and top-performing keepers are offered incentives. The No Driving Day program is in operation and the ratio of  compact cars and hybrid vehicles used for business is increasing. These endeavors assist our employees in sav- ing energy consumption in their daily operations. The green tourism campaign was launched for 20 days between June and July of 2011 near Seoul Station and  Yongsan Station, with accessibility to both subway and train passengers. The campaign aimed to promote green  tourism to the general public during the summer vacation days, offer guidance on practical guidelines for green  tourism and encourage tourists to reduce CO2 emissions through the use of public transportation in conjunc- tion with Green Korea United. The campaign allowed us to assist ordinary people in raising awareness, practic- ing green tourism and in taking wide-ranging initiatives. These initiatives included: the display of photos of our  beautiful rivers, the introduction of Dubalo (meaning with two feet in Korean), an application developed for hik- ers, and the decoration of green trees with verified train tickets. The green-tree decorating event was attended  by 618 tourists, which generated the effect of reducing 50,000g of CO2 emissions and planting 189 trees.

Water Consumption (Unit: Ton) 2011 2010 2009  22,433 20,882 23,954 Main Office Jungmun  Beach Golf  Club 250,499 178,186 236,530 6,987 8,345 7,801 Jungmun  Resort  Complex Sewage Treatment Reduction of Water Consumption The sewage that is generated from the Jungmun Beach Golf Club is processed by the West Sewage Treatment  Plant. Sediments created within the sewage collecting tanks installed at the clubhouse are collected and treated  more than once a year, in order to minimize odors while older drainage pipes and transport pumps are replaced  with new ones to prevent soil and water contamination. At KTO, company-wide waver-saving campaigns are being undertaken continuously. At the Jungmun Beach  Golf Complex, drain pipes and water-retaining tanks were installed in order to recycle rainwater and reduce the  consumption of underground water. The recycling of rainwater began in July 2011 and it reduced the facility s annual daily water consumption by 40% from 2 million tons to 1.2 million tons. Other activities continued to  reduce energy consumption and improve the water quality, including the improvement of degraded water quality  through self-circulation and current generation in each water-retaining tank. Waste Management All waste generated at the Main Office and the Jungmun Beach Golf Club is consigned to professional compa- nies for treatment. In-house endeavors to reduce the amount of waste generated include the minimization of  the use of disposable products, the use of electronic documents instead of paper documents, and the manage- ment of the amount of copies and prints made, as well as thorough recycling of waste generated. The Jung- mun Beach Golf Club is monitored for its use of highly toxic materials and prohibited from using agricultural  chemicals more than twice a year by the Environmental Resource Research Institute in the Jeju Special Self- Governing Province.   In addition, the on-site replacement of oil used for equipment is strictly banned in order to properly store and  treat waste oil at the groundwork site for the Mt. Naejang Resort Complex and waste oil containers are stored at  the dedicated storage units installed near the on-site office for integrated consigned treatment. Mobile crush- ers are mobilized for the on-site recycling of construction waste including waste concrete and asphalt and all  of these waste materials are consigned to professional treatment companies in order to prevent the generation  of additional air pollutants, as well as noise and vibration. In 2011, waste wood was not produced during the  construction and thus there was no waste wood to recycle and there was no single violation of environmental  regulations during the reporting period. Temporary storage for waste oil   Purchase of Eco-friendly Products We give precedence to eco-friendly products in making purchasing decisions in accordance with the Act on the  Promotion of Purchase of Eco-friendly Products. Major purchase items include office devices and construction  materials with environmental marks that verify their eco-friendliness, as well as recycled paper. In 2011, the  ratio of eco-friendly purchasing amounted to 93% of the total volume and 73% of the total amount. We will con- tinue to expand the number of items and ratio of green purchasing.

Creating Customer Value  2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 036 037 Management of Eco-friendly Tourism Resources   KTOs development project sites are categorized into underground water preservation areas, ecosystem pres- ervation areas and landscape preservation areas by their environmental characteristics, which are taken into  consideration to enable eco-friendly development. Moreover, environmental impact assessments are performed  quarterly in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Act of the Ministry of Environment and all  substances discharged from these sites satisfy legally permissible standards. The development sites that are  subject to environmental impact assessments, including the Jeju Jungmun Resort Complex, the Mt. Naejang  Resort in Jeongeup and the Haenam Oceano Resort, do not generate a significant amount of direct pollutants,  unlike most manufacturing sites. However, such external factors such as other construction sites in their vicinity  and climate change have an impact, which warrants the annual monitoring conducted by environmental moni- toring organizations in alignment with local governments. There was no single legal sanction imposed in rela- tion to violations of environmental regulations during the reporting period. The phase 2 area of the Jeju Jungmun Resort Complex includes such cultural heritage protection areas as the  community of big cone pines along the coastline, Natural Monument No. 378 Cheongjeyeon Warm-Temperate  Forest Area and the Columnar Joint Area. We ensure that the indigenous species including the camellia, the Ilex  rotunda and the silver magnolia are planted in harmony with surrounding vegetation, to preserve biodiversity  near the development areas and that the big cone pine forest along the coastline is continuously maintained and  managed to preserve its pristine condition. The project site to be developed into Mt. Naejang Resort in Jeongeup contains a clean region where the Korean  buzzard, the grade II endangered wildlife was observed during the field survey in March 2008. In addition, Seo- dangcheongol, the habitat for a variety of aquatic plants, amphibians and fish, is maintained to keep its original  condition within the site. Green natural areas with healthy vegetation, such as the pine groves in the south of the  complex are also well preserved to maintain their natural condition. The post environmental impact assessments of the Haenam Oceano Resort Complex discovered that the nearby  marine ecosystem was not impacted by the construction. Moreover, the big cone pines within the project area  are preserved to keep their pristine condition and transplanted trees are listed for appropriate management for  trees damaged due to the development of the golf course in the complex. The Southwestern Coast Tourism and Leisure City is under the planning phase and its construction has not yet be- gun. To minimize any possible environmental impacts, the city was designed in a way to maintain ecological stabil- ity through a multi-layered structure and species diversity. In addition, the natural permeation of rainwater and the  creation of water-retaining areas within the complex will establish an appropriate water circulation system.

At KTO, we provide travel information to over 2.5 million individuals with disabilities who are registered in Korea  and strive to promote tourism for these vulnerable populations.  As part of our endeavors to create a tourism environment that can be accessed and enjoyed by all, we offer in- formation on amenities for individuals with disabilities in such customized formats as: websites, guides & braille  books and audil files. All of these further contribute to the creation of tourism culture where no one is left be- hind. We also offer invitation trips to the less-privileged to promote tourist spots where the physically-challenged  can travel with ease and encourage local governments to improve tourist amenities to this end. Through the promotion of domestic tourism for people with disabilities, KTO is producing media content to intro- duce barrier-free (BF) tourist attractions to create a tourism culture where no one is left behind. Video content that  promotes barrier-free amenities at famous domestic tourist spots was developed and broadcast through TV chan- nels, in order to enhance the readiness and awareness of local governments regarding barrier-free travel. More- over, TV programs to promote barrier-free tourism in Korea are broadcast through the nations major terrestrial  TV stations: KBS, MBC and SBS. Such PR initiatives will continue to be taken through wide-ranging media outlets.   Our support for the development of green tourism resources and the commercialization of these resources by  local governments aims to enhance the general publics awareness of green tourism and increase the accessi- bility of FITs to green tourism. The pilot certification project, related to the Korean eco tourism promotion project  that is underway in conjunction with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Ministry of Environment,  helped us develop certification indicators and certify four tour products and three accommodation facilities in  the pilot phase. The certification system will be legalized in the upcoming years to improve public awareness of  ecological tourism. Moreover, 230 tourist spots nationwide were surveyed in April 2011 to identify the status of  their operations and old and outdated destinations were surveyed to identify the locations that require remodel- ing. As a result, four remodeling candidates were chosen and renovation work began accordingly.  To advance Koreas tourism culture and introduce new trends and the appeal of Korean tourist destina- tions, KTO attended major tourism expos in Korea and more than 290,000 people participated. These  events included the Travel My Country Expo (Feb.), the Korea World Travel Fair (May) and the Gyeonggi  International Travel Mart (Dec.). KTOs attendance at these expo events shed new light on the value of  domestic tourism and motivated expo participants to travel to a variety of tourist spots across the na- tion. KTO also provided useful and living information on accommodations and tour guides and proposed  a healthy and recommended direction for domestic tourism culture, developed together with travelers.  These included: fair tourism, global tourist etiquettes and the Smile and Hospitality Campaign.   At KTO, fair tourism was newly selected as an element for a modern tourism culture, that is both eco-friendly  and joined by local residents. The fair tourism familiarization tour was performed in Ilwon, Jongno District in No- vember 2011. As part of this event, fair tourism content was discovered, developed and promoted in conjunction  with the Jongno District Office. The tour was attended by 24 participants, including ambassadors to Korea (from  Israel and 12 other countries) and it also made headlines 25 times at major media outlets such as JTBC TV and  The Korea Herald. This served as an opportunity for both media and the public to pay special attention to fair  tourism as a new type of tourism culture.  Korea World Travel Fair Korea Tourism Supporters Our Korea Tourism Supporters organization is open to every Korean who is interested in and willing to partici- pate in the sustainable development of local tourism. These supporters directly take part in local tourism events  for monitoring so that high-quality tourism services are provided. Initiated in 2010, the organization has a total of  4,423 supporters in operation at 46 local governments including 380 businessmen and 3,970 ordinary citizens. In  2011, these supporters visited six local areas of Muju, Yongin, Cheongsong, Hapcheon, Sancheong and Gwangju  to perform monitoring and hold events in relation to local governments while assisting events visited by private  sector supporters and holding cultural events.  Every local government invitation event was attended by 30  foreign residents in Korea, including diplomatic delegates and overseas NTO (National Tourism Organization)  employees. These opinion leaders served to maximize the promotion of domestic tourist destinations and are  expected to contribute to revitalizing local tourism in the upcoming years.   Farmers Market for Special Products from Areas Damaged by Foot and Mouth Disease   The Grand Festival for Local Special Products from Areas Damaged by Foot and Mouth Disease was held in  Cheonggye Square in February of this year in order to stimulate the local economy and tourism in agricultural  areas that are suffering economic woes due to foot and mouth disease. Nine cities and provinces, 30 municipali- ties and counties and 56 producers organizations participated and operated exhibition booths to promote local  tourism for their region. The festival served to introduce the unique advantages of locally produced agricultural  and special products and the excellent quality of domestic agricultural products. This, in turn promoted the sale  of local products from areas hit by foot and mouth disease. Some 30,000 Koreans and tourists attended the fes- tival, which offered a venue for warm-hearted sharing Farmer damaged by foot and mouth disease Barrier-Free Travel  I. Responsible Operation  II.

Reaching Partners & Community 2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 042 043 Significance of Green Tourism Green Tourism PR Campaign Promotion of Green Tourism   Green tourism combines the conventional eco-friendly tourism that aims to minimize environmental impact with  low carbon green growth as a strategy to proactively address climate change caused by global warming. Its  fundamental objective is to reduce 1.37 billion tons of CO2 emissions generated from tourism across the globe.  In a nutshell, green tourism constitutes a voluntary program to attain such goals as reducing CO2 emissions to  zero through hiking tours, enjoying fresh local food and saving energy resources at tourist destinations. KTOs endeavors to promote green tourism were initiated with the creation of the Green Tourism website in  2010, followed by the production of a PR video and brochures covering the necessity for green tourism, action  guidelines for citizens willing to practice green tourism and related smartphone applications, in addition to green  tourism campaigns. The green tourism website and Naver blog account were created while the green tourism  pledge was signed (by 1,335 people), carbon widgets were installed (by 58,284 people) and an action plan event  was held (attended by 4,978 people). KTOs own smartphone application Dubalo that offers green tourism infor- mation was developed and distributed and an event was held to encourage users to download it. As part of our  efforts to use media and exhibitions & expos for PR purposes, programs were developed, feature stories were  run and eco tourism was introduced through KBS, the Joonang Daily and Euronews. In addition, we attended  the Green Growth Expo and waged a green tourism PR campaign at Seoul and Yongsan Station. These initiatives  produced KRW 4.08 billion in advertising effects, from the investment of KRW 150 million. At the end of 2011, a  two-part special episode on eco tourism, that covered overseas eco tourism stories and Koreas potential for  eco tourism development, was developed through the Environment Special, the representative environmental  documentary program of KBS and broadcast in February 2012.  Riverside Travel Products Cultural & Eco Trails with Stories Ten Korean Eco Tourism Models Tour Around Koreas Beautiful Rivers represents KTOs riverside tour program that aims to further familiar- ize Koreas beautiful rivers to travelers. This tour product attracted 3,702 tourists for four months and allowed  them to enjoy ten top-notch historical tourist attractions near the four rivers of the River Han, the River Geum,  the River Youngsan and the River Nakdong.  Moreover, Hiking along Riverside Trails was developed as a hiking  course program that aligns the four largest rivers in Korea with surrounding tourist spots. This allowed travelers  to take a look at the history of Korea where rivers were historically at the center of developing villages, as well  as look back on the cultural exchanges made and see the flourishing life and culture enjoyed. In addition, Green  Bike Train was created to enable bikers to carry their bikes on the dedicated bike train and explore surrounding  tourist resources. Developed with an aim to produce synergistic effects by aligning local festivals with bike com- petitions, this tour package attracted 2,066 travelers between September and November. At KTO, Cultural & Eco Trails with Stories have been chosen each year since 2009 to encourage domestic and  overseas in-bound travelers to enjoy beautiful natural landscapes and to experience local history and culture  while taking a walk conveniently. In 2011, ten trails including: Seoul Castle Train, River Geum Estuary Trail, River  Seomjin Trail and Dumulmeori Trail were selected under the four themes of Periodical History Trails, Sam- namdaero Old Trails, Scenic Riverside Trails and Mediation Trails with Love and Romance. There are a total of  29 designated trails nationwide as of the end of 2011 and the number will be increased continuously. To expand the basis for green tourism and stimulate green tourism, an eco-tourism consulting group, consist- ing of experts in ecology, environment and tourism is in operation. The aim is to develop ten model project sites,  selected jointly by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Ministry of Environment and promote  Korean eco-tourism, into a world-class one, while focusing on unique and differentiated eco-tourism attractions  by taking advantage of Koreas distinct ecological resources.  The consulting group serves as a coordinator, pre- senting reasonable directions from the initial planning stage and preventing project-related redundancy among  local governments. As of 2011, basic plans were completed for these ten project sites and design work or con- struction is underway. Development of Green Tourism Products s Beautiful Rivers     Eco tourism program      Details of eco tourism projects  Ten Eco Tourism Model Project Sites Slow City   At KTO, project management and PR activities are underway to turn Slow City into a tourism resource. Slow  City represents an initiative to improve the quality of life for local residents by delivering a rich life based on the  indigenous natural environment and traditions. It seeks to achieve the sort of globalization where local areas  are globalized through the protection of the natural eco-system, the preservation of traditional cultures, the in- heritance of local special products & handicrafts and the voluntary initiatives led by local residents. As of 2011, a  total of ten Slow Cities were designated and the slow life concept is gaining increasing attention. KTO is enhanc- ing the value of Slow City as a domestic and global brand by supporting and promoting wide-ranging experience  programs that combine both slow life and tourism.

Creating Customer Value V. Reaching Partners & Community 2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 044 045 Competitive Tourism Development of Emerging Markets  PR Activities through the Use of Multi-channel Media Local PR Marketing PR to Develop New Markets KTO uses modern media such as social network services, mobile applications and video websites as well as con- ventional media and printed PR materials, in order to promote Korea as an attractive tourist destination. We also  take localized PR marketing initiatives that include the invitation of local consumers in overseas markets, the use  of local networks and the participation in local events and use of major local media outlets to promote Korean tour- ism. In addition, sustained marketing activities are underway to introduce the charm of Korea as a tourist hotspot  in mid-sized cities in countries where KTOs overseas offices are located. Such marketing initiatives also extend  into the regions where KTO is not present and where emerging markets point to a huge growth potential.   We undertake localized marketing activities by choosing specific modern media favored by respective countries.  In Japan, where the mobile phone penetration is particularly high, practical tour content specialized for the mobile  environment was developed and real-time mobile events were held to achieve 90.3% in content satisfaction. In  China, where global social network services are not available, a KTO account was created on Weibo, the Chinese  version of Twitter, and FIT-dedicated content was uploaded in order to hold power Weibo invitation events and to  disseminate tour information. In English-speaking regions, VisitKorea, our mobile application that provides tour- ism information in English, was launched and we used Facebook to promote in-bound tour products covering Hal- lyu trends and winter travel products. Specifically, VisitKorea was ranked No. 1 in the number of downloads in the  free travel category at a U.S. app store and our Facebook account in English recorded 70,000 fans.    We also use conventional media marketing that reflects consumer needs in each market. This provides par- ticipatory and story-telling content that come with clear themes and is differentiated based on the analysis of  country-specific needs. Moreover, the customized online website (www.visitkorea.or.kr) was developed through  the analysis of online trends, consumer needs and overseas market trends in order to produce high-quality Hal- lyu content, introduce K-pop music and videos and strengthen content customized for respective markets. This,  in turn, resulted in 670,000 daily visits to the KTO website in foreign languages. KTO promoted Korea as a tourist destination through the first-ever Hallyu event in Europe and through consumer  events boosted by K-pop fever in Southeast Asia and Dongdaemun fashion shows in Japan. In-bound shopping  tour products were promoted through E-mart stores located in China and joint marketing initiatives were taken  with the established networks of well-known Korean companies with global reaches such as Samsung, Korean Air  Lines and LG. This generated synergistic effects and disseminated Koreas image as a favored tourist destination  through local networks. Specifically, the first Hallyu event and K-pop concert was held successfully in Europe pro- duced KRW 2.7 billion in advertising revenue while the Malaysian version of Superstar K, a Korean talent show TV  program, that was co-produced with local media, also generated KRW 7.4 billion in advertising revenue. Moreover,  major local media outlets were invited to cover and promote the Korean tourism market, which produced PR ef- fects valued at KRW 155.5 billion in China, KRW 46.5 billion in Japan, KRW 14.6 billion in Southeast Asia and KRW  14.9 billion in the Americas and Europe. KTO also attended a total of 64 expos held in China, Southeast Asia, the  Based on the 26 overseas offices concentrated in large cities in 17 countries, we were well aware of the limited  capability in attracting in-bound travelers and the need to develop new markets. This prompted us to establish  five new overseas offices in two countries so that we could take advantage of the Hallyu trends in exploring new  market potential. To this end, PR marketing activities were launched in Chengdu, Wuhan, Xian, Nanjing and  Harbin in order to tap inland cities, which are the emerging new stronghold cities in China. Briefing sessions for  local companies and consumer events were held and special commercials were produced to promote in-bound  travel products, while the familiarization tour to foster professionals on Korean tourism for working-level travel  agency employees was conducted and B2B events in conjunction with Korean companies were held. Moreover,  special charter plan tour products for the secondary market were launched, which attracted 13,116 travelers in  2011 alone. In addition to such PR marketing targeted at inland Chinese cities, overseas offices were newly es- tablished in Chengdu, Wuhan to expand the global presence of KTO.  & story-telling content with clear themes  Large-scale crises that hit our major markets in 2011, such as the devastating earthquake in Japan, the growing  concerns over the safety of the Korean peninsula in China, anti-Korean sentiment in Taiwan, and the great flood  in Thailand, caused a market slowdown and posed serious challenges to the Korean tourism market. In spite of  this, KTO continued to take selective and phased-in marketing initiatives through its in-house risk management  system and was able to record 9.8 million in the number of in-bound tourists. This exceeded its original target,  and KTO went on to post $ 12.3 billion in tourism revenues, the largest-ever in its history.

Reaching Partners & Community 2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 046 047 Addressing Chinese Concerns Over the Safety of Travelling to Korea Great Flood in Thailand and the Anti-Korean Sentiment in Taiwan  The extensive coverage by the Chinese media of the artillery attack launched by North Korea on the South Korean  island of Yeonpyeong in November of 2010 and the possible impact of radioactive materials leaking onto the Korea  peninsula from the nuclear power plant in Fukushima in March of 2011, caused many Chinese traveler groups to  cancel their reservations for Korean vacation packages. This led to a dramatic drop in the number of Chinese tour- ists in Korea. KTO responded by holding year-round briefing sessions to reassure Chinese local travel agencies and  media outlets of the safety of travelling to Korea, while increasing the number of media professionals it invited by  190% from the same period of the previous year and concentrating its media PR activities to fall in the first half of the  year. Moreover, discussion meetings with Chinese correspondents stationed in Korea were held to encourage these  correspondents to offer more coverage concerning the safety of Korean travel so that they could eliminate Chinese  concerns over the Korean tourism market. This led to a 25.3% increase in the number of Chinese tourists in Korea. The great flood that hit Thailand in August 2011 slowed down the nations economic growth and reduced demands  for overseas travel. This in turn, brought a sharp decline in the number of Thais visiting Korea. KTO responded  to this by launching the KOREA  THAI campaign, which included advertisements, donations, volunteer work  and relief aid. The Rush to Korea campaign was also waged to stimulate demands for Korean tourism and this  contributed to a 25.8% growth in the number of Thai travelers to Korea. Meanwhile, the disqualification of a Taiwan  Taekwondo athlete at the Asian Games held in Guangzhou, China, ignited a widespread anti-Korean sentiment  in Taiwan. This accounted for a 17.9% drop in Taiwanese travelers to Korea.

We identify their respective market share & characteristics and potential product materials in order to  undertake marketing activities with an emphasis on selected target products in each market. Promotion to Attract FITs Development of SIT Tour Products Customized for Respective Markets KTOs commitment to inducing FITs (Free Individual Travelers) is based on the characteristics of their higher ex- penditures and satisfaction than group tourists and such environmental changes as the spread of smartphones,  SNS and other new media, as well as the growing number of low-cost airliners. In Japan, we provided diverse  content covering Hallyu, local spots and food & culture to encourage more Japanese to revisit Korea. Meanwhile,  we strengthened promotional activities through the channels of wide-ranging media and included Japanese ce- lebrities and famous DJs in such activities. In China, where the idea of free traveling is relatively rare, marketing  initiatives were geared around Xing Er, our free-travel brand, in accordance with the streamlined process for in- dividual visas. As a result, a total of 56,227 products were sold, which set a new sales record for a single tourism  product. In the Americas and Europe, our Facebook account and smartphone applications became available in  seven languages including English, French and German, in order to promote Korea as a favored tourist destina- tion. Moreover, our marketing endeavors aligned with such world-renowned online travel agencies as Expedia  and Lastminute.com attracted 29,394 travelers to Korea. In response to diversifying the preferences of overseas tourists and an increasing the number of FITs, KTO was fully  dedicated to developing and promoting SIT (Special Interest Tourism) products customized for respective markets. In  Japan, products targeting the Hallyu mania, including fan meetings with Hallyu celebrities, attracted 24,601 tourists.  Meanwhile, Korean cuisine and lifestyle products, such as Makgeoli (Korean raw rice wine) and Tteokbokki (Korean  stir-fried rice cake) along with medical tourism products appealed to 5,871 travelers.  In China, 10,595 tourists from  the Baojian Group (under the incentive tour program) and 25,489 tourists from youth and senior exchange organiza- tions visited Korea. In Asia, PR marketing for ski tour packages attracted 35,538 winter tourists. In the Americas and  Europe, we targeted special-purpose organizations affiliated with Taekwondo, the hearing-impaired and education  as well as organizations in special relationships with Korea that consist of Korean adoptees or Korean War veterans.  This resulted in an additional 1,275 travelers to Korea. Our marketing activities for Hallyu mania in France and the U.S.  and the development of medical tourism products in Russia appealed to 191 and 10,000 tourists respectively. Specifi- cally, our Hallyu marketing in Paris ignited the boom for K-POP in the Americas & Europe and the Oceania. Addressing Japans Devastating Earthquake In March 2011, Japan, the largest consumer of Koreas tourism market, was hit by a devastating earthquake that  left 20,000 dead and caused an economic slow down in the Japanese domestic market. This inevitably resulted  in a dramatic decline in the number of Japanese in-bound tourists. Immediately after the earthquake, KTO en- sured the safety of Korean travelers in Japan and their early departure to Korea was supported in cooperation  with the legation to Japan, airlines and travel agencies. In addition, KTO ran advertisements in the Daily Yomiuri  to soothe the minds of the Japanese people suffering from the disaster and our CEO visited Japan with the Min- ister of Culture, Tourism and Sports to deliver compensation funds worth KRW 300 million. Other proactive mar- keting activities to address the crisis included the assistance for festivals held to revive the northeastern region  of Japan and the hosting of the Night of Korea-Japan Friendship in Sendai. Moreover, the decision was made to  open a Korea-Japan tourism exchange center in Sendai to promote friendship between the two countries and  K-pop concerts were held in order to recover demands for Korean tourist attractions in Japan. These various  endeavors contributed to a turnaround of an 8.8% increase in Japans demand for Korean tourist destinations.

As a result, the number of Taiwanese travelers to Korea rose by 31.3%.  I.    II.     III.    IV.

Specifically, stronger synergistic effects are being created in the tourism  industry through tourism industry-related services offered in cooperation with governmental agencies and  through close collaboration with local governments through our regional promotional offices. Facilitation of Domestic Tourism Discovery and Promotion of Theme-specific Local Tourism Materials Expansion of Experience Tours  To further facilitate traditional markets, which was initially started to help recover the livelihood of ordinary  people, KTO promoted traditional market tourism products, while running year-round programs to discover lo- cal tourism materials. This led to a 23% year-on-year increase in the number of traditional market travelers in  12 areas and a 91% year-on-year increase in the number of online page views. In addition, PR activities were  undertaken based on large-scale local events. These included the promotional support for the Visit Daegu Year  2011, promotion of the Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea and its commercialization and PR initiatives in celebration of  the successful bidding of Pyeongchang in hosting the Winter Olympics in 2018. As part of our efforts to stimu- late local tourism through the initiatives taken by citizens, interactive marketing programs that used the three  channels of the KTO tourism information site, Naver blogs and SNS, were launched and proactive online com- munication activities were undertaken. Thanks to such endeavors, KTOs travel twitter account was chosen as  the Number 1 account with the largest impact among 600 public organization twitter accounts. Also, we were  honored with the Social Media Grand Prix in the Public Enterprise Sector at the Korean Internet Communica- tion Awards in December of last year. Customized Story-telling Tourism With the help of the analysis of domestic tourism trends and consumer needs, we shifted the focus of our tour- ism content from delivering facts on tourism destinations, to providing customized story-telling content and  guidance-driven informational services. Specifically, we strove to take the customers perspective in creating  travel demands by selecting top tourist attractions through online voting and events on 20 candidate attractions  selected by tourism experts and through the expansion of related content through on-the-spot media coverage.   The expansion of story-telling content through internet, SNS and mobile applications produced 3,460 informa- tional postings on travel information websites, 3,769 postings on Twitter and 682 pieces of information through  our Guseok Guseok application. We also assisted local governments in improving on customized travel informa- tion websites by disseminating GPS-based electronic tourist maps.  Such endeavors helped us increase the accumulated number of visits to our KTO tour blog by 614% from the  previous year to 2 million. Moreover, our Guseok Guseok app was downloaded 160,000 times (Dec. 2011) and  we were honored with the top award in the app store tourism sector at the Mobile App Awards.  To locate materials for experience tours that revitalize the local economy in agricultural and fishing villages and  to enhance the tourism expertise of those operating experience villages, we cooperated with local governments  in improving the quality of products offered by experience tour villages and undertook systemized marketing  activities through our integrated brand of Green Nara Giljabi (meaning guidance to a greener nation in Korea).  This led to a continued increase in the number of visitors to the 102 experience tour villages to 22,840 in 2011  as well as growth in the number of ecological experience tourists and farming households income through the  sale of local special products.       In addition, surveys were conducted to identify the status and preferences of school trips and it was discovered  that South Jeolla areas were less popular than other regions as a destination. We responded by developing at- tractive tour courses for school trips, creating and distributing informational books and conducting familiariza- tion tours. This resulted in 3,093 students from 18 metropolitan area schools and KTX-aligned areas visiting the  province. Students were introduced to new tourist sites and the local economy was promoted accordingly.

This is also a high value-added industry that is organically aligned with accommodation, transportation, tourism,  trade and distribution. In 2011, KTO undertook intensive support projects to foster the MICE industry. This served  as a driving engine to expedite the goal of inducing 10 million in-bound travelers  International Conferences Held by Major Countries  in 2011   Laying the Basis for Stronger Competitive Edge of the MICE Industry (Unit: Number of people)   2011 2010 Endeavors to Invite and Hold MICE Events Attracting Baojian Group Employees as Incentive Tourists The dual operational system between the Main Office and overseas offices enhance the efficiency of our market- ing channels and boosted our endeavors to invite and hold MICE events in 2011. Briefing sessions and consult- ing services to this end also helped host organizations with capacity building. In addition, our support system to  provide customized assistance services for respective MICE event types (including convention meetings, incen- tive groups and corporate meetings) improved to the point that we were able to post a 92% success rate in the  invitation of international conferences. This rate remained above the 90% mark for three consecutive years.  In 2011, the Korean MICE industry was ranked No. 6 in the world, in terms of hosting international conferences.  This can be attributed to the proactive initiatives taken by KTO to stimulate the industry. In spite of the stagnant  growth in the number of international conferences caused by the global economic downturn, we were able to  improve by two steps from the previous year, which can be attributed to the concerted efforts made by the cen- tral and local governments and other MICE-related organizations. The organically established cooperation between KTO and related organizations (including the central and local  Korean governments) led to the attraction of group tourists from the Baojian Group as an incentive tourism organiza- tion to Korea, between the dates of September 13th to September 28, 2011. This success improved the awareness of  the general public concerning the economic benefits produced by incentive tours and built a nation-wide consensus  regarding the need to improve our readiness in inducing more in-bound travelers. Specifically, the visit of 10,595 tour- ists, the largest-ever incentive group coming from a single country, generated KRW 28.6 billion in direct consumption  expenditures, KRW 51.6 billion in induced production and 4.59 points in satisfaction (on a scale from one to five).

This, in turn, implies that the medical tourism industry is poised to show continuous  growth in the upcoming years. In responding to the Korean governmental policy to promote medical tourism as  a new engine of growth, KTO is fully committed to revitalizing the medical tourism industry as it generates tre- mendous economic rippling effects and serves as a significant contributor in job creation  (Unit: Number of people)   Promotion of oriental medicine in Japan  Laying the Foundation for Medical Tourism Laying the Foundation for Medical Tourism Promotional Marketing in Overseas Markets Training to foster a professional medical tourism workforce With an aim to achieve 300,000 in the number of in-bound medical tourists by 2015, KTO is striving to lay the foun- dation for domestic medial tourism, build cooperative networks with related organizations, launch promotional  marketing initiatives for overseas target markets and foster a professional medical tourism workforce. We are fully  committed to attaining the mid/long-term goal of making Korea into Asias top five medical tourism powerhouses. To discover outstanding medical tour products and provide systemized assistance, KTO held the first medical  tourism product contest in 2011. Meanwhile, it expanded joint projects with medical institutions, medical tour- ism developers, related governmental agencies and local governments, while establishing medical tour clusters  differentiated for unique local features. The medical tourism information centers located in Seoul and Incheon  were expanded to cover Busan in March 2011, which offers accurate information and improved accessibility for  in-bound medical tourists At KTO, target-specific and differentiated overseas marketing activities were undertaken in consideration of  preferred medical specialties and effective marketing channels in each market. Specifically, our intensive PR  initiatives in oriental medicine for Japanese travelers during the first half of 2011 resulted in more than twice as  many Japanese tourists coming to Korea for oriental medical services. In addition, our U-health center opened  in Vladivostok, Russia in 2011 to offer more convenient access for potential overseas medical tourists interested  in Korean medical tourism. In the emerging markets of Indonesia, Vietnam and Mongolia, sharing-oriented  marketing initiatives were proactively taken. This included inviting patients who lacked access to appropriate  medical services due to technological or economic reasons, to Korea to provide effective medical services. This  promoted the excellent quality of Korean medical services and touched their heart through humanitarianism. As demand for medical tourism professionals is expected to increase with the growth in the medical tourism in- dustry, KTO offered various training courses covering medical tourism coordination, marketing and international  nursing. In 2011, 200 such professionals completed their training to serve medical tourists. Specifically, special- ized trainers, who have cultural knowledge and language skills, assisted migrant women from multi-cultural  families, in landing suitable jobs. 2011 122,297 2010 81,789 2009 60,201 Global  Comparative  Indicator   International  Conferences   Number of  International  Conferences Held Singapore 1 919 U.S.  2 744 Japan 3 598 France 4 557 Belgium 5 553 Korea 6 469 China 16 200 Comprehensive Endeavors to Invite and Host MICE  Events Most-ever in-bound travelers invited to international conferences 2011 202,313 2010 182,091 11.1% Consulting support to invite and host international conferences 2011 62 2010 27 Increased by 230%  Success in inviting international conferences (Unit:%) 2011 92 2010 90 Higher than 90% for three consecutive years   Facilitate the MICE industry and strengthen Koreas national brand through stronger global competitive edge   Make comprehensive endeavors to invite and hold MICE  events  Lay the foundation for stronger competitive edge of the  MICE industry  2011 Korea Tourism Organization Sustainability Report Management Principle KTO is taking the lead in delivering a great workplace by ensuring fairness in recruitment, creating  a mutually beneficial labor-management culture and offering differentiated benefit schemes.

Moreover, wide-ranging strategic tasks are under- taken at KTO to provide benefits to employees and create a family-friendly corporate culture so that our employ- ees may strike the right work/life balance. Open recruitment processes and respect for human rights assist our  endeavors in creating a discrimination-free corporate culture and labor regulations set by domestic and inter- national labor organizations are strictly observed. KTO will be fully committed to becoming a Great Work Place  where all employees enjoy a sense of pride and contentment, by delivering a healthy and safe work environment,  along with wide-ranging benefits. The employee quota at KTO stood at 544 as of December of 2011.  With 23 employees newly hired in 2011, there  are 480 employees (including five executives at the Main Office, 271 at domestic offices and 72 at overseas of- fices). This adds up to a total of 823. Regular employees and contract employees account for 614 and 209 re- spectively. While unionized workers, subject to collective agreements, comprise 469 or 57% of the total. General  labor conditions are applied to all employees in accordance with Article 4 of the Collective Agreement. In 2011,  two employees resigned due to retirement age, four resigned voluntarily and 11 others resigned for personal  reasons. At KTO, unionized employees are entitled to undertake legitimate and free union activities according to  the labors three primary rights stipulated in the Constitution and the Collective Agreement and our top man- agement discusses major issues with the labor union through the horizontal communication channel of the  Labor Management Council. At KTO, we provide equal opportunities to applicants through an open recruitment process. The participation of  outside experts and simulation interviews promote the fairness of such processes and newly hired employees  are not discriminated against on the grounds of gender, nationality, religion or social status. The average wage  level per employee is KRW 66.89 million and employees in the same job level are treated equally in wage level  and benefits regardless of gender difference. Non-regular workers are 209 or 25% of the total and are also  equally treated in welfare and benefits with their regular counterparts. In recruiting new regular employees in  2011, social equality was considered as a key factor: 3 science and engineering majors as well as 2 local talents  were hired. In addition, our efforts to hire more high school graduates increased the ratio of high school gradu- ates to 11.7% of the total as of the end of 2011. KTO is in full compliance with labor regulations under the Labor  Standards Act. As a public enterprise, it prohibits its employees from any political activities or support. Moreover,  child labor or forced labor is strictly banned at KTO in accordance with the UN Global Compact principles and  Our HR system aims to strike the right gender balance by developing female recruitment targets and nurtur- ing female leaders. As of the end of 2011, the female workforce accounted for 35.2% of the total or 214, which  increased by 1.9% from 2010. This makes KTO one of the top-performing enterprises in recruiting and fostering  a female workforce. In 2011, female employees accounted for 17 or 74% of the total new recruits. The number of  female employees in team leader positions and above also continues to rise from 6 in 2010 to 8 in 2011.  In 2011, KTO created more jobs for the national economy by hiring 58 youth interns, 105 student trainees for  overseas operations, and 15 work-study program participants.

Creating Customer Value  2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 056 057 Minimum Notification Period Regarding Important Issues The secretary-general of the labor union and the head of the Human Resources Team serve as members of  the Grievance Committee in accordance with the grievance resolution guidelines developed in 2004. Grievances  submitted through various channels of e-mail, phone calls or interviews are consulted within 24 hours after the  admission and the employee in concerned is notified of the outcome within 10 days. Those issues not addressed  within this timeframe are considered unacceptable or non-eligible for institutional improvement and are pro- posed as agenda items to the Labor Management Council for further deliberation. Our grievance resolution rate  remains over 90% and new provisions were added in 2012 for the improved treatment of non-regular employees  and the confidentiality principle for those who raise grievances. At KTO, feedback systems were established to promote horizontal communication with the Labor Management  Council and to measure employee satisfaction with labor relations. Surveys are performed to measure employee  satisfaction over the entire spectrum of labor relations covering mutual trust, engagement and performance.  The survey results improved by more than 3% to 3.5 points from 2009. Article 23 of the Collective Agreement (Notification obligation) stipulates that important issues between labor and  management should be handled by notifying each other in written document format. When disciplinary measures are  taken against any unionized member, a written notification is made at least five days prior while any dismissal notice  concerning unionized employees is given at least 45 days (Legally-permissible criteria is 30 days) prior to the dismissal. Grievance Resolution System  Creation of an Open Corporate Culture  Promotion of Open Communication Channels  Information Sharing System Establishment of Multi-faceted Communication Systems   Facilitation of Bottom-up Communication Under the internal management policies of creativity, fairness and open communication, real-time information  sharing and multi-faceted communication systems are up and running in order to ensure open communication  at KTO. Specifically, bottom-up communication channels have expanded and the Corporate Culture Council and  Junior Board (attended by employee representatives) were in operation in 2011, in order to expand a new corpo- rate culture (V-KTO) based on open communication.   At KTO, our management information systems are differentiated in the way information is shared through the  KTO-Net, the Smart KTO, SMS and TMS. Meanwhile, the Labor Management Council, employee briefings and  the CEO Kinship Management serves as means for diversified real-time information sharing and consensus  building between labor and management. In addition, employee briefings were held on major issues including  performance-based salary schemes, organizational relocation, corporate advancement and management strat- egies, in order to solicit the various opinions of employees and reflect them in business operation. Our communication systems, categorized into online and offline, are both vertically and horizontally aligned to  deliver the perfect environment to facilitate internal communication. The multi-faceted communication systems  enabled us to successfully build consensus and take action to expand the organization by hiring more employ- ees in order to strengthen our core capacity. Open communication also allowed us to remain dispute-free for the  past 37 years since the KTO labor union was launched. Another key pillar that supports our multi-faceted communication channels is the facilitation of bottom-up  communication for open communication and corporate culture. The exiting communication channels of the  Grievance Committee and the sexual harassment counseling system were further complemented by new chan- nels including: the Corporate Culture Council, the V-KTO Post Box, KTO Talk Talk, reverse mentoring for new  hires, the Junior Board and the Young Gun Meeting that were established in 2011 to solicit diverse opinions from  employees. These channels were used to discuss new directions for our corporate culture, receive requests for  public briefings on major issues, IT training for manager-level employees and take many other initiatives.

Therefore, we provide fair opportunities to our employees and operate diverse pro- grams to assist employee capacity building and the development of human resources. This creates a workplace  genuinely favored by employees.  The ideal KTO employee has a challenging and innovative spirit, global professionalism and a sense of self- initiated responsibility. KTO is taking the lead in delivering a pleasant work life to its employees by helping  them strike a fair work/life balance through such initiatives as the establishment of a family-friendly corporate  culture and the creation of an exciting workplace. We are also in full compliance with the labor regulations of  domestic and international labor organizations. *The calculation method was changed from session-based calculation  into per capita-based calculations in 2011. This resulted in discrepan- cies in average training hours between this report and the previous  report. The current per capita-based calculation method will be used  in future reports. KTO is committed to the sustained development and improvement of employee capacity and the fairness of HR  management, including a corporate culture that enables a work/life balance. This is why KTO has developed and  implemented employee capacity building plans and human resource development plans in consideration of the  capacity required at KTO. Specifically, our employee capacity building system ensures that education and training  plans are developed, their outcomes are managed and that the feedback is integrated in planning again. In addi- tion, the analysis of organizational and individual needs in each sector helps us identify possible improvements.  This process forms the basis for developing strategies that use the 9 Block Model to manage key talented indi- viduals. Moreover, 13 employees were sent to take MBA and policy and local expert courses at domestic and over- seas universities, including Washington University. Other education programs specialized for the business at KTO  include: the You Can Be a KTO Expert program, correspondence education, and mobile education programs. At KTO, job duties are categorized into 20 job classes in a total of five areas and annual Individual Development  Plans (IDP) are developed in accordance with standard learning paths in each job class, based on one-on-one  coaching. Moreover, our education courses are operated in a systemized manner with an aim to enable each  employee to grow into an expert in one specialty area, through mandatory courses by job class and detailed  courses by capacity level. These are further complemented with diverse education programs that reflect the lat- est learning trends, such as alignment with mobile training as well as conventional online/offline programs that  improve effectiveness and employee satisfaction. In 2011, the total education and training hours at KTO amount- ed to 18,131 hours or 36hours* per employee. We will continue to provide wide-ranging education opportunities  to employees and enhance the quality of these programs to satisfy organizational needs.

Moreover, the appropriateness of evaluation indicators was  enhanced through the improvement of performance indicators in consideration of strategic and organizational  changes. The composition of external evaluation committee members was also improved and the percentage  make-up of evaluation items was adjusted to further advance the performance evaluation methodology. This, in  turn, is aligned with the overall HR system to motivate employees to improve on performance.   Under our promotion system, high-performers are given precedence, so that those with outstanding evaluation out- comes come first in assignments and promotions and the 2+1 scheme used for the open competition for overseas  expatriates ensures that top-notch expatriate employees may benefit from extended residences. Moreover, the perfor- mance-based salary scheme with stronger alignments between performance and remuneration allows performance  pay differences for executives to more than double their base salaries to differ by 2%. This inspires employees to improve. V-KTO (that was defined in 2009) represents our unique corporate culture slogan and the Corporate Culture Council  attended by labor and management was launched in 2011, in order to operate a variety of programs to promote our  corporate culture. Specifically, the labor-management joint cooperation declaration was announced in June 2011 and  the V-KTO 4H program was undertaken to disseminate family-friendly management. Such endeavors allowed us to  be chosen as a company with excellent performance in family-friendly management in 2011 and to be awarded with  the Prime Ministers Commendation that recognized these endeavors in celebration of the Family Month in 2012.  programs covering housing and scholarship loans, guest houses, health check-ups and collective accident insur- ance policies. These benefits are provided equally to both full-time and part-time employees. Previously, partial  differences were existent in the way our welfare and benefits programs were provided by employment type but the  revision of relevant systems on July 1, 2012 guaranteed that every KTO employee was eligible for equal benefits. Our Industrial Safety and Health Committee attended by an equal number of members from both the labor and  management meets quarterly and is operated in accordance with Article 76-79 of the Collective Agreement. The  NeoDINE Medical Institute and Korea Technology Safety Co., Ltd. were selected as a consigned health manager  and a consigned safety manager respectively from July of 2010, in order to enhance expertise and efficiency. Ev- ery year, all KTO employees and their spouses receive comprehensive medical check-ups and musculoskeletal  risk factors are inspected every three years. This goes to demonstrate our sustained commitment to the preven- tion of industrial safety accidents and injuries. Moreover, our employees and their family members are collec- tively insured against accidents each year. Employees are entitled to paid sick leave (up to one month) and paid  leave of absences (up to one year) if they are in need of medical treatment, as well as free leaves of absences (up  to one year) if their family members are in need of care, in accordance with Article 30 of the Collective Agree- ment and Article 23-2 and Article 45 of the Rules of Employment.  As a leader in operating retirement fund systems, KTOs pension system is reasonably operated. Our pension  system guarantees a stable retirement life for employees in the aging Korean society and is operated in accor- dance with legal standards. At KTO, the Joint Labor-Management Retirement Pension Steering Committee is in  operation and the external deposit amounted to 90% in 2011. As of 2011, every KTO employee was a member of  either the in-house pension fund or the national pension system. The innovative reorganization of the workforce at KTO aimed to pursue sustained change. Team leaders were ap- pointed through open competitions that valued job duty execution and performance above previous job levels. Also,  external experts are being hired more proactively. In addition, overseas expatriates are subject to interim evaluations  and overseas offices were reorganized with a stronger emphasis on local on-site operations to explore new markets.

The present KTO labor union (which is the majority labor union)  serves as the employee representative at the committee. To assist future retirees in pursuing continuous self-development and prepare for uncertainties in their retirement lives,  we offer systemized support, from career diagnosis & development and counseling that helps design a new retirement  life, to career move support programs covering outplacement, business start-ups and certifications. In addition, we cover  actual expenses spent on education for career moves, such as government-certified qualification training, outplacement  & business start-up training and the purchase of relevant training materials and books of a pre-determined limit.   At KTO, we pursue a family-like corporate culture that is joined by everyone with contentment. A specific portion  of our net income before taxes is invested in the welfare business in order to enhance employee welfare and our  selective benefits scheme has been in operation since 2002. Our multi-dimensional endeavors to create a great  work place helped raise employee job satisfaction from 3.72 to 3.85 points on a scale of one to five. Moreover, we  have been chosen as the best performer for four consecutive years since 2008 by the Great Work Place Awards  held by Hankyung Magazine and were honored with the Grand Prix at the awards in 2011.

Therefore, mutually beneficial development with stakeholders, through cooperative relation- ships, is directly related with the enhancement of the corporate values at KTO. We classify our customers into  internal and external customers, based on their operational and cooperative relationships we hold and our  frequency of contact with them.  External customers are further categorized into end customers, partners or  suppliers.  KTO recognizes that the true essence of customer satisfaction management is to seek solutions to the issues  raised by customers. By ensuring that their voices are heard, we can more rapidly and accurately respond to  such issues. Therefore, our VOC(Voice of Customer) system aims to manage customer information, statistics  and surveys in an integrated manner. VOCs are submitted through the various channels of: our website, e-mail,  phone calls and letters. In 2011, 2,381 VOCs were submitted and addressed and the online customer complaint  handling time was reduced by three minutes (from the previous year) to 50 minutes. Specifically, VOC channels  that engage customers more closely, such as the Tourism Idea Bank and KTO Monitors, produced two propos- als that were fully adopted and incorporated into our operations. The declaration ceremony for the Practice RIO Year (Observation, Interest and Relationship) was held in Janu- ary 2011 and company-wide extensive efforts were launched for customer satisfaction-driven management.  Customer briefings were held to introduce the customer-driven management philosophy of RIO, while another  ceremony to declare our commitment in attracting 10 million in-bound tourists was held in 2011 to raise the  awareness of the general public. Monthly RIO practice meetings and workshops for executive-level employees  were also held. KTOs organizational structure for customer satisfaction is systematically aligned, with the CEO at the center,  through all the different phases that reach on-site operations. Our Senior Vice President is in charge of cus- tomer satisfaction management as the Corporate Culture Officer and the CS Management Center encourages  the company-wide implementation of CS initiatives.

Creating Customer Value  2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 066 067 Commitment to Improved Tourism Environments  New logo for 1330 TT Call Center Support for Standardized Tourism Guide To provide diverse information on Korean tourist attractions, KTOs 1330 TT Call Center is in operation 24 hours  a day. This tourist information telephone service is available in English, Japanese, and Chinese. It also serves as  a one-stop tour guide that provides tourist interpretation services. Our professional QA team, the regular moni- toring by 1330 supporters, the cross monitoring with Seoul Citys 120 Dasan Foreign Language Call Centers  and customer satisfaction surveys, all ensure that the quality of services is managed in accordance with service  quality management standards. The quality of services offered by 359 KTO Information Centers across the nation was assessed and low- performing centers received service training while 290 employees at top-performing centers were awarded with  incentives. In February 2012, the Tourism Guide Exhibition Hall was remodeled on the 1st basement level of a  KTO office building. The remodeling came in addition to the establishment of a Korean food experience room, a  Hallyu exhibition room and a Hallyu product shop. These facilities all served to help visitors experience Hallyu.  Specifically, 100-day Korean culture experience events such as: wearing Hanboks (traditional Korean clothing),  handicraft experiences and playing traditional Korean games were attended by 15,955 participants. This contrib- uted to enhancing the image of Korean culture and travel 1330 TT Call Center Service Monitoring in 2011(Unit:points)   Operation of Dedicated CS Organizations To raise the awareness of the importance of CS management across the board, 50 team leaders at the Main Of- fice and other offices were designated as Customer Satisfaction Officers. In addition, CSO workshops and execu- tive workshops to practice RIO were held to identify implementation tasks in preparation for public evaluation.  A total of 71 working-level employees were appointed as CS/Integrity Angels, responsible for disseminating CS  guidelines, making improvements and operating the customer management week. Customer Satisfaction Survey Enhancement of Customer Satisfaction Information Disclosure At KTO, customer service levels are assessed to monitor the quality of services. In 2011, such monitoring prac- tices covered all employees, in order to evaluate each individual employees level of customer service and pro- vide feedback to help them improve upon on vulnerable areas. This raised the monitoring score by 0.84points to  86.1 points. Due to a year of extensive endeavors, service at contact points (which was identified as a vulnerable  area the previous year) greatly improved by 14 points to 91.19 points. Moreover, the 2011 customer satisfaction  management manual was developed and distributed throughout the company to offer customized CS train- ing, while KTOs unique CS guidelines were developed and utilized. In addition, our CS management expertise  was introduced to the subsidiary of GKL and joint responses were made to address customer complaints. Such  efforts all demonstrate our commitment to disseminating and expanding CS management. These endeavors  allowed us to maintain our status of excellent (the highest-possible level of customer satisfaction with public  enterprises) for five consecutive years. We also fully established the customer satisfaction evaluation system  through the in-house customer satisfaction survey scheme (KTO-CSI). In 2011, there was no single legal violation that occurred at KTO concerning personal information protection. We  are in full compliance with the Customer Information Protection Act to so that we may maintain trust from our  customers.

To manage service quality, public services (provided by each depart- ment) were divided into 29 categories, while service standards were revised and monitoring was performed to review  compliance with these standards. Consequently, our customer satisfaction management initiatives are undertaken  in consideration of the vision and core values at KTO that are revised to adopt to various business environments.

Our goal is to increase the number of  certified facilities, as well as focus on on-site training to maintain and improve the quality of services so that we may  further enhance the satisfaction of travelers. The legislation of municipal lodging business for overseas travelers in December 2011 was attributed to the  growing needs for alternative lodging facilities to respond to an increasing number of in-bound tourists. With  this, came the introduction of the Korean Stay certification system, a Korean B&B business system, while a  two-way matching system between hosts and guests was developed. As a result, a total of 230 households  were certified and this attracted 727 in-bound traveler stays for four months from October 2011. Our goal is to  increase the number to 400 households in 2012.

Creating Customer Value  2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 068 069 A Day at Hanok(www.hanokstay.or.kr), the website that provides information on staying at Hanoks (traditional Ko- rean housing), was created in order to encourage travelers to experience staying in Hanoks, Koreas unique hous- ing culture and Hanok promotional projects are underway at 250 sites nationwide. Specifically, 30 tour courses  in alignment with the Hanok experience were identified and promoted, while the world wide growing popularity  of Hallyu was used to hold Hanok experience events for overseas travelers. In addition, assistance was offered to  promote and commercialize Hanok experience programs. This led to the initiation of consulting projects on Hanok  management for local governments and the installment of washing facilities for Hanok experience businesses.  Other varied PR and marketing events were waged, including Hanok supporters and experience programs for for- eigners. This resulted in a 26% increase in the number of travelers staying at Hanoks from the previous year. BENIKEA is the acronym for Best Night in Korea and represents a Korean mid/low price tourist hotel fran- chise business launched in 2007. There were 44 BENEKIA hotels as of 2011 and their quality management fol- lows stringent criteria through quality assessments and customer satisfaction surveys in accordance with BSI  standards. Specifically, BENEKIA hotel reservation guide services became available 24 hours a day, 365 days a  year, through smartphone applications and 1330 tour guide call services in 2012. This raised sales generated  through online reservation systems by 44% to KRW 540 million. Our plan is to increase the number of BENEKIA  hotels to 60 by the end of 2012 through various supportive policies for BENEKIA business partners.  interior Facilitation of the Traditional Korean Housing Experience Program Development of the Local Brand of BENEKIA   1st Premium Shops Certification Various projects were launched to facilitate food tourism, as well as to improve readiness to address complaints  regarding food that are often raised by in-bound tourists. A government-wide task force team was created in  October to improve on food tourism services while monitoring was performed on Korean restaurants special- izing in serving in-bound travelers in order to enhance food services and ultimately the satisfaction of in-bound  tourists with food in Korea. Chua Lam, a famous gourmet chef from Great China, was invited in May 2011 to pro- mote Korean food and to develop & distribute menus favored by Chinese travelers, so as to minimize complaints  raised by Chinese travelers. In addition, 200 food streets were selected nationwide and their diverse cultural and  historical stories related to food were introduced in an appealing manner so that representative food streets in  each local area could be promoted as a brand. This paved the foundation for facilitating food tourism. We also  supported the publication of the Korean version of the Michelin Green Guide, a world-renowned tour guidebook,  which promoted Korean tourist attractions and food culture. The 1st Premium Shopping certification scheme was introduced for the first time in Korea in December 2010.  This aimed to bump up our shopping culture a notch higher by upgrading services and emphasizing premium  shops. These premium shops are chosen in accordance with stringent criteria covering product features, shop  services, price services, employee services and additional services. There were 429 certified 1st premium shops  in operation as of 2012 and overseas PR activities were strengthened through on/offline media. We will be  further committed to improving awareness of the certification scheme, its external credibility and post manage- ment as well as shopping tour satisfaction. Our Good Stay designation scheme has been in operation since 2006 in an aim to expand high quality lodging  facilities, support room sales and build cooperative systems with local governments. In 2011, 63 facilities and  2,400 rooms were newly designated as Good Stay, up 22% from the previous year. With this, the total number  of Good Stay facilities and rooms amounted to 345 and 13,000 respectively. In addition, the Good Stay website  (www.goodstay.or.kr) was completely revised to enhance customer accessibility. Good Stay reservations are  available through the partnership established with online lodging reservation websites and their quality is man- aged through the regular monitoring of their operational status and through workshops held for operators and  employees. In 2012, Good Stay facilities were further expanded in conjunction with South Jeolla Province as part  of our support for the Yeosu Expo Korea 2012 and we joined forces with the province in operating and managing  these facilities. The online Good Stay sales and the number of rooms sold amounted to $ 830,000 and 15,483  respectively in 2011. Commitment to Expanding Good Stay Facilities  2011 345 2010 282 2007 118 2009 182 2006 88 2008 164 The Korea Pass (the hybrid-type, pre-paid card specialized in tourism services) was launched in December 2010  in order to provide differentiated conveniences to FITs, whose numbers are ever increasing. With one single  Korean Pass card, a traveler may enjoy special benefits at 7,300 discount franchise stores nationwide. These  benefits can be found in: transportation, tourist attraction admissions, shopping, lodging and other types of fees  related to tour activities.   As part of our efforts in raising awareness for the Korea Pass and in stimulating its application, Korea Pass is  offered at various promotional events for in-bound tour products held at overseas offices, while joint cooperative  projects with external organizations are proactively identified (such as the agreement and joint promotional ini- tiatives with Busan City, Jeju Air, the Korean Railroad Corporation and the Visit Korea Committee). Connections  were also established with 1330 tour guide services to receive inquiries and complaints related to the Korea  Pass as well as to train employees at Korea Pass stores and monitor foreign pass users. Such endeavors assist  us in the continuous quality management of services and in establishing the Korea Pass as a representative  tourism card in Korea.   1st Premium Shop certificate  Shopping guidebook s Satisfaction with Shopping  (On a scale from one to five) 2011 4.12 2010 4.08 2009 4.03 2008 3.93 Korea Pass  Korea Pass    PR leaflets for Korea Grand Sale and Korea Pass       2011 Korea Tourism Organization Sustainability Report Management Principle KTO fully recognizes such social issues as: human rights, poverty, the environment, cultural  marginalization and social discrimination.

To provide policy support for the promotion of the tourism industry, we share governmental policies  and strategies with the Presidential Office, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance and other relevant organizations.  We also hold joint workshops bi-monthly with the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and visit the National  Assembly to propose bills to promote the tourism industry, working continuously to share policy issues with leg- islative organizations. In 2011, a total of ten policy proposals were made by KTO, including the legislation of the  1st Premium Shop certification scheme and training of tour guides. In addition 12 interviews with the KTO CEO  and law-makers were conducted to discuss the reinforcement of KTOs role and secure budget of KTO funds. We assisted the launch of the Korean Tourism Forum in March of last year, which was established in an aim to locate  legal and institutional aspects that could be improved on and to facilitate the tourism industry and generate ways to  further develop the industry. The forum will be committed to stimulating domestic demand through investment in  outstanding local tourism resources and strengthening the competitive edge of the tourism industry. Our goal is to use  this forum as a venue to improve on internal/external environments surrounding the tourism industry more efficiently. Facilitation of local tourism is emerging as a solution to address the economic downturn in local areas caused  by the national economic slowdown and shrinking domestic demand, as well as the breakout of foot and mouth  disease. Therefore, KTO is stimulating local tourism to assist the Korean governments policy to recover the  economic livelihood of ordinary people by attracting more tourists to local areas and helping generate income  in doing so. Specifically, our tour information website, tour blog and twitter events were mobilized to emphasize  the role of traditional markets as a venue where indigenous agricultural products are traded directly between  producers and consumers. Such online PR activities were combined with the activities at the joint e-marketing  fair for local governments held in conjunction with Auction and G Market (online auctioning websites in Korea)  as well as visits to traditional markets in celebration of the New Year.    These online events recorded 12,160 occasions of participation by citizens and the local governmental e-marking  fair generated KRW 200 million in the sales of domestic tourism products, through the selection of outstanding  local governments through votes cast by 2.63 million citizens. In addition, visits to traditional markets in Seo- To respond to the growing needs for KTO experience and expertise in developing tourism resources and stimu- lating the local economy through the diversification of in-bound tourism products, we developed an integrated  consulting system and standard models to undertake differentiated tourism consulting projects that meet specific  local needs. A total of 17 consulting projects with contract amounts worth KRW 3.2 billion were undertaken. This  supported the development of new tourism resources, such as the identification of international events to develop  high-end tourism products for Daejeon and the discovery of representative festivals in Busan in 2011. The amount  of awarded project value per employee also rose by 21% from the previous year. In addition, tourism readiness  diagnosis and consulting was performed on 33 local governments, whose outcomes were reflected in 13 local gov- ernmental projects. In so doing, KTO is determined to propose the best way forward for those working in relation to  the tourism industry and serve as a center for exchanges and cooperation in the tourism industry.  To contribute to the balanced development of the entire nation and the revitalization of the local economy, we  developed organically aligned cooperation systems with local governments, local tourism organizations and  KTOs regional promotional offices to discuss major issues. In 2011, heads of regional promotional offices and  working-level employees met twice a year respectively in order to lay the basis for public-private partnerships,  through the expansion of the function fulfilled by regional promotional offices. In addition, endeavors were made  to strengthen the role and responsibility of these offices as NTOs (National Tourism Organizations) that were ca- pable of undertaking highly localized projects. To this end, four key implementation tasks and 11 detailed imple- mentation guidelines were defined and the cooperation infrastructure among KTO-RTO-local governments was  reinforced. This resulted in securing KRW 550 million for 2012 with cooperative projects among the industry,  governments and academia underway. Between April and September, 369 KTO Information Centers nationwide were assessed for their operational sta- tus. This was the second such inspection made since 2008 and aimed to reflect and improve on issues raised in  the 2008 assessment. This was done in order to establish an assessment system in accordance with operational  guidelines for these Information Centers and standardize their operation while investing KRW 2 billion in remodel- ing these centers (depending on assessment outcomes). This encouraged local governments to grow interested in  the operation of Information Centers. We plan to evaluate center-specific assessment outcomes and their compli- ance with improvement measures as well as expand the service monitoring of Information Centers nationwide.

Under the vision  of creating a tourism ecosystem for shared growth through the promotion of SME suppliers and their indepen- dence, tasks were defined for companies in other industries, tourism companies, travel agencies and local gov- ernments. We also joined forces with SMEs in tapping the duty-free shop business and lodging service market  worth over KRW 34 billion and supportive of 141 exporters. Our CEO personally declared his commitment to  shared growth and strengthened initiatives, while internal systems were improved to ease bidding conditions for  international conferences and events held by KTO so that equal opportunities are offered to SMEs.     Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commissions in 2011    For contracts worth over KRW 20 million, the supplier and the KTO employee in charge of the contract are ob- ligated to write and sign the integrity contract agreement in order to promote fair administrative practices and  prevent collusion among suppliers. Moreover, the integrity survey conducted by the Anti-Corruption and Civil  Rights Commission in 2011 discovered that KTO scored 9.25 points in external integrity and 9.41 points in the  integrity of its contract and its management practices, which recognized the fairness and transparency estab- lished in the way our contract operation is conducted in relation to SME support. The Korean governmental policy to promote the support for SMEs was followed by stronger evaluations made in  compliance with the preferential purchase of SME products regulation and assessment made by the Ministry  of Knowledge and Economy on performance of public enterprises in supporting SMEs. Therefore, KTO is faced  with increasing requirements to support SMEs through the purchase of their products. We give precedence  to green products and products manufactured by small businesses run by the physically challenged, female- owned businesses, technology developers and social enterprises. Moreover, our company-wide promotional ac- tivities led to an increased share of SMEs in our publicly procured products, offering stronger support for SMEs.

Under the four themes of:  multi-cultural online tourism footprint, Fun-sharing Cool summer camp, Fun-sharing multi-cultural festival,  and Fun-sharing multi-cultural family trip, the event was promoted through such media outlets as K-TV, the  Dong-A Daily News, KBS Radio, the Joongang Ilbo, and the Associated Press. Moreover, multi-cultural families  in Korea were assisted with understanding Korean culture, mingling with Korean society, understanding the  cultural heritage of Korea and in tourism resource protection activities. Also included in our various corporate  philanthropic initiatives for socially underprivileged children and teenagers, was the volunteer work performed  by Guseok Guseok Nanumi volunteers. The Intra-bound Tourism Promotion Team supported sharing-driven tourism projects in conjunction with travel  agencies, G Market, and Holt Childrens Services Inc. to generate KRW 15 million in revenues. As part of our  social contribution initiatives for socially underprivileged people in local communities, welfare facilities and local  areas where our four regional promotional offices are based, we became beneficiaries of our year-end social- giving programs.   industry Creation of Jobs in the   2,100 jobs   Improve social trust  through sharing Move towards a fairer  society and mutual  cooperation   Social Contribution Mileage 42,500 points  KTO, a Friend for All, Ready to Share with Everyone Brand Recognition based on   80 points  Alignment with  Core Capacity Cooperation  and Sympathy Continuous   Leading a Fairer Society KTOs suppliers include customers who signed revenue-generating business contracts and providers of office  supplies and services. We pursue transparency in the entire contract process from bidding and processing to  post management and offer equal opportunities to all suppliers. Specifically, we defined the vision of enhanc- ing SMEs independence and sustainable growth to support SMEs and the key strategy to strengthen customer  support in order to expand the purchase of SME products and facilitate purchasing contracts with SMEs. In so  doing, we continue to explore ways to seek mutually beneficial development with suppliers and SMEs.  To reinforce SME support policies, fulfill our leading role as a public enterprise and to efficiently manage indicators  related to reasonable purchasing and contracting practices, we use the public e-procurement information network  (SMPP) and our own SMS purchasing management system. We also revise contract systems (laws and regula- tions) so that we can help SMEs reduce their burdens. Moreover, the expansion of electronic bidding contributes to  providing equal bidding opportunities, thus establishing a culture of fair trade and mutual benefits among SMEs.

In addition, the Guseok Guseok Nanumi (volunteers) volunteer  program attended by all employees is underway. Our commitment to wide-ranging volunteer initiatives taken to  help multi-cultural families, people with disabilities, individuals in struggling homes and welfare facilities for the  elderly was recognized widely and we were honored with the Social Volunteering for a Happier Society Grand  Prix Award by the Korean Society of Consumer Studies for two consecutive years. In 2011, 894 occasions of joint  labor-management social giving activities took place at KTO, which is translated into 2.4 activities and 11.9 vol- unteering hours per employee. Under the Green Mileage scheme, our employees are given individual social contribution index scores when they  participate in social contribution activities or propose ideas for social-giving initiatives. The scheme is aligned  with an internal management evaluation. In 2010, a total of 21,397 miles were achieved and the Nanum King  (Nanum means sharing in Korean) ceremony was held to award individuals and departments for their contri- bution. In 2011, our employees earned 34,752 miles, up by 58.4% from 2010, and the green mileage accumulated  annually has been on the rise continuously since 2008. Our goal for 2012 was set at 38,300 miles.

The program contributed to stronger social cohesion and paved the foundation  for governance-type social contribution projects that encourage businesses in the tourism and other industries to  donate their talent. The Guseok Guseok Love Sharing Trip campaign was waged to stimulate domestic tourism as  well as to donate its profits. This program was developed into a larger-scale initiative that joined with Korean travel  businesses and created a total of 30 sharing-driven tour products and attracted 2,867 travelers. Moreover, 3% of  the profits were donated to child welfare facilities, practicing the spirit of sharing through tourism.  Overseas Exchanges and Volunteer Work In an effort to promote cultural and tourism exchanges for overseas customers, we undertook a public interest  project to invite the parents of 60,000 Chinese students studying in Korea. Consultations were made with the  Ministry of Justice to streamline the visa process for these parents and increase their accessibility to individual  visa issuance. This was followed by various events held through the joint efforts of airline companies and local  governments. As a result, 98% of the participants responded that they developed a favorable image of Korea.  This laid a foundation for long-term bilateral exchanges between China and Korea. In addition, proactive assis- tance and exchanges occurred in alignment with the devastating earthquake that hit Japan and the great flood  in Thailand in 2011. In order to improve the image of Korean tourism and forge an even stronger trust-based  relationship, our overseas volunteer work and exchanges continued on in 2011. Sharing in Local Communities As part of our sustainable social contribution initiatives based on the protection of Korean cultural heritage and  the environment, we signed an MOU with the Cultural Heritage Administration and have been undertaking an- nual PR activities for the Keeper for Every Piece of Cultural Heritage campaign. Included in our efforts to pro- tect the cultural heritage of Korea, are palace experience events for children from less-privileged families and  volunteer programs for teenagers. Moreover, 21 elderly individuals living alone were matched with 210 family  participants for health-sharing trips and Saturday experience trip products were developed to benefit 607 stu- dents from low-income families at five elementary schools nationwide.

Moreover, tangible outcomes were produced  by social contribution projects undertaken together with the CJ Welfare Foundation, RTOs and domestic travel  agencies, as well as other social-giving projects aligned with KTOs unique business covering the facilitation of  domestic tourism and overseas tourism marketing.   2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 079 Category  2011 2010 Assets 1.

Limitations Not included in this assurance statement are Interviews conducted of employees in charge of respective performance areas and  employees in charge of compiling performance data as well as review of the adequacy  of data  On-site inspections on the KTO Main Office  Verification performed based on materials concerning the reporting period and dis closed information  Evaluation of the reliability of performance data  Opinions IPS is not aware of any critical errors or biases regarding the Report content in accor- dance with the assurance scope, methods and evaluation criteria stated above. Major  assurance outcomes are suggested through this assurance statement and detailed out- comes and recommendations were submitted to KTO. Responsibility and Objective  The responsibility for defining sustainability management goals, managing performance,  compiling information and all data and statements related to the preparation of the  Report lies in KTO. The objective of this assurance statement is to find any critical errors  or biases in the Report, check the operation of KTOs information compilation system,  review the identification process of sustainability management issues and thus suggest  opinions to further improve the quality of Report.  Assurance Standards   This assurance engagement used the following standards:  1) Assurance criteria in AA1000Assurance Standard(2008)   2) BEST guidelines   3) GRI G3.1 guidelines on sustainability reporting Assurance Scope and Methods IPS used the following processes in order to 1) evaluate the inclusiveness, materiality and  responsiveness of the Report content and to 2) verify the level of compliance with indica- tors suggested by GRI/BEST sustainability reporting guidelines  Review of the source of disclosed data and the department in charge Review of the adequacy of sector-specific performance data compilation systems as  well as reporting processes   Review of the consistency between financial data in the Report and the corresponding  audit report  Verification of response systems for material issues  Interviews with employees in charge of respective performance areas  Physical on-site inspections and verifications with an emphasis on the Main Office  (Aug. 1~2 of 2012)  Review of the Application Level in accordance with GRI/BEST guidelines on sustain- ability reporting Independence  IPS does not have any interest regarding profit-making in KTO and performed the assur- ance engagement with independence and autonomy by not participating in the creation  of the Report except for the presentation of its feedback on the Report.  Assurance Type and Level  This constitutes a Type 1, moderate level assurance in accordance with AA1000 AS (2008).  IPS reviewed the appropriateness of data presented in the Korean Tourism Organiza- tion Sustainability Report 2011 in order to perform a Type 1 assurance engagement  while evaluating disclosure materials, reporting systems and performance manage- ment methodologies based on inclusiveness, materiality and responsiveness, the three  principles suggested by AA1000 AS (2008). Not included in this assurance statement is  the verification of the reliability of data presented.  IPS also conducted a moderate level engagement by obtaining evidence materials that  are sufficiently enough to lower the possibility of errors occurring regarding the Report  content and performing limited interviews with employees in charge of respective per- formance areas. [Inclusivity]: Review of the appropriateness of KTOs strategy development and engagement pro- cesses regarding stakeholder engagement  IPS believes that KTO is aware of the importance of stakeholder engagement in practic- ing sustainability management and that stakeholder engagement processes are under  constant operation at KTO. KTO endeavored to analyze & define stakeholders in accor- dance with ISO 26000 and operate communication channels for respective stakeholder  groups, thereby incorporating their feedback in its business operation. Specifically, KTO  is highly appreciated for the following:  KTO developed communication channels that enable stakeholder engagement such as  blogs, Twitter, Facebook and customer satisfaction surveys, in addition to their VOC(Voice of  Customers)s. KTO proactively used these channels as effective means for communication.  KTO established on/offline communication channels to ensure multi-dimensional com- munication with its employees and solicit feedback. It then reflected such findings in  creating its own corporate culture and business conduct.  IPS recommends that KTO shares its stakeholder engagement processes and the results  of the decisions made on a company-wide level. In so doing, such strategic management  approaches may strengthen KTOs executive capabilities to handle relevant issues and  enable the voices of more diverse stakeholders to be heard.  [Materiality]: Review of whether information most material to KTO and its stakeholders is included in  the Report  IPS is not aware of any critical omissions or exclusions of material information that  should be disclosed to KTOs stakeholders in this Report. IPS verified that KTO reviewed  material issues through such analytical processes of media analysis, benchmarking of  industry peers, stakeholder interviews and ISO 26000 compliance diagnosis and identi- fied & reported issues material to stakeholders through relevance and significance tests.  KTO is particularly appreciated for the following:  KTO used surveys and conducted interviews with its internal/external stakeholders so  as to concretely identify material issues. This helped KTO select more substantial and   AA1000AS(Assurance Standard): This represents the assurance standards for sustainability management reports that were developed by AccountAbility, a non-profit organization working in relation to social re- sponsibility management located in the U.K., in 1999. Their objective is to improve the quality of social & ethical accounting, assurance and reporting to enhance general performance and accountability on an orga- nizational level. The application of the revised 2008 version was initiated from 2010.  BEST Sustainability Reporting Guidelines: These guidelines concerning the creation and assurance of sustainability management reports were developed in 2006 through joint endeavors made by the BEST Forum,  the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy, IPS and the Korea Chamber of Commerce & Industry, in order to expand the practice of sustainability management reporting among Korean corporations. The guidelines  define the level of reporting on five different levels.  GRI G3.1 guidelines: These guidelines constitute sustainability reporting guidelines that were established in 1997 jointly by CERES (Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economics), an international associa- tion of environmental organizations, and UNEP. The guidelines evolved from the G3 version announced in October 2006, to the G3.1 version announced in March 2011, which came with the expansion and supple- mentation of such areas as human rights, gender, and local communities. The fourth revised version of the G4 is slated for release in 2013.  [GRI Application Level] IPS verified that this Report satisfied all the requirements for the Application Level A+ in  accordance with GRI G3 guidelines.  Recommendations Qualifications of IPS s an Assurance Provider  The Institute for Industrial Policy Studies (IPS), commissioned by KTO to perform this  assurance engagement, serves as a third-party assurer that provides assurance ser- vices to Korean sustainability management reports. Established in 1993, IPS has been  accumulating rich experience in the fields of ethics management, social responsibility  management and sustainability management since 2002. The assurance team for the  KTO Sustainability Report 2011 consisted of professors at prestigious universities in  Korea and experts with specialized training records and experience as advisors on sus- tainability management, with major specialties in general management, accounting, the  environment, etc.   [Compliance with BEST Sustainability Reporting Guidelines] The evaluation of KTOs compliance with reporting standards and the intensity of infor- mation in this Report under the BEST Sustainability Reporting Guidelines prompted IPS  to believe that the Report satisfies 97.1% of the Level 4 (establishment) requirements out  of the five Levels defined in the guidelines.   [ KTO Sustainability Reports Compliance with BEST Sustainability Reporting Indicators] Year of Report  Publication Round of Report  Publication Level Compliance Rate  2011 4th Level 4 97.10% 2010 3th Level 4 96.38% [Responsiveness]: Review of the appropriateness of responses made by KTO to address stakeholder re- quirements and interest  IPS believes that KTO endeavored to appropriately address stakeholder requirements  and interest by soliciting their opinions through stakeholder-specific communication  channels. IPS also verified that KTO was committed to identifying internal and external  issues that are critical to sustainability management and in responding to stakeholder  feedback. Specifically, KTO is highly appreciated for the following:  KTO stated its endeavors to communicate with its stakeholders through stakeholder  interviews and surveys, so as to effectively compile their feedback for response.  KTO reported its responses to and achievements in issues of great interest to stakehold- ers. Such issues included: the demand for tapping emerging markets to strengthen the  competitive edge of the tourism industry, facilitation of high value-added items, theme- driven tourism and customized efforts to attract foreign travelers.  It is recommended that KTO take a more balanced approach in addressing diverse  stakeholders and develop management systems to become more proactive in soliciting  and addressing opinions from suppliers and local communities. In addition, KTO would  benefit from creating a variety of communication channels in consideration of its unique  features so as to respond to and report on stakeholder interest and issues in a more pre- emptive and proactive manner. It is IPSs conclusion that the KTO Sustainability Report 2011 is highly recommendable  in that (1) the Report established a framework to align corporate management strategies  and sustainability management strategies, (2) the Report outlines indicators and goals to  measure performance of sustainability management as well as relevant achievements  and clearly stated them for appropriate management, (3) KTO created a dedicated sus- tainability management organization and took a step further to ensure company-wide  implementation of sustainability management. KTOs future sustainability reports would  be further improved in consideration of the following:    Strengthen KTOs concept of sustainability management and develop a stronger man- agement framework for sustainability management Analyze and illustrate material issues identified through the materiality test process  from a time-series perspective so as to manage and report trends of material sustain- ability management issues  Present more detailed responses and plans to improve on mistakes or shortcomings  to take a more balanced perspective (through some such issues were addressed in the  Report). Aug. 8, 2012 Jae-Eun Kim   President of the Institute for Industrial Policy s  detailed material issues.  KTO was committed to clearly stating material issues by prioritizing material issues  through the materiality test process and the reflecting the outcome in constructing the  table of contents for this Report. IPS believes that KTO would benefit from reporting on negative issues regarding sustain- ability management more proactively, as well as proposing detailed plans and measures  to be taken.  Appendix 2011 Korea Tourism Organization  Sustainability Report 086 087 Results of ISO 26000 Compliance  Diagnosis   Diagnostic Outcomes of the Seven Core Subjects of  ISO 26000 Diagnostic Standards A social responsibility compliance diagnosis checklist was developed in accordance with  ISO 26000, the international standard on social responsibility, by the Korean Standards  Association (KSA) as part of the research contract commissioned by the Korean Agency  for Technology and Standards under the Ministry of Knowledge and Economy. This report  outlines the outcomes of the diagnosis performed of the social responsibility process  and of the Korean Tourism Organization (KTO) along with its achievements in each of the  seven core subject areas in conformity with the checklist standards.   Scope of Diagnosis  The scope of the diagnosis performed by KSA included KTOs processes and achieve- ments in fulfilling its social responsibility. To this end, KTOs mid/long-term strategies,  as well as its social responsibility management strategies, stakeholder engagement and  social responsibility initiatives, were evaluated.  Diagnostic Method KSA undertook the following steps by compiling relevant evidenced data in accordance  with objective diagnostic standards (with an emphasis on KTOs task force team in  charge of publishing sustainability reports):  Review of internal documents in KTOs sustainability reports as well as its activities  and achievements  Interviews with KTO employees in charge of each issue of social responsibility  management Diagnostic Outcomes of the ISO 26000 Social  Responsibility Process  KTO recognizes social responsibility and sustainability management as engines of corpo- rate growth. These are demonstrated through the development of sustainability manage- ment visions and strategic directions, as well as a dedicated CSR organization in order  to achieve its vision of a Global Public Enterprise that Makes Korea an Attractive Tourist  Destination based on public interest. Since the first publication of its sustainability report  in 2008, KTO has been engaging stakeholders and identifying material issues annually.  However, KTO still lacks an appropriate system to incorporate stakeholder feedback and  material issues in the top managerial decision-making process. Therefore, KTO is ad- vised to extend the scope of its social responsibility to cover contract employees and the  entire organizational value chain, while expanding the role and influence of the dedicated  CSR organization so as to ensure the systemized implementation and management of  strategic tasks and performance indicators regarding sustainability management.    Organizational Governance KTO is committed to facilitating the efficient and transparent operation of the Board of  Directors. It is recommended that KTO establish a social responsibility management  committee, as a dedicated decision-making body within the BOD in order to practice so- cial responsibility management and strengthen corporate governance, while continuing  to manage performance on social responsibility goals and tasks.  Human Rights  Among the seven core subjects, KTO is relatively weak in the area of human rights and  is specifically insufficient in providing human rights protection and support policies for  partners, suppliers and local communities. KTO would benefit from developing detailed  guidelines and policies to promote the protection of human rights and in creating train- ing and regular monitoring systems for its employees and stakeholders.  Labor Practices KTO offers outstanding policies and support related to working conditions regarding  flexible working hours, family-friendly benefit schemes, support for club activities, the  KTO Future Plan Center and counseling systems. It also has policies to better treat non- regular employees. KTOs remarkable performance will be further improved by develop- ing workable measures to assist employees in improving on safety and physical health,  as well as managing stress.  Fair Operating Practices Wide-ranging initiatives are being undertaken at KTO to build a culture of integrity into its  daily business operations. These include: integrity training, the Integrity Mileage scheme  and contract provisions on executive job integrity. However, there lacks an adequate  system to support the tourism industry and suppliers in taking social responsibility initia- tives. In addition, KTO would benefit from preventing negative cases from occurring by  developing tourism resorts and transferring KTO business to the private sector.    Consumer Issues  KTO provides diverse and detailed information on Korean and overseas tourist attrac- tions, as well as its own management practices, through its website blog, guides and  brochures. KTO is also improving the quality of its services through self-supervised  certification schemes regarding accommodation, food and tourist sites. As sufficient  practices to secure the safety and health of travelers are still lacking, KTO would benefit  from developing relevant manuals and systems while undertaking regular training and  campaigns in order to raise the awareness of sustainable tourism The Environment Under the vision of becoming a Platform for Low Carbon Green Growth, KTO set GHG  emissions reduction targets and drew up a green management roadmap, KTO is under- taking systemized initiatives to address climate change, with the Energy-saving Commit- tee playing a key role. It is advised that KTO expand investment plans for environmental  management, while waging company-wide training and protection activities to raise the  awareness of green tourism and the protection of ecosystems.   Community Involvement and Development  KTOs social contribution initiatives are categorized into: sharing with local communities,  sharing cultural tourism, protection of the tourism environment and support for over- seas exchanges (with KTO volunteer groups playing a central role). In addition, tourism  development consulting and tourism business incubation projects are underway in con- sideration of KTOs unique business characteristics. KTO is recommended to extend the  scope of its social contribution activities and take stronger initiatives so that programs  are developed and supported to improve the health and training for local community  residents.    Conclusions The self-initiated assessment of KTOs compliance with ISO 26000 discovered that KTO scored 84.5 points in process and 89.9 points in performance, on a scale from 1 to 100. The final  weighted score was 88.3 points, which places KTO in the SR IV level with outstanding results. Process-wide, KTO has established a systemized recognition of its social responsibility  and sustainability while governance, human rights and the environment proved to be relatively weak areas in performance.
