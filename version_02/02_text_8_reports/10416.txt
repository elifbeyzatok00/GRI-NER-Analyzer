IPPAG Cooperative  In Wannen 16  CH-8406 Winterthur  Switzerland  Tel. +33 6 19 64 79 42  e-mail: secretariat@ippag-secretariat.ch      Winterthur, December 28th 2010        COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) TO THE GLOBAL COMPACT      Dear Mr Lavigne-Delville,    I am pleased to confirm that the IPPAG Cooperative continues to support the ten principles of  the Global Compact in respect to human rights, labour rights, the protection of the  environment and anti corruption. With this communication, we express our intent to support  and advance those principals within our sphere of influence.     We commit to making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and  day to day operations of our organisation, and the companies that compose it. We also  undertake to make a clear statement of this commitment – to our members, their employees,  our partners, clients and suppliers, and to the public.    Please find below our Communication on progress (COP) as a description of our efforts since  we joined in May 2006 until now.        Yours sincerely,        IPPAG MANAGER       IPPAG PRESIDENT  Miss Florence Mosnier        Mr Soeren Langhoff                                  Some background information:    IPPAG (The International Partnership for Premiums and Gifts) is a Swiss based Cooperative created  in 1965, made up of 25 distributors of promotional items in different countries around the world.  The Cooperatives purpose is to produce shared resources, output and added value for all its  member companies, based on the open exchange of information, and resulting in commonly  developed initiatives and projects.     In September 2008, the IPPAG Cooperative elected a new executive committee composed of:  - Mr Soeren Langhoff, Langhoff Promotion AS, Denmark: President  - Mr Thibaut Fontaine, Kick&Rush, Belgium: Committee member  - Mr Jeff Lederer, Prime Resources, USA: Committee member  - Mr Lauri Honka, Mastermark, Finland: Committee member (until April 2010)  - Mr Eduardo Zegaib, Eximaghen, Mexico: Committee member (since April 2010).    This committee has made an upmost priority of developing and implementing a vast CSR program  throughout the group of IPPAG members and our supply chain...    ----------------------    Integral part of the IPPAG committees 2008 – 2010 strategy plan based on IPPAGs 4 key components:        Concrete achievements and aims according to this strategy plan:                                   Actions this committee has implemented include:    - Conducting social audits (SA8000 based audits with Asia Inspection):    IPPAG traditionally works with a network of Far East suppliers: these suppliers have been integrated  into our Preferred Premium Partner program, or PPP system over a number of years based on criteria  such as their excellency of service, product quality, following of our own Code of Conduct, and  commitment to reaching SA8000 production levels.  There are currently 26 suppliers in this program (based mainly in China, but also Taiwan, Pakistan,  Thailand and India). Each of these suppliers has been notified of IPPAGs commitment to the Global  Compact and has been asked to provide details of their factory conditions and working standards.  - Successful social audits have been carried out with / sufficient existing social auditing information has  been collected from 17 of these  - 3 are currently being assisted in the preparation of a second audit with a corrective action plan after  their first audit failed  - The status of the remaining PPP suppliers who are unable to meet SA8000 criteria will be reviewed  during our upcoming general meeting in Dusseldorf in January 2011.    - Collecting and sharing information about individually audited factories:    Of course, these 26 PPP suppliers cannot cover all our member companies sourcing needs. The  promotions industry implies working with a very wide variety of consumer products. And these  diversified client needs require us to work with a multitude of traders and factories    Each of the 25 IPPAG member companies collaborates to exchange and share information concerning  recommended factories that reach SA8000 standards per product category.     Our factory inspection and auditing partner Asia Inspection, has created a joint IPPAG web platform,  where each individual IPPAG company can access and use audit / inspection reports carried out by  their fellow members:                     Similarly, members are informed about factories who fail such social audits, as they are placed on an  internal black list.    In addition, our internal supplier database system (the IPPAG Intranet) references audited suppliers  first in any product search.            Encouraging this exchange and availability of information has helped to increase to use of social  auditing procedures, and has given all our members better access to audited factories.       -  The IPPAG Code of Conduct    In 2005, the IPPAG members collaborated to define and implement an IPPAG Code of Conduct  (attached as appendix). This document has been signed by all members, and is widely distributed to all  suppliers: they are asked to read, acknowledge and sign this document. Over the years, we have done  significant work with our Chinese factories: making them aware of these requirements, and making  sure they understand the importance of the clauses. Our Code of Conduct is regularly the theme of the  supplier receptions and workshop we hold during trade fairs in Asia.    - Workshops and educational role    IPPAGs activities also focus on a central educational role:   - with members: making sure information on regulations and product conformity is widely known and  applied in each member company/ organizing workshops for purchase staff (concerning REACH with  SGS for example), etc  - with suppliers: stressing the importance of SA8000 - Global Compact issues in production / showing  that our criteria for products, price, and standards is deeply connected to the protection of our clients  reputations, and our personal convictions  - with clients: acting to demonstrate the compatibility but also the upmost necessity of integrating the  Global Compacts 10 guiding principles in all their supply and product choices.            - External communication (informative calendar, website, news stories, etc)    Our members are all encouraged to make the Global Compacts 10 guiding principles a focal point of  their communication.  IPPAG stresses its own commitment regularly: by working closely with suppliers and clients as  explained above and by promoting the principles in all our methods of communication.
