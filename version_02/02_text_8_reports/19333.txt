Microsoft 2012 Citizenship Report  1  Citizenship at Microsoft About this Report Working Responsibly Serving Communities Our Company Im proud of the generosity of our employees. In October 2012 we are marking our  companys 30th Employee Giving Campaign, whereby the company matches the  financial	and	volunteer	contributions	of	our	employees.	Through	this	campaign,	 Microsoft and its employees gave nearly $100 million in FY12, and in FY13, we are  on track to bring the total to $1 billion since 1983.  Beyond	direct	service	to	the	community,	we	made	significant	strides	in	the	areas	 of human rights and environmental sustainability. We consulted with businesses,  government and other key stakeholders to develop a human rights statement  that brings together long-standing policies on issues such as privacy, security, free  expression and labor rights. And, we exceeded our goal to cut carbon emissions  by 30 percent compared with 2007, due in part to the 1.1 billion kilowatt hours   of green power we purchased, the third most of any US company. Being a leader in corporate citizenship, we recognize theres always more we   can do. Our endorsement of the United Nations Global Compact drives us to  continually improve our business practices and increase our accountability.  Im confident that in this coming year we will continue to create value for   our business as well as the communities and people we touch through our   citizenship activities. Thank you for your interest in Microsoft. We welcome   your thoughts and suggestions. Sincerely,  Steven A. Ballmer  CEO, Microsoft Corp. To our stakeholders, Weve always believed that technology creates opportunities for people and  organizations to realize their full potential. This belief inspires us to deliver   new technology that unleashes creativity, productivity, and opportunity for   more and more people around the world.  This	report	describes	our	citizenship	work	in	fiscal	year	(FY)	2012	and	shares	our	 vision	for	whats	to	come.	Together	with	our	annual	financial	report,	it	provides	  a	full	accounting	of	our	fiscal	and	citizenship	priorities	and	performance.	 The full scope of our citizenship activities includes serving communities, champi- oning the growth of our people, and advancing our commitment to responsible  business policies and practices. In particular, we are increasing our focus on  young people in order to help more and more youth reach their dreams.  Though we live in a time of tremendous opportunity, theres a growing divide  between young people with the chance to succeed and those without. To help close  this gap and ensure a prosperous future, we are launching Microsoft YouthSpark,   a bold initiative to connect hundreds of millions of youth with opportunities for   education, employment and entrepreneurship. In partnership with governments,  nonprofit	organizations	and	businesses,	were	helping	the	next	generation	use	  technology to make a real impact for a better tomorrow. For	the	first	time	ever,	we	are	now	dedicating	the	majority	of	our	cash	donations	 to organizations that help young people. And, through our Technology for Good  program,	we	provided	more	than	62,000	nonprofits	in	more	than	100	countries	 with affordable access to technology to better serve their communities.  Our Company Serving Communities Working Responsibly About this Report Citizenship at Microsoft Citizenship at  Microsoft Our citizenship mission is to   serve globally the needs of  communities and fulfill our  responsibilities to the public.   Microsoft 2012 Citizenship Report  3  About this Report Working Responsibly Serving Communities Our Company Citizenship at Microsoft Since	the	release	of	our	first	product	in	1975,	weve	demonstrated	 the promise of computing to change the world. But as weve grown   as a company, so have the worlds social and environmental   challenges. Were responding by applying our technology, ingenuity,  and collaborative spirit to help solve these critical challenges and  create	fulfilling	and	exciting	opportunities	for	people	everywhere.	 We focus our commitment to corporate citizenship in two ways:  serving communities around the world and working responsibly   in our own business. Serving communities  Were active members of the communities everywhere we do busi- ness. We use our skills, technology, and other resources to serve the  people in these communitiesâ€”from supporting disaster relief efforts  to	connecting	nonprofits	with	the	tools	they	need	to	run	efficiently.	 Creating opportunities for youth is the backbone of our community  work. By making technology more accessible and creating programs   to inspire and empower young people, were helping a new generation  of innovators build the skills and education they need to prosper. As  we work to bridge the opportunity divide that separates youth who  have opportunities from those who dont, we help young people secure  their individual futures and also the future of our global economy. It takes more than   a great product   to make a great  company.  Bill Gates, Chairman  Microsoft 2012 Citizenship Report  4  About this Report Working Responsibly Serving Communities Our Company Citizenship at Microsoft Citizenship governance  Our board of directors assumes overall governance responsibilities   for citizenship at Microsoft. Through most of FY12, the boards  Governance and Nominating committee handled oversight of all   citizenship and public policy issues. As FY12 drew to a close, however,  the board shifted citizenship governance to its new Regulatory and  Public Policy committee, which is charged with overseeing public  issues that may affect the companys operations or performance in  areas like human rights, climate change, and responsible sourcing.  Our Citizenship and Public Affairs team manages our overall citizenship  initiative, including stakeholder engagement. Part of our Legal and  Corporate Affairs department, the 30-person team is responsible for  driving new citizenship programs and engaging with colleagues and  partners to keep our citizenship work vibrant.  More broadly, citizenship at Microsoft relies on the combined  efforts of all our employees, including colleagues in dozens   of other leadership roles, business and operational groups, and   global subsidiaries. Together, they help us identify the issues   that are most material to Microsofts business, develop and implement  new strategies and programs, and monitor our progress.  Working responsibly  Good corporate citizenship starts at home. To meet our responsibilities  as a global company, were continually working to create a respectful  and rewarding work environment for our 94,000 employees.  Were also taking steps to reduce the environmental impact of our  operations while partnering with industry colleagues and leading  nongovernmental	organizations	(NGOs)	to	elevate	standards	across	 the supply chain. And with the release of our Global Human Rights  Statement,	we	affirmed	our	commitment	to	respecting	fundamental	 rights and freedoms throughout our business practices.   Microsoft 2012 Citizenship Report  5  About this Report Working Responsibly Serving Communities Our Company Citizenship at Microsoft External frameworks To guide our work, we consult international frameworks such as the  Global Reporting Initiatives Sustainability Reporting Guidelines,   the	United	Nations	(UN)	Guiding	Principles	on	Business	and	Human	 Rights, and the UN Global Compact. This report serves as the  Communication on Progress of our commitment to the UN Global  Compact	(see index on page 86).	 Setting priorities and stakeholder engagement We regularly communicate with thousands of stakeholders from  global human rights experts and environmental NGOs to parents  concerned about their childrens safety and education. Those   conversations help inform and guide our citizenship strategies   and programs.  Our stakeholder engagement takes several forms. Employees   from our business and operational groups regularly identify and  engage with stakeholders in the course of their daily work activities.  Our Citizenship and Public Affairs team also manages a number   of stakeholder engagements and external relationships to help  guide our strategies.  We connect with leading thinkers on corporate responsibility issues   as participants in groups such as Business for Social Responsibility  (BSR),	the	Boston	College	Center	for	Corporate	Citizenship,	the	 Clinton Global Initiative, Net Impact, and the World Economic Forum.  In partnership with our colleagues in corporate governance and  investor relations, we discuss environmental, social, and governance  issues twice a year with our largest institutional investors.  We also listen to advocacy groups, socially responsible investors,  corporate responsibility rating agencies, and our own employees   to identify new and emerging citizenship issues.

By	 connecting youth to the resources they need, we can help them  create more opportunities for themselves, their communities, and  the world, and ultimately make a real impact for a better tomorrow.  	 Provided access to relevant and affordable education technologies  to 7 million young people worldwide through our Shape the  Future program. 	 Shared new learning approaches with 217 million teachers   and students in 119 countries to date through our Partners in   Learning program.

Equipped students with the technology skills they need   to succeed in todays evolving workplace at the Microsoft IT  Academyâ€”a career-ready education program operating   in 160 countries.  A glaring opportunity divide separates young people who have   the access, skills, and chance to succeed from those who dont.   We believe we can and must help close this gap. Improving access  to technology, skills, and opportunities is the central focus of our  Microsoft YouthSpark initiative. Were using technology to make   it	easier	to	find	and	take	advantage	of	learning	opportunities,	  and were delivering real-life experiences that equip youth for   a successful future. Youth empowerment  starts with access, but it  doesnt end there. We  must also inspire young  people to envision a better  tomorrow and connect  them with opportunities   to realize their dreams.

Microsoft 2012 Citizenship Report  17  About this Report Working Responsibly Our Company Citizenship at Microsoft Serving Communities Saving childrens lives with a Windows phone Sometimes	a	mosquito	bite	is	just	an	itchy	bump.	Sometimes	its	 the symptom of something far more deadly. In sub-Saharan Africa,  Asia, and parts of the Americas, mosquitoes often carry malaria,   a potentially fatal disease that takes the lives of more than 1 million  people	per	yearâ€”85	percent	of	them	children	under	the	age	of	five.	 One team that competed in the Microsoft Imagine Cup technology  competition believes it can save childrens lives by diagnosing  malaria faster and more accurately, increasing detection rates, and  ensuring medication is distributed correctly.  The current malaria test uses a chemically treated cotton swab to  diagnose an infection. But the test has a false positive rate as high as  60 percent, leading health care workers to distribute precious medica- tion to patients who dont need it. A new solution called Lifelens  provides a more accurate diagnosis using high-resolution images.  The concept is simple: a semi-spherical lens is attached to a Windows  phone, enabling the phone to take pictures of cells from blood  smears. The parasite is then detected using an algorithm. The test is  94 percent accurate and 40 percent cheaper than traditional tests.  Whats more, Lifelens automatically collects and stores data so it  can be transferred to a centralized server that aggregates the infor- mation to identify outbreaks before they become serious. Lifelens  can be used by anyone who has the ability to operate a cell phone,  lowering or eliminating training costs, and enabling testing to  reachâ€”and saveâ€”more children.

They	are	just	looking	for	the	opportunity	and	 support to unleash their potential.  Thats exactly what Innovate for Good gatherings are all aboutâ€” helping youth take charge of the future by bringing them together  to collaborate, inspire, and support one another.  At a 2012 event, Nageeb and more than 220 other young people   from 11 Arab countries came together to identify needs in their local  communities. Student innovators showcased how they used Microsoft  technology and programs to help change their communities for   the better. Others delivered speeches tackling challenging issues  related to the Arab Spring, the image of Arab youth, the potential   of e-governance, and the pressing need for community service. Nageeb talked about Ekshef, his online social directory that helps  people	in	Arab	countries	find	the	doctors	with	the	expertise	they	 need, and book appointments online in minutes. Access to health  care information is a basic right, he says. However, it doesnt exist in  many parts of the Arab region, including Egypt. Another participant,  Manal Elattir from Morocco, founded Anarouz Social Enterprise, an  organization that promotes empowerment and entrepreneurship   for women through market access and technology.  On	the	final	day	of	the	conference,	participant	groups	each	designed	 a	work	plan	for	a	project	serving	some	aspect	of	their	community.

Microsoft 2012 Citizenship Report  21  About this Report Working Responsibly Our Company Citizenship at Microsoft Serving Communities Photo courtesy of Todd Bishop, GeekWire Creating the next generation of tech leaders If computer science is one of the fastest growing and most   lucrative career paths, why are so few US high school studentsâ€” less than 0.6 percent of all students who took Advanced Placement  tests in 2011â€”choosing to take a computer science class?  Kevin Wang, a former teacher and current Microsoft employee,  believes limited availability, not lack of interest, is at the root of   the problem.  Theres	just	a	huge	black	hole	in	computer	science,	Wang	says.	  I	started	teaching	first-period	computer	science	at	a	local	school	 on the way to work. Word got around, and schools wanted clones  of me to start computer science programs at their schools. Thats why Wang founded Technology Education and Literacy in  Schools	(TEALS),	a	program	that	trains,	mentors,	and	places	high- tech professionals from companies like Microsoft as volunteer  computer science teachers. The programs team-teaching model  also trains existing faculty, so they can continue teaching the  courses on their own. What started as a one-school, one-volunteer  program with 12 students is now expected to impact more than  2,000 high school students in 37 schools across eight states in the  2012â€“13	school	year.	 It is so incredibly important for high school students to be exposed  to	computer	scienceâ€”just	like	biology,	chemistry,	and	physicsâ€” before college, Wang explains. Not everyone will become a  computer scientist, but everyone should have the chance to learn  about computer science in high school no matter where they  choose to go in life.

An ideal  PUE is 1.0. Microsoft averaged 1.40, while the current industry average is 1.8â€“1.9.  The Microsoft Chicago data center averaged a PUE of 1.07 in the container area  for the majority of the year. We aim to average 1.125 PUE or better next year. Minimizing data center impact 	 Saved resources by developing modular data centers that use   up to 50 percent less energy and consume only 1 percent of the  water of traditional data centers.

A	modest	number	of	large,	influential	 companies are stepping up to the plate, not only because they take  good corporate citizenship seriously, but because they understand  that operating sustainably also makes them more competitive and  more	profitable	over	the	long	term. Microsofts announcement that it will become carbon neutral in  FY13	exemplifies	the	kind	of	visionary	thinking	that	has	been	the	 companys hallmark for decades.

How	Microsoft	plans	to	achieve	carbon	neutrality	reflects	the	companys	 innovative spirit. Ceres has long argued that without putting a price on  the carbon emissions responsible for global warming, as long as the  atmosphere is treated as an unlimited free resource, it will be virtually  impossible to slow the rate of climate change.  Rather than wait for policymakers to take this vital but elusive step,  Microsoft is putting an internal price on carbon that will make each  of its business divisions responsible for the cost of offsetting its  carbon	emissions,	either	through	energy	efficiency	or	by	payment	 into a central fund that will be used to source renewable energy or  purchase carbon offsets.

Core features of the GPs have been incorporated into the updated  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the new European Union  corporate social responsibility strategy, the International Finance  Corporations revised sustainability policy, and ISO 26000. The   GPs	also	enjoy	strong	support	from	stakeholder	groups	including	 business, workers organizations, and civil society.  The GPs lay out the duties of states to protect human rights, the  corporate responsibility to respect human rights, and the need for  remedy where harm does occur. In addition to calling on businesses  to adopt a human rights policy statement, the GPs provide the  means for them to know and show that they respect human rights.  These include a due diligence process to identify, prevent, mitigate,  and account for how they address adverse impacts on human  rights, and processes to enable the remediation of any such  impacts they cause or to which they contribute.  By reducing the risk that companies cause or contribute to human  rights harm, the GPs protect human rights, build trust between  companies and their internal and external stakeholders, and help  ensure that fragile global markets become socially more inclusive  and sustainable.

Those standards play an important part in   our supplier selection and retention decisions. By setting  clear expectations, and by sharing experiences and best  practices with our suppliers, we create incentives for   them to promote the health, safety, and well-being of  their workers and the communities where they operate.   Microsoft 2012 Citizenship Report  70  About this Report Serving Communities Our Company Working Responsibly Citizenship at Microsoft As a global company with supplier relationships around the world,  Microsoft recognizes the importance of working with suppliers com- mitted to responsible business practices. As the foundation of our  commitment, all companies doing business with Microsoft must  agree to abide by our Vendor Code of Conduct, which sets out our  expectations about ethical business practices, employment practices,  and compliance with environmental and worker safety requirements. Microsoft is committed to the fair treatment  and safety of workers at manufacturers  contracted to our company, and we use   a risk-based approach to promote safe   and healthy working and living conditions,  engaging directly with our suppliers to build  their capabilities in these important areas.   We have invested heavily in a robust supply  chain social and environmental accountability  program intended to verify that suppliers  meet our Vendor Code of Conduct. Brian Tobey, Corporate Vice President   Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Information and Services  We also share experiences and best practices with our suppliers   to encourage them to improve their business practices. We work  collaboratively with our suppliers to verify that they are complying  with the Vendor Code of Conduct and to enhance their ability to  find	and	fix	problems	that	do	sometimes	occur.	If	we	find	a	supplier	 is unwilling to follow the Vendor Code of Conduct or address such  problems, we will takeâ€”and we have takenâ€”disciplinary action up  to and including terminating supplier contracts. There is always  room for improvement, but we are encouraged by the cooperation  we	find	among	our	suppliers	and	many	companies	across	the	 electronics industry to tackle existing challenges and address new  issues as they arise.  Vendor Code of Conduct   The Microsoft Vendor Code of Conduct (VCC) sets our   expectations for ethical business and employment practices  among all companies doing business with Microsoft,   including overseas suppliers and service providers. Our   VCC requires, among other things:    Fair, legal wages under humane conditions   A safe and healthy work environment   A workplace free of harassment, discrimination, or abuse   Freedom of association   No forced or child labor    Environmental and regulatory compliance   Business, legal, and anti-corruption protections  Microsoft 2012 Citizenship Report  71  About this Report Serving Communities Our Company Working Responsibly Citizenship at Microsoft escalated to Microsoft senior management and the suppliers  were placed on restricted status with no new Microsoft business  awarded until they had resolved the issues.  	 We	identified	one	instance	of	under-aged	labor	at	each	of	two	  supplier sites, and one instance at a site of a prospective supplier  with which we declined to do business. The cause of these violations  was	vulnerabilities	in	the	suppliers	age	verification	procedures,	 which	did	not	detect	the	misuse	of	borrowed	identification.	Both	 cases were escalated to senior management, and the supplier   was placed on restricted status with no new Microsoft business  awarded	until	the	problem	was	resolved.	We	verified	they	had	taken	 corrective actionâ€”including immediately ceasing employment of  the	minors	and	providing	the	minors	a	safe	journey	homeâ€”and	 verified	they	had	taken	appropriate	steps	to	make	their	identity	  validation controls more robust. In one case, we helped the supplier  implement facial recognition software to screen new employees   and	substantially	reduce	the	risk	of	minors	using	false	identification	 papers to get work. Hardware production To meet our own and others expectations to make our products  with integrity, Microsoft operates a Social and Environmental  Accountability	(SEA)	program	specifically	focused	on	suppliers	  that produce our hardware products and packaging materials.  Raising supplier accountability expectations 	 Microsofts hardware and packaging suppliers are required to  provide Microsoft and third-party auditors on-site access to conduct  audits and assessments of conformance with our Vendor Code of  Conduct. Microsofts factory managers and SEA team regularly visit  supplier factories to assess living and working conditions. The facto- ries that assemble Microsoft products receive third-party compliance  audits at least once a year. The suppliers we contract to make com- ponents for our products also receive SEA team assessments and  third-party	audits	based	on	their	risk	level.	All	of	the	final	assemblers	 of our hardware and all high- and medium-risk component suppliers  have undergone human rights pre-contracting and ongoing screen- ing.	In	FY12,	98	significant	hardware	suppliers	underwent	human	 rights risk assessment and monitoring.  	 Overall,	monitoring	found	no	instances	of	human	trafficking	or	 interfering with workers freedom of association. Monitoring  detected eight non-conformances of the non-discrimination  provisions of our Code of Conduct. It also found seven instances  of concern regarding suppliers forced labor prevention pro- cesses, including protecting workers ability to refuse overtime  work	and	to	have	easy	access	to	their	personal	identification	 documents that workers need for travel. All of these issues were  We seek worker input to help  target our supplier engagement  efforts for improvements where  they matter most.  Microsoft 2012 Citizenship Report  72  About this Report Serving Communities Our Company Working Responsibly Citizenship at Microsoft Listening to workers 	 Enhanced supplier management capabilities to better understand  and resolve workers concerns through an updated workers  grievance process, including an anonymous hotline to capture  worker concerns and worker interviews conducted by the Fair  Labor	Association	(FLA).	 	 Based on an initial assessment in 2011, we updated the model in  FY12 with a bigger focus on promoting improvements in worker/ management communication. Worker surveys and interviews  conducted by the FLA provided key data to support our collab- orative efforts with suppliers on issues the workers themselves  most want to see addressed. Promoting a safe working environment 	 Shared experiences and best practices with suppliers on a  number of workplace safety topics, including management of  hazardous and toxic substances, electrical safety, emergency  response plans, combustible dust, and use of personal protective  equipment at a supplier forum in Shenzhen, China.  	 Directly engaged priority suppliers based on risk and compliance  records to promote improved factory conditions and worker  treatment at those suppliers sites. We sent a team of Microsoft  senior management and health and safety representatives   to China to meet with those suppliers, support their efforts to  implement corrective actions, and help them build capabilities   to address future issues.  Improving health and living conditions 	 Launched	a	worker	community	project	to	support	supplier	 efforts to improve living conditions, quality of life, and develop  career growth opportunities for workers. Our improvement   projects	include	providing	cleaner	dormitories,	workshops,	and	 canteen areas; offering more culturally diverse foods; organizing  field	trips	for	workers	to	give	them	a	better	work/life	balance;	 enhancing management and worker communications; and  developing career paths for workers. Community Technology Centers  teach people in supplier com- munities how to use computers  and the Internet, explore new  careers, further their education,  participate in community activi- ties, and develop job-related  technology skills.

See the Environment section to learn how we work with our   partners to reduce environmental impact.  Conflict minerals We proactively support industry and multistakeholder efforts   to	move	toward	a	conflict	mineralâ€“free	electronics	supply	chain.	 	 Continue to examine our supply chain to identify each component  used in our products containing tin, gold, tantalum, or tungsten   and the suppliers of these components. We are educating these  suppliers	regarding	the	conflict	minerals	issue	and	ask	suppliers	  to	identify	each	smelter	or	refinery	they	use	and	verify	that	the	  minerals	in	these	components	do	not	come	from	implicated	conflict	 mineral zones.  	 We seek to align our efforts with the Organisation for Economic  Co-operation	and	Development	(OECD)	Due	Diligence	Guidance	 for	Responsible	Supply	Chains	of	Minerals	from	Conflict-Affected	 and High-Risk Areas and the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and  related	US	Securities	and	Exchange	Commission	(SEC)	regulations.	  Microsoft 2012 Citizenship Report  74  About this Report Serving Communities Our Company Working Responsibly Citizenship at Microsoft Expanding our efforts This year, we enhanced our responsible sourcing efforts in many ways:  	 Supported woman-owned, minority-owned, or veteran-owned  suppliers with more than $1.5 billion in worldwide spending in FY12.  This puts us among the top 15 companies globally in this category.  	 Explored ways to promote improvement in our suppliers social   performance by launching a new reporting program. Under the  program, we asked approximately 20 key hardware suppliers and  service providers to use several Global Reporting Initiative indicators  to document how their programs and policies meet our standards.  	 Provided people of all ages and abilities low-cost access to   technology by partnering with suppliers to build Community  Technology	Centers	(CTCs)	in	their	communities.

Goal: Developed new practices to promote supplier adherence to our  Vendor Code of Conduct, and to apply the code consistently across   our business units. We strengthened our anti-corruption screening program for our entire supplier  database and developed new ethics training programs for our suppliers. We   also enhanced how we apply our Vendor Code of Conduct to strategic business  process suppliers, such as customer support call centers.

Microsoft 2012 Citizenship Report  82  About this Report Serving Communities Our Company Citizenship at Microsoft Microsoft 2012 Citizenship Report Working Responsibly Setting the standard for transparency Corporate participation in politics and funding of elections has  become a hotly debated issue. From newspaper editorials to grass- roots campaigns to investor inquiries, companies are under scrutiny  for their political spending and lobbying, with widespread fears that  they	are	exerting	undue	influence.	As	Microsoft	has	demonstrated,	 the way to address such fears is transparency.  Microsoft engages government agencies and representatives   on public policy issues crucial to its business, guided by a set of  principles and practices with transparency, responsibility, and  accountability at its core. When	asked	How	much	influence	is	your	company	exerting	in	the	 political process, and how do you do it? or What is your agenda?  Microsoft provides answers, posts them publicly, and updates them  annually.	Microsoft	provides	specifics	about	its	lobbying	and	politi- cal spending, with details on how much is spent on each activity.  Company participation is guided by a public policy agenda, which  openly spells out the issues important to its business.  Any company involved in the political process can face controversy.  For example, it is always confusing to stakeholders when trade  associations claiming they speak for their members, such as the US  Chamber of Commerce, take positions counter to Microsofts on  issues like the environment or diversity. This makes it all the more  important for Microsoft to consistently declare what it stands for  and differentiate itself from any backward-looking trade association  statements or lobbying positions. Such a transparent, responsible,  accountable approach sets the gold standard.  Microsoft is a leader in showing how corporate participation in   politics can be consistent with corporate responsibility.
