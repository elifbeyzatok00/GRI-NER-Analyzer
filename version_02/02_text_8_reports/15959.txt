OUR CORE VALUE Banyan Tree defines success not just financially,  but also socially and environmentally. Sustainable  development as a socially responsible business is a  core value of the Group. This involves: These sustainability values have been embedded as core  values since our founding and have enabled us to be agents  of social and economic development in areas where we have  a presence. With our triple bottom line concept of success  as a backdrop, we seek to minimise our impacts while also  maximising our positive contributions to our surroundings. Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2011 2  2011 AT A GLANCE As part of our founding commitment to  sustainability, Banyan Tree has sought continual  progress in Embracing the Environment and  Empowering People.  In 2007, a then 14-year-old Ms Li Ai Chun  (above right) joined Banyan Tree Lijiangs  Seedlings initiative upon strong community  recommendations. She was paired with a volunteer  Banyan Tree Lijiang associate to mentor her, serve  as a con dante, a guide in life matters, and an  instructor in English and basic computer skills.  Continuing to excel at her studies since then,  Ms Li embarked upon her tertiary education in  late 2011 at Yunnan University of Nationalities,  under a full scholarship provided by Banyan Tree. In 2011, we were encouraged by the results of strategies  prioritised and emphasised as we empowered our  associates to achieve our founding value of sustainability.  Highlights of these values in action during included: Resource Conservation – Two more properties achieved  EarthCheck Bronze Benchmarked status; Banyan Tree  Lijiang also successfully maintained its Silver Certi ed  status for the fourth consecutive year; and Laguna  Phuket launched its pursuit of benchmarked status as an  EarthCheck precinct. Resorts in the Maldives also reduced  use of plastic water bottles by as much as 33% from 2010. Greening Communities – We planted 50,438 trees across  18 resorts, bringing our  ve-year total to 147,111 trees,  exceeding our cumulative target by over 11,000 trees. The  bulk of trees planted were either mangrove trees that help  to protect vulnerable coastlines in Asia, or various fruit trees  donated to local communities to provide additional sources  of nutrition and income. Seedlings – Spread across 13 participating resorts, 55  young people are now under mentorship and scholarship,  receiving an average of  ve hours of one-to-one guidance  per month with our volunteer mentors. One of our Seedlings  participants has also exited the programme in order to enter  university, fully funded by Banyan Tree. Emergency Support – In addition to raising over  US$30,000 to support the recovery from the March 11  Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, Banyan Tree associates  also raised over US$70,000 to aid recovery for  oods in  Thailand. In both cases, Banyan Tree matched or exceeded  the contributions by associates. International Recognition Acclaim for our sustainability efforts in 2011 included: – Cond Nast Traveler World Savers Awards 2011 –  Winner for Preservation – Environmental and/or Cultural. – Tourism Authority of Thailand UK Green Awards –  Overall Winner and Winner, Large Hotel Category for  Banyan Tree Phuket – Travel + Leisure Global Vision Awards 2011 –  Leadership: Education Initiative for Seedlings Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2011 3  EXECUTIVE CHAIRMANS STATEMENT In this Asian century with tremendous growth in the  region, Banyan Tree strives to be among the sustainable  Asian brands expanding across the world. While we are excited by the architecture and interiors  of all the hotels we design, it is our people that make  the destination and experience complete. I am  inspired when I visit our hotels and see young people,  just starting out with their lives and embracing  new challenges.  Our journey is just beginning: Banyan Tree as a  vehicle to stimulate development and provide  livelihood for people. We have always had a strong commitment to  sustainability, even before the term was popularised.  My background was not originally in business;  I was a journalist and developmental economist  and my main interest in resort development was  because it is a vehicle through which to carry out  wide-ranging socio-economic development.  Although we are in the luxury resort industry,  Im not particularly fascinated by things like  crystal chandeliers or the thread count of our bed  sheets. What excites me is how our resorts can  really be an impetus for social, cultural, and  economic change. As Ive often contended, the purpose of business is  to build a better society for all. In order to realise that  core mission, we as business leaders need to think  beyond maximising shareholder returns and focus  on transforming the lives of the people we touch.  The same needs to be said about enterprises – that  only by transforming the lives of stakeholders can an  enterprise be a leader within its industry segment. As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact,  Banyan Tree is one of the nearly 7,000 global business  participants who agree that business must be an integral  part of solutions to the challenges of our global populace.  If those 7,000 business participants are indeed leaders  and thus able to transform lives, we are well on our way  to a very much brighter future. Yours sincerely, Ho KwonPing Executive Chairman Banyan Tree Holdings What excites me is  how our resorts can  really be an impetus for  social, cultural, and  economic change. Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2011 4  BANYAN TREE GLOBAL FOUNDATION  CHAIRPERSONS STATEMENT Enterprises who can  examine how they  interact with various  stakeholders are better  positioned to be able  to create increased  value, thus inevitably  taking steps up in  performance. While the global economy is emerging from the depths  of the global  nancial crisis which started in late 2008, it  unfortunately remains unclear if an underlying shift has  enabled capitalism to transform from an individual focused  practice to the wider communitarian concept.   Has the mindset of chasing short-term pro ts been  replaced with a longer-term pursuit of creating value for  multiple stakeholders? Have thought and business leaders  been successful in empowering our respective capacities  for compassion, moderation, and shared bene t?   While there has been progress, it is unfortunate that  sustainability is still somewhat of an iconoclastic endeavour.  While some have started to more widely embrace concepts  of strategic philanthropy, industry still seems relatively  mired in the dogma of single-minded pro t maximisation.   In the current information age, companies are still slow  to recognise the reputational risks of not being aligned  with the more progressive ideals of what is increasingly  expected of business. While risk management is a major  issue for driving sustainability, the more signi cant concept  of sustainability as a driver of innovation remains largely  under-recognised. Peter Drucker de ned innovation as  change that creates a new dimension of performance.  Enterprises who can examine how they interact with  various stakeholders are better positioned to be able to  create increased value, thus inevitably taking steps up  in performance.   Another concept of vital importance for sustainability is  innovativeness, the spirit of always resisting old dogmas  and seeking new solutions in a never-ending journey and  cycle of improvement.   With that in mind, I invite you to review this 2011  Sustainability Report to help you become familiar with  Banyan Trees commitment. You can then track our  progress via this current edition of our sustainability  report as well as our past editions, which are all available  in soft copy via www.banyantree.com/csrpublications.  This will allow you to become a part of our continual  cycle of improvement via setting targets, measuring  achievements, reporting progress, and reaching  higher-level commitments to create broader impact  on the environment and society.

EMBRACING THE ENVIRONMENT  PROJECTS BY LOCATION Elephants – Banyan Tree Gallery in Thailand In 2011, Banyan Tree Gallery launched an exclusive  Elephant collection to commemorate National Thai  Elephant Day, which falls on 13 March annually. The  initiative included photo exhibitions in Bangkok from April  to May and Phuket in August, showcasing the Elephant  Nature Foundation and its advocacy for the welfare of Asian  elephants in Thailand. Net pro ts from photography sales  and sales of limited edition elephant T-shirts, along with 5%  of Banyan Tree Gallerys total revenues from 13 March to  13 June, were donated to the Elephant Nature Foundation. Fish Diets Study – Maldives In 2011, Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru and Angsana Velavaru  continued a project launched in late 2010 to study the diets  of  n  sh. To enhance the understanding of the predator-  prey and food chains within the  sheries in and around  the Maldives, both resorts Marine Labs collected samples  for central analysis in an effort to safeguard the vital food  chains supporting marine biodiversity and  sheries. By  the end of 2011, the second year of this multi-year study,  Regular Volunteer Clean-Ups – Maldives, Sanya, and Phuket In the ongoing effort to take an active role in protecting the  habitat, Banyan Tree resorts invited their associates,  community members and guests to participate in various  clean-up days. This included monthly reef cleaning dives in  Angsana Velavaru that, since 2007, have had 274 guests and  297 associates remove some 4,046 coral reef predators, such  as the crown of thorns star sh, in order to better protect  reefs still at risk of El Nino-caused bleaching events. Beach clean-ups were regular events at Banyan Tree Sanya  and Banyan Tree Phuket, which had separate sessions to  clean Layan Beach and Bangtao Beach including some  44 associate volunteers and  ve secondary school students.  A separate session was conducted in February 2011 to  clean up roads in Bang Tao supported by 15 volunteer  Banyan Tree associates along with 16 students and  20 community volunteers.   Free Conservation Presentations and Activities –  Bintan, Maldives, Phuket, and Mayakoba In 2011, the Banyan Tree Bintan Conservation Lab Bintan  engaged some 956 guests with complimentary conservation  themed activities with 412 participating in guided nature  walks, 54 in free conservation presentations, 41 in guided  tree trail walks, 14 in birdwatching sessions, 15 joined in  tours of the neighbouring Kampung Baru village, and 320  participated in turtle brie ngs during hatching and releases  on three separate days. While handling all this, the Lab  also underwent an expansion renovation to further enable  driving conservation awareness. The Banyan Tree Maldives Marine Lab also continued its  ongoing free marine conservation presentations, with  Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru hosting 472 guests and Angsana  Ihuru reaching 137 guests in 2011. On top of that, the  Banyan Tree Phuket Rangers programme was launched to  engage children below 10 years old. This daily programme  revolves around the stimulation of the  ve senses – sight,  sound, touch, smell and taste – to explore and appreciate  the natural environment around them.  Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2011 10  1,565 Number of People Attending  Free Conservation Presentations 594 Turtles Released between Angsana Velavaru and its northern counterparts,  Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru and Angsana Ihuru, in order to  better understand the precursors of spawning for different  species of corals. Turtles – Maldives and Bintan Turtle efforts continued in Bintan and Vabbinfaru. The  Bintan Conservation Lab managed three clutches of  eggs, totalling 236 eggs, of which 120 hatched and 118  successfully enter the ocean, bring Bintans cumulative  total to 594 turtles released. Additionally, some 320 guests  were part of the three release brie ngs and celebrations in  April, May and August. Laguna Phukets Annual Sea Turtle  Release was cancelled in 2011 due to inclement weather.  Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru upgraded the turtle facilities such  that only two turtles were under the Head Start effort and  released in October 2011. Seafood – Ungasan, Bangkok and Maldives The Banyan Tree Maldives Marine Lab in Vabbinfaru  initiated studying distribution, abundance, and sizes of  key species in support of a nationwide Maldives effort  establishing a  shery management plan. Banyan Tree  Bangkok continued its lead role in developing sustainable  seafood guidelines across the group, and Banyan Tree  Ungasan continued its participation and support of WWF  Indonesias Seafood Savers effort. Ecosystem Mapping and Habitat Monitoring The Banyan Tree Bintan Conservation Lab continued  its efforts to map and monitor its coastal rainforest  ecosystem. Species speci c monitoring efforts included  birds, snakes, coral, and sea turtles. Wider ongoing actions  included leading advocacy for marine shipping pollution,  supporting Earth Hour and Earth Day, collaborating with  nearby universities on research, connecting with Wildlife  Conservation Society to support a marine protected area  in Bintan. At Banyan Tree Mayakoba the effort to map and monitor  the ecosystem has taken shape in a wildlife guide freely  distributed to guests highlight the local ecosystem, including  local species such as iguanas and sereques. A similar effort  was done at Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru to map the house reef  and its marine biodiversity to produce in-villa Reef Guides  to help guests explore at their own leisure, in addition to the  fully guided snorkelling and diving outings offered onsite. Banyan Tree Phuket has developed an interactive  experience where guests take part in birdwatching, paddling  along waterway habitats, and learn how local populations  used to live off the land in days past, including  shing  net casting.  Global Awareness In support of raising awareness for both local communities  in Sri Lanka and visiting guests in Maldives, Banyan Tree  Global Foundation supported the publication of two books  highlighting the vital need for conservation: FootFalls in the  Wild: Re ections & Writings of the late Deshabandu Lyn de  Alwis, and Maldives: Underwater Kingdom. the resorts had already gathered 150 samples, and will  continue working towards their target of 500 samples  for analysis. Corals – Maldives and Bintan The Banyan Tree Bintan Conservation Lab conducted  coral planting with guests to celebrate Earth Day,  and also connected with Reefcheck for training and  dialogue in support of Indonesias coral reefs. Angsana  Velavaru continued with its Coral Tunnel Garden effort to  transplant coral onto metal frames to create new reefs  supporting marine biodiversity. Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru  also continued its ongoing monitoring of coral bleaching  to determine which species of coral are most resistant  to higher temperatures, and thus the best candidates for  transplanting in support of new reef creation even during  El Nino events. Coral spawning was also closely monitored  Banyan Tree Bintan Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2011 11  In 2007, Banyan Tree launched a group-wide  effort to monitor and systematically reduce the  energy consumption, water consumption, and  waste production at each resort. The ongoing  target is to conserve resources through more  sustainable operations. EMBRACING THE ENVIRONMENT RESOURCE CONSERVATION Energy  Electric Motor Boats – Banyan Trees GPS Development  Services (GPS) subsidiary conducted a three-month study to  replace the four-stroke gasoline engines powering Laguna  Phukets pontoon ferries with electric motors for cleaner  propulsion. Though conversion of existing ferries to electric  motors was not a reliable or cost-effective solution, the  study found that boats designed to optimise electric motors  will reduce both costs and impacts, thus warranting new  resorts and boats to feature electric motors. Solar Buggies – GPS also conducted a three-month study  in Bintan on solar panels roo ng for guest buggies. The  photovoltaic panels extended mileage between required  charges, thus prologing battery life by some 35%. While the  return on investment for the panels was too long to justify  retro tting existing buggies, the results were favourable  enough to recommend inclusion of new solar buggies when  bringing in new buggies. Because of this, Banyan Tree  Ungasan now features solar buggies among its  eet. Ef cient Lighting – The effort for effective lighting solutions  continued with higher ef ciency installations in Lijiang  (3W LED lighting replaced 35W bulbs in landscape lighting),  Vabbinfaru (garden lighting turned off during two clear  full moon nights every month), Bangkok (savings of some  78,000kWh per year), Ihuru (reducing pathway wattage  and villa wattage by some 617W per villa), Phuket (an  estimated 8.9% reduction in electrical bills), and Maison  Souvannaphoum Hotel (an estimated savings of 7,305kWh  for the year). Timers – Timers on public area air conditioning and car  park lighting in Bangkok (saving some 1,100kWh per month)  as well as on garden lighting in Vabbinfaru (saving some  977kWh per month) and Velavaru (saving some 750kWh per  month) helped reduce energy consumption. Biodiesel – Expanding beyond the 2009 Seychelles practice  of converting used cooking oil into biodiesel, Banyan  Tree Ungasan partnered with CARITAS Switzerland to  donate used cooking oil, which is converted to biofuel and  purchased back for use in garden torch lighting. HVAC Systems – Water heating increasingly relied on  heat pumps to capture waste heat from air conditioners  in Bintan, Ungasan, Sanya, Macau, Velavaru, and Fu Xian  Lake, while Velavaru also began phasing out standard air  conditioners for inverter systems.  Water Landscape Irrigation – Alternate sources for landscape  irrigation included water from draining hot tubs (Bintan and  Macau), capturing rainwater and runoff (Seychelles, Phuket,  Bintan, and Velavaru), and onsite wastewater treatment  (Ungasan and Sanya). Other Measures – Vabbinfaru and Ihuru introduced sealed  1.5L bags into the toilet cisterns to save 1.5L of water per   ush, conserving an estimated 44m3 per month. Phuket  installed waterless urinals in all male public restrooms, while  Ihuru began testing saltwater for  ushing in some toilets,  and Bintan tested  lling hot tubs only upon guest request. Waste Waste Separation – Waste separation practices helped  reduce Ungasans waste sent to land ll (2.6L per guest  night compared with an EarthCheck regional best practice  of 4.2L per guest night) while also helping resorts donate  food waste to local community enterprises in Bintan (to  local duck breeders), Mayakoba (to a local pig farm), and  Bangkok (to nearby pig farms).

Mentorship – The  rst phase of the programme,  mobilises associates from Banyan Tree resorts to  inspire young people between the age of 12 and 18  to achieve what previously might have been beyond  their means. To effectively mentor youths,  associates from Banyan Tree resorts undergo  training conducted by the University of Wales,  which has facilitated national mentoring schemes  in over  ve countries. 2. Scholarships – For young people who cannot afford to  continue their education. 3. Internships – Upon completion of school and  after becoming a young adult, optional internships  provide job training and valuable work experience  in the participating resorts operational areas such  as housekeeping, food and beverage, engineering,  frontline customer service, marketing, reservations,  procurement, security or landscape architecture. A concerted effort to harness Banyan Trees core  competencies to support enhanced long-term  prosperity within communities, Seedlings aims to  guide young people at risk of societal exclusion to  achieve what may have otherwise remained beyond  their means. This programme bene ts the community at  large as it provides the next generation with educational  opportunities. This in turn allows communities to  break the poverty cycle as education is a strong tool  for empowerment. Structured topics help guide mentor-mentee interactions  to address and include discussion of relevant issues and  topics while reinforcing communal values along four key  areas: Social, Environmental, Academic Interests, and  Health & Sports. The Social aspect addresses local cultural issues such as  celebrating local traditions and holidays while also sharing  local arts and crafts to reinforce the importance and beauty  of local heritage.  The Environmental portion includes  eld trips addressing  the importance of natural conservation as well as activities  supporting the environment such as tree planting.  Academic Interests taps into the resorts onsite training  facilities to provide additional language training (English)  as well as basic information technology training sessions to  familiarise students with computers.  Health & Sports focuses on promoting healthy lifestyles  including both active recreation as well as practical  sessions on cooking and nutrition from our in-house  Food and Beverage department.

Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2011 25  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CSR FUNDS Banyan Tree Global Foundation provides greater  assurance to contributing guests that funds will  primarily create social and/or environmental  bene ts for local communities. Green Imperative Fund Mechanism In 2001, Banyan Tree set up the Green Imperative Fund (GIF)  as a mechanism to continue formalising its corporate social  responsibility efforts. The GIF mechanism aims to widen  the reach and effectiveness of the companys efforts by  providing critical  nancial support to worthy environmental  action and community based projects where Banyan Tree  has a presence. At Banyan Tree branded properties, every guest is  invited to be a supporting partner through a small  contribution of US$2 per room night, under an opt-out  arrangement. At Angsana properties, the amount is  US$1 per room per night. Our hotels then match these  guest contributions, dollar for dollar, under the GIF  mechanism. To further link the performance of the resorts  with contributions to the contributions to our Group CSR  fund, each property must maintain a contribution level of  at least 1% of its pro t. Combined with the mechanisms to  match each guests US$2/US$1 per room per night,  the level of the resorts contribution will at times exceed  the amount of guest contribution for that year, but the  amount the hotel contributes will never be lower than  the guest contribution. Resort Autonomous CSR Budget Each year, every property is given an Autonomous CSR  budget for the year amounting to 20% of their previous year  collection and contribution though the GIF mechanism.  This fund can be spend at the complete discretion of the  propertys General Manager and CSR Champion with the  following three prohibitions: – Purchasing turndown gifts for guests; – Paying service charge to associates; and – Paying wages. Eligibility Projects eligible for funding are those which support  communities or environmental issues around the groups  properties. A maximum of 20% of the expenses can be used  for administrative purposes, while the bulk of the funding  must directly support the bene ciaries. Banyan Tree Global  Foundation oversees the  nances of our Group CSR Fund,  allocating funding to worthy projects. In 2009, the Banyan  Tree Global Foundation Board approved a small percentage  of collections that could be invested in research and  development as long as the results of such research were  shared unreservedly and publicly.

Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2011 26  In 2012, we look forward to ongoing internal  streamlining of processes enabling our sustainability  efforts in order to better Embrace the Environment  and Empower People. FUTURE DIRECTIONS As part of our commitment to the journey of sustainability,  the strategic priorities for sustainability are aligned with  enhancing operational ef ciency, protecting biodiversity and  developing local capacity. Immediate targets for this include: External Focus Resource Conservation – We recognise that our locations  provide us with the opportunity to share with local communities,  especially those in more rural locations, the importance and  impacts of conserving resources. This is an area of engagement  we feel can be further developed to the bene ts of the  overall communities of which our resorts are a part.  Greening Communities – While we have planted 147,111  trees exceeding our  ve-year target of 136,000 trees, we  look forward to planting even more trees while connecting  with even more communities through the planting efforts.  Seedlings – Apart from the continued increase of  participating resorts, we will also conduct additional  internal training to enable resorts to have their own  mentor trainers to ensure we can continue to support the  young people who are a part of our Seedlings effort. This  speci cally targets to raise the number of quali ed internal  mentor trainers by some 15 to 20 people. Internal Focus Resource Conservation – We eagerly anticipate the results  of our  rst precinct and multi-sector benchmarking efforts.  Laguna Phuket has begun its efforts as an entire precinct  benchmarking, including Banyan Tree Phuket, Angsana  Laguna Phuket, Laguna Resorts & Hotels, Laguna Holiday  Club Phuket Resort, Laguna Phuket Golf Club, Outrigger  Laguna Phuket Resort & Villas, Laguna Service Company  Limited. In Bintan, we look forward to Banyan Tree Bintan,  Angsana Bintan and Laguna Bintan Golf Club becoming our   rst multi-sector to be benchmarked by EarthCheck.  Capacity Building – To help support the ongoing roll out  of EarthCheck to all properties, we will target training and  capacity building for resort teams to better engage in all  sectors of the benchmarking and certi cation process.  We aim to establish a similar train the trainer approach  as taken with Seedlings mentor training.   Governance – As part of our commitment to sustainability,  we will continue to target practices pushing transparency  and overall governance of our efforts. In 2011, Banyan Tree Phuket joined with Laguna  Phuket to pursue EarthCheck benchmarking as an  entire precinct rather than as a single resort. This  is a signi cant step in benchmarking and certifying  the entirety of our presence in Phuket as it will  cover our sister resorts, our golf course, as well as  the entity managing the common services for the  Laguna Phuket integrated resort. Banyan Tree Holdings Limited Sustainability Report 2011 27  SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE We strongly believe our actions and inactions today  signi cantly impact the future of our children and  grandchildren. We share a responsibility to not only  safeguard but also to enhance both our human and  natural environments. We believe good businesses are  also businesses who do good, and we invite you to join  us in the ongoing journey in pursuit of sustainability. Banyan Tree Global Foundation Structure With the formation of Banyan Tree Global Foundation in  2009, the governance of the Banyan Trees Sustainability  and CSR efforts was formalised under the Singapore-based  Board of Directors for Banyan Tree Global Foundation  including Chairperson Ms Claire Chiang, Co-Chairperson  Mr Ariel Vera, and Chief Financial Of cer Mr Eddy See, and  managed by Coordinating Director Mr Michael Kwee. Banyan Trees two full-time Group CSR Directors then  jointly oversee the Sustainability/CSR teams onsite at each  property. While not all resorts have full-time positions  addressing Sustainability and CSR, all resorts do have  a CSR Champion onsite who is the key contact point for  sustainability. In some cases the CSR Champion is the  resorts General Manager, while in other cases it is either  a full-time dedicated resource or it is a team member  empowered by the resorts General Manager. CSR General Committee First established in 2004, the Banyan Tree CSR General  Committee is made up of all General Managers from  each resort and key management associates of each  resort, including the resorts CSR Champion. In 2008,  we formalised an onsite CSR Committee for each resort,  coordinated by the respective CSR Champion in order to  integrate all the departments at each property. This CSR  General Committee functions as the network to share best  practices and experiences while working towards ful lling  the CSR Strategy Committees and Banyan Tree Global  Foundation Boards directives. We thank you for taking the time to review our efforts for  2011 and look forward to sharing more about our efforts  in future reports.
