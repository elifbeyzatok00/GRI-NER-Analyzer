La aprobacin y difusin  del Cdigo tico supone una oportunidad para el desarrollo  de procedimientos que permitan avanzar en el cumplimiento  de todos los aspectos relacionados con la anti-corrupcin reco- gidos en dicho texto, proporcionando las medidas preventivas  oportunas a implementar en caso de materializarse algn riesgo  de este tipo. en este sentido, durante el 2011, en base a las  conclusiones de los trabajos de auditora realizados, no se ha  detectado ningn riesgo significativo al respecto.   asimismo, durante 2011 no se ha impartido formacin espe- cfica en la materia, aunque el Cdigo tico ha sido debida- mente difundido entre los empleados, habindose iniciado la  formacin sobre el mismo el primer trimestre de 2012. en este  sentido, el Cdigo tico se ha divulgado y comunicado al 100%  de los empleados de UFG, s.a. y Gas directo, siendo firmada su  recepcin por todos los empleados. Cabe destacar que para el  caso de seGas se ha realizado una presentacin a la primera y  segunda Lnea, aprobndose en el Consejo de seGas el conte- nido y aplicacin del Cdigo y estando en curso la divulgacin  del mismo al resto de empleados. el Cdigo se encuentra acce- sible en la pgina web del Grupo UFG.  Relacin con las administraciones pblicas  La posicin del Grupo UFG en las polticas pblicas y su rela- cin con los rganos de las administraciones de los pases en  los que opera se basa en los principios recogidos en el Cdigo  tico del Grupo UFG. La naturaleza poltico-estratgica del  also, since 2009 UFG has belonged to the spanish institute of  internal auditors as a corporate partner. each year, the institute  of internal auditors holds conferences and forums of experts  in which UFG participates, thereby remaining up to date in  relation to matters of internal control, fraud, quality control,  ethics and the most significant trends in the profession. Combating corruption the UFG Groups policy in relation to anti-corruption measures  and practices stems from its Code of ethics, which refers to  anti-corruption measures and the prevention of extortion and  bribery.  Whenever there are indications that make it advisable, the  internal audit department implements specific forensic  initiatives. the approval and dissemination of the Code of  ethics represents an opportunity to develop procedures  that make it possible to forge ahead in the fulfilment of  all the matters relating to anti-corruption included in the  aforementioned text, providing preventive measures to be  implemented should any risks of this kind arise. accordingly,  in 2011, based on the conclusions reached in the audit work  performed, no significant risk in this respect was identified.  in 2011 no specific training on this subject was given, although  the Code of ethics was duly distributed among the employees  and training did in fact begin on the subject in the first  quarter of 2012. in this regard, the Code of ethics has been  communicated to all of the employees of the UFG, s.a. and Gas  directo, who have signed an acknowledgement of receipt. it  should be noted that in the case of seGas a presentation was  given to the first two tiers of management and the companys  board of directors approved the contents and application of  the Code which is currently being disseminated to the other  employees. the Code is available on the UFG Groups website.  Relations with public authorities  the position of the UFG Group in public policies and its  relations with the government bodies of the countries in  which it operates is based on the principles contained in the  UFG Groups Code of ethics. the political and strategic nature  of gas resources means that relations with the institutions  and governments of the various countries are necessary for  the activity of a business that seeks to provide the maximum  value possible in each environment, responding to the local  needs identified and promoting a framework of transparency  and trust based on compliance with prevailing legislation at  all times.  pages 74 to 76 of this report include a list of all the initiatives  and industry associations of which the UFG Group forms part.
