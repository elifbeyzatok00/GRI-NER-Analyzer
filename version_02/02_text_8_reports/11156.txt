Although we do not have data available for all  indicators yet, we report about progress achieved on a yearly basis. 04   PERFoRMAnCE InDICAToRS AnD nARRATIVES for Environment, Society and Governnance (ESG) of EFFAS/DVFA Indicator Name Description 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Comment ESG:   E01-01  (Scope I) Energy   efficiency  Total energy con- sumption: primary  and secondary  sources (in MWh) 467,429 e 368,166 e 270,325 e 192,426 e As in previous year   we expect growth  (under-proportionate   to production increase)   in 2011.

PRoCESS FoR DEFInInG REPoRT ConTEnT MATERIALITy: Materiality is determined by the economic, environmental and social/societal impact of  the various topics and indicators. Disclosure is practiced for the purpose of informing stakeholders. It  includes the topics and indicators which significantly influence the assessments and attitudes of stake- holders. We assume in principle that all Core Indicators contain significant information for the stake- holders in all organizations. However, not all indicators apply to all companies to the same extent.  Regarding Additional Indicators, the data available were not sufficient in some cases. The other indi- cators were not considered relevant or are not applicable.  02  GRI Index p.S04//  The following chart shows that the Annual Report covers topics of equally high priority for society and  the company.

In some  cases we have internal data available which we are not able to disclose because they include confiden- tial information.

STAKEhoLDERS: The main stakeholder groups who will use the present report are investors (sharehold- ers, institutional investors, analysts as intermediaries). In addition, the report will serve to inform  employees and customers (wholesalers, installers, end customers) and suppliers of the SolarWorld  Group. It will also be a source of information for the interested public. REPoRTInG bounDARy As a general rule, the reporting boundary includes all the organizational units that we control and   significantly influence, i.e. all SolarWorld Group companies. Upstream and downstream stages of  the value chain outside the SolarWorld Group are included only to a limited degree, due to lack of  control and influence. Apart from the Group companies, management policy also applies to Solar- World Korea ltd.

Joint ventures are only included if we exert operational control and significant strategic influence with  regard to a specific indicator. Outsourced operations (such as logistics services) are not included. The  reporting boundaries are as congruent as possible with those of the previous year to ensure that report- ing periods and data relating to different structures remain comparable.

MISSIon STATEMEnT, CoDE oF ConDuCT, PRInCIPLES Our vision, our values, our guidelines, our codes (SolarWorld Code of Conduct and SolarWorld  Suppliers Code) and our strategy reflect our economic, environmental and social/societal mission  statements.

Corporate  management and controlp.030//Strategy and actionp.027//Human resources 2010 p.100//   www.solarworld.de/en/vision // Furthermore, SolarWorld signed up to the United Nations Global Compact in 2009 and has pledged  to work for its 10 Principles, and this includes making explicit reference to them in the SolarWorld  Code of Conduct. / 4.6 / / 4.7 / / 4.8 /  Solarworld 2010  DETAILS on SuSTAInAbILITy PERFoRMAnCE  STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT S30 The SolarWorld Code of Conduct is a voluntary groupwide standard for conduct on the basis of appli- cable international and national law, which governs our conduct in areas where no economic or legal  framework is formulated or existing rules do not suffice in SolarWorlds view. The code of conduct  was put to the works councils vote in Freiberg in 2010. In doing so, we complied with a ruling of the  German Federal Court of Labor (BAG) dated July 22, 2008 with a view to the legal stipulations of Sec- tion 87 of the German Works Constitution Act (BetrVG). Upon the works councils approval, the Code  was adopted and signed by the Supervisory Board and Management Board in 2010. We plan to roll out  and communicate the Code groupwide in 2011. Additionally, we plan to include Code topics in initial  and further training schemes we conduct in the group. We will also try to commit our business and contract partners to comply with similar standards. In this  context, we adopted the SolarWorld Suppliers Code in 2009, which is currently being converted into  process standards and is scheduled for communication to suppliers in early 2011.

An internal analysis is made for all stakeholder groups, based on information  available within the company and in external studies. Regular surveys are carried out among our   customers   Operating metrics act as leading indicators p.031//, suppliers and employees.   Human  resources–futuredevelopment p.140// We conduct systematic surveys among our wafer clients,  wholesalers and installers. So far, end customers can only been interviewed on an ad-hoc basis since  such surveys require a lot of time and effort. In the mid-term, we hope to do this for our other stake- holder groups, too. We also maintain close links with the communities at our sites. Moreover, as a  member of various associations and advocacy groups and through our collaboration with scientific  bodies we are engaged in regular exchanges of socio-political views with further stakeholders. We  exchange ideas on topics like Life Cycle, Recycling and Sustainability with members of PV Cycle, the  EPIA (Sustainability Group), Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC), as well as within the Solar Energy  Industry Association (SEIA) and participate in the IEA Task 12 (Sustainability, Health & Safety). We  also make our expertise available by way of panel discussions for example at the PV SEC in Valencia.  In our Solar2World projects   www.solarworld.de/sustainability //, we work closely with the local  stakeholders (e.g. communities and NGOs) in order to offer solutions that will give the population the  maximum benefit and can be continued by the local people themselves after completion of the project.  As a result, the company is aware of the needs and able to take them into account in its decision-mak- ing processes.  When compiling this report, we drew on specialist feedback from ratings agencies and sustainability  experts. We are submitting our Report to the voting for the 2nd CR Reporting Award for the online Cor- porateRegister.com   www.corporateregister.com // and the GRI Readers Choice Awards 2010     awards.globalreporting.org //. We also offer all stakeholders the opportunity to contact us any time  via   placement@solarworld.de // and   sustainability@solarworld.de //.Since 2009, stakeholders have  had the alternative option of sending us an e-mail – anonymously if they so wish – via a contact form  on the website. The Communication on Progress achieved around the 10 Principles of the Global Compact is made  through group reporting procedures, which means it is available to all stakeholders. Stakeholder ini- tiatives can even influence the implementation of these Principles, for example via networks built by/ with stakeholders or standards requested by stakeholders. / 4.16 /  Solarworld 2010  DETAILS on SuSTAInAbILITy PERFoRMAnCE  STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT S38 10  STAKEhoLDER Main stakeholders Instruments Employees Direct contact, employee surveys, existence of works councils,   company suggestions scheme Specifically applicants Direct contact, company presentations Customers (wholesalers,   installers, end customers) Direct contact, annual customer survey Suppliers Direct contact, supplier surveys Shareholders and investors Direct contact, feedback after road shows, corporate news Banks and creditors Direct contact Residents/local population Direct contact e.g. during events at the SolarWorld grounds, in the event   of concerns or complaints voiced; for Solar2World projects direct   involvement in the project Other stakeholders Instruments Analysts/brokers Direct contact, feedback after road shows, investor days, corporate news Governments/agencies Direct contact, interviews Non-governmental organizations  (NGOs) Networks, discussion forums The interested public Reporting, corporate news Workforce representatives/  employee associations Direct contact in negotiations (Professional) associations/  industrial trading groups Direct contact via networks, trade fairs, etc. Competitors Market research, informal discussions Press Interviews, press releases KEy ToPICS AnD ConCERnS RAISED by STAKEhoLDERS SolarWorld is championing compulsory product recovery in the solar industry.

We estimate that 90 percent of our suppliers are  certified according to ISO 9001. EnVIRonMEnTAL Environmental aspects are relevant mainly in our processes, especially in production. Our aim is to  take greater account of the environmental impacts of our business partners. We already estimate  energy consumption throughout the entire value chain, i.e. beyond company boundaries. By adopting  our suppliers code, we have moved another step in that direction. Involving the widely diverse cus- tomer base of wholesalers and installers will be an even greater challenge. To take systematic account  of ecological aspects, we have extended ISO 14001 certification to the whole group including the joint  venture in South Korea. We estimate that 40 percent of our suppliers are certified according to ISO  14001. It goes without saying that our products – the technology for transforming solar energy into  electric power – is also a critical aspect.

Guidelines and processes which should not favor any particular associations or trade  unions: In Freiberg, our compliance with the right to freedom of association is appar- ent by the existence of a works council (current total number of works councils: 15), a  representative body for youth and trainees, a representative body for people with severe  disabilities and a company bargaining agreement concluded with the IG BCE (Industrie- gewerkschaft Bergbau, Chemie, Energie) trade union (applicable for: deutScHe Solar  GmbH, deutScHe cell GmbH, Solar Factory GmbH and SolarWorld innoVationS  GmbH). As a matter of course, we comply with all legal rules and regulations in this  regard (especially with the German Works Constitution Act (BetrVG)). Transparent pro- cesses in selecting applicants, recruitment, promotion to another location or upwards  promotion towards a more senior position and dismissal are ensured through legal, bar- gaining-related and site-specific rules (e.g. a works agreement for vacancies).   The conditions for exercising a function in an association or trade union: It is always our  aim to seek cooperation with the works council, and people who perform tasks for the  works council or for the other bodies mentioned above are given the appropriate time  off to do so and provided with the materials and space they need, as well as funding for  further training, etc. Alongside day-to-day exchange, there is a regular meeting struc- ture for the parties within the company and within the works council bodies. The works  council and the youth and trainees representatives have their own pages/zones on the  Intranet. These bodies can also use the notice boards (in all buildings on the Freiberg  site) and send e-mails to employees. The trade union that organizes within the com- pany (IG BCE) is also granted appropriate information and communication facilities. The  works council and employees naturally also exchange information during open surger- ies, workforce meetings and surveys.   In the U.S., we generally dont have a labor union representing employees.   Human rights clauses and the abolition of child labor and forced labor: suppliers code.   Complaints procedure: Any complaints are handled directly by the respective superior  and/or the HR department. In order to maintain anonymity, there shall be SolarWorld  ombudspersons and a helpline from 2011 (originally planned for 2009).    We offer training schemes for safety practices with regard to our business operations but  we do not offer any specific training programs involving human rights aspects for our  security staff (which isnt necessary because no private security guards are deployed,  apart from reception staff). The Joint Venture in South Korea has a security service for  employees protection (basis is Korean law).   We respect the rights of indigenous people (no conflict constellations to date).

Since 2008, the percentage of recycled operat- ing waste increased from 35 to nearly 60 percent. To quote an example, delivery boxes  and pallets are further used as ceiling bars, trailers or construction sheds. Furthermore,  we were able to improve on our waste avoidance ratio.   Due to a major output increase, environmental indicators rose in absolute terms at our  Hillsboro site but we managed to achieve significant reductions per unit. From January  through November 2010, our consumption of municipal water, power and gas and the  amount of discharge water produced decreased by 40 to 50 percent. As a result, costs  were reduced by 33 to 65 percent. From January through September, the amount of  waste per MWp decreased by a 2-digit percentage value, which made itself felt as cost  savings. However, this positive effect is overlaid by additional consumption triggered by  the start-up of module production.   At our Camarillo site, we were able to reduce energy consumption by making adjust- ments to manufacturing and de-commissioning older plants.

Employees who were employed at the former Munich site are  entitled to direct pension commitments, funded directly by the company. In 2010 the commitments  amounted to  8,029k (2009:  7,995k).   58.Non-currentandcurrentfinancialprovisions p.195//On  top of this, we are planning to introduce a company-specific offer for private pension schemes (under  the Riester pension scheme). In the U.S., there is a program for retirement savings, the SolarWorld 401k program. Under this pro- gram, employees may receive a company match of funds at a rate of US$ 0.50 for every US$ 1.00 contrib- uted by the employee – up to a maximum of 3 percent of annual base rate of pay. All 401k regulations in  the U.S. tax code apply to this program, which is administered by Diversified Investment Advisors. Eligi- bility for this program begins after 90 days of employment in regular status. It is a voluntary program  for all eligible employees. Therefore, participation rates vary from site to site. Participation rates are  37 percent of regular employees as of the end of 2010 (2009: 42). There are no specific programs at the other sites. The amount paid into the programs is determined by  the employees on conversion of compensation. Where funding comes from the employer, the amount is  specified in the contract of employment. Participation is voluntary.   Human resources 2010 p.100// On the basis of the data available to us, no statement can be made concerning the extent to which this  will be used since these data were not collected on a uniform basis so that it is impossible to draw up  statistics (explanation type 2).

Consoli- dated financial statements p.151//There is no company guideline under which preference is given to  local suppliers. The geographical position plays a minor role in selecting suppliers since the equip- ment and commodity market is an international market.

We try to keep the number of expatriates down, but we need some  employees from our existing subsidiaries and from Head Office at the location because that is impor- tant for harmonization of differences between sites. Under various non-discrimination provisions like  the federal agreement on application of equal opportunities legislation (AGG) in Germany and rules  and regulations by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as well as under Affirma- tive Action in the U.S. and pursuant to our groupwide code of conduct, local candidates must not be  given preference nor discriminated against in recruitment process. We adjusted our definition of senior executives (German: leitende Angestellte) to the definition  under the German Works Constitution Act (BetrVG), under which executives include board members  and, where applicable, managing directors. However, we disclose such information also for the 1st level  of management, too, because we believe this distribution is relevant as well (in doing so, we are  exceeding GRI requirements).  / EC4 / / EC6 / / EC7 /  Solarworld 2010  DETAILS on SuSTAInAbILITy PERFoRMAnCE  ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE INDICATORS S49 14  LoCALLy bASED hIRInG oF EMPLoyEES  Locally hired executive staff/employees 2010 2009 2008 2007 Percentage local (board members and managing directors)  Germany 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %  France 0 % n.s. n.s. n.s.

We have taken precautions against all kinds of hazards by means of  technical inspections, personal protection equipment and training courses. The only possible hazard  is due to chemicals, but this is minimized by the above methods of inspection. For purposes of docu- mentation, we record company hygiene and conduct surveys (both of these annually).

However,  we cultivate open and direct relations with employees, which means that any such risk should be noti- fied to us. The legislation in Germany, Spain and the U.S. protects employees against any restrictions  of their rights. At the site in South Africa, we currently have only 4 employees, and at the site in Singa- pore only 7 employees, which favors strong participation of the individual employees in the decisions  of management.

We have been pur- suing this objective since 2008, but as the matter is related to adopting the code of conduct   4.8 p.S29//this is a medium-term project for ourselves.  CoRE // CoRRuPTIon InCIDEnTS AnD ACTIon TAKEn In the reporting period, a corruption incident was ascertained for the first time. The incident did not  occur inside the SolarWorld Group but at a joint venture. According to our zero tolerance principle,  we immediately drew personnel consequences and initiated a criminal prosecution.  CoRE // LobbyInG SolarWorld conducts lobbying work in order to help solar energy become competitive and is an advo- cate of political funding programs. This relates for example to compensation through the German  Renewable Energies Act (EEG). We supported an increase of the annual reduction of the rates of com- pensation in 2010 since they provide the industry with incentives to create cost reductions and quality  improvements. Additionally, SolarWorld supported the idea of integrating photovoltaics into the RoHS  Directive at European level. We are also working worldwide for free access to the electricity grid for  power producers because that is a prerequisite for solar energy to be competitive with other sources of  power. In general terms, we work politically for climate protection, the conservation of resources, sus- tainable development and ethical management. That means our lobbying activity is in conformity with  our declared principles.

It is the responsibility of the Executive Board of Solar- World AG to prepare the Report on Sustainable Corporate Management 2010 in accordance with the  following criteria set out in the G3 Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (pages 7 – 17)   materiality    comparability   stakeholder inclusiveness    Gaccuracy   sustainability context    timelinesst   completeness    clarity and   balance    reliability Our task is to provide an a confirmation for the report on sustainable corporate management on the  basis of our assessment of the report segments KPIs FOR ESG (core performance indicators) and  Performance indicators.  We conducted the audit review on the report segments KPIs FOR ESG (core performance indicators)  and Performance indicators in accordance with the German standards for the audit of sustainability  reports established by the Institute of German Auditors (IDW). Accordingly, the audit review requires  us to comply with professional requirements and to plan and perform the engagement in such manner  that we can rule out, through critical appraisal of the facts, that the report segments have not in all  material aspects been drawn up in accordance with the above-mentioned criteria of the GRI Guide- lines (G3) of the Global Reporting Initiative (pages 7 – 17). An audit review is limited primarily to mak- ing inquiries of company personnel and applying analytical procedures and thus does not provide the  assurance that we would obtain from an audit of financial statements. In the course of our audit review, we acquired the evidence, based on assessments of risks and materi- ality, to obtain limited assurance that report segments KPIs FOR ESG (core performance indicators)  as well as Performance indicators comply with the specified criteria of the GRI- Guideline Version  3.0 of the Global Reporting Initiative (Pages 7 – 17). The nature and extent of our procedures were  determined, with the additional assistance of appropriate samples, by our professional judgment as to  the requirements for obtaining limited assurance. The performance of our engagement included  among other things the following procedures:  S82 Solarworld 2010  DETAILS on SuSTAInAbILITy PERFoRMAnCE  CONFIRMATION OF THE AUDITOR   Inspection of the relevant documentation, including documentation of Group principles and manage- ment and reporting structures, as well as inspection and random testing of existing documents and  systems for compiling, analyzing and aggregating sustainability data   Discussions with the team entrusted with compiling the Report on Sustainable Corporate   Management,   Discussions with employees of other Group divisions   Acquiring an understanding of the process used to identify themes for Report on Sustainable   Corporate Management in 2010   Discussions and inspection of documents at the Bonn and Freiberg sites in relation to the   sustainability data of operations at those sites. With regard to environment data, we were able in the course of our engagement to access data and  information pertaining to regular ISO 9001 and 14001 auditing. The work we performed did not make us aware of any facts which would lead us to assume that the  report segments KPIs FOR ESG (core performance indicators) and Performance indicators were  not drawn up in material respects in accordance with the underlying criteria specified in the GRI  Guidelines (G3) of the Global Reporting Initiative (pages 7 – 17).
