The question posed by some stakeholders to companies is, How are you going to meet your environmental goals while substantially increasing the total volume of consumption? To respond to this challenge, LOral is embedding sustainable consumption at each stage of the product lifecycle.

Reaching one billion new consumers through the universalisation of beauty is the groups strategic objective for years to come. This great project of ours is accompanied by our commitments to show exemplary corporate conduct, meet demanding targets to lighten our environmental footprint, find new ways to consume more sustainably, and contribute to the wellbeing of communities. In other words, our corporate citizenship is inseparable from who we are and what we do, and our core purpose goes to the heart of what it means to be a human being. The use of cosmetics creates a sense of wellbeing, and enables individuals to express their personality and build self-esteem. When individuals share this sense of self and wellbeing with others, the social bonds that are essential to quality of life are strengthened and reinforced. This is LOrals true purpose, and the focus of our activity. A vision of universal beauty LOrals vision depends first and foremost on meeting ambitious economic goals, which provide the basis for achieving sustainable growth and delivering the groups financial results. The ambition to win over a billion new consumers is a significant increase in our scale of operations, effectively doubling our existing consumer base. LOrals adventure is beginning a new chapter, to universalise beauty and this mission offers our group tremendous, long-term prospects for growth. Attracting a billion new consumers means reaching out to extremely diverse groups and populations by offering products tailored to specific needs and contexts but which also reflect a universal vision. Universalisation certainly does not mean uniformity. On the contrary – for LOral, beauty for everyone means beauty for each person. Our research teams, present in every continent, are radically transforming in order to create products for a diverse world, using their expert knowledge of local needs and customs to offer beauty that is perfectly suited to many different consumer aspirations across the world. A human adventure At the heart of our ambition is a human adventure, which is based on our belief in individual talent and the recognition that our company is built from the talent and enterprise of many individual men and women. Equally important, our group is founded on strong values of social responsibility, respect, a pioneering spirit, boldness, integrity and excellence. These attributes are valued by potential young recruits to our company, reflecting LOrals recent ranking as 11th among all global companies that they aspire to join. LOrals human resources strategy has been recognised in several countries, particularly in France, where the group was awarded the 2010 Human Capital Trophy for the quality of its initiatives. It is this human adventure that lends strength, coherence, originality and above all, great vitality to our corporate ambition to serve two billion consumers in the coming years. Inseparable from this is our dedication to becoming a model of responsible, shared and sustainable development. Our efforts to date have placed LOral among the 100 most sustainable companies in the world for the fourth year running. To become the model corporate citizen of our ambition, we have identified four key priorities. Contributing to a more beautiful life and a better world is LOral's constant ambition LOral has been a signatory to the UN Global Compact (UNGC) since 2003. We remain committed to its 10 Principles VIEWPOINTS FROM OUR CHAIRMAN & CEO ABOUT LORAL SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ECONOMIC AFFAIRS IN CLOSE-UP: SUNCARE PRODUCTS ETHICS UN GLOBAL COMPACT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RATINGS AND AWARDS CONTACT DOWNLOADS GROUP REPORT HOME SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2010 BUSINESS  INNOVATION  PRODUCTION  CONSUMPTION  TALENT  COMMUNITIES  DATABANK  Behave ethically and responsibly in every daily activity We know that the sustainability of our company depends greatly on maintaining relationships of trust with all our internal and external stakeholders, including shareholders, private and public partners, and consumers. Each expects exemplary conduct from LOral. This is why we are constantly striving to add to employee and stakeholder awareness and knowledge of ethics and corporate responsibility. At our last Ethics Day event, which we organise every year, more than 16,000 employees took part in our online seminar during which they communicated directly with myself and other senior management, asking more than 800 questions. We are convinced that tomorrows leaders will be companies that have integrated ethical considerations into corporate strategy as well as daily business activities. Promote the diversity of human capital We fimly believe that diversity, which forms part of our business culture, creates value because it brings greater creativity, greater performance and a better understanding of our consumers. Our first Diversity Overview Report for France, published in 2010, shows the wide scope of our engagement. Our goal is to extend this internationally and to establish across the entire group initiatives to promote, measure and recognise efforts in diversity management. Invent new approaches to environmental sustainability The world leader in beauty has an absolute duty to help to preserve the beauty of the planet and environmental sustainability is a key commitment for LOral. Even though the cosmetics industry has a limited environmental footprint, for many years LOral has been proactive in driving forward major programmes in resource efficiency, biodiversity and protection of the biosphere. As a result, we are well on the way to achieving extremely stretching targets to reduce our CO  emissions, water consumption and waste production – by 50% in each case, from 2005 to 2015. Already, at the halfway stage, we have reduced water consumption by 19%, CO  emissions by 27% and waste volumes by 23%. We are equally convinced that sustainable innovation is the pathway towards better, responsible consumption. Our laboratories have for many years embraced this strategy, which encompasses all the lifecycle stages of our products. We continue to invest in eco-design, the eco-evaluation of our ingredients and green chemistry. We are incorporating more and more renewable raw materials with a low environmental impact and today 40% of our raw materials are of plant origin. Share the benefits of sustainable growth For 12 years, our corporate citizenship has developed and grown. Led by the L'Oral Foundation (the second largest Foundation in France in terms of funds), our programmes have had a real impact in three key areas: science, education and solidarity. Many of the programmes focus on occupational integration, rehabilitation and restoring self-esteem and dignity to individuals. This, for us, is the true meaning of beauty for everyone. Our sustainability strategy is built on five key principles: Integrating sustainable development within the groups global strategy. Our corporate governance is fully aligned with this ambition, and in 2010 the Strategy and Implementation Committee of the Board of Directors became the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee. The change reflects the Boards commitment to ensuring that all necessary means and resources are directed towards the broad range of challenges associated with sustainable development A long-term vision. This is demonstrated in the actions and commitments of our teams : 20 years effort in environmental protection; 30 years research effort into alternative methods to avoid animal testing; more than 12 years partnership with UNESCO to promote the role of women in science and create a better world. These programmes and investments are sustained and long-term in order to maximise their positive impacts Engagement by our employees on a daily basis, at every level and in every area, complemented by a network of employees specifically focused on sustainable development Achieving continuous progress through concrete goals, efficient initiatives and measurable, sustainable change Systematic evaluation of global performance across a broad range of economic, human, environmental and societal indicators. At the heart of all the groups activities, there is a profound desire to engage everyone in a sense of mission to achieve our goals: to offer men and women everywhere the best cosmetics in terms of quality, efficacy and safety, and meet their needs and aspirations for beauty in all its diversity. LOrals engagement draws on a vision of corporate responsibility in which economic success, human progress and social development go hand in hand. Providing access to products that add to quality of life, while safeguarding the planets natural capital and contributing to society, are the key ways in which LOral can create value to benefit everyone. Contributing to a more beautiful life and a better world is LOrals constant ambition.

The Body Shop www.thebodyshop.com  Business / Sustainability strategy  Sustainability strategy LOrals approach to sustainable consumption incorporates and focuses the various institutional and operational agendas which are interdependent within the company. Strategic management of sustainable consumption requires responsible dialogue with consumers to define together new aspirations for evolving life styles, respecting diversity and ensuring the largest number of people can access the benefits of innovation. It also requires developing new research paradigms and new production technologies to protect the natural and societal environment. An outcome of our sustainable growth strategy At LOral, our strategy for sustainable growth is based on: Integrating sustainable development principles into innovation, products and processes An equitable and sustainable business model that respects the environment and that delivers economic performance while at the same time meeting our societal responsibility A commitment to optimising intangible value drivers, particularly human and intellectual capital, and stakeholder relations. Sustainable development is therefore a driver for responsible growth and a source of inspiration for our brands. It means growing responsibly As we progress in our ambition to win the trust and confidence of a billion new consumers in the next 10 years, a responsible approach becomes even more essential. In emerging markets we see an increasing aspiration for a western lifestyle, and the economic and societal benefits associated with it. This trend worries some stakeholders CORPORATE CONSUMER RESPONSIBILITY UNGC COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS ETHICS PROGRAMME Sustainable consumption is a shared responsibility between industry and all its stakeholders.

To respond to this key challenge, LOral is embedding sustainable consumption at each stage of the life cycle of its products. Through sustainable innovation that integrates ethical policies and advanced research in the selection of new ingredients and the development of eco-design and the use of green chemistry. Responsibly managing our production, packaging and supply chain to significantly reduce our environmental and societal impact wherever we operate. Our 2015 targets are ambitious: 50% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, waste and water consumption per finished product. Our fair trade policy and commitment to local communities are fully integrated into our business decision making process. The other question some stakeholders ask is: Are you destroying local cultures in emerging nations by transferring / imposing our Western model? LOral strongly believes that innovation must be conceived close to where consumers are living, and must be responsive to their perceived needs and aspirations. The best way to achieve sustainable consumption is to: Deliver on performance and quality, based on the best global practices Take into account local cultural habits; for example, in India, the kajal, used in traditional make-up, is a great source of inspiration for us in developing new products. We are particularly vigilant to take care of the local natural and societal environment that drives the way consumers choose and use cosmetics. Corporate Consumer Responsibility Policy At LOral, we apply our 'Corporate Consumer Responsibility' Policy in every activity – from research and innovation to sourcing and production, and from marketing to consumer relations. From a global perspective, it is essential to understand that companies cannot meet the challenge of sustainable consumption alone. Consumers have a major role to play, along with the rest of society, to ensure that what is consumed today does not exceed what the world can provide tomorrow.  Business / Sustainability topics  Sustainability topics Why is an ageing society significant for LOral and its consumers? How do we approach biodiversity challenges? What is our position on scientific breakthroughs such as adult stem cell research? These and other key sustainability topics have been identified through active engagement and consultation with our stakeholders.

We aim to create value over the long term for the largest possible number of stakeholders who have an interest in our business and its success. Review of 2010 In the context of a stronger global cosmetics market, LOral achieved strong turnover growth. The group accelerated in every field, in all channels and across all business units. Outpacing the market, LOral confirmed its position as the world leader in beauty. 2010 was a year of breakthroughs for the group during which several of our brands achieved spectacular successes: LOral Professional achieved worldwide success with its INOA hair colourants; Maybelline confirmed its leading position in make-up with a very wide consumer appeal; Yves Saint Laurent enjoyed a major revival; and La Roche-Posay, the brand recommended by 25,000 dermatologists worldwide, continued to expand. Geographically, LOral advanced in Western Europe and strengthened its positions in North America. Our New Strategic Markets continued to go from strength to strength, particularly Asia- Pacific and Latin America. LOral China became the groups third cosmetics subsidiary with a turnover exceeding one billion euros. This performance confirms the groups strategic direction adopted at the end of 2008: accessible innovation, new product categories, rapid brand globalisation and strengthened investment in research and promotions. 2010 was also a year of strong financial results; the operational efficiency initiatives adopted by the group two years ago are continuing to bear fruit. LOral is well positioned and ready to grasp strategic opportunities, driven by our ambition to attract one billion new consumers. We are turning a new page in our history: making beauty universal and available to all. Inspired by an encouraging start to the year, we have confidence in the groups capacity to achieve another year of turnover growth and profitability in 2011. A growing market After having resisted well throughout 2008 and 2009, the cosmetics market got off to a good start in 2010. With estimated growth of 4.2%* over the year, the market reverted to growth levels similar to previous levels, confirming consumers deep attachment to beauty products. * Excluding soap, toothpaste and razors.

This set of countries, which already represents 50% of the global cosmetics market, will grow by 80% in the coming years. The major strategic choices made in recent years, and the deep-seated changes undertaken in 2010, have primed LOral to meet this new expansion phase. Almost unlimited potential The emerging countries represent vast populations of new consumers, and this is set to continue. In 2020, middle-class socioeconomic groups in these countries will number some 2.7 billion people, compared with 1 billion in 2010(1). Today, western consumers account for approximately two-thirds of the sum spent by middle class groups worldwide. In 20 years, 70% of these sums will be spent by the middle classes in Asia, Latin America and Africa(2). By this date, the world population will have increased by 25% and the number of consumers with access to modern cosmetics will have increased by nearly 50%. In fact, once basic needs have been satisfied, per capita consumption in cosmetics will grow exponentially. These countries, where the per capita consumption is still ten times less than that in the developed markets, are only just starting to experience modern cosmetics products. This major shift in the market is providing unprecedented opportunities and driving our ambition to attract one billion new consumers. Today, LOral derives the majority of its turnover from less than 15% of the global population. In ten years, however, we should have as many customers in Asia- Pacific as in the whole of Europe and the United States together. Our horizons are broadening. Targeting two billion consumers is a considerable change for the group in terms of scale and ambition. As this new world takes shape, LOral is turning over a new page in its history; the universalisation of beauty. Responsible growth The group ensures healthy long-term geographic and sector-based balance for its brands and increases the rate of its international expansion through a highly selective acquisition policy. Localised production The group's growth is never achieved at the expense of its corporate responsibility: by manufacturing locally wherever feasible, we contribute to local economic development, applying the principles outlined in our Code of Business Ethics. Investments LOral applies the highest standards of quality and innovation in the creation of its products in order to ensure the total satisfaction of our consumers. This involves significant investment in technology and particularly in Research & Innovation.

A preferential dividend of +10% is thus offered to all holders of registered shares - whether directly or managed - for at least two years*, to reward those who support the company over the long term. Shares held in registered form enable LOral to get to know its shareholders better, and to offer them more advantages. The number of shareholders signing up for registered shares has increased very sharply over the last two years. * The preferential dividend is subject to a limit of 0.5% of the share capital per shareholder. The first preferential dividend will be paid in 2012 on the dividend for 2011, for shareholders who have continuously held registered shares – whether directly or managed – from 31st December, 2009 until the payment date of the dividend after the Annual General Meeting of 2012.

In Asia and Latin America, sunscreen products are regulated in a positive list of approved cosmetic substances. In the United States and Australia, they are listed in parapharmaceutical monographs. LOral has pioneered and campaigned to strengthen public protection against UVA rays and there is now a specific UVA logo for suncare products in Europe, with Asia to follow suit. Ethics and integrity LOral uses an array of scientific methods and tools to evaluate the performance, safety and potential environmental and social impact of every ingredient used in its suncare products. The evaluation strategy uses predictive methods based on reconstructed skin models, which enables us to limit in vivo testing. Diversity LOral is an expert in geocosmetics, which includes the study of skin characteristics, and of consumer and cultural norms, in every part of the world. This helps us to evaluate the impact of exposure to the sun according to individual skin type (greasy or dry), different climatic conditions and different uses such as swimming in the sea. While tanning may be an aspiration in certain societies, in others, the desire is to keep a light skin colour. Business / In Close Up: Sunscreen  In Close Up The development of suncare products mirrors the growth of leisure, forming part of a real social and cultural revolution in industrialised nations. Suncare products also have a functional role to protect people continuously exposed to the sun due to work or living conditions. Suncare products are closely linked with the pleasures of free time but they also have a true public health purpose.

Ethics LOral is based on core values: respect, integrity and the pursuit of excellence, supported by courage and transparency. Our commitment to act in an ethical and responsible manner is summarised in a document called "The LOral Spirit". The LOral Spirit is available to everyone at loreal.com. Ethics and sustainability Ethics is at the heart of LOrals commitment towards sustainable growth and consumption. The L'Oral Spirit forms the framework for LOrals policies with regards to corporate governance, environmental stewardship, health and safety, social affairs and diversity, supplier relations, sustainable innovation, corporate consumer responsibility and philanthropy. LOrals Code of Business Ethics The Code of Business Ethics, available in 43 languages, is the reference document for ethics within L'Oral. It applies to all employees, officers and directors of the group and subsidiaries worldwide. All employees receive their own personal copy. The Code of Business Ethics was first issued in 2000. In 2007, the Code was updated with the help of employees from 22 countries via international working groups in Asia, Europe, North America and Latin America. The Code was then validated by each Country Manager, Human Resources Manager and local counsel to make sure it was applicable locally. To underline the importance of this document, LOrals Chairman and Chief Executive Officer both signed the foreword, and the introduction is signed by the entire Management Committee. The Code of Business Ethics is regularly reviewed in order to improve it, if necessary. Employees are encouraged to give their feedback on the Code. Country Managers are responsible for ensuring that the Code of Business Ethics is respected at local level. The Group Director of Ethics The Group Director of Ethics reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. Further information: interview with Emmanuel Lulin, Group Director of Ethics. The role of the Group Director of Ethics includes promoting and integrating ethical best practices across the group, providing help in ethical decision-making, training employees and addressing any possible complaints. The Group Director of Ethics regularly measures and assesses results and provides periodic reports to the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee.

With 17 additional appointments in 2010, the worldwide network of Ethics Correspondents means that 93% of employees have a local correspondent. Open Talk Employees are encouraged to raise any concerns with their management. Additional resources are available in certain countries such as Human Resources, Ethics Correspondents, staff representatives, grievance procedures or helplines. Employees may also contact the Group Director of Ethics via a dedicated and secure website. A strict non-retaliation policy applies for all concerns raised in good faith. Ethics and performance management LOral employees are appraised not only on their results but also on the way in which such results are obtained. Two ethical competencies are now part of LOrals appraisal system worldwide – Act/Lead with human sensitivity and Obtain results with integrity. Ethics and restructuring LOrals sustainable growth is the best guarantee for its employees. In order to achieve this objective, LOral must continually adapt to its environment. This can give rise to restructuring, particularly given the current difficult economic climate. Any decision likely to affect the job and working life of employees is taken only after careful consideration. Our values of respect and integrity guide us in such situations. We communicate clearly and regularly to make sure that our employees are fully informed, and ensure an on-going dialogue with our employees and staff representatives. When redundancies prove unavoidable, we aim to maintain employment by supporting employees in their professional reorientation, in particular through internal redeployment or solutions adapted to each individual situation. Ethics training The Ethics Training Programme is part of the induction of new joiners, and there are also seven other specific modules, including for country managers, procurement teams and recruitment. External initiatives LOral has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since June 2003 and is a member of the French network of the Global Compact (Forum des Amis du Pacte Mondial).

In 2010, the theme was "The LOral Spirit". The central event was a live webchat with LOral's CEO, accessible to all staff around the world from their workstation. Countries organised local events including meetings with country managers, local online discussions, games and quizzes and the online session with our Chief Executive was broadcast in meeting areas and staff restaurants. Between 15,000 and 17,000 employees followed this event in 2010 and almost 800 questions were asked. Employee feedback on the event was very positive and the online discussion will be held again in 2011. LOral named by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the Most Ethical Companies LOral was chosen among a record participation of thousands of companies in more than 100 countries and 36 industry sectors. Following an in-depth survey and several stages of evaluation, shortlisted companies had to demonstrate exemplary conduct in ethical engagement and a positive societal contribution to local communities.

LOral for Ethics Excellence Bursary This bursary is for students who are studying ethics in their vocational training. The winners are selected on academic excellence and the quality of an essay submission. In 2010, the theme was The importance of ethics for business leaders of tomorrow. Romanian student Alexandru Szel was one of two students who won the 2010 "L'Oral for Ethics" Excellence Bursary awarded this year by the group. Alexandru is entering his third year as a student at Babes Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca and he was strongly recommended by his teacher, Mr Imre Ungvari Zrinyi, following his genuine interest in the Ethics in Economy course. Interview with Alexandru: When did your interest in ethics start? As a student, my first contact with ethics in the economy was in the second semester of my first year, as we had an optional subject called Ethics in Economy, which I had decided to follow. It was really interesting as we had to watch a TV show called "Business Responsibility" on the financial TV channel 'Money Channel', and write our impressions of it. During the seminars we had to watch different types of films on the subject of ethics and draft presentations about it. It seemed very interesting to learn about important companies and how they include ethics in their business and how you have to lead a company so that it operates responsibly in society. I've learned interesting facts from this course and I have to admit that I really started to be interested in this subject. What does the "LOral for Ethics" Excellence Bursary represent for you? I didn't think I would win this bursary as the competition was strong. For me, this bursary represents a great chance to broaden my knowledge of ethics in business and I take this opportunity very seriously. Now, I can really say that ethics has become a part of my life. What are your future plans regarding the study of ethics, having been awarded this bursary?

With the help of my ethics teacher, I have found a summer school on Finance, Economics and Ethics, in Salerno, Italy, where I will learn more about the connection between the financial crisis and ethics. More precisely, there will be a series of workshops on investigating possible guidelines for future socio-economic models and on the proper role of finance in these new models, looking at ethics as a new emerging concept of value. The workshops will try to find answers to questions such as: "Are there any tools and ways to give more importance to the ethical nature of finance? How should the financial tools aimed at supporting ethical business be used? What might be the role of the new media in this process?" Starting in September, I will study for half a year as an Erasmus student at Corvinus University, Budapest, and there I will have the possibility to take up further courses on Corporate Responsibility, Ethics in Marketing, or Civil Service Ethics. It is also one of my plans to attend ethic courses during my masters degree. In your essay you emphasised the characteristics of an ethical leader. What makes a great ethical leader? It's important to note that the ethical climate of a workplace matters to employees. The leaders of corporations have a responsibility to be leaders in the community as well. In other words, a great business leader should have a sense of social responsibility. A great ethical leader should be ethical in all areas of life, and be capable of leading a company in such a way that all of the stakeholders are satisfied and the company should be profitable, capable of developing and acting responsibly in society. The ethical leader will always have an advantage.

Policy and training We address human rights in our ethics training courses. In addition, several chapters of our Code of Business Ethics are devoted to the practical implementation of human rights – in particular Health, Safety and Security, Diversity, Harassment and Bullying, Sexual Harassment, Privacy, Contribution to the Community, Supplier Selection and Fair Treatment of Suppliers. Child labour LOral has chosen to set the minimum age of 16 for all its employees, which is higher than the minimum age set by the Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO). All LOral subsidiaries are required to check the age of employees upon hiring. Our suppliers and subcontractors can request a waiver from the Group Purchasing Director upon presentation of a complete file (schooling, type of contract, hiring conditions, type of work). These waivers are only possible for apprenticeships or for children carrying out light work if this work does not affect their health and safety or their regular attendance at school, where the local law allows it and when the supplier/subcontractor has appointed an internal tutor for the children. Employees aged 16 to 18 also benefit from special attention; they are not allowed to work nights or overtime, handle dangerous machinery or carry heavy loads. See our policy on Suppliers/Subcontractors and Child Labour. Supply chain LOral seeks to ensure that human rights are respected throughout its supply chain. Through LOrals Buy & Care programme, all our suppliers and subcontractors are asked to comply with the Group's General Terms of Purchase and Payment, which include an undertaking to comply with the Fundamental Conventions of the ILO and local legislation – for example, in terms of minimum wage, working hours and health and safety. Regular audits are carried out in order to monitor compliance. Our own plants and distribution centres regularly undergo the same social responsibility audits that we impose on our suppliers and subcontractors. These are carried out by the same external auditors using exactly the same criteria. Monitoring Country Reporting Ethics, our annual ethics reporting system, covers all the themes covered in our Code of Business Ethics, providing us with a full analysis of initiatives carried out at country level and enabling us to assess the Group's performance with regards to human rights.

Business / Corporate governance  Corporate governance An independent, available and vigilant Board of Directors The LOral Board of Directors considers that the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code of December 2008 are in line with the companys corporate governance approach. This Code is therefore used by the company as its reference when drawing up the Chairmans Report on the conditions in which the Boards work is prepared and organised (pages 110 to 113 of the 2010 Reference Document). General managements functions In 2006, the Board of Directors appointed Mr Jean-Paul Agon as Chief Executive Officer, and in order to prepare for the future of the company and ensure a smooth transition in its management, wished at the time to separate the role of Chief Executive Officer from that of Chairman of the Board of Directors, which was entrusted to Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones. Since then, the Board has noted firstly that this arrangement has been satisfactory, particularly in view of the quality of the relationship between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, and secondly that this measure proved very useful during a period of economic crisis. At its meeting on Thursday, 10th February 2011, the Board of Directors, which noted the quality of the results for 2010, decided to reunify the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, considering that the environment was once again favourable. When Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones, in accordance with his original intention of stepping down as Chairman at the age of 65, decided to place his office at the disposal of the Board on 17th March 2011, the Board appointed Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LOral. Mr Jean-Paul Agon has been Chief Executive Officer of LOral since 2006. Sir Lindsay Owen- Jones, who continues to be a member of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the LOral Foundation, has been appointed Honorary Chairman. Directors with a complementary range of experience The directors of LOral come from different spheres; they complement each other in terms of their diverse professional experience and expertise, and they have a good knowledge of the company. The directors are present, active and closely involved. These are all assets for ensuring the quality of the Boards deliberations and the preparation of its strategic decisions. The directors are independent in their thinking, have a duty of vigilance, and exercise complete freedom of judgement. This freedom of judgement enables them in particular to participate in a totally independent way in the work of the Board and its Committees. The Board of Directors of LOral comprises 14 members: the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, six directors from the majority shareholders, three of whom represent Mrs Bettencourts family group, and three of whom represent Nestl (the two Vice-Chairmen of the Board being chosen from among these members), and six independent directors: Annette Roux, Charles-Henri Filippi, Xavier Fontanet, Bernard Kasriel, Marc Ladreit de Lacharrire and Louis Schweitzer. Mr Ladreit de Lacharrire has been a director of LOral for more than 12 years, but his professional experience and his freedom of judgement, combined with his good knowledge of the company, make a considerable contribution to the Boards discussions and decisions. Systematic annual self-evaluation Every year, the Board reviews its composition, organisation and modus operandi. It considers the avenues of possible progress and makes any improvement that it considers appropriate. The Board met five times in 2010, with an average attendance rate of 98.5%. In 2010, the Board of Directors devoted one whole day to analysing various strategic aspects and strategic monitoring, in the presence of several senior managers.

Furthermore, the functioning of the Committees was found to be satisfactory, with extensive and thorough preparatory work. Finally, in 2010, the Board was provided with regular information on the groups business activities, and, at the end of the year, the directors expressed new wishes in this area, and made proposals for subjects to be discussed at meetings in 2011.

(2)(3)  Business / Corporate Governance / Board Committees  Board Committees Actively involved Committees prepare for Board meetings The Committees act strictly within the framework of the remit given to them by the Board. They are actively involved in preparing the Boards work, and make proposals, but do not have any decision- making powers. The Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee This Committee clarifies, through its analyses, the strategic orientations submitted to the Board, and monitors the implementation and advancement of significant operations in progress. It ensures that the main financial balances are preserved. It reviews the main lines of development, options and strategic projects presented by the General Management, together with their economic and financial consequences, acquisition opportunities, and financial transactions that may significantly change the balance sheet structure. The Committee met four times in 2010. Along with the constant and close review of the groups business activity and the analysis of markets and competitors, the Committee monitored the economic conditions during emergence from the crisis, after having (in 2009) noted the strategic decisions taken by the general management at a very early stage to tackle the difficult economic environment. Furthermore, the Committee was called on to study projected acquisitions. The Audit Committee This Committee is, in particular, responsible for monitoring the process of preparing financial information, the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, the auditing of the annual and consolidated financial statements, and the independence of the Statutory Auditors. Mr Charles-Henri Filippi, LOral director and a financial expert, is the Chairman of the Committee. The Committee met five times in 2010. It reviewed the evolution of the main items of the profit and loss accounts and balance sheets. It considered that the work of the Internal Audit Department and the Internal Control process put in place,from the risk viewpoint, are improving in quality. After taking note of the French financial markets authority (AMF) Report of July 2010 on the functioning of Audit Committees, the Committee found that its work was carried out in a framework complying with AMF recommendations. The Committee examined the conditions of industrial and environmental risks management and of those linked to quality and safety in product design. It noted that the systems and processes put in place, which are based on a sound methodology, are comprehensive and satisfactory. Finally, the Committee is regularly informed of legal risks and of any litigation and, once ayear, meets the Statutory Auditors without the presence of the management. The Human Resources and Remuneration Committee This Committee makes proposals on matters including, in particular, the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, the amount of attendance fees to be submitted to the Annual General Meeting and the method of distribution of such fees, and the implementation of long-term incentive plans, such as those providing, for example, for distributions of stock options or for free grants of shares. The Committee met four times in 2010 to consider all these matters. In connection with the proposal made to renew the Chief Executive Officers term of office, the Committee proposed to the Board that his contract of employment should continue to be suspended, which was accepted by the Board. After the closing of accounts, it made proposals to the Board with regard to the remuneration of the corporate officers and the implementation of a plan relating to stock options and conditional allocations of shares to employees concerning a large number of people. The Board approved the Committees proposals, particularly with regard to the performance conditions to be achieved by the Chief Executive Officer (who must, furthermore, conserve some of the options that he exercises) and by the members of the Executive Committee. The Appointments and Governance Committee The Appointments and Governance Committee makes proposals to the Board on the choice of directors, examines the expediency of separating the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, clarifies the Boards decision concerning the conditions in which the general management is exercised and the status of corporate officers, discusses the independent director qualifications reviewed each year by the Board, ensures that the Corporate Government Code to which the company refers is applied, and prepares for the Boards decisions about updates to its Internal Rules. It also ensures the implementation of the succession plans for the corporate officers in the event of an unforeseen vacancy, and conducts the reflection process with regard to the Committees in VIEWPOINTS FROM OUR CHAIRMAN & CEO ABOUT LORAL SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY TOPICS PERFORMANCE SUMMARY ECONOMIC AFFAIRS IN CLOSE-UP: SUNCARE PRODUCTS ETHICS UN GLOBAL COMPACT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE > BOARD OF DIRECTORS > BOARD COMMITTEES RATINGS AND AWARDS CONTACT DOWNLOADS GROUP REPORT HOME SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2010 BUSINESS  INNOVATION  PRODUCTION  CONSUMPTION  TALENT  COMMUNITIES  DATABANK  charge of preparing for the Boards work. The Committee met three times in 2010. When the Directorss terms of office were considered for renewal, the Committee proposed that the Board should review the situation of each of its members on a case-by-case basis, in particular in light of the independence criteria set out in the Afep-Medef Code. In the 2010 Reference Document, the independent directors are clearly qualified as such, in light of the criteria adopted by the Board. The Committee also confirmed its wish to carry out a harmonious renewal of directors terms of office, and it made proposals to the Board in the framework of the Annual General Meeting. Finally, the Committee examined the evolution of the Executive Committee and the talent pool for the future, and stated its view concerning a possible succession plan. In view of the broad spectrum of matters entrusted to the Committees, the Board has modified the names of two Committees to better reflect the extent of their remits. The Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee In the framework of the strategic orientations which this Committee studies and validates, the Board is extending the Committees remit by ensuring that the companys commitments in the field of Sustainable Development, in light of the challenges which are specific to the groups business activities and objectives, are fully taken into account. In this framework, the Committee examines the means and resources put in place, and reports on them to the Board. The Human Resources and Remuneration Committee The Committee is extending its remit to include all aspects of Human Resources Policy, such as social relations, recruitment, diversity, talent management and securing employee loyalty. The Committee also ensures that best practices in ethical matters, as set out in the Code of Ethics, and the groups key values, such as respect and integrity, are widely disseminated, known and practised.  Business / Ratings and awards  Ratings and awards Among the worlds top 100 responsible, ethical companies LOrals sustainable development initiatives received widespread recognition in 2010.

This is a fundamental shift in our world. It is part of what I have called the 40 trillion dollar green tech revolution. Green tech innovation is a fundamental shift that is here to stay. It will transform our future over the next 20 to 30 years. And the reason is – consumers demand it, politicians are required to deliver it in terms of regulation, and businesses are expected to build it into every aspect of their systems, processes and products.  Patrick Dixon, Chairman, Global Change Sustainable innovation means taking human, environmental and ethical considerations into account very early in the research process in order to create new ideas and concepts. This is exactly what we have done at LOral for more than 20 years. For example, we have strongly invested in the field of alternative methods. Today we are accelerating this process by developing predictive methods that use integrated strategies to innovate better, faster and earlier.

In 2010, research at LOral underwent great changes to meet the vast diversity of needs of a new generation of consumers in the emerging markets. With new tools, new structures and new approaches, LOral is ready to rise to the challenge of beauty for all while actively promoting sustainable innovation and consumption. With this challenge in mind, our research teams are adapting their practices, revising their projects and reinforcing their efforts to place the consumer at the very heart of their mission, as well as positioning sustainable development at the core of their activities. LOrals innovation strategy is thus deepening its respect for the three key values that determine its research work: Openness – generating and exchanging cutting-edge knowledge, backed up by dialogue with stakeholders and our partners Ethics – designing effective products that enhance a persons well-being and respect the socio-economic environment, ecosystems and future generations Responsibility – identifying and preventing any impacts that ingredients or products may have on the environment throughout their entire life cycle.

Developing the first hair care probiotic Predicting the efficacy and safety of raw materials and formulas The LOral Gerland centre in Lyon is fast becoming the worlds leading centre for predictive assessment in cosmetics. It is dedicated to the predictive assessment of efficacy and safety in ingredients and products. It has doubled in size, its staff has increased four-fold and the centres production of biological tissues – skin and cornea – in accordance with the ISO 9001 quality standards now exceeds 160,000 units per year, compared with 70,000 in 2007.

First Asian reconstructed skin models in China: The LOral Advanced Research laboratories in Pudong have developed the first Asian reconstructed skin models. After five years' work, several models have been developed: a simple epidermis model, a pigmented epidermis model and a complete model with epidermis and dermis. Used to study pigmentation and ensure our products are harmless, these models have enabled the entire skin-irritation protocol approved in Europe to be reproduced.

The variety of reconstructed skin models enables different efficacy-assessment models for ingredients and formulas to be developed, and their reliability is continuously increased through the use of the latest scientific techniques such as genomics and proteomics. The stock of knowledge and data on substances, and the predictive methods that R&I have at their disposal, add value in three ways. They are used to enable the safety assessment of ingredients and formulas, measure the efficacy of ingredients and select, rationalise and endorse the most promising design programmes for new active substances from the earliest stages. For over 20 years, the development of tissue engineering in particular has advanced in line with this dynamic, producing tools for the biological analysis of skin and supporting innovation. In fact, the reconstructed skin models represent a unique tool for predicting human physiological reactions by perfectly imitating the conditions under which the products are applied. In 2009, for example, the models enabled us to gain an objective view of the cosmetic efficacy of new essential oils such as lemon balm. Towards an integrated predictive efficacy-assessment strategy Specific measurement protocols are being developed by LOral Advanced Research to create an integrated predictive-assessment strategy for efficacy. The ultimate objective is to achieve a sufficiently reliable level of prediction that will represent an alternative to clinical trials. In other respects, the dossier on the efficacy of the principle molecules developed by LOral relies increasingly on the data gained from assessments carried out in accordance with in vitro protocols.

Advances in knowledge In 2009, R&I completed the genome map of skin, based on reconstructed skin, in a joint project with Laval University in Qubec and the Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris. This ten-year research programme achieved numerous advances in terms of knowledge and, in particular, the discovery of the skin proteome. In 2010, after 10 years of research and collaboration with the University of Cleveland, researchers identified one of the keys to young-looking skin: papillary fibroblasts, cells in the outer dermis of the skin that play a major role in skin regeneration. Papillary fibroblasts alter and disappear gradually with age, while the reticular fibroblasts of the inner dermis skin layers are preserved. This discovery enabled the researchers to select and patent a skin-repair substance, Rhamnose. The aim is now to build on this knowledge in order to refine the selection of new ingredients and maximise their cosmetic properties in increasingly tailored products. From design to formulation Virtually all LOrals ingredient-development programmes are part of a new approach extending from design to formulation. Several key initiatives have been implemented to achieve this: Development of a physical chemistry platform that enables the characteristics of new ingredients to be defined by generating as much data about them as possible, complementing the information provided by the suppliers Systematic use of IT modelling in advance of ingredient-design programmes Optimisation of design procedures from the early stages. Rhamnose Rhamnose, a plant sugar produced by certain Brazilian plants, such as Uncaria or trees such as Betula Pendula (Silver Birch), was selected and patented for its skin-repair effect. It is extracted using a hydrolysis process which preserves its natural origin and endows it with a favourable environmental profile. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in vitro on reconstructed skin models then confirmed in vivo by a proof of clinical concept study. This approach resulted in a gradual redefinition of the routes to innovation for each major category of ingredients. RAW MATERIALS MORE IN THIS REPORT...

A constantly evolving portfolio Every year, LOral introduces new raw materials into its portfolio either to enhance the quality or boost the performance of its products. At the same time, various other raw materials are removed if their performance is considered inadequate or if new regulations are anticipated. This is why LOral eliminated triclosan, diethylphtalate and octamethylcyclotetra-siloxane (silicone D4) from its portfolio at a very early stage. Since 2009, LOral no longer adds raw materials containing decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) to its portfolio. A portfolio evolving towards renewable, low-impact raw materials LOral aims to increase the use of renewable raw materials in its products. In 2010, 40% of materials included in its portfolio were plant-based and 26% comply with the principles of green chemistry. This proactive approach has in some cases enabled plant-based alternatives to be sourced to replace petrochemical raw materials: 70% of the polymers recently registered are plant-based. Some synthetic polymers are therefore being replaced by polysaccharides. This approach is leading us to develop relationships with new partners, notably a group of suppliers in the food industry. R&I is currently working to identify alternatives to petrochemical substances that are lower-impact but equally effective by exploring the potential of molecules and solvents of natural origin. Raw materials impact assessment The Raw Material Sustainability Assessment (RMSA) is an impact evaluation and qualification framework for the whole life cycle of a raw material, and is based on our key criteria. Drawn up initially in 2006, it has already been applied to more than 100 new raw materials. It aims to present a clearer analysis of the global impact of each ingredient, and our suppliers are closely involved in this process. In 2009, this framework was extended to include a quantitative impact assessment and to take into account the challenges specific to each supply chain. In 2010, LOral successfully assessed all new raw materials on the basis of this framework. This will now be extended to the plant-based raw materials already in use, with priority being given to the largest volumes and the ingredients for which potential challenges have been identified from the plant data sheets. By the end of 2011, 80% of our raw materials presenting a biodiversity issue will have been assessed. BIODIVERSITY CHALLENGES MORE IN THIS REPORT...

Systematic analysis of impact on biodiversity Our systematic analysis of impact on biodiversity is based on two tools which enable: advance identification of potential issues linked to the use of a plant with respect to three key criteria (ecology, fair trade and society). The information is consolidated in our internal database. In 2010, the portfolios of raw materials of natural origin from the groups recent acquisitions were also analysed minimisation, using the RMSA evaluation framework, of the impact of suppliers' practices on the relevant supply chains, focusing in particular on respect for biodiversity. If the use of a given plant in one of our raw materials is likely to have a negative impact on biodiversity, a plan of action is implemented to remedy this in conjunction with the supplier concerned, calling on the support of third parties if necessary. In 2010, our commitment to biodiversity was recognised in the publication of the study, Business and Biodiversity ["Entreprises & Biodiversit"] by the Gondwana agency. In November, a summary of this study was presented at the Pollutec exhibition during the 2010 Business and the Environment award ceremony. Palm oil The production of palm oil has led to large-scale deforestation in the primary forests of the southern hemisphere. Conscious of its responsibility to contribute to the preservation of biodiversity and ecosystems, LOral joined the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in 2006. The aim of this body is the creation of responsible supply chains. An internal interdisciplinary working group called "Sustainable Palm Oil 2010" was created. LOral uses a very small quantity (approximately 600 tonnes of palm oil annually, compared with the more than 40 million tonnes used globally), but was nonetheless committed to sourcing only certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) by the end of 2010. This objective was achieved by the middle of the year – ahead of our commitment. The certification chosen guarantees that the palm oil contained in our products comes only from plantations certified sustainable by the RSPO. The WWF recently included LOral in its list of top ten responsible palm-oil users. Nerolidol Nerolidol is an important raw material in the denaturing of alcohol for formulas labelled Ecocert organic (claiming to be of natural origin). It is a co-product of the parquet sector, obtained from the distillation of the essential oil of cabreuva wood. The felling of this endemic tree is currently controlled in Paraguay. LOral has asked its supplier, Robertet, to undertake a local audit to clarify the regulatory context and the procedures to be implemented to ensure compliance. Monitoring the certificates obtained from INFONA (The Paraguayan Ministry of Water Resources and Forests) now enables Robertet to verify the source of all batches of nerolidol supplied to LOral.

Expertise in organic and natural products Since 2009, the formulation of products claiming to be "natural", "of natural origin" or "organic" has been covered by a special charter that defines the categories of authorised raw materials (water, raw materials of natural origin unprocessed or processed exclusively in accordance with processes adhering to the principles of green chemistry), and promotes green chemistry or biotechnology processes. In collaboration with a COLIPA working group, LOral has continued to work on defining the meaning of natural and organic in the cosmetics industry. This working group is closely monitoring efforts to draw up a potential ISO standard which could establish a norm. An increasing number of brands In 2010, several dozen formulas were labelled "Ecocert organic" and 58 new products were Ecocert-registered, including: Bioexigence, Biotherm, Garnier, Mixa, Mixa bb, Narta, Sanoflore, Srie Nature, The Body Shop, Ushuaia, Agns b, LOral Professionnel and the hair oil Delicate Care Organic Certified Oil de Matrix. In parallel with this development, numerous brands are gradually integrating more and more natural raw materials into their new formulations. This is the case at Garnier with the Fructis Style Pure Clean gel and also at Dop with the Green Fix de Vivelle gel. Certain formulas already on the market are also being reappraised in order to introduce ingredients of natural origin offering the same level of performance. A sugar that was one of the ingredients of a shower gel labelled "organic", has subsequently replaced a fossil-based surfactant in all conventional shower gels, thereby helping to reduce both their environmental impact and their development costs while still offering the same performance. New plant-extracts R&I has also increased its research efforts into natural and organic cosmetics. A dedicated laboratory set up in 2008 aims to identify and promote skin- and hair-friendly plant extracts that are just as effective as conventional cosmetics. The action of certain essential oils (the anti-ageing effect of essential oil of geranium, the soothing properties of lemon balm, etc) has been demonstrated in vitro on biological models (reconstructed skin).

Using water, sugar and controlled plant extracts, a biomass is produced that is not found in its natural state except in a highly diluted form in hot springs. This is now being produced continuously, enabling fermenter energy to be reduced by a factor of ten and guaranteeing quality. LOrals cosmetics knowledge plays a key role in optimising the sensitivity to skin and the tolerance of organic or plant-based products.  Innovation / Eco-design  Eco-design A transversal and global approach LOrals eco-design approach is a pillar of sustainable development. It began several years ago and lies at the heart of the Research Department's activities, forming an integral part of Advanced Research & Innovation processes at all stages. Throughout the entire life-cycle of the product, innovation processes increasingly adopt the rules of eco-design. These include choice of ingredients, automated testing on the smallest quantities to reduce waste, re-using by-products, manufacturing processes requiring low levels of energy and toxic solvents, and recyclable packaging, and is an approach shared with suppliers and partners. This approach forms part of a global approach for cosmetics ingredients and formula design based on five essential criteria responding to the major challenges of sustainable development in R&I activities: Human health and safety Protection of the environment Respect for biodiversity Social and societal impact Fair trade.

LOral adopted green chemistry in 1999 and has positioned it at the heart of its principle of eco- design. The commitment by LOrals R&I team to comply with the principles of green chemistry in the design of its ingredients constitutes the cornerstone of its sustainable development initiatives. The fundamental principles Use of renewable raw materials, mainly plant-based Developing environmentally friendly processing methods that consume low levels of energy and solvents and produce low levels of waste Production of biodegradable ingredients with low ecotoxicity. Modelling tools and predictive methods Throughout 2010, LOral continued to work on reinforcing the eco-design processes for its ingredients using newly developed modelling tools and predictive methods: Upstream evaluation, by means of predictive calculations, of the environmental impact of the ingredient and the economy of atoms, enabling maximum utilisation of the atoms involved Measuring the E factor of processing methods, from laboratory to factory. This enables the quantity of waste generated per kg of product to be calculated very rapidly. In 2009, for example, the E factor of the synthesis of Pro-Xylane dropped from 13 to 6.6, which equates to a saving of more than 100 tonnes of waste Intensification of research and development efforts into biocatalysis, a key technology for the development of environmentally friendly processes, notably through the active participation of LOral in the Toulouse White Biotechnologies project (French Programme Future Investments [Investissements dAvenir]). Developing new ingredients This eco-design approach for ingredients directs and guides the development of formulations. In 2010, numerous international partnerships were pursued with a view to developing new ingredients in accordance with the principles of green chemistry. For example, participation in the Industries and Agro-Resources Cluster (IAR) project Synthons, and the ANR programme, Sustainable Chemistry – Industry – Innovation (CD2I), was aimed at the development of green technologies and green processes using biomass. Collaborations with suppliers such as Roquette were also conducted for the same purpose. In 2010, L'Orals commitment to green chemistry was recognised with an invitation to the Gordon Research Conference on Green Chemistry at Davidson College (USA, NC). Professor J. Warner, one of the co-founders of the principles of green chemistry in 1998, made reference to this commitment in the following terms: By bringing natural materials and renewable feed-stocks into their science, LOral is addressing the principles of green chemistry at the highest level. LOral has an excellent internal Green Chemistry program that places them at the forefront of the industry. NEW FORMULATION PROCESSES LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS MORE IN THIS REPORT...

By advancing their knowledge of raw materials and their impact, they are evolving their approach to formulating ingredients. Innovation is being redefined in three main areas: formulas, processes and packaging. A formulation tool is currently being developed using all the relevant data assembled to date. It is already enabling militant brands to make an in-depth appraisal of the ecological quality of their formulas. Changes to laboratory processes and methods For some years now, LOral laboratories have been undertaking a massive revision of formulations, selecting those ingredients with the most favourable environmental profile and offering the same level of performance. This approach also helps in the development of new formulations, providing products with high environmental credentials that comply, where desired, with eco-labelling requirements. In order to ensure this, before a formula is designed the formulators refer to a variety of indicators that help define the environmental profile of each raw material and of the formula as a whole, taking account of the concentrations used. This approach to formulation became standard procedure in 2009. It was formalised in an eco-design charter for products based on the following criteria; biodegradability, non-ecotoxicity and respect for biodiversity. This charter sets out two approaches: a gradual progress approach and a militant approach. This charter is reflected, for example, in the highly biodegradable and non-ecotoxic ranges such as Rain Forest Ecoconscious or Earthlovers from The Body Shop, the shampoo and conditioner Fructis Pure Brillance from Garnier, or Dop Nature from Dop. Product performance and impact are increasingly being systematically tested on reduced samples using automated processes. This reduces the quantities of raw material used, accelerates screening rates and increases the number of ingredients assessed. This all reflects the increasing integration of corporate social responsibility into the work of the laboratories. GREEN CHEMISTRY LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS MORE IN THIS REPORT...

The analysis examines each stage of a products life cycle from production via utilisation to its ultimate disposal. Developed from the 1970s onwards, and standardised in ISO 14040 and 14044, life-cycle analysis has now become a vital sustainable development tool. Life-cycle analysis enables the major aspects of a products environmental impact to be targeted, prioritisation of any improvements to be made to processes, and a comparison of two products with the same function on the basis of their environmental profiles. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, LOral conducted some twenty life-cycle analyses of both products and raw materials. For example, the analysis of Pro-Xylane, a molecule developed by LOral laboratories and designed in accordance with green chemistry principles, confirmed the choices made by the factory, in particular with respect to the treatment and recycling of waste. These choices enabled savings of almost 69 MJ of primary energy in the production of one kg of Pro-Xylane or 25% of the total. This analysis also highlighted the possible improvements that could be made to the Pro- Xylane manufacturing processes, laboratories and factories are currently actively engaged in implementing these improvements, with a view to further improving Pro-Xylane's environmental profile.

Regular check-ups, targeted training and an information programme help to optimise the effectiveness of safety procedures. Double certification for our R&I centre At the end of 2010, the Chevilly Larue R&I (Research & Innovation) centre obtained double certification, ISO 14001 (Environment) and OHSAS 18001 (Health and Safety), a world first for a LOral non-industrial site. This double certification is the culmination of several years study of the societal impact (corporate social responsibility) of the sites activity followed by an 18-month reassessment of all EHS (Environment, Health and Safety) procedures. This certification is based on a new mode of governance which complies fully with these internationally recognised standards. It puts in place the essential framework for a working environment that is both more employee-friendly and safer. Consumer protection An absolute priority Consumer protection is one of LOrals absolute priorities. The stringent safety tests carried out on products before they are brought to market ensure that LOral meets all current safety regulations in the 130 countries where its products are marketed. An international cosmetics post-marketing surveillance network An international cosmetics post-marketing surveillance network employs stringent and well- established methods to analyse any adverse effects linked to product use. This provides an extremely efficient early-detection system of the merest sign of product intolerance so that immediate corrective action can be taken.

This includes a commitment to replacing animal testing with approved alternative methods based on tissue engineering and in vitro tests, and the development of predictive methods. These methods show great promise in terms of assessment and efficacy. Compliance with international and local regulations LOral has not tested end products on animals since 1989 However, the authorities in certain countries still demand animal testing in order to register substances marketed in their territories and LOral is obliged to adhere to these national regulations with respect to those of its products manufactured and sold locally. LOral is working with the authorities in these countries and sharing knowledge about alternative testing methods. In this way, the group contributes to and promotes European values relating to the development of new predictive tools for safety tests and is encouraging these countries to adapt regulations in favour of alternatives. LOral has been a supporter of the REACh directive since 2003 The European REACh regulations came into force in June 2007 and aim to ensure the safe use of chemical products. The regulations require companies to assess, register and submit the use of their chemical products for authorisation. LOral created an internal department dedicated to this issue in 2009 in order to ensure optimum integration of the obligations imposed by REACh, and by the new chemical regulations appearing in several countries. This department is known as the International Chemistry Regulatory Affairs Division. LOral is heavily involved in various professional associations, drawing up methods and contributing to the enhancement of knowledge, and helps its suppliers to get their substances registered. LOral primarily bases its substance cases on predictive methods, literature reviews and approved alternative tools.

Integrated safety-assessment strategy In response to these regulatory requirements, a new model, similar in scope to the eco-design model, is being developed by LOral for the safety assessment of ingredients and end products. This is now a vital part of the group's capacity to innovate by exploiting the cosmetic performance potential of ingredients selected initially due to their zero impact on health and the environment. This capacity stems from LOral's 20-year investment in the development of tools for predicting the impact of raw materials and end products on human health and the environment without recourse to animal testing.

In continuing to upgrade and fine-tune these tools, the group plans to create an integrated safety assessment strategy attuned to the challenges of "21st century toxicology". In this context, progress has been made in the simulation of the first human application using a combination of predictive and in vitro tools. This involves a certain number of ingredients exclusively for cosmetic use. Employing a combination of predictive methods, the aim is to optimise the design of new ingredients and end products by assessing from the outset their innocuousness, in compliance with prevailing legislation. This ensures ongoing improvement of the methods used to make the initial selection of ingredients based on safety criteria. In 2010, this integrated assessment strategy, together with the supporting tools, was presented by R&I at the Society of Toxicology congress in Baltimore, the ESTIV congress in Linz, and the COLIPA workshop on contact allergy.  Innovation / Ethical, Safe Products / Predictive methods  Predictive methods The Predictive methods combine data and tools in order to predict the safety of ingredients and formulas. LOral's added value, in terms of the safety assessment of its ingredients and end products, lies in its investment in tissue engineering combined with a range of predictive methods including statistical and mathematical models, in silico, and QSAR (quantitative structure–activity relationship) methodologies developed in-house or in collaboration with external partners. These are used in combination to optimise predictive capacity. Using these resources, the safety of raw materials can be assessed without further recourse to animal testing in 99% of cases. They include a whole range of tools and methods, as outlined in this section.

There are five main applications: Developing knowledge about skin without invasive clinical trials Developing and assessing the effectiveness of new active substances Helping to assess the safety of raw materials and end products Creating, validating and standardising new alternative tests for assessing product safety and efficacy Developing tests to assess efficacy (eg solar filtration). In 2010, LOral continued to exploit commercial opportunities relating to the use of reconstructed tissue models for the safety assessment of ingredients and formulas. The reconstructed HCE cornea model also entered the validation process during 2010. As methods are validated, L'Oral makes them available to industry at large. Skin irritation assessment R&I has developed two validated methods for skin-irritation assessment using skin models (Episkin and RHE models). The entire raw materials catalogue of LOral and The Body Shop has been tested using these models – an initiative that has increased our knowledge of the ingredients and enhanced both the associated stock of data and the regulatory status. Ocular irritation assessment With regard to ocular irritation, the Reconstructed HCE cornea model from SkinEthic is in the process of validation. In 2010, a published study demonstrated the reliability of the protocol developed by LOral and tested on over 400 ingredients. New ingredients are systematically tested using this HCE model. Formula assessments with respect to skin and ocular irritation have also continued. More than 12,000 formulas and 2,000 ingredients have been assessed since 2006. Training suppliers on alternative methods using reconstructed tissues In 2010, LOral continued its training initiative in alternative methods with eight suppliers, principally using reconstructed skin. The aim is to enable suppliers to integrate these tools into the safety assessment procedures for their own ingredients.

LOral is also co-operating with other relevant industries, in particular under the EPAA (European Partnership on Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing), in order to progress the development of alternative multidisciplinary solutions in the field of safety assessment. Predicting skin sensitisation R&I is working to integrate several methods for the prediction of skin sensitisation in order to create an integrated strategy. In 2008, LOral, together with American start-up Hurel, initiated exploratory work into the potential of micro-fluids combined with reconstructed tissues. In 2010, on completion of the feasibility phase, LOral and Hurel developed a totally integrated commercially viable system that mimics skin-allergy reactions on a single chip and which will replace the LLNA test. Prediction of acute and chronic toxicity LOral is collaborating with COLIPA on a community programme steered by the European Commission in the 7th framework programme with funding of some 50 million, half of which is provided by COLIPA. The programme's aim is to develop the knowledge to finalise methods for predicting chronic toxicity phenomena. LOral is also following closely and actively the work of the US-EPA on the ToxCast project. In the field of predicting acute systemic toxicity, LOral is working in partnership with Ceetox to improve significantly predictive capacity. Predictive in silico methods LOral is also developing predictive in silico methods based on mathematical approaches such as QSAR (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship). These methods can be used for molecules with a chemical structure close to that of an ingredient already in use. These methods deliver results of such accuracy that they help to enable cosmetic ingredients to be applied for a first time on humans without recourse to animal testing. LOral R&I has entered into a collaboration with Professor Ovanes Mekenyan of Bourgas University optimise several predictive tools being developed by the OECD.

LOrals ethical values, rooted in both scientific rigour and responsiveness to societal concerns, are reflected in a pre-emptive approach whereby formulations are evolved by removing and/or replacing substances that are the subject of concern. Phtalates LOral has only ever used diethylphtalate (DEP). In 2010, in accordance with its commitment, the group has continued to replace it in its formulations – also for the recently-acquired brands. The objective has been achieved for virtually all our products. No concentrate containing DEP is present in our perfume portfolio today. Parabens We have continued to remove long-chain parabens from end products during 2010. Various group brands are offering products without parabens wherever possible; in other cases, preference is always given to the use of short-chain parabens. In addition, R&I is continuing to develop further alternative approaches for preserving its formulas, focusing on packaging: in 2010, La Roche-Posay launched Tolriane Ultra, a preservative-free formula, protected from bacterial contamination by a new generation of airless packaging fitted with a hermetically-sealed anti-bacterial pump. The research teams are also studying new formulation procedures, for example the use of acid preservatives (benzoic, salicylic, sorbic or anisic acid), alone or in association with polyols. Multifunctional raw materials provide another option; some of these are of natural origin and require smaller quantities of traditional preservative. Triclosan The objective of refraining from the use of triclosan has been achieved, and this policy will be systematically applied to products resulting from the groups future acquisitions. Heavy metals Since 2007, LOral has deployed extremely sensitive equipment to enable the detection of traces of heavy metal down to just a few ppm. This equipment has enabled an analysis of the entire portfolio of raw materials of natural origin and the building of a vast database. Now, through predictive calculation, the degree of unavoidable heavy metal traces in finished products can be established in order to guarantee that these remain below the authorised or recommended threshold. Nanotechnologies LOral has limited the use of nanotechnologies to emulsions and pigments: Nanoemulsions are formed from water and oil droplets containing active ingredients that are released on contact when applied to the skin. They are reduced to nanometric size to increase the quality and efficacy of the formula. Mineral nanopigments are present in our natural environment. Titanium dioxide, an inert, non- toxic material, is the best known, due to its capacity to reflect UV light and protect human skin from the adverse effects of the sun. These nanopigments are nowadays a very effective complement for achieving high protection factors. The European NanoInteract programme has confirmed that titanium dioxide nanopigments are not present at the time of application as separated nanoparticles, but as larger aggregates, often several microns in size.

This has been introduced into a Roche-Posay sun care product. Tests have also been developed aimed at measuring the impact of sunscreen filters on aquatic ecosystems. All products concerned will be assessed using this protocol. Hair colourants Finding less sensitising colourants is a focal aspect of R&I. At the same time, efforts have continued to rework formulas to optimise the technical performance of hair-colour products while minimising the concentration of colourants, particularly PPD and PTD. Aluminium salts LOral has been working for several years on reducing the concentration of aluminium salts contained in deodorants and has invested in the search for alternative solutions delivering a similar level of performance. These efforts resulted in the launch of a number of ranges in 2009, notably those by Garnier, LaScad and Biotherm.  Innovation / Ethical, Safe Products / Endocrine disruptors  Endocrine disruptors Conscious of increasing concerns regarding the potential of some substances to disrupt hormone balance, LOral has made this a focal point of its research efforts. We therefore seek to remove all endocrine disruptors from our products. With this end in view, all new raw materials are tested in advance in order to determine any potential interaction with certain biological receptors. This assessment, relying on a whole range of in vitro tools combining cellular tests and reconstructed-skin, allows us to identify any early biological activity that indicates potential interference by the ingredient with mechanisms involved in endocrine disruption. If such a case is identified, the ingredient in question is withdrawn and structure-activity programmes are launched. The assessment of ingredients already present in the portfolio is also underway. Ingredients that give rise to justifiable doubt are withdrawn. This was the case with DEP, triclosan and long-chain parabens and the removal of these from the portfolio is almost complete. Certain development projects have been discontinued as a result of these test findings. R&I has also continued its research effort aimed at gaining a better understanding of the endocrine disruption mechanism and developing predictive and assessment methods related to this phenomenon and its impact on human and environmental health. New techniques identified and recommended in the ToxCast programme were assessed in 2010.

For the last 15 years, LOral has relied on the expertise of its ecotoxicology laboratory, and on partnerships, to increase its screening and assessment capacity during 2009. Environmental assessment is one of the keys to LOrals eco-design approach because it ensures elimination, from the outset, of ingredients with an unfavourable environmental profile. A profile of a raw material's environmental impact, based on PBT (Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic) and vPvB (very Persistent and very Bioaccumulative) criteria, is established in every case well in advance. Environmental assessment relies in particular on in silico and in vitro tools applied in close collaboration with suppliers. More than 95% of the raw materials in the group's portfolio have been provisionally classified under the PBT – vPvB criteria. This is in progress for raw materials from the groups new acquisitions. LOral was heavily involved in the creation and subsequent development of the Animal Alternative Needs in Environmental Risk Assessment Project Committee at the HESI*. This international working group, whose first two conferences (in 2008, and in 2010) LOral sponsored, is working on the development of alternatives to the standard tests on fish and amphibians. Together with the HESI, LOral has invested in the development and recognition of the Fish Embryo Test (FET), currently undergoing validation at the OCDE, as a potential alternative to the standardised acute toxicity test on fish (OCDE N203). In 2010, this work was covered in scientific publications in partnership with ECVAM**. Thanks to the development of predictive tools, the environmental profile of raw materials is available to formulators for the design of their products. The environmental quality of formulas is thus increasing each year. It is now possible to create environmentally friendly formulas without compromising on performance. All the raw materials registered by LOral in 2010 have a favourable environmental profile or are of higher ecological quality than the previous versions. * HESI: Health and Environmental Sciences Institute  ** ECVAM: European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods AQUATIC SYSTEMS MORE IN THIS REPORT...

In 2009, in partnership with external experts, the ecotoxicological laboratory continued to work on the development of methods for predicting the impact of ingredients and end products on aquatic systems in strong support of the eco-design of formulas. LOral is heavily committed, together with other partners, in the development of the Fish Embryo Test as a potential alternative to the acute toxicity test on fish. This alternative method is in the process of being validated by the OECD. The R&I teams are also working to achieve a better understanding of the behaviour of those compounds contained in the groups products, which are subsequently released into the environment as trace materials. A partnership with the Pasteur Institute in Lille was established to study this issue in more depth and to validate a sampling and analysis protocol. RAW MATERIALS MORE IN THIS REPORT...

This is all the more important when the plant in question represents a potential source of revenue and employment for local communities. Since 2005, LOral has been developing tools to identify in advance potential "fairness" issues associated with the use of a given plant. LOral uses the Sustainability Assessment framework when considering raw materials with potential biodiversity issues for inclusion in the portfolio. This framework includes the following criteria, which are evaluated by the supplier with respect to its individual supply chain: The importance of the plant in terms of local revenue and employment and the level of return allowed by the supply chain to the local community Recognition of traditional uses and know-how. These are taken into account in the management of all intellectual property aspects Access of local populations to raw material sources Any change in land use that may be caused by production of the raw material. Particular importance is placed on land initially used for food. In 2010, LOral carried out a systematic study of the patents registered by the group to ensure that they respected traditional know-how and the free access of local populations to their resources. The same criteria were applied to supplier patents. LOral considers the guarantee of a fair return to local populations essential to the sustainability of its supply chains. It is an integral part of a socially responsible and sustainable supply chain that meets the requirements of the Convention on Biological Diversity. In 2010, the signatory countries to the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted the Nagoya Protocol, which aims to regulate access to resources in a given territory and to share the profits from the use of these resources in an equitable fashion. Each signatory country must put in place binding rules applicable for its territory. Although this Protocol will only come into force during 2011, LOral is already particularly mindful of the future implications. The Emblica supply chain in India Emblica is a native species of south-east Asia, particularly India where it is widely used in traditional medicine. India is one of the countries to have put in place regulations concerning access to resources within its territory. LOral has made contact with the National Biodiversity Authority in India, which has confirmed the legality of this resource with respect to prevailing national legislation relating to biodiversity.

This is consistent with the forthcoming ISO 26000 on societal responsibility and is applicable to all LOral group brands and their suppliers, applying equally to North-South trade as well as to North- North trade. Ingredients from socially-responsible supply chains In 2009, LOral finalised a charter setting the framework for the development of products containing ingredients resulting from fair trade. Any commitment to use these ingredients is undertaken for a period of at least two years in order to ensure consistency in production and purchasing volumes. This applies to products launched by the groups brands and which contain at least one raw material from the Community Fair Trade programme such as Ushuaia shower gels, Essential Repair from Pureology, Delicate Care shampoo from Biolage and Skinenergetic from Biotherm etc. The Community Fair Trade programme LOral buys more and more raw materials from the 'Community Fair Trade' programme, and these are now incorporated into more than 200 formulas. Worldwide, LOral doubled its use of fair-trade raw materials between 2008 and 2010. In 2010, LOral Professionnel launched Oilixir, containing olive oil, under this programme and The Body Shop introduced an organic alcohol made from sugar cane. LOral has intensified its partnership with Beraca involving socially responsible supply channels with two Amazon-sourced ingredients: aai extract and pracaxi oil. The supply of these ingredients is organised in close collaboration with the local communities that harvest them. In 2010, aai extract was introduced into the Fructis Color Resist range from Garnier. LOral actively encourages its shea butter suppliers to enhance the sustainability of the supply chain in Africa and is proactive in the Global Shea Alliance, an international organisation of shea stakeholders which aims to create economically-viable production of shea, sustainable both in social and environmental terms. In 2009, Sanoflore was awarded Bio Solidaire certification for 36 raw materials. This certification recognises supply chains that prioritise the sourcing of local raw materials. Sanoflore is the first French organic cosmetic brand to highlight the local origin of its products in this way. The argan supply chain The group uses three cosmetic ingredients from the argan tree (oil, a leaf extract and a berry extract) in numerous hair- care, skin-care and make-up products. These are purchased by LOral, in partnership with one of its suppliers, (Laboratoires Srobiologiques, Cognis France), and the French NGO Yamana, from six co-operatives in the Targanine EIG (Economic Interest Group) in Morocco. An important aim of this approach is to achieve better recognition of the value of this important natural resource in order to contribute to its conservation by improving the social and environmental conditions of production, developing by-products and increasing income opportunities for women in local communities. Thermoliss Richesse by Jacques Dessange, Nourishing Dry Oil by Mizani, the EverSlick range by LOral Paris US, and lHuile Universelle from Krastase, all containing argan oil, were launched in 2010. Also in 2010, a new raw material from this supply chain – kernel powder – has complemented the existing range and will be exploited in Ushuaia products for its exfoliating properties.

Research in social sciences The outsourced social sciences research centre is investigating the psychological and socio- cultural processes at work in cosmetic use and personal hygiene routines. Since 2005, interdisciplinary research has been conducted (in the form of four theses and a post- doctoral study) in psychology, sociology and anthropology. Three international round tables have also been organised. These studies centre on the profound motivations underlying peoples interest in their appearance and their attitude to risk. They consider issues of culture, acculturation and social networks, based on data gathered from ten populations. Two theses and a post-doctoral study have since been completed, forming the basis of new protocols. This research has led to the development and validation of new psychometric tools which can be applied to other populations, providing measurement indexes relating to appearance, self- esteem and risk perception. Research into quality of life The BeautyQoL project The BeautyQoL initiative, an ambitious programme aimed at developing a new quality of life index specific to cosmetics, has been underway since 2006 in 13 countries and 16 cultures. It enables a comprehensive assessment of new products, drawing on aspects such as wellbeing, self-esteem and other psychosocial criteria. This tool will provide a new indicator in the development of products, factoring in consumer expectations, cultural variables and the environment. In 2009, the results of a study conducted in partnership with the Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris, on cosmetic use in adult patients suffering from anorexia, were published as part of the proceedings of the 61st Institute of Psychiatric Services in the USA. The study was entitled: Cosmetics care in anorexia nervosa: a few grams of eye shadow to relieve self-loathing. Integrating diverse needs To gain a better understanding of skin and hair diversity throughout the world and to design products tailored to the needs of every individual, LOral continuously conducts studies of local populations. In 2009, for example, a study aimed at determining hair colour and growth parameters was carried out by the hair product laboratories in 23 countries. In 2010, the make-up laboratory continued its work on gaining an understanding of skin colour around the world and has also completed other typological studies.

In 2003, the European Commission, in conjunction with the member states and stakeholders, adopted a global strategy to maintain a positive list of approved hair dye substances. We use these in our existing products in full compliance with approved concentrations, and any new product developments are submitted to the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS). Integrity and responsibility LOral evaluates – scientifically and exhaustively – the performance, safety and potential environmental and social impact of every ingredient used in its products. LOral also attaches great importance to the proper use of its products by consumers.  Labelling and advice on the front of our packaging alerts consumers to the risk of allergic reactions and recommends that a skin allergy test is carried out before using the product. A use-by date is also shown in the case of multi-use professional products (as opposed to single-use products that by their nature are used in one go). LOral provides single-use gloves in its hair colouring kits for consumers. We also provide salon professionals with advice on good hair colouring practice. Ethics LOral categorically advises against the colouring of childrens hair aged under 16. Diversity LOral is an expert in geocosmetics, which includes the study of hair characteristics and consumer preferences (hairstyles) in every part of the world. As a result, our product formulations can vary according to hair type – from naturally curly to straightened hair, or hair that has a very dark base.

The beauty of that, in a globalised environment, is that you bring a very important local component to everything you do. What I love about this approach is that if we consider sustainability as a combination of economic, environmental, human and social factors, creating these ecosystems actually strengthens the human factor.  Jos-Mara Figueres, CEO IJ Partners One of the goals we have set ourselves is a 50% reduction in CO  over the ten years 2005 to 2015. When we talk of acquiring one billion new consumers, were talking 2020. That means we have to do much more than we said that we would do in 2009 to reduce our CO  emissions because, of course, we have to build new factories, and these will probably be in China and Indonesia. Our policy is that all these factories must have very low CO  emissions so by the end of 2020 we will be meeting or beating our target.  Miguel Castellanos, General Manager, Global Environment, Health & Safety, LOral THE EXPERTS PRODUCTION How we source sustainable ingredients A central question for me is are you, in driving forward with the supply chain, sharing with your suppliers the kind of knowledge they need to be sustainable economically, socially, and environmentally, so that they can support your goals of reducing your carbon footprint?  David Logan, Co-founder, Corporate Citizenship LOreal has a tradition of long-term relationships with its suppliers. More than a third of LOrals existing suppliers have worked with us for decades. The people we started with when we were implementing our facilities in Indonesia, China, Brazil and elsewhere in the world are not just still with us, but they have developed with us. (B.L) In 2006, we have worked to assess suppliers to ensure that the supply chain we are using is not affecting biodiversity and is compliant with all international, regional, and local regulations.

In 2010, we made and distributed more than five billion units of product. At LOral, safety is non-negotiable and environmental conservation is a strategic core value. Health & Safety The Health & Safety of the people who work in and use our facilities is of paramount importance and we are committed to maintaining Health & Safety in all our workplaces, including our industrial facilities. We are aiming for an 86% improvement in our safety record by 2015 - base year 2005; TFc (Conventional Frequency Rate) of 4.20, representing a TFc of < 0.60. In line with the positive trend we have seen over several years, performance continued to be very good in 2010. Our accident rate fell by 23% compared with the previous year. Environment Making and distributing our products with respect for the environment and for people is vital to LOrals sustainability vision. Our factories and distribution centres are committed to stretching environmental targets: 50% absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 and 2) 50% reduction in waste generated per finished product 50% reduction in water consumption per finished product Reductions will be calculated on a like-for-like basis (2005-2015). LOral has an ambitious target to reach one billion new consumers by 2020. How our products are consumed – as well as how we make and distribute them – is of paramount importance.

These standards include OHSAS 18001 (or VPP in the US) for occupational health and safety, and ISO 14001 for environmental management. We want to continue to develop our approaches and with this in mind, our Chimex subsidiary is working with the new international standard, ISO 20006, which does not replace the standards we have already adopted, including ISO 14001, but complements them. The goal for Chimex is not ISO 20006 certification but to demonstrate that Chimex is meeting the broadest definition of corporate responsibility, as set out in this new standard. For more information on ingredients manufacture, see Made in Chimex.  Production / Managing EHS  Managing EHS LOral has had an Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) policy for many years. This sets out our commitment to the development, production, distribution and sale of innovative products of the highest quality in an ethical manner, by minimising our impact on the environment and guaranteeing the safety and health of our employees, our customers and the communities in which we work. EHS policy and group EHS manual In 2010, we initiated a project to bring together in one place all the elements that support implementation of our EHS policy across LOrals worldwide sites. The result is our EHS manual – the first level of documentation in our EHS system. The manual outlines how EHS is organised and managed within LOral, and sets out the measures to be applied by all operational sites under LOrals control. These include measures and targets for safety (zero accidents), resource efficiency, CO  emissions, as well as EHS responsibilities, internal procedures and so on. This provides sites with a key tool to drive further improvements in EHS performance. The EHS manual is due to be launched in 2011 to all operational sites and will be extended to cover Research & Innovation sites and administration centres from 2012. Organisation of EHS There are clear accountabilities for EHS at every level. The Managing Director of the LOral Operations Department is responsible for EHS and reports to the CEO. The EHS department is linked to each part of our operations through EHS managers. Each LOral division has a dedicated EHS function. In a typical factory of 350 workers, there would be three to four full-time EHS staff. Factory managers and distribution managers remuneration is linked to EHS performance. Worldwide audit programme External experts regularly visit LOrals production and distribution sites to assess progress and risks. Third party audits are also carried out at supplier sites using the same standards that we apply to ourselves. Impact assessments The cosmetics industry has limited environmental risks, but as with any manufacturing operation, these do exist. Before building or renovating a factory anywhere in the world, and before introducing new manufacturing equipment and processes, L'Oreal assesses all the potential EHS impacts and develops mitigation strategies where required. EHS Policy training We provide targeted training in LOrals EHS Policy for line managers and EHS professionals across our group.

From 2011, there will be a customised version targeted at all levels of line management. Training in EHS and leadership In 2010, 20 LOral participants took part in two open seminars for site managers on EHS & Leadership, held at CEDEP, the collaborative learning community based on the INSEAD campus in France. The main objectives of the seminars were to change the mindset of managers on safety, build recognition of safety as a core issue for organisations and leaders, and improve the capacity of managers to instil and maintain safe behaviours over the long term. Environmental initiatives We have done a tremendous job worldwide this year through our dedicated teams and transversal steering committees to improve environmental monitoring and prioritised environmental efforts alongside operational performance. As a result we have enhanced best practices in our drive to halve our CO  emissions, our water consumption and our waste generation by 2015. We know that these are hard goals to attain, but we are already halfway and we will get there. Naturally, we are also thinking of further goals after 2015... and are very aware that the reduction of our environmental footprint will provide cost savings through operating efficiency and also drive innovation. Miguel Castellanos, Director of Environment, Health and Safety, LOral Safeguarding bees and biodiversity Bees are vital for pollination and biodiversity but populations around the world have suffered dramatic declines in recent years. The Chimex factory at Tours, France, has allocated 8,000 square metres of its land to wildflowers and other native flora, providing bees with an ideal habitat. Following an agreement with a beekeepers association, four hives have been set up as part of a programme to recolonise the local area. The factory is also providing funding so that a hive can be safely observed from a distance as part of an educational outreach programme with local schools. 2  Production / Recognising excellence  Recognising excellence We recognise achievements internally, through our annual EHS Award Scheme. These are an important part of encouraging and motivating operational teams and employees. The LOral EHS Awards recognise exceptional EHS performance across our factories, distribution centres and administrative sites. Previous winners have included an ergonomics programme, water reduction initiatives, and recycling projects. Future winners will be announced in October 2011. Future winners will be announced in October 2011. In 2010, we also continued our "Excellence Manufacturing" worldwide programme, which has once again enabled substantial improvements in efficiency. Our approach was recognised with the presentation of the "Manufacturing Excellence" award at the European Manufacturing Summit in Dusseldorf. The jury stressed the rapidity of the results obtained and their regular improvement, as well as the innovative and collaborative nature of this approach, based on the sharing of best practices between sites. 2010 PERFORMANCE: ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH & SAFETY EHS MANUAL (PDF) GROUP EHS POLICY DATABANK MORE IN THIS REPORT...

This relates to a rise in the number of incidents at a newly acquired site, where the group EHS policies and procedures are still currently being implemented Another area of focus is lost time accidents of temporary workers in our factories. This rose by 50% compared with 2009. Controlling explosion and fire risks ATEX is a framework that reflects two European Directives on controlling explosive atmospheres, including standards of equipment and protective systems. Since 1997, we have had an internal directive which has been applied in all operational sites worldwide. This follows the spirit and major requirements of ATEX, as well as the American NEC 505 standard. Although our sites have a low fire risk, LOral takes it extremely seriously. Our warehouse in Essigny, France, which stores aerosol products containing flammable gases, is considered a model across Europe for fire prevention measures.  Production / Health And Safety / Health & Safety initiatives  Health & Safety initiatives Key initiatives in 2010 included the following: SHAP During 2010 we reviewed our approach to general risk management on all our sites using SHAP (Safety Hazard Assessment Procedure), LOrals proprietary risk analysis tool. A key aim is to engage all our employees, to help them understand and prevent risks in their work environments. In most of our factories, we have achieved an 80% engagement rate, measured through our EHS Culture Audits (Audits Culture), and we will be building on this in 2011. The SHAP methodology was first deployed in 2001 in all our factories and later in our distribution centres. This was accompanied by the creation of a risk analysis function. SHAP is well established across our operations, but our review in 2010 has identified the need to: Extend SHAP to all sites (including administrative centres, laboratories and campuses) Make managers responsible for risk analysis and prevention Develop more awareness and promote the active participation of employees in the risk analysis of their work environment. EHS manual This project aims to bring together all the elements that make up our EHS policy, in order to help our sites to implement it worldwide. The manual complies with international standards, (including ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001), and provides a complete picture of LOrals goals for safety and the environment. It summarises EHS roles and responsibilities in all the Groups structures, as well as EHS directives – helping sites to achieve and maintain a high level of EHS performance. The manual will be published in 2011. Ergonomic Attitude programme In 2010, we extended a 2009 pilot, to develop a group-wide ergonomic programme called Ergonomic Attitude. The programmes principal aim is to develop systematic, focused improvements within our work environments. A group steering committee oversaw the development of the strategy and identified initial focus areas. For each focus area, a workgroup was established, and in 2010 workgroups for computer workstations, packaging line design, best practice sharing, and training and awareness were initiated. In particular, good ergonomic practices were collected across LOrals sites and were published on the group EHS intranet, providing a platform for knowledge sharing across all sites. An Ergonomic Attitude awareness film was created at the end of 2010, which will be available for use by sites to support their development of ergonomic situation awareness and for launching the programme. 2010 was a great year for Ergonomic Attitude and 2011 promises to be even better. MESUR programme MESUR (Managing Effective Safety Using Recognition & Realignment) is a group EHS programme that develops the capacity of an individual to identify risk and act accordingly. MESUR is a programme developed by LOral for LOral. It uses a variety of best practices in Behaviour Based Safety, which are aligned with our safety culture and future vision. The programme requires management to systematically speak to employees about their safety. Employees are observed in day to day activities by management and are then engaged in discussion about their safety, their At Risk Practices and the potential for injury. Solutions are then developed with the individual, with a preference for immediate solutions. MESUR is designed to ensure that: Line management discusses safety with employees on a systematic basis, enabling employees and those with safety responsibilities to discuss best practice and identify improvements together The safety culture of LOral develops to become an interdependent culture Low level signals (At Risk Practices) are identified and reviewed. This provides management with the opportunity to identify potential injury risks before an injury occurs. MESUR has been extended to all our operational sites. In 2010, 6,788 MESUR visits took place. These led to 14,210 actions for improvement, and 92% of these were completed. PERFORMANCE 36,565 suggestions and opportunities for improvement were actioned through our safety programmes in 2010 2010 HEALTH & SAFETY PERFORMANCE DATABANK VIEWPOINTS INTRODUCTION MANAGING EHS RECOGNISING EXCELLENCE HEALTH AND SAFETY > HEALTH AND SAFETY INITIATIVES > AUDIT PROGRAMME CARBON AND ENERGY WATER WASTE AND RECYCLING MADE IN CHIMEX SOURCING RAW MATERIALS SUPPLIER RELATIONS PACKAGING SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS TRANSPORT CONTACT DOWNLOADS GROUP REPORT HOME SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2010 BUSINESS  INNOVATION  PRODUCTION  CONSUMPTION  TALENT  COMMUNITIES  DATABANK  In 2011, it is planned to pilot an extension programme based on MESUR principles with all employees. SIO (Safety Improvement Opportunities) The aim of the SIO programme is to involve employees in sharing responsibility for safety matters and to create a culture of safety. The SIO programme promotes the need for employees to identify areas for improvement and reduce the risk of incidents. These might range from a missing floor tile, an issue with a safety device, or any other improvement that could prevent an accident. Progress is monitored through the Safety Culture rate – the total number of SIOs per million hours worked. Our 2010 performance shows the increasing involvement of our employees: A Safety Culture rate of 636 – a 75% increase on 2009 25,028 SIOs were identified in 2010 across all operational sites 89.3% of these SIOs were completed. Our next target is to close more than 90% of all SIOs identified during 2011.  Production / Health And Safety / Audit programme  Audit programme LOral has a comprehensive audit programme in EHS, including Risk Audits, Culture Audits and Contractor Audits. EHS Risk Audit Risk Audits are designed to ensure that procedures and methods being used by employees do not carry inherent risks. These audits are carried out by independent, recognised experts across our international operations. A team of three or four auditors would typically evaluate a factory over four to five days, while one or two auditors would typically spend two to three days at a distribution centre. In 2010, Risk Audits were carried out in ten factories, nine distribution centres and five administrative sites. EHS Culture Audit This programme was set up in 2009 with a focus on leadership, visible EHS culture and industrial excellence. EHS Culture Audits are triggered by a sites performance and are conducted by internal EHS specialists through group interviews involving 20% to 30% of the sites employees. Before the audit, the site management is invited to carry out a self-evaluation using 16 key criteria (see example below). These are then evaluated during the audit, with the site management and workforce, in order to assess performance and identify opportunities for improvement. In 2010, EHS Culture Audits were carried out in 15 factories and eight distribution centres. Examples of EHS Culture Audits showing results over two years: Suzhou, Asia and Franklin, USA Suzhou factory, Asia Our Suzhou factory was one of 12 across LOrals operations that reached or passed the threshold of one million hours worked without a lost time accident for LOreal employees or temporary workers.

We have an audit programme specifically for contractors who manufacture and/or package our finished goods. This programme focuses on compliance with EHS regulation and risk control. Audit visits are carried out by independent, external auditors on LOrals behalf. In order to become a contractor of LOral, there must be a positive audit result. In 2010, EHS Contractor Audits were carried out at nine contractor factories. See also: Social audits, which focus on suppliers labour standards. Other types of EHS audit Other types of EHS audit include insurance inspections (30 fire and environment inspections in 2010); certification audits (30 site audits in 2010, for ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001); and visits to assure the accuracy of our KPI data – for example, see databank section for this report. EHS Corporate Audit Committee The role of this Committee is to assure the governance, quality and effectiveness of our audit programme. The committee met twice in 2010, to discuss findings and recommendations from audits with zone management, and to define a three-year improvement action plan.  Production / Carbon and energy  Carbon and energy To help address climate change, LOral has made a significant pledge to achieve a 50% reduction in absolute carbon emissions (scope 1 and 2), 2005-2015. We are making good progress and as of 2010 have achieved a reduction of 27% since 2005. Energy and greenhouse gases in manufacturing The cosmetics industry has a relatively low energy demand in comparison with other sectors. For example, LOral is exempt from the European regulations on carbon emission quotas. However, we are committed to using energy efficiently and reducing dependency on fossil fuels. Wherever possible, we purchase natural gas rather than fuel oil (which has a higher carbon intensity) and continue to develop our renewable energy strategy. We value every initiative taken by every site across the world. Each saving is important in reducing our overall carbon footprint. For example: Our Yichang factory in China has reduced the electricity it uses for lighting by 45% (2008- 10) as a result of progressive upgrades including the use of T5 fluorescent lamps In Piscataway, USA, our factory has reduced the amount of electricity used for lighting by 70%, by installing LED lamps and sun tubes, which make use of natural daylight. BUS (Better Utilities for Sustainability) The BUS project, a group-wide pilot project run by operations managers, is drawing on expertise from across LOral to identify methods, technical solutions and good practices in cleansing, cooling, air compression and other factory processes. To date, we have identified 11 good practices in water conservation and energy efficiency. The aim is for these to become second nature and non-negotiable across the group. Halving CO  emissions at Vichy Our Vichy factory has already reduced its carbon footprint by 38% (2005–10). It is partnering with energy provider EDF on three new technology projects, with the aim of reducing carbon emissions by 50% by 2011. Triple energy recovery: Energy from three processes (waste water, steam and compressed air) is recovered to heat water to between 12 and 60C, which is then used for washing and cleaning. Steam is then used to heat the water to a required 70C Free cooling: This applies an ancient principle in a new way: colder night air is captured and re-used for cooling, while in winter the heat generated from the production plant is used to maintain an even temperature Geothermal energy: The heat generated by the geothermal system enables water to be pre-heated in summer, air to be warmed in winter, and it also keeps an even temperature in the building. The cold water produced by the system is used for production processes and for cleaning the plant. TARGET FOR 2015 50%  reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions, scope 1 and 2 Reduction will be calculated on a like-for-like basis (2005–2015) PERFORMANCE 27.8%  absolute reduction since 2005 (scope 1 and 2 emissions) 8.7%  absolute reduction since 2009 (scope 1 and 2 emissions) CO  EMISSIONS SCOPE 1 CO  EMISSIONS SCOPE 2 TOTAL CO  EMISSIONS ENERGY LOral was ranked No. 1 in the annual Climate Counts survey of companies who are managing their climate impacts DATABANK VIEWPOINTS INTRODUCTION MANAGING EHS RECOGNISING EXCELLENCE HEALTH AND SAFETY CARBON AND ENERGY WATER WASTE AND RECYCLING MADE IN CHIMEX SOURCING RAW MATERIALS SUPPLIER RELATIONS PACKAGING SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS TRANSPORT 2 2 2 2 CONTACT DOWNLOADS GROUP REPORT HOME SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2010 BUSINESS  INNOVATION  PRODUCTION  CONSUMPTION  TALENT  COMMUNITIES  DATABANK  LOrals wider carbon footprint By measuring carbon emissions through the whole lifecycle, from raw material extraction to product use and disposal, we are identifying where savings can be made and taking action where we can. Following a study of our eight product categories, we estimate that 12% of our entire footprint relates to raw materials, and 58% on average comes from the use of our products. Green IT We are working to reduce our energy consumption and carbon footprint by implementing an environmentally friendly approach to the use of IT hardware and systems. This includes evaluating IT equipment for energy efficiency, recyclability (including consumable parts such as printer cartridges) and delivery terms (including packaging). For our major data centres, we select outsourcing partners with clear commitments and policies to reduce the carbon footprint of their operations. Tools such as video conferencing and instant messaging have been deployed to workstations, and web conferencing is available to help reduce business travel and minimise our carbon footprint. The new multifunction office copiers now in use in all LOral sites in the Ile de France region provide state-of-the-art functionality, enabling us to monitor our use of consumables and reduce this where possible. The machines provide double-sided printing, better recyclability and improved accessibility for people with reduced mobility, with easy-to-use buttons and levers.  Production / Water  Water LOral has had a strong water conservation programme in place since 2003 and we have made significant progress in reducing total water use and increasing eco-efficiency. Our performance In 2010, we reduced water consumption per finished product by more than 6% while overall water consumption in our factories and distribution centres rose by just over 4% compared to 2009. Over the past five years (2006-10), by challenging every single water use and optimising water systems, we have reduced water use per finished product by 16.5% and cut absolute consumption by 7.6%. This is in the context of a 10.8% increase in production over the same period. Water use Most of the water used in LOral factories is for cleaning production equipment and packaging lines to maintain our strict hygiene standards. This represents approximately 44% of all water consumption in our industrial sites. To meet our targets, we are aiming to reduce the amount of water used for cleaning without affecting quality. This is a major challenge, because cleaning is a complex process that takes place in different ways, depending on the equipment used and the formulas involved. We have developed a new method called OptiCIP, which enables us to take into account site specifics such as equipment and type of product, then apply the most efficient cleaning processes in our factories. In 2010, several factories ran pilot projects (including Warsaw, Poland; Solon and Florence in the United States; and Vichy, France), with initial findings showing significant savings of 50% and more on certain types of equipment. Implementation plans are now in place, with the aim of standardising the OptiCIP method by 2015. Use of rainwater, Fapagau, France Around 80% of the water used at our Fapagau perfume factory in France is for sanitary purposes and cleaning. After conducting a feasibility study, taking into account local rainfall intensity and available roof surface, we installed three storage tanks (with a capacity of 70 m3) to collect rainwater. The use of rainwater has enabled the factory to reduce the use of drinking water by 30% compared to 2009, contributing to conservation of ground water. TARGET 50%  reduction in water consumption per finished product Reduction will be calculated on a like-for-like basis (2005–2015) PERFORMANCE 19.2%  absolute reduction (litres per finished product, 2005–2010) c.8% reduction (absolute terms, 2005–2010) WATER CONSUMPTION WATER QUALITY DATABANK VIEWPOINTS INTRODUCTION MANAGING EHS RECOGNISING EXCELLENCE HEALTH AND SAFETY CARBON AND ENERGY WATER WASTE AND RECYCLING MADE IN CHIMEX SOURCING RAW MATERIALS SUPPLIER RELATIONS PACKAGING SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS TRANSPORT CONTACT DOWNLOADS GROUP REPORT HOME SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2010 BUSINESS  INNOVATION  PRODUCTION  CONSUMPTION  TALENT  COMMUNITIES  DATABANK  Improving the cleaning process, Settimo, Italy Our factory in Settimo doubled its mascara production in 2010. To avoid water and energy increasing in direct proportion, we transferred technology from the chemical industry and now use a component that breaks down the remaining mascara emulsion. This reduces the amount of water and energy used in cleaning the production vessels, improved the efficiency of the cleaning process and delivered ergonomic benefits. Applying simple ideas, Ormes, France Factory teams in Ormes have invented a practical solution to an everyday challenge by finding a new way to clean and change the hoses on tanks and filling machines without compromising strict hygiene standards. The idea is a simple yet effective sock inside the hose, which requires less water, steam and detergent for cleansing. Wastewater In 2010, COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) of wastewaster before treatment was reduced by 4%, which corresponds to 17.5kg COD per tonne of bulk produced. Approximately half of LOrals sites have on-site wastewater treatment plants. These use a range of methods including physical, chemical and biological processes, or other technologies adapted to different wastewater characteristics and local discharge conditions. The COD of wastewater after on-site treatment was reduced by 11.2% to 1.2g COD per finished product. With the aim of minimising overall energy use and solid waste production while maximising residual treatment efficiency, LOral supports European research including a project with the University of Newcastle, UK, which is looking into energy efficiency in wastewater treatment. Transparency in water reporting: Carbon Disclosure Project In 2010, LOral became a Founding Responder to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) water reporting initiative. The CDP is a leading, independent, not for profit organisation that promotes transparency in climate change reporting. In 2010, the CDP expanded its scope to include water reporting. LOral has provided a report to the CDP on water management strategies, including water consumption, water discharge and other initiatives being carried out by the group.  Production / Waste and recycling  Waste and recycling For many years LOral has followed a robust policy of waste management. This goes beyond regulatory compliance and the prevention of human risks to the environment, and consists of waste prevention, reuse, recycling and energy recovery in order to avoid waste to landfill. In 2010, in line with the targets we set in 2009 to reduce waste per finished good by 50% (2005-15), we started new initiatives across the group that go further in reducing waste at source while reducing our overall environmental footprint. 96% of our waste is re-used, recyled or recovered More than 50% of our sites send zero waste to landfill Waste including returnable packaging per finished product reduced by 7.4% compared with 2009. Types of waste Waste is defined as any material leaving LOral sites, other than products, and we distinguish different types of waste in accordance with European regulations. These include transportable wastes (including cardboard, paper, plastic, dirty packaging, pallets, and residues from manufacturing), returnable packaging for transport that circulates between our suppliers and our sites, and exceptional waste such as construction debris. Waste reduction Our priority is to avoid generating waste at all, whether this is unnecessary packaging, or residues from wastewater treatment. This is key to greater resource efficiency and sustainability. In 2010, we reduced waste per finished product by 7.4%, by re-using pallets, more eco-efficient wrapping and packaging, and reducing obsolete products. Joint projects to reduce waste In our Active Cosmetics Division, a production steering group led by a director meets every month to monitor progress on waste management projects. By working with all interested parties including suppliers, the Division has reduced the volume of waste per finished product by 8%, while reducing the volume of returnable packaging per finished product by 17%. We are in the early stages of a groupwide project looking at tertiary packaging and preventing waste at source. Drawing on specialist knowledge from suppliers and eco-design consultancies as well as our packaging, sourcing, production and environmental teams, we will be developing and piloting new indicators to drive our waste management performance. We will also be developing guidelines to help our teams with design and purchasing decisions, including the choice between returnable packaging or recycled and recyclable materials.

These include eco-design processes that harness green chemistry and biotechnology in order to minimise environmental impacts. Chemistry is both a science and an industry. It has always involved transformations of materials that have been essential throughout human history. Made in Chimex provides customers with the assurance that sustainability factors have been taken into account during product design and manufacture, using environmentally friendly technologies and a clear understanding of the environmental footprint of individual products and ingredients. Environmental footprinting As one example, Chimex has studied the environmental footprint of the active anti-aging ingredient Mexoryl OLS (see below), measuring water consumption, the location of raw materials, packaging, carbon footprint and other factors. The chart shows how Chimex has progressively reduced the E-factor for the ingredient Mexoryl since 2008 by using specialised processes – in this case, the volume of waste generated (kg per finished product).

Such partnerships are helping to develop more fuel- efficient processes – for example, the replacement of conventional chemistry with bio-conversion. Benchmarking performance Chimex is working with leading corporate responsibility rating agency Vigo to build a profile of its environmental and social performance. This profile enables Chimex to benchmark its performance within the industry and to examine its sustainability performance across interlinked and often complex issues. Engaging with sustainable development By voluntarily evaluating its social and environmental performance, Chimex shows its commitment to placing corporate responsibility at the heart of its business strategy. The results obtained using our methodology demonstrate a convincing level of engagement with sustainable development, as represented by Made in Chimex. Samuel Dufay, director, Vigo Following the positive results achieved in this evaluation, Chimex is aiming for certification to the LUCIE standard in 2011. This standard, created by Qualit France Association and Vigo, is based on the new ISO 20006 standard for social responsibility.  Production / Sourcing raw materials  Sourcing raw materials Strategic management and responsible sourcing of raw materials is key to LOrals sustainability strategy, the conservation of natural resources and the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems. Sustainable palm oil LOral buys very small amounts of palm oil (approximately 600 tonnes a year, mainly for use in our skin and hair care products), compared to the worldwide consumption of more than 40 million tonnes. Despite being a low volume purchaser, in 2008 we committed to playing our part in the protection of biodiversity and forest ecosystems by sourcing all our palm oil from sustainable plantations. Since January 2010, 100% of our palm oil comes from sustainable, well managed plantations which have been certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). RSPO, of which WWF is a founding member, is a not for profit association of international stakeholders from across the palm oil industry. RSPO was formed to: Develop principles and criteria to ensure that palm oil production is economically viable, environmentally appropriate and socially beneficial Promote plantation management practices Improve land use planning processes for the development of new oil palm plantations Improve risk analysis and decision-making tools for banks and investors on palm oil development Investigate different chain of custody approaches, to create links between the oil palm plantations and the consumer. While recognising that as a small purchaser of palm oil we have a limited influence in this area, in 2010 we took our commitment a step further by joining the Derivatives Coalition Working Group, which is exploring a range of alternative, sustainable raw materials. In 2009, LOral was recognised by WWF as one of the ten most responsible companies using this ingredient. A pioneering community fair trade programme Through its Community Fair Trade programme, The Body Shop sources the highest quality ingredients from 14 countries around the world. These include shea butter from Ghana, supplied by the Tungteiya Women's Shea Butter Association. The Association has invested in local community projects and facilities including schools, health clinics and feeding centres, benefiting tens of thousands of people every year. The brand added new ingredients and suppliers to the programme in 2010: hemp seed oil from the United Kingdom, honey from Bezamarin, Ethiopia and beeswax from Cameroon. More than 65% of products by The Body Shop contain ingredients sourced through its Community Fair Trade programme, including the first fairly traded alcohol in the industry, made from organic sugar cane grown in Ecuador. The programme was recognised in 2010 by the Institute of Marketecology (independent specialists in quality assurance of eco-friendly products, organic agriculture and fair trade management systems).

This new global purchasing programme aims to reach new groups of disadvantaged suppliers all around the world, with particular focus on small scale suppliers, minority-owned suppliers, social enterprises employing people with disabilities, and fair trade companies. Suppliers in these categories tend to be more economically vulnerable, diverse, and might not otherwise be able to trade, or find it difficult to trade, with multi-national companies. We offer them the opportunity to trade with us and we pay them fairly, which helps them to improve their own and their communitys living conditions. To maximise the positive impacts of this programme, we are extending it through our supply chain: sharing implementation of Solidarity Sourcing with our Tier 1 suppliers, with a view to subsequently cascading to Tier 2 suppliers. The programme is applied across all areas of group purchasing, from raw materials for our products to real estate. Launched in 2010, Solidarity Sourcing will be implemented during 2011 and managed by each of our Sourcing Centre teams around the world. We will measure the success of the programme with precise and specific indicators, such as the number of jobs created.

We also maintain a dialogue with our suppliers to better understand how they are addressing their own sustainable development issues. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) We consider that our suppliers carbon emissions are part of our wider corporate footprint and that we need to work with them to make progress. As a member of the CDP since 2003, and of the CDP Supply Chain Leadership Collaboration Project since 2007, we continue to encourage suppliers to measure and manage their carbon emissions; 30% of our supplier base, by revenue, is involved with LOral in the CDP. In 2010, 43 suppliers (up from 29 in 2009) responded positively to our invitation to join with us in the CDP. Both the number and participation rate are above the average for CDP members.

Asia Pacific In November 2010, LOral Asia Pacific invited more than 350 delegates, representing 140 companies – including suppliers of raw materials, packaging and industrial equipment, as well as most of our subcontractors in the region – to a supplier event in Hong Kong. The main objectives were to share LOrals vision in Asia for the next decade and to reward 12 suppliers for their recent outstanding contributions. In China, we organised four supplier seminars on compliance with RPP950 and REACh regulations on the use of chemicals. These sessions, funded entirely by LOral, were held at supplier sites and involved Intertek, SGS and other accredited third parties. All of LOrals worldwide suppliers have now signed the RPP950 Commitment Letter, which outlines the banning of PVC. LOral Nihon Purchasing also invited its point of sale and promotional suppliers and internal stakeholders to share LOrals group Policy. There was a special emphasis on social responsibility, and our consultants SGS gave our suppliers an overview of performance assessments and compliance with national standards, Chinese legal regulations and our Social Audit process. Engaging globally LOral purchasing teams regularly take part in roundtable discussions with our suppliers of point of sale materials, through POPAI, the global association of retail marketing companies.

Small, minority and women-owned suppliers Our purchasing of point of sale and promotional materials has recently been centralised across Europe and for some worldwide projects. We still maintain relationships with our small local suppliers, many of whom have more than ten years history with LOral. In Russia, for example, 15 suppliers have been on our supplier list for the last 15 years. In the United States, our total spend on small, minority and women-owned suppliers for 2010 rose by 2.3% to $58,372m (up from $57,040m in 2009). Our procurement spend with minority and women-owned businesses is 7% of our total procurement spend.  Production / Supplier Relations / Social audit programme  Social audit programme We are committed to working with suppliers who share our values and ethical commitments, so we assess supplier sites worldwide. These audits are independently conducted on our behalf and paid for by LOral. Social audits Since 2002, LOral has had a programme to ensure that our suppliers comply with all applicable laws, respect human and labour rights, ensure the health and safety of workers, and protect the environment. To date, we have completed social audits at more than 2,500 supplier sites, 567 of which were carried out in 2010 as below, and we aim to carry out a further 400 social audits in 2011. Programme developments In 2010, we revisited and upgraded our social audit programme in order to help our suppliers develop their approach further by moving beyond compliance towards best practices. This focused on: Communication – ensuring that our suppliers have total transparency about LOrals expectations, our audit processes and performance assessments Programme principles – flexibility and practicality in adhering to our ethical values Tracking and reporting – closely monitoring progress and recognising the specific actions taken by our suppliers. We are revising the assessment categories used during audits, so that it is clear when immediate action or continuous improvement is needed, depending on the type of compliance issue involved. When these developments have been completed, we will communicate our approach to our suppliers and aim to provide a Suppliers Principles Guide for publication in 2011. Child labour We want to help end the exploitation of children in the workplace and we actively seek out and favour business partners who share our values and our ethical commitments. In 2010, LOral communicated a specific policy on child labour to suppliers. This states that our suppliers and subcontractors cannot hire employees who are under the minimum local legal working age, or who have not yet finished their mandatory schooling, and in any case who are under the age of 16.

Developing awareness in Asia Pacific In Asia Pacific we have held internal training and workshops for purchasing teams in ethics and supplier relations. The LOral Code of Ethics was reviewed, and LOrals requirements regarding fair competition, conflicts of interest, gifts and entertainment, management of confidential information, intellectual property rights were discussed in detail. All our suppliers in the region have signed a letter confirming their understanding of LOral standards including our gifts and entertainment policy. We believe that these and similar approaches being pursued by LOral as a purchasing company in the Asia Pacific market are important in supporting an emerging market for sustainably sourced products and services in the region. Packaging, point of sale and promotions In April 2010, we held our first Cherry Pack packaging innovation forum at LOral Headquarters in Paris. This brought together leading international suppliers, who presented more than a hundred packaging innovations exclusively to 350 senior executives from across LOral. Among the 56 projects pre-selected by LOral brands and our Research & Innovation teams, 33 were retained and ten chosen for development. A joint project between LOral and the Greek company Lantzis Labels SA has helped to reduce the use of raw materials in our printed labels by 40%, reduced environmental waste by 45%, and brought significant cost savings. Working with Earth Spectrum, our Consumer Products Division has switched from polypropylene to PET for its lightboxes. The material is transparent, cost-effective and more sustainable: PET contains 30% post-consumer recycled material, and both PET and the ink used are 100% recyclable. Holografica, one of our printing suppliers in Brazil, has developed a new ecological ink based on vegetable oils and organic pigments. A joint development project with Gerresheimer has led to the production of recycled glass containers for our Garnier, Vichy and Biotherm brands. For more details, see Packaging. LOral Russia has stopped using PVC in its point of sale and promotional material. Promotional campaigns for Garnier and Vichy sun protection products used cardboard point of sale displays instead of metal, and identified clear savings in materials, water and CO  emissions. LOral Uruguay has harmonised the size of brochures and banners to reduce the amount of paper needed. All the point of sale materials for Srie Nature are locally designed and produced on recycled paper. We are working with manufacturers in China and Indonesia to reduce the paper used to manufacture our paper bags and increase the proportion of recycled materials. In Japan, we only use Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper for point of sale printed materials and our point of sale displays use recycled materials for multiple use. Green purchasing initiatives in Taiwan include replacing PVC with PET, sourcing wood from well managed forests for our boutiques, and surveying suppliers about their use of FSC-certified materials. LOral USA has successfully redesigned and standardised the pallets used to transport promotional merchandising. These are now made from recycled materials, and in three months, we have used 38% fewer pallets, saving the equivalent of 227 trees, and CO  emissions from nine cars.

Supplier portal The supplier portal on LOrals website was launched in 2008, and provides a dedicated space for existing and potential new suppliers. In 2010, this was upgraded to promote our LOral Buy&Care Programme, and to provide recent information about joint initiatives with suppliers. Suppliers can also use the portal to submit new ideas or proposals. iTender Two tools have been selected to simplify information exchange with our suppliers. These are Emptoris e-sourcing (an updgraded version has been implemented in Europe, North America and South America in 2010) and the iTender purchasing tool. iTender has been selected and implemented in several European countries, including Poland, Norway, Finland and Sweden. iTender significantly reduces the need to store physical documents relating to purchasing, and enables LOral and its suppliers to communicate and exchange documents electronically. This saves paper and storage space, and makes the tendering process more efficient.

Our approach LOrals major divisions and zones have their own packaging design and production services, each of which follows the standards and guidelines established at group level, especially on packaging and the environment. LOrals innovation in packaging includes eco-design, weight and volume reductions, new materials and technologies, recycled content, and lifecycle evaluation. Our approach is based on Respect, Reduce, Replace: Respect – for consumers, nature and biodiversity Reduce – packaging weight and volume Replace – renewable resources and recycled materials. Recycled glass for Garnier, Biotherm and Vichy jars A joint development project with the company Gerresheimer has led to the production of recycled glass containers for Garnier, Vichy and Biotherm brands. It is a real technical breakthrough: recycled glass (using broken glass, called cullet) with the same good looks and clarity as non-recycled, sourced from mineral water bottles which are processed using new technology. The result is high quality glass containers and reduced environmental impact. The energy needed to melt the cullet in special ovens is less than that needed to transform sand and silica into glass – meaning 20% less CO  compared to a conventional forge. Overall, the production of 25 million containers for Garnier, Vichy and Biotherm has led to a reduction in CO  of 84 tonnes.

Sustainable forests The worlds forests are vital for ecosystems, biodiversity and carbon capture, and support livelihoods and communities around the world. LOral only uses wood fibre from well-managed, sustainable sources. More than 90% of our sources are well managed and certified. Most are certified by the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) and the remainder have the PEFC certification (in those few cases where FSC material is not yet available). Our goal is 100% from certified sources by the end of 2011. More than 700 of our products carry the FSC logo, and 85% of LOral's printers in Europe are FSC- certified. With FSC certification, we ensure that the whole Chain of Custody is certified, from the forest to the printer. In France, the certificates are delivered by Bureau Veritas. For our EU operations, our wood fibre is sourced mainly from Scandinavian and Polish forests that are certified sustainable. Eco-design good practice LOral is present in more than 130 countries with a portfolio of 23 international brands and it is important that our environmental packaging strategy is consistent. We are developing tools and sharing good practice to help brand design teams to integrate sustainability. This includes a three- day seminar on Sustainable Packaging for our product development, packaging and purchasing teams, exploring environmental challenges and impact reduction. Since 2009, more than 200 team members have attended this training in Europe, the United States and Asia. To raise awareness among marketing teams, we launched a 50 page guide in our four European divisions, which is also due to be launched in the United States, Asia and Latin America in 2011. This explains the importance of packaging for sustainability; the principles of eco-design in reducing environmental impacts; and outlines good practice in providing environmental information to consumers.

Weight reduction at source Since the beginning of the 1990s, and as new packaging technologies have become available, LOral has developed lighter and lighter packaging. Today, LOrals plastic bottles are among the lightest on the market. In 2010, we saved a further 590 tonnes of plastic, and a total of 2,110 tonnes since 2008. Our weight reduction programme goes further than just the packaging of our finished products. We are looking at the whole supply chain, even including the packaging of packaging. See: Waste and recycling. Volume reduction Limiting the environmental impacts associated with packaging means reducing volume as well as weight. A procedure introduced in 2008 is enabling LOral to measure packaging volume and help marketing teams ensure the right balance between the volume of the package and the volume of product it contains. Garniers pledge Over the last decade Garnier has been a pioneer in packaging reduction. It is the leader in cosmetics, being the only cosmetics brand to pledge to reduce the weight of its plastic packaging by 15% by 2012. As of 2010, Garnier is on track to meet this goal, having already achieved a reduction of 8% compared to 2008. Other LOral brands are taking a lead from Garniers commitments and initatives in this field.

Recycled materials We look at how the product will be used and what might happen to the packaging at the end of the products life. We limit the types of material we use so that packaging can be recycled through public facilities. In 2010, Garnier, Vichy and Biotherm launched a jar that contains 40% post-consumer recycled glass. The Body Shop also uses up to 30% recycled content in its glass perfume bottles. For the first time, we have recycled glass that looks good and which does not affect the price of the product. Kiehls, The Body Shop, Sanoflore and LOral Professionnel use recycled PET and in some cases this comprises 100% of the content of the packaging. Lancme, Matrix and Sanoflore use recycled PE in tubes and bottles – for example, Lancme Aroma blue tube has 50% recycled PE. Types of packaging material used Renewable materials LOral only considers new types of renewable material if they come from renewable resources and if there is a clearly reduced environmental impact. LOral rejects any material that is in direct competition with food sources. We do not apply the concept of biodegradability to our packaging materials. A material can only be defined as biodegradable if it breaks down in a certain way within a limited period. Biodegradable materials are not capable of protecting our products in transit, on the shelf, or in use. Our efforts in sustainable packaging are focused instead on reuse, recycling and materials replacement. Bioplastics research For several years, LOral has been investigating the potential of bioplastics. So far, these materials have not had the necessary composition to protect and conserve the product over time. LOral is providing five-year funding for the Chair in Bioplastics at the Ecole des Mines in Paris, along with four other companies. This work is being carried out in close collaboration with EPNOE (European Polysaccharide Network of Excellence) and is co-ordinated by CEMEF (Centre de Mise en Forme des Matriaux / Centre for Material Forming). Download an overview of some of the research topics and scientific challenges. Consumers and the environment Going beyond existing regulations on heavy metal content, LOral does not use materials and substances that might present the slightest risk to consumers and the environment.

Following an in- depth study of its point of sale (POS) footprint and an eco- design process, there have been significant savings in materials, electricity consumption and a 46% reduction in carbon emissions. 2008: identifying the carbon footprint of POS displays In 2008, the global carbon footprint of the worldwide merchandising activities of LOral Paris was 44,730 tonnes of CO  equivalent. LOral Paris began the process with a joint carbon footprinting study with the French government agency lADEME and eco-design experts ECO  Initiative. This enabled LOral Paris to identify the key environmental challenges related to POS which centre on use of materials (a ratio of 2:1 in favour of metal) and electricity used to light the cabinet. The study showed that 57% of the carbon footprint comes from the manufacture of POS displays and 32% is due to in-store electrical consumption. Freight transport is responsible for 9% of emissions. 2009: an eco-design approach to reduce the carbon footprint of POS Having completed the study to identify the carbon footprint of our POS displays, LOral Paris communicated its findings internally and to POS manufacturers. LOral Paris provided them with a carbon calculator tool and expert training to help realise the new vision for POS displays – reducing the quantities of materials used, considering the use of low-carbon alternative materials and reducing the amount of electricity used by displays in store.

Since 2007, weve been making significant progress in reducing the electricity usage of our displays, but in 2009 we really broke the mould in terms of how we approach the issue. While maintaining the high quality of our displays, we reduced the thickness of the materials, changed the displays to incorporate wood and optimised the lighting in order to reduce the total number of bulbs used. There was an immediate impact on the volume and weight of materials used and electricity consumption. Contrary to received wisdom, reducing the environmental impact of our displays has also reduced our costs and stimulated innovation – the environmental impact has been improved while the unit price cost has lowered. 2010: PEARL – reducing our carbon footprint by 46% In 2010, LOral Paris redesigned its PEARL make-up display cabinet to achieve the following results: The back of the display cabinet, which was previously made of metal, has been replaced with wood. The total amount of metal used in the cabinet has been reduced by 50% The plastic drawers have been redesigned, and are now 50% thinner, without harming the aesthetics the unit now uses low-energy lamps, which have been repositioned to enable a 50% reduction in the number of bulbs needed without reducing brightness. These changes have reduced the total carbon footprint of the display unit by 46%, reduced the cost per unit by 20%, and reduced in-store energy consumption by 50%. Shafik Asal, co-founder of the ECO  Initiative, commented: Point of sale displays are made by sub-contractors and installed on third-party premises. As part of the design process, its necessary to bring together a complex chain of buyers and suppliers, in which there may appear to be conflicting interests. However, by taking an intelligent approach to eco-design, its possible to add both economic and environmental value. Next steps: the POS of 2020 and end-of-life strategies LOral Paris is using the extremely positive results from the PEARL project and applying a similar eco-design approach to all new point-of-sale products to be developed in coming years. This approach will help LOral Paris to achieve its goal of Factor 4: to reduce the carbon footprint of all POS displays by 75% by 2050. To achieve this, it is important to look at optimising material usage and electricity consumption, but equally to consider making longer-lasting POS displays which can be recovered at the end of their life, remanufactured and reused in future models. 2  Production / Sustainable buildings  Sustainable buildings LOrals Sustainable Buildings Policy was established in January 2008 and applies to all buildings owned or operated by the group worldwide. The principle is that all major construction projects of new buildings and significant renovation projects must comply with LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification or a local equivalent (such as HQE in France, or other international standards such as CASBEE or BREEAM). On top of such certification, our construction and renovation projects must meet our equivalent internal standards, detailed in a comprehensive guide. These govern the choice of locations, approaches to reducing energy consumption, use of green energy or renewable energies, water harvesting, use of renewable building materials, the quality and comfort of the interior spaces, and innovation.

In 2010, 17 plants were audited (out of a total of 38). This approach will be extended to all LOral-owned administrative centres and research campuses worldwide. The audit programme is helping to consolidate a map of energy consumption across all LOreal buildings, so that we can develop action plans to reduce energy use and maximise energy recovery. 2  Production / Transport  Transport LOral optimises its global production on a regional basis, placing operations teams as close as possible to the markets they serve. This allows each production site to be more responsive and more efficient in terms of logistics and transport. While the cosmetics industry is not, relatively speaking, a significant emitter of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), transport still contributes to LOrals overall carbon footprint. LOrals logistics network sees over four billion products a year move from factories to distribution centres to our customers all over the world. New carbon reduction initiatives in 2010 With 58% of LOrals transport use by road, where feasible our logistics operations use greener forms of transport that still enable us to meet required lead times and costs. In 2010, we have focused on different methods and various modes of transport with lower GHG emissions: Electric vehicles In our efforts to find a solution for making deliveries in major cities, LOrals Luxury Products division in France makes deliveries to Parisian clients in MODEC electric vehicles. This saves 12 tonnes of CO  a year. Our work with GEFCO, a leader in logistics, combined with our experience using our first three electric lorries, have led to us using a fully electric vehicle which offers the same performance as our fuel vehicles. We are looking to increase the percentage of electric vehicle deliveries within bigger cities. We are currently running a feasibility study which will allow us to develop a long term strategy for deliveries on a more international scale. Transport between sites Following the reorganisation of our logistics network when LOral acquired Yves Saint Laurent, the Luxury Products Division reorganised the distribution of goods between our sites in the north of France. LOral used vehicles with the latest energy saving features such as more efficient motors and tyres, which have resulted in a 28% saving in fuel consumption. In Latin America, a greater number of road routes have been replaced with rail routes for transporting maritime containers from our factory in Mexico to the Veracruz port. Additionally, the Consumer Products division has increased its use of rail transport from their factory in Rambouillet so that rail now accounts for 20% of tonnes transported per km. Transport suppliers LOral has introduced two new criteria in selecting carriers and transport suppliers: a sustainability questionnaire and a sustainability indicator in the score cards used in the selection process.

It is a three hour ferry journey or 1200 km (two days by road) from the main cities of South Island. Our Professional Products Division used to air freight all products to our South Island customers to meet 24 hour or less delivery times. Analysis of our CO  emissions showed that 71% of the total New Zealand emissions due to freight arose from delivery to customers in the South Island, which represent less than 10% of the group's New Zealand business. Wanting to balance our environmental responsibilities with customer care, we decided to seek feedback from our customers before deciding on a course of action. All the hair salons we consulted expressed their willingness for us to deliver by road (48 hours) rather than by air (24 hours), if this reduced CO  emissions. As a result, with the co-operation of our customers, LOral reduced its transport CO  emissions by 68% in New Zealand. Measuring transport GHGs Carbon footprint measurement is complex and wide ranging, not least of all in our logistics operations. To ensure that we can calculate and report carbon emissions indicators (including Tonne/Km and CO /Stock Keeping Unit) associated with our distribution network, we have adopted and are piloting a reporting tool and carbon footprinting methodology validated by ADEME, the French official body overseeing sustainability, which is compliant with the GHG International Protocol and supported by the WBCSD (World Business Council for Sustainable Development). Starting from shipment characteristics (weight, volume, number of parcels), the tool maps the transport journey, including types of transport, and will help us with decision making around choices of transport and packaging reduction strategies. It measures CO  emissions related to transport made (ie controlled and paid) by LOreal, including . emissions linked to vehicle manufacturing; extraction, transport and transformation for liquid fuels; and combustion. The tool is currently being refined and trialled in our logistics operations in Asia, and when fully implemented across the group, it will enable LOral to determine more precisely the level of CO emitted from transport operations. We will then be able to more accurately calculate the total footprint of our products and seek improvements in carbon emissions and achieve greater operational and cost efficiency. In 2010, LOral reports an estimated 2,239,128 Ktonnes, representing an increase of 2.6% compared to 2009. (Ktonnes = one thousand tonnes transported per km). New car fleet policy in Russia By working with Volkswagen, LOral in Russia has also reduced the environmental impact of its car fleet. By changing the class of engines available, from Euro 3/Euro 4 to Euro 4/Euro 5, CO  emissions have been reduced by 7% compared to 2009 and fuel consumption will decrease from 8 litres per km to 6 litres per km. Greener miles between France and Italy Thanks to a multi-mode transport strategy operating between LOrals factory in Rambouillet, France and Calvignasco, Italy, carbon emissions have been cut by 90% and transport costs reduced by 15%, through the combined use of rail and road. 2 2 2 2 2 2 2  VIEWPOINTS INTRODUCTION CORPORATE CONSUMER RESPONSIBILITY ENGAGING EXTERNALLY RESPONSIBLE COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCT ACCESSIBILITY PRODUCT SAFETY Tony Blackshaw Senior Lecturer,  Sheffield Hallam University Maria Jones International Consumer  Affairs Director, LOral Engaging externally Report downloads Product safety Leave feedback Expert opinion on meeting the needs of new lifestyles LISTEN TO EXPERT OPINION CONTACT DOWNLOADS GROUP REPORT HOME SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2010 BUSINESS  INNOVATION  PRODUCTION  CONSUMPTION  TALENT  COMMUNITIES  DATABANK Find out about our key themes  VIEWPOINTS INTRODUCTION CORPORATE CONSUMER RESPONSIBILITY ENGAGING EXTERNALLY RESPONSIBLE COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCT ACCESSIBILITY PRODUCT SAFETY Tony Blackshaw Senior Lecturer,  Sheffield Hallam University Maria Jones International Consumer  Affairs Director, LOral Consumption / Viewpoints  CONSUMPTION How we develop sustainable consumer relations There is a sense that the world is changing and becoming more hybrid. There are different markets emerging and different ways of consuming. The world that we are living in is becoming increasingly uncertain. It's what you might call a 'liquid world' where people are confronted with many uncertainties and it seems that they look to the things that are consistent in their lives such as consumer products.  Tony Blackshaw, Senior Lecturer, Sheffield Hallam University No more can we say that the dominant market is the western world. That's why we are so conscious of the way in which we feed back information received from the many different countries where we sell our products. It's absolutely critical that we feed this information back robustly to our marketing people and to our research teams. Today, people want to retain their culture and don't want to be swallowed up by other countries. It is important for us to remember that.

Companies cannot meet the challenge of sustainable consumption alone. We must involve and engage our consumers, who have a major role to play. Corporate Consumer Responsibility (CCR) LOrals comprehensive CCR vision formalises our contract with consumers, puts them at the heart of everything we do and sets out seven key commitments that reinforce trust in our brands. This trust is essential to engaging with our consumers, meeting their beauty needs through sustainable products, and encouraging positive behaviours.

The result of Garniers initiative is a specially designed, recycling container for the bathroom, available free of charge. It has two compartments so that people can sort and carry items more easily from the bathroom to recycling, and avoid end-of-life packaging from going to landfill. Garniers campaign has raised awareness among consumers, and a significant percentage of calls to LOrals customer advisers are requests for the container. In 2010, 15,000 were distributed free to consumers and Garnier widely promotes the offer on its website. Labelling on Garnier products (including the Fructis range) reminds customers of the need to recycle and provides clear information on the products footprint – the result of extensive studies into environmental impacts throughout the life cycle. Luxury, new markets and sustainability There are close parallels between sustainability and luxury. Both respond to key human aspirations including the desire for genuine origins and shared social identity. Growth economies, with increasing high net worth individuals, aspire to authentic luxury and to sustainable growth. LOral takes these fundamental legitimate calls into account with its own strategic objectives in new markets, recognising both the aspirations of consumers for a luxury born out of their own cultural sources rather than Western representations and also the challenges of sustainable consumption. LOral is the first cosmetics company to assess its sustainability approach in a transparent way, by publishing a Sustainable Development Report specific to LOral China. In our Luxury Products division, Giorgio Armani skincare and make-up are increasingly the preferred choices among Asian consumers. Anti-ageing serum Crema Nera Extrema is one of the biggest successes, helping to increase sales of the brand sales by 76.7% in China.  Consumption / Corporate Consumer Responsibility  Corporate Consumer Responsibility LOrals seven Corporate Consumer Responsibility commitments are the basis for engaging with our consumers, sharing a vision of responsible, sustainable consumption then acting together to achieve it. 1. Innovative products and product efficacy For LOral, innovation and product efficacy go hand in hand, demonstrated through scientific and clinical proof. However, the quality of a shampoo mousse, for example, is perceived very differently by different cultures. For this reason, innovation at LOral combines our research into diverse beauty customs and preferences with robust scientific knowledge and increasing use of green chemistry principles. Youth Code by LOral Paris is a range of new anti-ageing products and the result of pioneering research in the science of genes. 2. Product safety Irreproachable product safety is at the heart of every LOral brand. We test our products rigorously and continually explore new techniques such as predictive research methods, which exploit scientific breakthroughs. Read more about these approaches in the Innovation section. 3. Sustainable marketing According to Mintel research, consumers check whether packaging can be recycled after purchase, and that this is a motivation in future decisions to buy the same product. Our packaging and point of sale programme is a strategic priority, focused on recyclability, responsible sourcing of materials, weight and volume reductions, and use of recycled and renewable materials. More than 90% of the wood fibre sourced for our packaging comes from certified sustainable sources and 700 of our products carry the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) logo. Read more about packaging in the Production section. 4. Responsible advertising We ensure that our advertising and promotional material is based on proven performance and scientific data, and that the information we provide is readily understandable by consumers. We adopted the French Union of Advertisers (UDA) Charter in 2007 and once again report the actions we have taken. 5. Transparency and care We aim to provide the best advice, support and education to our consumers. LOral has 357 specialist Consumer Advisers in 54 countries where we have a subsidiary. 6. Availability of our products LOral aims to make its products as widely available as possible. Read more in Product accessibility. 7. Sharing best practice with industry and stakeholders We participate in industry groups and engage with consumer organisations, listening to concerns and taking action when needed.

Garnier launches Bio Active After four years of research, we launched Garnier Bio Active in 2010 – our first certified organic anti-wrinkle skincare. The products contain 95% ingredients of natural origin, and up to 20% organic ingredients, including samphire with anti-ageing properties. Garnier Bio Active is designed using an eco- responsible approach at each stage of its development. Our production plants are ISO 14001 certified and our European factories are also Ecocert* certified to manufacture our organic products. Sound energy management at our plants has resulted in reduced water consumption, reduced energy and carbon emissions, and 99% of waste is recycled. Bio Active packaging has been developed taking into account the environmental impact throughout the life cycle, for example, the boxes contain over 90% recycled fibre and the cardboard is FSC certified. *Ecocert is an independent certification accredited by the government guaranteeing a strict traceability for natural and organic cosmetics.  Consumption / Engaging externally  Engaging externally In 2010, LOral took part in external initiatives to explore solutions and discuss the challenges of sustainable consumption and Corporate Consumer Responsibility (CCR). These engagements involved a wide range of stakeholders and organisations representing consumers and public authorities: At the European Business Summit held in June 2010, in Brussels, LOral led a panel which included Commissioner John Dalli and Madame Monique Goyens, Director General of BEUC, the European Consumers Organisation. Corporate responsibility and consumer engagement were also discussed at the French industry association MEDEF, which aims to share good practices, particularly among small and medium enterprises. LOral is actively engaged in projects with the French National Consumer Council (CNC), which are bringing together business, consumer associations and public authorities under the leadership of the Secretary of State for Consumer Affairs. In 2010, CNC unanimously adopted three guidelines around the management of personal customer data, the provision of information for consumers related to nanotechnology in consumer goods, and environmental information on products. LOral is also actively engaged in a dialogue with consumer associations and NGOs on the topic of responsible communications. Sustainability makes brands more meaningful for consumers In the second annual Brand Sustainable Futures report, corporate sustainability is closely linked to brand meaningfulness. The survey, which was conducted with 30,000 consumers in nine countries, indicates that the more sustainable the brand is perceived to be, the more meaningful and trusted it becomes in the mind of consumers. L'Oral Paris was one of the most-improved companies in the survey compared to 2009, based on the survey score, which assesses the sustainable health of brands over time. The survey reveals that social issues and sustainability still rank as major concerns among consumers worldwide. Furthermore the onus for action rests firmly with companies, with a significant 80% of consumers expecting business to act responsibly. Also, an increasing majority (76%, up from 70% in 2009) place the responsibility for environmental and social issues on business rather than governments. Despite this, only 29% believe that brands are really working hard to resolve sustainability issues, and while 86% of consumers consider sustainability aspects when shopping, over half do not do so systematically or often. The survey authors believe that this gap between intent and reality can be addressed by companies and brands who adopt clear and engaging communications, offer greater product incentives (such as price), and make their products widely available and accessible, which are all cited as key barriers to responsible consumption.

Kiehls efforts to encourage recycling and upcycling Among the measures taken by Kiehls in 2010, the brand partnered with a manufacturer of eco- friendly materials to encourage customers to not only recycle their used Kiehls bottles but to think about the inventive ways they can upcycle waste. Leading by example, Kiehls iconic Lab Coat, which has been worn by Kiehls Customer Representatives since the brand's early days – is now to be made from Bionic Yarn fabric, made with fibres derived from plastic bottles. Each of the new Lab Coats is constructed from 10 plastic bottles, and bottles recycled at Kiehls will go towards this and other new, functional items. Kiehls also offered its customers an excusively designed, limited edition eco-tote bag manufactured from Bionic Yarn, and customers participating in the Recycle and Be Rewarded programme will be eligible to receive the tote bag free of charge.

This includes ensuring that advertising and promotional material is based on proven performance and scientific data, and that the information we provide is readily understandable by consumers. We also uphold the principles in a number of other codes on a global basis in all our advertising. UDA Charter on Responsible Communication The UDA (French Union of Advertisers) Charter on Responsible Communication covers responsible communications and marketing, consumer privacy and social and environmental impacts. Since 2007, LOral has been a signatory to the Charters five commitments and every year we report our progress against these. International Code of Advertising Practice We recognise the International Chamber of Commerces International Code of Advertising Practice as the principal global guidance on responsible advertising, and fully support its principles and implementation.

Consumption / Product accessibility  Product accessibility We want to bring our beauty promise to more women and men around the world – through new product categories attuned to needs, cultures and aspirations; by making our brands available at the right price through international distribution channels; and by demonstrating our corporate responsibility. Accessible innovation LOrals strategy is to reach new consumers by making our brands as widely accessible as possible. This involves paying careful attention to positioning products at the right price, which is not a synonym for at a low price, nor does it come at any price. Our commitment to product accessibility and suitability for consumers in different parts of the world (for example, offering products in tubes rather than bottles, or in smaller-format containers and sachets) goes hand in hand with our commitment to performance, safety, and respect for people and the environment. As part of packaging eco-design, we carefully evaluate any environmental impacts of smaller formats, such as the potential increase in packaging material per volume of product. Garnier offers mini-formats and mini-pricing adapted to the needs of consumers in South East Asian markets, including Garnier Light sachets in Thailand and Fructis shampoo sachets in India. Increasing accessibility In 2010, LOral brands continued to offer accessible innovation to consumers. From our Consumer Products Division, Elseve Hydra Max shampoo by LOral Paris, Caffeine Anti-dark Circles 2-in-1 Eye Roll-on from Garnier, and The Volum Express Falsies Mascara from Maybelline New York, are all available at prices to reach the widest number of consumers. LOral Triple Active and Garnier Essentials have also gone from strength to strength, especially among young Asian consumers. The Body Shop effectively doubled its brand presence in India in 2010, and now has 55 stores in 23 cities. The brands naturally inspired, 100% vegetarian products offered at a price that is accessible to millions of people, together with its natural and ethical beauty values, resonate with Indian customers. A hair salon for everyone An accessible hair salon in Grenoble is the first of its kind in France. LOral Professional provided half of the funding needed to create a salon fully adapted to the needs of all customers.

The group took part in the creation of the first Gender Equality European Standard, initiated by Arborus with the support of the European Commission. At an international level, LOral participated in the creation of the first international certification for gender equality, initiated by Swiss Foundation the Gender Equality Project, in partnership with the World Economic Forum. To proactively promote gender diversity, LOral created the first Company Parent-Friendly Charter in 2008 in France with SOS Prma (a national parent support association) and sponsored by the Ministry of Labour. The initiative, in line with gender equality in the workplace, highlights our determination to encourage a work environment where working parents can better manage their professional and personal lives. Moreover, in 2010 several LOral subsidiaries offer access to day care centres. In 2002, LOral Canada launched the LOral Kids Care Centre which provides 36 places for LOral employees children. Since 2008, LOral Germanys Day Care Centre provides space for 18 kids. In France, at the end of 2010, 87 places were available in the five multi-company day care centres that have been established near to LOral. In addition, by the end of 2010, a multi-company recreational centre run by Filapi, will host 17 children (from age three upwards) on Wednesdays and during school holidays. In addition, we wanted to address salary discrepancies between men and women and we have progressed significantly over the past two years. The gap is around than 3% in France. Female representation in our business 63% of the worldwide workforce 61% of new recruits 58% of managers 45% of LOral group brands are headed by women 39% of Management Committees 21.4% of the Executive Committee (since January 2011) 45% of new appointees to expatriate positions 34% of employees holding expatriate positions abroad 15 women were appointed to the post of Managing Director in 2010 Measuring our progress Assessing and measuring our success is an important part of our policy. In 2010, we produced our first Diversity Overview Report, which includes over a hundred indicators. Dedicated to our employees, partners and other key stakeholders, this report is a basis not only for managing our policy, but also for dialogue with all those concerned.  Our Diversity Overview Report achieved a Grand Prix award at the 6th International Diversity Forum. For 2011, the objective is to create our first international Diversity Overview Report.  Talent / Diversity Management / Diversity management framework  Diversity management framework LOrals approach to promoting diversity is reflected at every level of the group. Our 2005-2010 ambitions Reflect the diversity of origins within our teams Promote gender equality within our teams Encourage the employment of people with disabilities Encourage work experience in anticipation of a longer work life Develop an inclusive managerial culture, respectful of all Promote the emergence of a diversity community or ecosystem Deploy and evaluate the diversity policy. Principles for action Respect our standards of excellence in terms of competencies and individual performance Attract candidates from outside our usual talent sources and identify profiles that will bring new perspectives Create a social dynamic and promote diversity externally, through working with our partners (suppliers, clients) and other stakeholders Measure and report our progress. Our 2005-2010 framework Policy and charters Five years after establishing our formal group diversity policy, we remain committed to promoting diversity within the workplace as a key driver in our the groups performance. We formalised our commitment to diversity when we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact in 2003. We were also one of the first companies to sign the national Diversity Charter in France. Subsequently, we helped to create a national charter for Italy, Sweden and signed the seven existing Diversity Charters in Europe. Furthermore, LOral is committed to promoting specific dimensions of diversity, such as gender/parenthood, social background and age, by co-creating other commitments such as the Parent-Friendly Charter, and signing agreements with governments (such as the Plan Espoir Banlieues in France in 2008), and with trade unions (such as the agreement for employment of senior employees in France). We were one of the first companies to receive the Diversity Label in 2009 from AFNOR, a French certification company, in recognition of the groups commitment to equal opportunities, promotion of diversity and prevention of discrimination.

Broad Based Black Employment Equity scorecard level 5  Talent / Dialogue  Dialogue We encourage open dialogue and engagement between employees, their representatives and LOral. Employee feedback We place great importance on open communication with our employees. We are keen to hear their views on LOral and on issues that affect them. LOral has carried out a global employee opinion survey (Pulse) since 2003. The last survey covered 28,000 employees in 28 countries and 150 taskforces are now turning the ideas generated into action around the business. These include time-management guidance, car-sharing schemes and individual Training Passports, along with many other initiatives. The survey will be repeated in 2011 and 2012 across the group. Fostering labour relations France: Labour relations at LOral are based on mutual trust and respect. In France, there are 96 bodies representing the views and interests of our employees. These have 603 employee representatives and cover 1,183 areas of interest. Our employees have access to a wide range of forums and representation, including works councils and committees, union representatives, occupational health and safety committees, and the group committee. There are also informal forums for social dialogue (known as RIEDS in France). In France, LOral has signed 25 internal agreements. (If the same agreement is signed by several different sites or legal entities in a given country, it is considered as a single agreement). Other regions: In the rest of the world, the group has 937 employee representatives in 66 subsidiaries. Dialogue at European level Through LOrals agreement with the French and European trade unions FECCIA and EMCEF, we established (in 1996) our European Works Council: Instance Europenne de Dialogue Social (IEDS/EWC). The agreement has been regularly updated, and in 2009 we introduced a new consultation procedure which applies to transnational projects involving local consultation procedures in at least two countries. This procedure allows for the possibility of an opinion from the EWC and is being implemented, according to the geographical and strategic dimension of the project, with the Liaison Secretariat and extended to include members of the countries concerned, or with the entire EWC. This revision represents an important advance which aims to reinforce social dialogue at LOral while remaining a step ahead of legislation. The IEDS/EWC informs discussions and formal meetings about our current situation and future prospects with IEDS representatives. It has 30 members from the European countries that are part of the European Economic Area with more than 145 employees. The members receive regular training on economic and labour related issues. Today, the IEDS covers more than 30,000 employees and 26 countries, of which 16 are directly represented.

We aim to provide our employees with learning opportunities throughout their professional lives as part of ensuring LOrals competitive edge. An individual approach LOral & Me provides a new global framework for career reviews, which includes two reviews a year to identify and discuss career paths, personal development and compensation. We ensure regular personal and professional development through a unique learning structure to offer tailored training to the workforce, whatever the function or the geographical region. The Learning for Development organisation is fully integrated into the business, maximises best practices worldwide and provides a consistent vision for the training programmes. Developing individuals to their full potential is key to ensuring sustainable competitive advantage. Since the group has a unique and dynamic career path management approach, the Learning for Development department has developed tools to help managers deal with transitions and the new responsibilities they are given. International mobility Geographic and career mobility are beneficial for both the individual, in terms of development and experience, and the group, in terms of growth and innovation. International mobility also reinforces our diversity policy as multicultural teams enable our brands to adapt to local demands. At the end of 2010, 752 employees from 49 countries were on long-term international assignments in 57 different countries – a 13% increase on 2009. Of these employees, 34% were women and 15% were under the age of 30. At the end of 2010, LOral transferred close to 40 employees transferred abroad to bring expertise to other countries, mainly for manufacturing projects, for short-term assignments of up to 12 months. We have reviewed our international mobility policy so that it meets the needs of employees and the company. We have developed specific packages for junior employees and also for transfers between regions. To support this ambitious acceleration of internationalisation, we provide our best talents with international programmes, developed in partnership with leading institutions, where they access the best educational resources around the world, combined with the expertise and experience-sharing of LOral business leaders. These programmes also aim to convey the culture and values that are unique to LOral and contribute to strategic alignment. As an emblematic seminar, LOreal Insight has in 2010, been seen by a record number of 195 young managers of 37 nationalities, showing the commitment of local HR directors to support the development of their talents. Overall, nearly 400 key people, from all countries across the group, have attended one of the main international corporate seminars in 2010. My Learning In 2010, with the ambition to bring learning to all our Learning for Development teams launched our My Learning platform internationally in 18 languages, reaching 20,000 employees in 32 countries. We will extend this to 45,000 people in 56 countries in 2011. By using a single platform across LOral, we can ensure the sharing of group culture and expertise globally. My Learning will also support knowledge transfer within the company; employee orientation; corporate initiatives such as diversity and ethics; and will enable information to be disseminated quickly to employees. NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES COMPOSITION OF WORKFORCE BY REGION NATIONALITIES IN In the current economic environment characterised by rapidly accelerating change, managers and employees face increasing complexity. The ability to learn, which has always been at the heart of LOral culture, is more than ever a true competitive advantage. We believe firmly that every one of our employees around the world should have equal access to continuous learning in order to gain, develop and extend their personal and professional competencies, and on top of this share the vision and passion for our metier. We believe that the My Learning programme will not only help us to continue to attract the best employees but also contribute to employee commitment, sense of belonging and loyalty Sylvie Dangelser LOral's Learning For Development Corporate Director In 2010, training represented the equivalent of 2.1% of our gross payroll costs, an increase of 28.5% compared with 2009; 72% of managers and 57% of all employees received training.

It has been created using a blend of innovative learning methods and tools ranging from distance learning to video demonstrations to meet the long-term training needs of every LOral employee. My Learning provides employees with an individualised development track which encompasses the training offer and the open access online modules appropriate to their role. 400 specific development tracks have been provided, focusing on the specific skills required to develop in line with the key job accountabilities. Sharing knowledge, culture and values worldwide Our Learning and Development strategy reflects the many different ways of learning through a mix of formal and informal methods. While we believe in sharing knowledge and learning by doing, we have captured some of our internal knowledge or savoir faire, and created on the job learning cards to help employees to develop their skills on a daily basis. To share our culture with all of our employees, even in the furthest countries, we also launched two e-learning modules in 2010: I-Discovery – an interactive module for new joiners to discover our brands, our strategy and organisation, everywhere in the world Keys to L'Oreal – a module, available in nine languages, which explains and shares the group's specific values on matters such as decision making or innovation. Our Learning for Development teams have also developed new interactive e-learning resources that capture and share specific expertise in different departments. For example, in the Research & Innovation department, one of these resources allows people to identify the colour, shape and chemical components of hair fibres, while another helps researchers to understand all stages of product development and the role of teams at each stage. As another example, in 2010, the Consumer Products Division launched an e-programme for Category Management Certification, which allows new Category Managers to gain theoretical and practical skills. The programme includes case studies and webinars with Category Management experts sharing their experiences. It is delivered by the Category Management Knowledge Group, a global leader in Category Management training. After successfully completing the programme, the participants receive a Category Management Certificate. Engaging employees in sustainability As we seek to embed sustainability in our daily activities, we engage with our employees to increase their awareness. As well as learning, they can develop their skills by getting involved in volunteering activities in the communities where we work. Volunteers from LOral USA worked at the Passaic River Park, Berkeley Heights, as part of our annual Employee Volunteer Day 2010. They removed an estimated ton of invasive plant species, repaired deer netting, picked up trash, spread wood chips and restored paths. Read more about our volunteering in Communities.

A passionate quest for talent Having weathered the difficult global economy of recent years, LOral is in a strong position as an employer. We have realigned our strategy for the future, placing emphasis on growth and increasing market share, especially in our new markets. In 2010/11 we are extending our recruitment policy to meet the competitive market for talent. Our recruitment objectives take account of the fact that candidates relationships with the corporate world are changing. We are looking for candidates with courage, energy, resilience, intellectual speed and agility to help build the LOral of the future. We also want to provide individuals of the right calibre with the training and support to help grow the business over the next three to five years, as well as provide LOral with the best leaders in the longer term. Where our talent comes from University campus management – we have partnered with over 200 campuses and have links with student associations. We also reach potential high-calibre graduates with Brandstorm, a marketing competition for international students Online tools – REVEAL, our online business game, is open to students and graduates, with the purpose of sourcing prime, diverse talent from all over the world Internships – our EurOpportunity programme offers 6-12 month internships in Europe. It has sourced more than 100 interns over the last two years, with strong rates for hiring post- internship. In addition, the VIE (Volunteer for International Experience) programme began between LOreal Latin America and Paris and is now being extended to Asia MBA candidates – LOral offers 60 jobs for international MBA recruits every year, providing a specific induction programme into the beauty business and the LOral working culture. Apprentices In France, we train apprentices as it is an excellent way of offering people the chance to complement their studies with practical experience. We offer high quality professional training to young people of all levels, and since our apprenticeship programme started in 1993, we have welcomed 3,638 apprentices to our business. Apprentices make up 4.76% of our workforce in France. They are supported by a network of over 2,000 mentors, who receive up to two days training to help them fulfil their role. Developing leaders Our management training programmes provide us with a talent pipeline. We maintained the number of our management trainees throughout the economic crisis, because LOral always takes a long-term view. Economic growth allowed us to drive forward our Ppinire management trainee scheme, which grew by 35% in 2010, and even doubled in some regions. We are proactively building our recruitment plans for experienced candidates, to cater for our two to three year leadership needs, including the recruitment of senior proven talent to enrich and diversify our management pools.

Through the online story and situations, participants can learn more about their own skills, explore LOrals company culture, discover potential career opportunities, and get the chance to join the group at the end. It is a unique experience for any student preparing for working life, regardless of their academic background. Over 2010, almost 60,000 people used REVEAL, and in future, we expect it to help us source 30% of our interns. Brandstorm Brandstorm is our unique, world class international marketing competition. The 18th competition took place in June 2010 in Paris, where 43 affiliates participated in a unique experience. 7,100 students from the best 220 academic institutes took part in a business challenge to develop a new beauty product range for men and the associated communications campaign. First prize went to the team from the Instituto Universitrio de Lisboa, Portugal. Each year, more than 150 creative profiles are sourced through Brandstorm to join our marketing teams worldwide. LOral ranked 11th most attractive employer in the world L'Oral was chosen by 130,000 students from top academic institutions all over the world as their most attractive employer, according to the Universum Global Talent Attraction Index. This is the first global index of employer attractiveness and highlights the worlds most powerful employer brands, those companies that excel in talent attraction and retention. LOral has moved up three places in the ranking among business students and is now ranked 11th worldwide and third in Europe.  Talent / Reward and recognition  Reward and recognition At LOral, we recognise our employees achievements and reward them with competitive remuneration and a range of benefits. Remuneration At LOral, our remuneration policy reflects our employees contribution to our business success. Remuneration packages vary according to the job and level of responsibility. All countries have a remuneration policy based on a standard performance assessment system applied worldwide. The career advancement and salary of each employee is managed on an individual basis. LOral aims to offer competitive compensation packages in order to attract and retain the best people. Accordingly, almost all subsidiaries take part in an annual compensation survey. The compensation package is determined by the position, competencies, performance and potential of each individual. In most of the countries in which we work, the salaries we pay to our employees are considerably higher than the legal minimum wage (on a national or sector level, and taking into account collective agreements). For example in Argentina, the minimum salary paid by LOral is 96% higher than the minimum salary fixed at national level. This is also the case in China, where the minimum salary paid by LOral is 82% higher than the minimum salary fixed at national level. Profit sharing LOral believes that all our employees should share in the success they have helped to achieve. An annual bonus rewards performance, strengthens employees sense of belonging and increases motivation. Employee profit-sharing totalled 185 million in 2010. Employee benefits LOral offers benefits packages, which vary according to local practices and regulations, to enhance the wellbeing of employees and their families. LOral has an International Benefits Steering Committee to ensure coverage is offered consistently to all our employees. It has drafted a charter for a safe and long lasting investment of the assets allocated to pension programmes, which must be applied by all subsidiaries. In 2010, we continued to review our pension programmes around the world and implemented new programmes in Chile and Pakistan. We also improved the existing programme in Poland. The total cost of our pension programmes was 438 million in 2010, compared with 422 million in 2009.

This is the route to embedding responsible behaviours, citizenship and sustainability. Business needs to show, for its part, that it is making a serious, major effort in this area. Without that, it cannot ask consumers to share the responsibility and make life style changes that are needed to consume more sustainably.  Mark Halle, Executive Director, International Institute for Sustainable Development There can be no sustainable consumption without showing consumers what responsible production looks like. If businesses, and we at LOral are among them, can develop an offer for consumers that is responsible in all senses of the term, then the enlightened consumer, armed with the right information, will be able to exercise their choice and finally make the vision of sustainable consumption into a reality.

Philanthropy at LOral This commitment has a global reach, with LOral brands and subsidiaries supporting hundreds of projects worldwide. We are active in areas in which we can make the greatest contribution, and which reflect our purpose and values: Promotion of scientific research, particularly through the LOral-UNESCO For Women in Science programme, a joint initiative with UNESCO, now running for 13 years, and extending to 103 countries Restoring appearance, which is a recognised factor in building self-esteem and social wellbeing. The restorative surgery programme Opration Sourire, carried out with Mdecins du Monde, illustrates this, as does the donation of personal care and beauty products by group brands Education and occupational integration, particularly in the beauty professions. In 2010, LOral invested 32.6 million in both large-scale international projects and hundreds of initiatives throughout the world. This represents an increase of more than 17% compared to 2009, and comprises 8.6 million from the LOral Foundation (6.1 million according to London Benchmarking Group methodology), 16.1 million in corporate donations, and 16.5 million from the group brands. Highlights of 2010 2010 saw existing programmes developed and extended internationally, as well as several new partnerships initiated. LOral-UNESCO For Women in Science expanded further with the launch of the first pan- Arab and pan-African regional awards. These ten scholarships have been created to encourage young researchers in areas of the world where L'Oreal is not present. Following the success of the first scholarships, the intention is to double the number of scholarships awarded in 2011.

Science, solidarity, education Its key role is to strengthen and maintain the companys commitment to social responsibility, while reflecting LOrals values of scientific research, the transmission of knowledge, diversity and respect for others. The Foundation is committed to three main goals: Promoting scientific research and the role of women in science Helping people made vulnerable because of a change in their appearance to regain their self-esteem and self-confidence Facilitating access to education and occupational integration. Philanthropy with purpose Since its inception, the Foundation has engaged in projects that reflect LOrals values. Working with partners around the world, it has developed some of the groups major social programmes, such as LOral-UNESCO For Women in Science, and LOral-UNESCO Hairdressers Against AIDS, while also continuing to support the life-changing work of Opration Sourire. In the framework of the Beauty from the Heart programme, the Foundation supports free skincare and make-up workshops for women with cancer, teenagers suffering from psychiatric troubles, and socially excluded people. The Foundation also distributes Group brand products to people suffering from exclusion, violence or poverty. Be proud, get involved, have fun To mark the groups centenary in 2010, employees from all around the world took part in the first ever LOral Citizen Day. This internal event was designed to involve as many employees as possible in the groups many solidarity projects around the world, inviting them to take part in fund- raising challenges and discovery programmes supported by the Foundation.

This is why the company promotes science and supports the cause of women through the LOral-UNESCO For Women in Science programme. The world needs science... science needs women Currently, just 29% of scientists worldwide are women (Statistical Institute of UNESCO, November 2009). For the last 13 years, L'Oreal has partnered with UNESCO to support women scientists and recognise the valuable contribution of their research. Every year, five L'Oreal-UNESCO For Women in Science research awards are given (one per continent) in recognition of scientific excellence, with the winners selected by an independent international jury chaired by three Nobel Prize winners.

This recognition helps to redress the fact that only 16 of the 546 Nobel Prizes awarded for science have gone to women. Fellowships Since 2000, LOral-UNESCO For Women in Science has awarded research fellowships to support young women in the pursuit of scientific careers. Each year, 15 International Fellowships are awarded to young women whose projects have been accepted by leading research institutions outside their country of origin. Dozens of LOral National Fellowships are awarded each year to young women doing research in their home country. The LOral-UNESCO For Women in Science regional programme, launched in 2010, awards Fellowships to encourage young women pursuing research careers in countries where LOral does not have a presence. In 2010, Fellowships were awarded to women from countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and countries in the Pan-Arab region (United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Tunisia, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia). Agora – For Women in Science community Agora is an online platform dedicated to the exchange of ideas and is an integral part of LOral- UNESCO For Women in Science. It has become an important meeting place where members can talk about their scientific research, the role of women in science, their education and careers, and the global development of the programme. For more information, visit the Agora For Women in Science Community website. The LOral Foundation, in partnership with Science Magazine, also published two booklets focused on women pursuing successful careers in science. The 2010 booklets focused on women undertaking research in biology and the green sciences.  Communities / LOral-UNESCO Hairdressers Against AIDS  LOral-UNESCO Hairdressers Against AIDS The unique relationship between hairdressers and their clientele is at the heart of the Hairdressers Against AIDS initiative, which is now helping to raise awareness of the HIV virus in 26 countries around the world. A unique approach Developed in partnership with UNESCO, Hairdressers Against AIDS is a programme of preventative education promoted through LOral Professional Products extensive global network of instructors and training centres. The programme aims to give hairdressing professionals the knowledge and confidence to talk to their customers about the risks of the disease, which kills over two million people every year. More than a million hairdressers reached Communication and education is vital – and so is conversation. I am proud of the fact that the Hairdressers Against AIDS programme has reached 1.3 million hairdressers. In exchanging a few important words with their clients, every hairdresser can help to prevent the spread of this disease. Nicolas Hieronimus, Worldwide President, LOral Professional Products Division Use Your Voice, Use Your Power As well as providing a professional service, a hairdresser is often a confidante too, talking to customers about how they feel, their hopes and their worries. As a trusting relationship develops, the hairdressers rapport with their customers, and their ability to communicate with them, becomes a highly effective way of relaying information about issues such as HIV/AIDS and its prevention. LOral first recognised the power of the hairdressers social role when it launched the programme in 2001. Four years later, in 2005, the LOral Foundation formed a partnership with UNESCO to further promote HIV/AIDS awareness among the global hairdressing community. The programme is also rooted in a general philosophy at LOral of promoting health and hygiene. The educational network of the LOral Professional Products Division has been the driving force behind the initiative and now more than 5,000 trainers are working on the programme. Over 1.3 million hairdressers worldwide have taken advantage of a bespoke HIV/AIDS training module, introduced as part of LOrals hairdressers curriculum. The module includes information about the risks of the disease and protection against it, as well as guidance for hairdressers on maintaining the highest standards of hygiene, and ensuring the comfort and safety of their clients and themselves. Hairdressers Against AIDS is a rolling programme which will be extended on a country by country basis, with particular focus on regions where the disease is most prevalent. COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS BY DOMAIN COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS BY GEOGRAPHICAL REGION HAIRDRESSERS AGAINST AIDS 1.3 million hairdressers have received HIV/AIDS awareness training since 2005. Over 500,000 hairdressers receive the training every year. 5,000 LOral trainers operating in 300 training centres in 30 countries. By 2012, LOral aims to reach 3 million hairdressers in 50 countries.

New York launch Over 500 hairdressers took to the streets of New York on World AIDS Day in December 2010 to launch Hairdressers Against AIDS in the US. The goal was for the hairdressers to start 200 conversations with people, who would be asked to post videos, Tweet, Facebook and chat with at least ten friends, triggering one million conversations about AIDS. There were live feeds to giant screens in New York Times Square, which reached an estimated 1.2 million people. LOreal Professional Product Educators currently work with over 400,000 salon professionals a year in the US, with the HIV/ AIDS modules now part of this training process. And with each hairdresser seeing on average up to 12 clients a day, as many as 200,000,000 new people could become more aware of the issue every year. Celebrity Calendar To further extend the reach of the programme, and give hairdressers a talking point in their salons, a 2011 Hairdressers against AIDS Celebrity Calendar has also been produced. This calendar showcases the hairstyles of 12 famous models including Diane Kruger, Vanessa Paradis, Monica Bellucci and Audrey Tautou, as captured by renowned photographer John Nollet. Communication that makes a difference I do believe that beauty professionals can have an impact on society in a way that goes beyond aesthetics – by communicating openly about this serious disease, hairdressers can make a real difference on the lives of their clients and their communities. John Nollet  Communities / Helping vulnerable people  Helping vulnerable people Caring for an individuals appearance is at the heart of all LOrals activity. Beauty is connected to self-esteem and a positive self-image, which is why LOral supports programmes that help vulnerable and disadvantaged people, and those affected by illness. Beauty nurtures self-esteem Because beauty and self-confidence are so closely linked, the LOral Foundation created the Beauty from the Heart programme to help people made vulnerable by illness or negative life experiences. By using cosmetics and hygiene products, many women and young people can gradually regain their confidence and control of their self-image. In 2010, more than 150 workshops were conducted with financial support from the Foundation. Giving meaning to beauty For several years, LOral has been carrying out an extensive research programme called The Sense of Beauty, which aims to advance knowledge and research on the meaning and role of appearance. This led to the publication of the book '100,000 Years of Beauty' in 2009. Written by 300 multidisciplinary researchers from 35 countries, this is an authoritative reference work charting humankinds quest for beauty. In 2010, the LOral Foundation began to disseminate much of this knowledge about beauty and, along with the Paris Descartes University, helped to stage the exhibition The Face in All its States. At the Women's Forum, a space for meetings, discussion and debate, the Foundation organised a meeting on the theme of appearance. It featured a talk by Aimee Mullins who, despite having both legs amputated below the knee as a child, overcame her disability to become both a model and an elite athlete. In 2010, the Foundation also created a pilot course in the Anthropology of Beauty at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris. The course was facilitated by many of the authors who had worked on '100,000 Years of Beauty'. Over the last three years, the LOral Foundation has also funded a scholarship in The art of being and appearance for young researchers in the humanities. In 2010, the huge number and quality of applications led the Foundation to award two scholarships: one for a student investigating skin whitening during the Renaissance period, and the second for research into the significance of physical appearance and religion. Opration Sourire For the past three years, the LOral Corporate Foundation has supported Opration Sourire (Operation Smile) a programme of reconstructive surgery run by Mdecins du Monde. Surgeons volunteer their expertise and time to help people who have been disfigured by disease, malnutrition or war, and help them to regain their dignity and identity, and integrate back into normal life. LOral currently works with children through missions in 12 African and Asian countries, and in 2010, 834 people were supported – 62% more than in 2009. In total, more than 1,500 have now been helped by the programme. COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS BY DOMAIN COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS BY GEOGRAPHICAL REGION TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF LOOK GOOD...

In 2010, the funding allowed a team of Japanese doctors to carry out a mission to Dhaka, Bangladesh, while specialists from Germany have been able to strengthen existing efforts in Cambodia, working in the province Kampong Cham. A team of doctors was also able to carry out an exploratory mission to Pakistan, with a view to setting up a new operation in 2011. Supporting people affected by illness In 2001, LOral was one of several major French cosmetic companies to found La Vie...de plus belle. The organisation is sponsored by the anti-cancer group Ligue contre le cancer, and is a member of the international Look Good...Feel Better network, which is active in 21 countries. 'La Vie... de plus belle' offers free skincare and make-up workshops in hospitals to help female cancer patients to cope with the side-effects of treatment and restore their self-esteem. In France, the programme is active in 21 hospitals and in 2010 organised 222 workshops for 1,822 women. Supporting disadvantaged people In 2007, the Foundation provided funding to Samusocial de Paris, a humanitarian emergency service, to help establish La Maison des Femmes a refuge for women in need. The 14 residents can also participate in weekly self-esteem and image workshops. In 2010, 48 workshops were organised, contributing to the stability and wellbeing of the residents. In 2010, LOral also distributed more than 500,000 branded products to our charity partners, LAgence du Don en Nature, Les Restaurants du Coeur and Samusocial de Paris, to support their work in helping disadvantaged people to rediscover a sense of wellbeing and self-esteem.  Communities / Access to education and occupational integration  Access to education and occupational integration LOral seeks to promote socio-economic and cultural diversity through its support for education projects around the world. The LOral Foundation supports a range of educational activities designed to support students from low-income backgrounds, international students studying in French universities and Grandes Ecoles (higher education establishments), and secondary school students in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. It also provides assistance to disabled students studying at the French university Sciences Po. Public awareness of environmental issues LOral is a founding member of the Nicolas Hulot Foundation for Nature and Mankind, a non-profit organisation dedicated to educating the public about protecting the environment and the beauty of nature. LOral contributes to the Foundations three operational programmes: Promoting nutrition and a healthy diet Preserving and restoring biodiversity Reducing energy consumption and tackling the challenges of climate change. We also actively help with the Foundations scientific work, support 150 field projects in 10 countries every year, raise public awareness of the need to preserve natural resources, and support the Nicolas Hulot School for environmental education. To build awareness of environmental and climate change issues among its 11,000 employees in France, LOral joined the Dfi Pour la Terre (Challenge for the Earth) programme. LOral supports science at school The LOral Foundation actively supports a tutoring programme, facilitated by the Museum of Science and Industry in partnership with the Association of Prevention Site de la Villette (APSV). Now in its fourth year, the programme supports children in middle and high school who might otherwise fall behind in science subjects. The programme, which includes a mentoring system with highly motivated and trained science students, takes place at weekends and school holidays, and has now helped nearly 4,000 school children. Support for disabled students Together, the prestigious French university Sciences Po and LOral share a strong belief that diversity is an asset, and support the idea that both educational institutions and businesses should recruit from a broad base in order to promote equal opportunity and identify talented future employees. The Sciences Po Accessible programme, created in partnership with ARPEJEH (Accompagner la Ralisation des Projets dEtudes de Jeunes Elves et Etudiants Handicaps), offers disabled students the tools to succeed in their studies. Sciences Po has developed a system whereby it can adapt teaching conditions to suit students individual needs. They also offer a personalised student support service ensuring they have the space, access and equipment they need to reach their full potential. During 2010, seven students received grants for international mobility allowing them to go abroad as part of their studies.

In 2010, LOral, in partnership with ADIE (Association for the Right to Economic Initiative) helped 25 young entrepreneurs create their own beauty and wellness businesses. The young people were unable to access funding from mainstream banking, so LOral stepped in with financial and product support. The LOral Foundation has also signed a new partnership with the French micro-credit website Babyloan, helping women to develop their own beauty-based businesses. So far, 18 projects have been supported including beauty salons and boutiques selling perfume and cosmetics.  Communities / Community projects around the world  Community projects around the world LOral supports a range of community projects around the world. Some are environmental, some are social, but all aim to deliver real benefits to people in the communities where we work. LOral Mother River Protection Fund, China LOral is one of the key supporters of The Mother River Protection Fund in China, which is helping to protect the environment of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and which will eventually extend to other endangered areas throughout China. The programme was initiated in 1999 by the Chinese government in order to solve some of the problems facing the rivers that were caused by population growth and increased industrial activity. As part of its continuing commitment to sustainability and environmental welfare, LOral is also sponsoring The Mother River Awards and funding several youth groups involved in environmental protection that are working on projects to help improve the rivers. Hair for oil Following the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, LOral brand Pureology, in partnership with eco organisations Global Green USA and A Matter of Trust, took practical action to help the efforts to limit damaging impacts. Hair has proven, effective absorption properties and Pureology encouraged hair salons all over the country to donate clean hair clippings. These were packed into recycled nylon stockings and sent to the Gulf where they were used to skim off and soak up surface oil. Chimex LOral subsidiary Chimex was commended in the European Responsible Care Awards 2010 for its Harmonie outreach project with local schools in the Parisian suburb of Le Thillay. The project allowed school children to find out more about the science behind cosmetics, take part in a scientific experiment in a professional development laboratory, and learn more about the broad principles of sustainable development. Chimex is already heavily involved in the eco-design of formulas and cosmetic ingredients, processes which are helping to minimise the company's environmental footprint. Stop Sex Trafficking Campaign, The Body Shop, Indonesia In 2010, Body Shop Indonesia won a coveted Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Award for its Stop Sex Trafficking Campaign. According to UN research, this is one of the worlds fastest growing crimes and the Body Shops campaign is helping to support victims, as well as sponsoring a prevention programme and helping to increase public and media awareness of the crime. This was the second consecutive year Body Shop had been awarded a MDG award, having also been honoured for its 2009 Stop Violence in The Home campaign.

Our objective was to verify the validity of the EHS data supplied by the sites. In order to do this, a statistically representative sample of five manufacturing sites, three distribution warehouses and one administrative site and research centre located in France, Mexico, the USA, China and South-Africa has been audited. The approach was to find the sources of the information and to interview the heads of the departments concerned on the audited sites. Findings Our review has shown that, for the sample examined, data collection and processing have provided us with information which is globally precise and reliable. New indicators were added in 2010, namely the level of safety culture and the MESUR frequency rate. The data allowing the calculation of both new indicators were found to be reliable. Some inaccuracies or omissions were noted for each of the visited sites, but with no significant impact on the scale of consolidated data for the group: Two sites had not reported several first aid injuries as non loss time accidents Two sites did not count several loss working days, taken into account in the calculation of the Severity Rate A notification from the authorities, issued in December 2010, about non-compliant wastewater discharge and associated non- compliances was not reported at the time of the audit. Opinion We believe that the EHS data published in this report and presented in the text, the schedules and the graphics for 2010 give an honest, transparent and reasonable image of the EHS performance of manufacturing sites, distribution warehouses and administrative activities. The noted improvements in EHS performance appear to be representative of the actual progress made by the sites and show a great regularity in the level of reporting reliability of the LOral group.

The review report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. General Direction  LOREAL GROUP  14, rue Royale  75008 Paris Further to your request and in our capacity as Statutory Auditor of the LOral Group, we have performed a review designed to enable us to express moderate assurance on the procedures used to compile certain social data published in the LOral Group sustainable development report and identified by the sign ( ). These procedures, together with the data published in the Group sustainable development report, were prepared under the responsibility of the Human Resources Executive Management in accordance with the Groups internal reporting standards. These standards are available on the Groups website. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the procedures for compiling the selected social data, based on our review. Nature and scope of our work We performed the work according to The Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes (CNCC) doctrine related to this review. We performed the work described below in order to obtain moderate assurance as to whether procedures used to compile the selected social data are free of material misstatement. A higher level of assurance would have required more extensive procedures. Moreover, our review is not intended to express, and we do not express, a conclusion on the accuracy of the figures published. We performed the following work: At headquarters level For each of the areas reviewed, we met with various representatives from the departments listed below responsible for organizing the reporting procedures as well as for the consolidation of social data at Group level: the Labor Relations Department, HR Information Systems Department, Corporate HR Support Services, and Corporate Learning for Development Department. Based on interviews with these representatives and reviews of documents (Group consolidation manuals and subsidiary reporting schedules), we obtained assurance as to the: existence of instructions concerning definitions of the data to be compiled and the related calculation methods existence of reporting and consolidation procedures consistency of the data published with the scope set for such data due and proper inclusion of the social data obtained from the reporting systems in the consolidation packages, assessed on a test basis. Our work was based on the following indicators: total cost of the retirement programmes, % of countries with pension programmes in excess of basic social security requirements, number of employees per gender, data taken from the management database of executives profiles and careers (nationalities, number of executives by gender, number of women amongst the management committee), number of employees and executive staff trained, amount allocated to the World Profit Sharing program (WPS), number of employees representatives. At subsidiary level Additional tests were carried out to ensure the understanding and correct application of Group reporting procedures by the subsidiaries. These tests were carried out at country consolidation level, on a selection of six countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Serbia and Japan) and in respect of the aforementioned indicators, except for the two specific indicators related to retirement (total cost of the retirement programmes, % of countries with pension programmes in excess of basic social security requirements) that are managed for all countries at headquarters level. Our work was based on interviews with the individuals responsible for reporting at country level as well as with other people involved in the data collection and reporting procedures. The tests involved assessing the understanding and application of Group data definitions and data collection procedures at country level the consolidation procedures at country level and exhaustiveness of the scope the existence and appropriateness of internal control procedures at country level with a view to ensuring compliance with such procedures by the subsidiaries.
