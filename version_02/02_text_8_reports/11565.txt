UN Global Compact Communication of  Progress Report by Unilever South Africa May 2011  Unilever has been a global signatory to the UN Secretary- Generals nine principles of the Global Compact since  January 1999. The principles have since grown to 10 to  include Anti-Corruption. Every year, Unilever has been  using its Sustainable Development Report as its  Communication of Progress.  With the establishment of the local UN Global Compact  network in South Africa under the National Business  Initiative, it has become necessary to demonstrate support  for the 10 principles from a local reporting perspective.  This is the second report that Unilever will be submitting.  The report will show how we are implementing the  principles in the South African business.  The UN Secretary-General has sought adherence by  business to the principles as follows: Human Rights Principle 1: support and respect the protection of  international human rights within their sphere of  influence; and  Principle 2: make sure their own corporations are not  complicit in human rights abuses. Labour Rights Business is to uphold the following labour principles:  Principle 3:  the freedom of association and the effective  recognition of the right to collective bargaining;  Principle 4:  the elimination of all forms of forced and  compulsory labour;  Principle 5:  he effective abolition of child labour; and  Principle 6:  the elimination of discrimination in respect  of employment and occupation. INTRODUCTION The United Nations Environmental Policies Businesses are asked to: Principle 7: support a precautionary approach to  environmental challenges;  Principle 8:  undertake initiatives that promote greater  environmental responsibility; and  Principle 9:  encourage the development and diffusion of  environmentally friendly technologies.  Anti-Corruption  Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption  in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.  2  3 Unilever is one of the largest consumer goods companies  in the world. For over 100 years now, our brands have  been a part of the South African home and we identify  the local needs and aspirations of South Africa as our  own. It is based on this relationship, and our loyalty to our  consumers, that we conduct our business in a sustainable  manner. To this end, we have partnered with industry  bodies, government, NGOs, educational institutions and  local communities to ensure that our small actions  together translate into a big difference for our consumers  and for the world at large. This report will highlight our  efforts in this regard. Our continued submission of the Communication of  Progress from Unilever South Africa is intended not only  to comply with the UN Global Compact requirement for  an annual report, but also to serve as an engagement tool  for all of our stakeholders. Our efforts within the ambit of  operating as a responsible company have been further  defined through the launch of our Unilever Sustainable  Living Plan. To give impetus to our Sustainable Living Plan, we have  set targets for various initiatives, initiatives that strongly  echo the principles set out within the UN Global Compact  Report. Being a responsible corporate citizen has been  strongly embedded into the DNA of Unilever and we are  confident that through continued efforts we will be able  to increase the scale of impact that Unilever South Africa  will be able to deliver.  Together with the continued submission of reports of this  nature coupled with the right mindset from an internal  perspective, Unilever South Africa will undoubtedly be  contributing towards improving the lives of South African  citizens. Marijn van Tiggelen Chairman, Unilever South Africa CHAIRMANS STATEMENT ON UNILEVER SOUTH AFRICAS COMMUNICATION OF  PROGRESS  Unilever has consistently demonstrated, both on a  national and local South African scale, that day to day  business processes are very much in accordance with  legislation that seeks to protect individual human rights.  Stringent adherence is exercised with regard to global  standards and this commitment is solidified within The  Unilever Code of Business Principles. The Unilever Code of Business Principles demands an  annual sign off and commitment by all employees to  work with honesty, integrity and respect for others. It is  part of the annual positive assurance that is expected of  all heads of business units. It encourages high standards  of personal behaviour from all employees in their  relationships with colleagues, dealings with suppliers,  customers, consumers, shareholders and other third  parties, and also in the use of Unilever resources.  Unilever South Africa boasts a richly diverse workforce.  We continue to recruit, employ and promote employees  on the sole basis of the qualifications and abilities needed  for the work to be performed. In line with the principles, we do not use any form of  child, forced or compulsory labour. Through the Unilever  Business Partner code we demand a similar commitment  from all our suppliers and service providers. We also  expect managers to be mindful of ways to support  employees to fulfil their family and other personal  responsibilities. Where it is stipulated, the national  minimum age for work is observed.  All forms of harassment whether individual or collective  and whether based on sex, race, position in the  organisation or otherwise are unacceptable and treated  as a serious disciplinary offence.  We recognise the right of our employees to join or not to  join a trade union. In all of our operations, we seek to  engage in constructive relationships with recognised  trade unions and other employee representatives. As per  the countrys labour laws we recognise and negotiate  with local trade unions legally elected by employees on all  matters affecting their well-being and labour rights.  In the case of consumers, we have transparent and  well-tested procedures in place to address their  complaints fairly and speedily without undue cost or  burden to them.  Our corporate vision serves to further validate the  inherent culture that can be found throughout the  organisation: We work to create a better future  every day We help people feel good, look good and get more  out of life with brands and services that are good  for them and good for others. We will inspire  people to take small everyday actions that can add  up to a big difference for the world. We will  develop new ways of doing business that will allow  us to double the size of our company while  reducing our environmental impacts. OUR SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS These corporate values that have been expressed in the  above vision are brought to life through the recently  launched Unilever Sustainable Living Plan. Included in this  plan are the focus areas of Enhancing Livelihoods and  Improving Health and Well-being that position Unilever  very much at the forefront of corporate responsibility.  We have realised our efforts to enhance livelihoods  through the establishment of strategic partnerships across  our Supply Chain where we contribute to the  development of small enterprises around South Africa  and in so doing ensure that the livelihoods of South  Africans are enhanced. In partnership with the Development Bank of Southern  Africa (DBSA) and the Accelerated Shared Growth  Initiative of South Africa – Eastern Cape (ASGISA-EC) we  have established a small holder farming initiative to grow  and procure paprika for our Robertsons Spice brand.  Based in Keiskammahoek in the Eastern Cape, an area  which has an 87% unemployment rate, the programme  has successfully completed two production cycles and has  provided employment to over 200 community members.   Unilever South Africa is committed to supporting this  initiative to make this a sustainable and commercially  viable agricultural model thereby increasing the benefit to  the wider community.  4  For over ten years Unilever South Africa has worked with  Smollans to deliver the Unilever Trade Development  Programme. 4,700 Small general traders around South  Africa receive regular on-the-job business development,  pricing advice and in-store layout guidance to ensure that  their business becomes successful and sustainable. The  traders also receive a quarterly Trader Value Club  magazine which ensures the further transfer of skills.  We also recognise the value of partnering with bodies  that will enable us to increase the overall scale of our  impact within South Africa. Unilever South Africa is a  founding member of the South African Diversity Council  (SASDC), part of the National Business Initiative (NBI),  which has been established to promote black suppliers  through the sharing of knowledge, experience and best  practice in supplier diversity. We also support SASDC  member commitments to increase procurement and  development opportunities for black-owned suppliers.  Below are other organisation that we share partnerships  with in a combined effort to address the national agenda  on various socio and economic issues: 1. BUSA (Business Unity South Africa)                                             Acting as the principal                                             representative of South African                                             business, BUSA provides expert  comment to government on the economy, transformation,  the national budget and various pieces of legislation.  Significant in the past year are the relevant comments  made on the Consumer Protection Bill, which aims to  promote fair business practices.  2. Business Trust                                 The Business Trust implements                                             programmes and projects in                                             partnership with government to  promote growth, capacity, employment and investment in  key areas of the economy to combat poverty.  3. NBI (National Business Initiative)                Through our association with the NBI we                            are able to be at the forefront of aligning                            our efforts to deliver against our countrys                            national agenda. We also have provincial                            board representation. Through our work with Government and other  stakeholders we have helped improve the health and  well-being of South African citizens. We have improved  the quality of life by educating communities on the  importance of simple hygiene procedures.  Issues  pertaining to personal hygiene have been addressed by  Lifebuoy through the Wash Project and Global Hand  Wash Day initiative. We have targeted rural and urban  women in South Africa with an educational programme  designed to improve their knowledge and understanding  of basic hygiene.  In 2010 Lifebuoy managed to reach the  following groups with their campaign:  -  12 230 Schools  -  5 503 500 Children  -  253 Paediatricians  -  75 900 Patients Domestos has also established a community based  programme in partnership with the Department of Health  and the World Toilet Organisation. Through the World  Toilet Day initiative we have gone into areas of high risk in  South Africa where diarrhoeal disease is endemic in  certain months of the year.  To further amplify the  message, Domestos has gone into a school, Sapebusi  Primary School in Orlando West, Gauteng and refurbished  their ablution facilities. Enhancing the quality of peoples diets to help improve  heart health and tackle both over and under-nutrition is  key to the work that we have done around nutrition. We  have worked with the Heart and Stroke Foundation of  South Africa to raise awareness of Cardiovascular Disease  (CVD) and the importance of a healthy diet and lifestyle in  reducing CVD risk factors through our Flora Test the  Nation campaign. In 2010 we tested the cholesterol levels  of approximately 22,000 people across the country.  Flora  has also demonstrated their commitment to a healthier  lifestyle by being the main sponsor of the Comrades  Marathon. All the initiatives we support are intended to entrench the  Human Rights from a broad perspective enshrined in the  Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.  5  Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE)  and Diversity We consider Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment  an imperative for growth in the economy and within  Unilever itself. To this end, the implementation of BBBEE is  based on our our commitment, principles and targets to  achieve the objectives of the legislation. Based on a  foundation of years of equal opportunity recruitment,  diversity programmes, skills development, training and  mentorship of employees. In 2010 we achieved a BEE level  6 verification certificate.  We are dedicated to creating a working environment that  enables all people, especially women, to become future  leaders and role models. Our gender representation levels  are ahead of industry norms, particularly at senior levels  within the organisation, compared with local (JSE listed)  and state-owned enterprises. Since 2005, Unilever South  Africa has partnered with SA WomEng, a non-profit  organisation, which seeks to address the issue of gender  inequity in the South African engineering field.  Upholding the Rights of Workers  Our strategic intent as contained in our IR (Industrial  Relations) strategy is to build constructive and meaningful  trade union relationships and to ensure fair labour  practice and compliance The following source documents remain the basis of our  industrial relations strategy:  a) Basic Conditions of Employment Act - where we strive  to do better than the minimum requirement of the  legislation.  b) Sections 23 (1) to (4) of the Bill of Rights in the  Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, which  outlines the rights of employers and workers.  c) Unilever Business Code of Business Principles, which we  get our contractors to sign off, to ensure that they too are  compliant with worker rights.  d) Unilevers Industrial Relations Strategy, which explains  the companys intent to promote good relations between  itself and trade unions.  .The objective of good relations with trade unions is a  matter of enlightened self interest. We would like to  ensure that work disruptions are minimised, management  is able to run our businesses cost effectively and  competitively and that all parties comply with ethical  conduct and fair labour practices. Disciplinary and  grievance procedures as sanctions for poor performance  would be greatly undermined if there were no good  relations between the company and the trade unions.  We have successfully step changed the level of  engagement with all trade unions represented on all of  our sites. We have, where possible, influenced bargaining  to take place at an enterprise level rather than at a  sectoral/chamber level. Amongst othnts to maximise the  benefits of strong industrial relations, mechanisms to  settle wage negotiations within mandates and without  work disruptions have been implemented and hopefully  will be mutually beneficial to all parties. OUR SUPPORT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 6  OUR APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENT Working across all of our operations and activities and in  partnership with government, other stakeholders and the  people who use our products, we continue to do work  that seeks to reduce our overall environmental impact in  the areas of greenhouse gases, water and waste. We have introduced plans into each of our manufacturing  sites to reduce Co2 emissions from energy alone by 12%  by 2015 vs. a 2009 baseline:  From a manufacturing perspective we have saved 2,352  tons of Co2 from waste disposal via our recycling  initiatives from January 2009 to April 2010. We have installed energy efficient motors and variable  speed drives for our manufacturing equipment in two of  our factory sites which will significantly reduce energy  consumption.  In 2010 we installed solar panels at our  Boksburg manufacturing sites.   In addition, 36% of our Ola Cabinets currently installed in  our Ola ice-Cream distributors are climate-friendly  (hydrocarbon) cabinets. These new refrigerants are not  only better for the environment but last longer and  maintain colder temperatures for longer.  We are continuously decreasing water usage in our  manufacturing process to meet a 15% reduction target by  2015. We have also supported work towards the  improvement of water quality on a national level.  Through our partnership with the Institute of Water  Research at Rhodes University, the Unilever Centre of  Environmental Water Quality (established in 2000) aims to  leverage government and relevant stakeholders to  monitor and put in place programmes that improve the  quality of South Africas water.  A key initiative that has  been borne out of this project is the work that we are  currently doing at Boksburg Lake within the Ekhuruleni  Municipality. The Centre and Unilever have partnered with  the local municipality, community and industry at large to  restore Boksburg Lake to its former glory. This year we  saw the second Boksburg Lake Day take place. It was  attended by just over 230 scholars from nine schools in  the Gauteng area. Unilever South Africa has been reducing the packaging  material of its brands in a number of different ways.  Some examples of this are: we replaced detergent cartons  with flexible block bottom pouches. This has removed  4,457 tons of material from the waste stream annually.  We light weighted our deodorant roll-on caps resulting in  a polypropylene waste stream reduction of approximately  120 tons per annum.  We moved Omo and Skip 9kg plastic buckets to PET/Pe  flexi-bags which has removed 85 tons of packaging  material per annum from the waste stream. We have also  light weighted the Dawn lotion closures saving 13.5 tons  of packaging material annually.  We have provided consumers with refills to make it  possible to reuse the primary pack, for example: we  launched pouch refills for our Sunlight 750ml bottles. This  has removed 37.5 tons of packaging from the waste  stream. Refills were launched for our Lifebuoy hand wash  liquid which saved 8 tons of packaging. Where possible  our packs have been designed for reuse by consumers. Case Study:  Wildlands Through an existing partnership with the Wildlands  Conservation Trust, we have initiated a recycling  programme that commenced in March 2010. This  project encourages communities within rural areas  to collect recyclable goods to be bartered for basic  day to day commodities.  The projects statastics to date for 2010 are as  follows:   Total recyclables collected : 889 850 kg   Projected value of recyclable material: R336 707   Projected avoided emission impact: 1017 tCO2e Below are the numbers of stakeholders that have  participated in this project:   Schools: 45   Businesses: 62   Waste-preneur communities: 7   Government Departments: 3   Charities: 3   Residential Areas: 21 8  Summary of our Environmental Statistics for 2010 9  Employees are required by Compliance Management to  sign off on the policy and to commit that any demand for,  or offer of, a bribe or improper advantage must be  immediately rejected and reported to management. The  policy also stipulates that no gifts or other benefits  including entertaining may be offered to government  officials or others of whom we require services, or with  whom we do business, which could reasonably be  expected to render advantage to Unilever. The Company  Chairman reviews and sets clear limits as to what gifts can  be made, taking into account local social custom.  All such gifts have to be properly accounted for, recorded  and approved by local management. Employees are  advised not to expose themselves to a potential conflict of  interest by accepting benefits, gifts, favours or  entertainment offered by a supplier, customer or other  contact which exceeds the common practice associated  with usual business conduct. Improper benefits include,  among other things, loans, consulting fees, guarantees or  any other granting of credit. Any benefit offered on  behalf of Unilever to third parties must conform to the  Anti-corruption Policy which forbids any form of bribery.  ANTI-CORRUPTION The gifts and entertainment policy gives the  following guidance to employees: The issue of  gifts is sensitive. Gifts can be seen as bribes. They  may be intended to influence decision-makers, or  to build reciprocal obligations. Any employee who  accepts money, gifts, favour or benefits for an  inappropriate purpose or of an inappropriate  monetary value will be liable to disciplinary action  which in serious cases could result in immediate  dismissal on the grounds of serious misconduct or  be subject to criminal prosecution under relevant  laws. The annual Positive Assurance exercise, which is  monitored by the global Corporate Risk Management  Office, requires heads of businesses to confirm in writing  compliance, breaches and exceptions to policy that have  occurred within the year of reporting.  Below are statastics from 2010 illustrating our  vigilance within this area of business focus: Annually we run a volunteer week which enables employees to have one days paid leave to spend doing volunteer  work in communities. Since we started the programme in 2008, 52 charitable organisations, reaching thousands of  disadvantaged individuals, have been touched by this initiative.  As part of our charitable giving programme we distribute all of our good obsolete food, products through Foodbank  South Africa and our home and personal care products through Gift of the Givers. In 2010 we donated the equivalent  of R10 million worth of products and Foodbank SA and Gift of the Gives saw that it reached deserving beneficiaries  across the country. Our partnership with the Wildlands Conservation Trust also extends into the realm of community involvement  through a project aligned with environmental conservation. This project aims to educate and provide poor children  and parents with the tools to grow indigenous trees which are then bartered for goods such as bicycles, school  uniforms, school fees, food and clothes.  Currently this project spans over 8 communities. During 2010 there were  1,167 individuals growing trees. 195 267 trees were  bartered to the value of R1 070 661. Case Study: COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT  The Corporate Responsibility and Reputation Committee  oversees Unilevers conduct as a responsible multinational  business. It is also charged with ensuring that Unilevers  reputation is protected and enhanced. Inherent in this is  the need to identify any external developments which are  likely to have an influence upon Unilevers standing in  society and to bring these to the attention of the Board.  The Chief Legal Officer and external counsel report to the  Committee in this regard and matters are then considered  by the full Board. The Committee comprises four  independent Non-Executive Directors: Leon Brittan  (Chairman), Hixonia Nyasulu, Narayana Murthy and Louise  Fresco. To ensure that it is kept up to date with current and  emerging sustainability issues, the Committee benefits  from the insights of two groups. The first is the Unilever  Sustainable Development Group (USDG) – five experts  from outside the Group who advise on Unilevers  sustainability strategy. The second is CRISP, the Corporate  Responsibility, Issues, Sustainability and Partnerships  group of senior executives from across the business.  The Committees terms of reference and details of the  Unilever Sustainable Development Group are available on  our website at www.unilever.com DIMENSIONS OF REPUTATION RATINGS  FOR UNILEVER 2010 In 2002 Unilever launched THOKOMALA as a  meaningful and holistic response to the plight of  children left without parents because of the HIV/ Aids pandemic by setting up a community family  home housing six children, cared for by a foster  mother. This unique, independent and  professionally managed orphan care programme  was registered as a Section 21 company in 2005 in  order to leverage partnerships with community  organisations, government, donors and donor  organizations. THOKOMALA now operates 20  community family homes in six of South Africas  provinces. THOKOMALA which means warmth or  care in isiZulu gives orphans of HIV and AIDS and  other vulnerable children quality care: A better life,  free from the stigma and discrimination  surrounding HIV infection; and at the same time,  providing much needed support to counteract the  emotional and social scars caused by losing ones  parents.  THOKOMALA is a holistic model in that it not only  offers shelter, food and care but also the love and  nurturing of a normal family environment, essential  to raise children to become healthy and  emotionally balanced adults. In partnership with  Child Welfare South Africa, other NGOs and local  and international funders the programme aims to  provide HIV/Aids infected and affected children  with the best possible chance of leading a normal  family life.
